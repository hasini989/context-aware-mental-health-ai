alcoholism,Disturbthepeas,2018/01/01,"Might quit tomorrow but don't want to hurt myself going cold turkey. Usually drink 5-8 drinks per day from 11:00am I have been drinking heavily every day since age 21 besides a 5-year period of sobriety.  I am in my mid-30's now. 

I just had a breakup tonight with a bartender I was dating for the last year +2 months and I think I am ready to dry out and get myself out of a deep depression that has lasted 7 months. 

The first bout of sobriety for me happened at age 25 after I lost a family member to suicide and I didn't want to derail into depression. This time I realize I am at an all-time low physically and mentally and somethings gotta give. 

What is the typical advice here? Go cold turkey? Scale down to one drink per day for a couple days? I plan on spending a week with a parent starting tomorrow. I will then return home and my ex has 30 days to move out. They have a sizable liquor collection at home which I can ask them to relocate into their bedroom out of common areas, if need be. 

I had a friend who had seizures after a single day without alcohol when they were moving to a new apartment and their BAC dropped suddenly. 

Am I at risk?

alcoholism,doggosareamazing,2018/01/01,"Treating alcoholism with naltrexone using Sinclair Method cures 80% of all alcoholics https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/overcoming-addiction/201307/drink-your-way-sober-naltrexone

If you have not heard of this treatment option, please do your own research and consider it. 

I have used naltrexone according to Sinclair method for 38 weeks by now and my drinking has dropped down to 6 drinks a week. I used to drink 45 drinks a week. I am planning on quitting drinking altogether now. The change so far has been totally painless, there has been no need to white knuckle it through or experience the cravings.

alcoholism,crapscab,2018/01/02,"I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin. I've got a bit more than 9 months sober right now. My sobriety isn't at risk; this sub and the rooms of AA have helped me learn how to ask for help.

Although I'm not interested in drinking, I want to jump right the fuck out of my skin right now. So often, alcoholics suffer from anxiety and depression. I am in that category despite my firm denial for the last few years.

Work isn't particularly bad or good, but today it just feels like too much. I feel like I can't do anything right, that my mind is too foggy to figure out what to do next, and (most importantly) like I'm one misstep from losing my whole career. Objectively, none of this is true, but I can't shake the feeling or out think it. To make matters feel bigger, I'm in a relationship I believe is on its final leg. This woman is great (she celebrates me, we are comfortable together, every conflict we've had is spoken—not yelled—through) but it just doesn't click. She wants a different future (kids, dog, house) that I don't want. I feel like Paul Rudd in Knocked Up being critical of his wife who just wants to spend time with him. I've got this great woman, who I just don't see a future with and don't have the balls to end it. To add another layer to the hesitation, I'd hate to end the relationship because I'm going through a bought of anxiety that will eventually pass.

There they are, the things that make me want to crawl out of my skin, the details that haunt my thoughts today. Here's the benefit, I don't want to drink over it. As bad as those things are, I prayed for these kind of problems. These kind of problems beat the hell out of coming-to in the morning and scraping through existence. It doesn't make this phase of life any ""easier"", but it so much easier than the alternative. I woke up today, am doing my job, am being a dad, am being a son, and am talking with my God. 9 months ago, I wouldn't have dreamed that scenario.

thank you all who come here with wisdom and encouragement. I've been sober before and know better than to think sobriety will change everything. I fucking hate the way right now feels, but I know that no matter what, a drink or twelve would not offer anything in the way of a solution to these problems.",5.9717142857142855,5.420942303296705,6.420087912087912,81.44991208791211,66.62637362637363,9.829450549450547,29.848351648351645,9.281916038205594,2.209886153846153,1768,53,376,29,25,575,214,455,0.12,0.701,0.18,0.9782,2,0,4,0,0,0,61.0,1,1,1,4,16,33,5,2,24,0,38,12,4,4,2,73,77,22,0,12,14,3,10,5,0,4,3,0,1,3,32,21,4,1,14,5,2,5,15,15,1,1,7,12,37,18,60,63,9,49,2,3,2,2,24,24,3,5,23,236,69,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828943383656334,0.08233006671209124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05238840122795728,0.08078093591181937,0.1178675371205644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679122500397308,0.0,0.07202001994425777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286468265192227,0.046961577582189634,0.0,0.06555356313154974,0.08679531162945839,0.0,0.0681337458561177,0.08410541406828087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149586387179589,0.06636131359619829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06635261453538109,0.0,0.0,0.08048818959231893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2264033860137201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364653940817288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06490773786264653,0.0,0.0692366805487272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726686736559925,0.22014351202515992,0.0,0.08439123370837158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14244056033036667,0.0,0.0,0.04378240345064824,0.06461572004661068,0.12322846291618544,0.16986907285814448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521179177516685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032737362921712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08889137205976526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0764482103455753,0.0,0.0,0.16044619755076278,0.08467601002287335,0.06279615561120955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05441413405327871,0.18818408807463813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861856839808732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15427015252624765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07778629938225126,0.0,0.1229818042140362,0.0,0.1132634141331411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08193066105486041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052202862326644665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22114454548747955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16541970842713888,0.0,0.3289496497829896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06138921750520907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061920131085137366,0.0,0.07092613100934334,0.0,0.0,0.10236109078391248,0.09872552774896258,0.0,0.0611594727736911,0.04492140828184892,0.0,0.2190687118546648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31807256984305243,0.1222981691880458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08601004362246807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056084495319863606,0.0,0.0,0.05472550076219899,0.0,0.0,0.049609869962752816
alcoholism,birthdaybitch,2018/01/02,"Boyfriend has a Problematic Relationship with Alcohol My boyfriend decided to have a dry January to assess his relationship with alcohol and hopefully come up with a plan to drink more moderately. He can certainly have one to a few drinks then stop (doesn't always overdo it), but on occasions when binge drinking is normalized (birthday's, new years, parties in general), he cannot pace himself and winds up drinking far more than anyone else. Are there any words of wisdom or tools he can look to to help him with moderation?",11.665319148936169,9.587147127659575,10.772872340425534,59.68250000000002,56.446808510638284,15.35744680851064,45.84042553191489,13.816669648895859,6.398561702127662,426,21,70,14,4,137,71,94,0.036000000000000004,0.81,0.154,0.9136,0,0,6,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,4,0,9,6,0,0,1,16,12,6,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,7,6,1,1,4,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,4,3,16,12,3,11,0,0,1,0,9,5,0,2,5,45,5,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3650937152828528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14212987234409094,0.0,0.0,0.11615851174352745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943623027668512,0.17501782447375555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471400394743535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6693257733040515,0.0,0.0,0.1426921151557625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11449217029637415,0.0,0.0,0.16965557942791867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14343967035284524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16497199608912366,0.0,0.0,0.16736020543441496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11574712444897678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3667778877300532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14280708821723775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10999779584012294
alcoholism,CurseOfTheVain,2018/01/02,"Alcoholic- Wernicke? Hi All,

First time poster here. I am hoping someone can help me.

I have had concerns about my partners's drinking for quite some time. 

For some background, he is a 33 y/o male. At this point, I would call him more of a binge drinking than anything else. But absolutely has alcoholic tendencies.

He does not drink every day, but when he does, it is rare for him to NOT go overboard. I definitely feel that I am a good influence on him, and if I weren't around, he likely would be drinking nearly every day.

My concerns starts with how drunk he seems to get compared to everyone else in the room. I can have a quite a few drinks and be fine, but he has a few in a short amount of time and becomes a different person.

He is not mean, aggressive, abusive or anything. But he becomes very... odd.

It starts off with forgetfulness and trouble forming sentences (finding words, finishing thoughts, etc.) This, I also just chocked up to being drunk. But then, the eye fluttering and head bobbing begin. That's when I know it's time to tell him to go sleep it off.

Then begins his rambling, like he doesn't know what's going on.. like he is in a different world.

For example: the other night he was laying in bed after drinking and I came in the room to see he him. He began asking about ""the glasses."" He said: ""I have to disagree about the glasses. The glasses that are a good gift. They are a small gift. They are a soft gift. Do you know what I mean?""

Of course, I did not know what he meant and what he was saying had no relevance to anything we had spoken about earlier in the day. 

I am beginning to worry he has some neurological disorder that is contributing to this drunken behavior.

Does anyone have any experience with similar situations or behaviors?

I was looking into Wernicke Syndrome and wondering if that could potentially be the issue.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,samneedshelp,2018/01/02,"First time posting, I could use some advice...(trigger warning possibly) -long Hello all,

First time poster but I’ve been reading this sub for a while. Here’s a short backstory: 

I have a history of sexual/mental abuse in my childhood, I have been a self harmer for nearly 16 years (have about 11 months since the last time and now that I’ve found God I cannot do it anymore) I started drinking heavily in my early 20s, went to detox, sober for maybe 11 days, I’ve had on and off struggles since. in the past few years I drink every day and I drink vodka with some juice, probably 6-10 drinks a night. (I don’t drink from the time I go to bed until when I get home from work) I’m now in my 30s. I have struggled with major social anxiety and generalized anxiety as well as moderate panic disorder for as long as I can remember and I loved how drinking eliminated that for the most part. Ive been in therapy for anxiety and panic for nearly a year and it’s helped tremendously and I am now taking an anti anxiety medication and it is amazing but I am not supposed to drink on it. I would love to see the effects it might have if I’m sober. 

I come from a long line of alcoholics (father, grand mother, uncles) who really haven’t had any side effects (major ones: DTS, seizures, liver problems, etc)  but I’m scared that I might. I had blood work done recently and everything was fantastic. I want to quit. I think I’m ready to quit but I don’t want to quit, but I want to, if that makes sense. I don’t feel like any of us are ready because it’s so scary to let go of something that is so comforting and it’s ours. I’ve done a lot of research and I feel like all of the logic is there but the want and the need to drink surpasses that. I have an infinite number of reasons why I want and need to quit but every night it’s the same thing; come home from work and make a drink. 

I have a successful career, a wonderful boyfriend who supports me and accepts me with my addiction to alcohol but wants me to quit, and is willing to do whatever he can to help me quit. We’ve agreed to be open about it and he can ask questions to keep me aware because I’m so used to hiding it. 

My mother has my back as well but I live with her at the moment and she also drinks vodka every night so it makes it that much harder. My boyfriend, I feel, is hesitant to live with me because of my drinking but I feel like living with someone who doesn’t drink regularly will help me a lot in my recovery process. 

I’m currently trying to just taper myself down so I don’t feel like I’ll be at risk for the major withdrawal effects, so hopefully I can cut back to like a few beers a night and then hopefully nothing throughout the week. I’d really like to eventually not be interested in drinking except occasionally but that’s a long way out. I’ve also done research on naltrexone but it only decreases the urge and not the side effects so I’m not discounting it, I’d just like to get to a point where I’m not scared of seizures and all that. 

I feel like I’m at a point where I’m finally ready to quit (although I don’t want to because it’s scary and such a familiar thing) but I’m finally being honest with myself and my family and friends and asking for help because I know that I can’t do this alone. I’m also praying that God will give me the strength to overcome this and it’s in his will that I can be sober.

Any advice would really be appreciated. thank you in advance and God bless, I wish you all the best and may you have great determination and strength in your battle.  I’m here with you and for you. Feel free to ask questions about this or PM me, anything that might help, I’m not terribly good with advice but consider me an open ear. 

Thanks for listening,

alcoholism,justfordafunkofit,2018/01/03,"My SOs alcoholic brother is being pushed away by his family My SOs brother is an alcoholic and suffers from depression. He has been hospitalized in the past, has almost gone through rehab, has gotten DUIs, and most recently struck his mother and then threatened his brother-in-law with a pitchfork (there were three small children in the house at the time). He then stole her car and was arrested later that day. He hasn’t spoken to anyone in his family, except for one brother, for 6 months. The terms of his parole are therapy once a week and drug tests, however my understanding is that he currently lives in a house where alcohol is readily available. That being said he has just reached out to his family again.

As some one who grew up with an alcoholic parent who also suffers from depression, I offered to talk with my SOs mother regarding how to approach the disease, and to create a safe environment for the person in question to feel as if they have support in recovery. The thing I’m bumping up against now is that my mother’s addiction was in full swing when I was very young and I’ve blocked a lot of it out, I only have traces of memories and am now coming up short in my advice. 

I believe what can be the most helpful thing is to show the person love and acceptance. To give them a safe space, but to be committed to not enabling them. Undoubtedly a hard balance. Her (SOs mother) biggest issue is that, even though he assaulted her, she loves him, forgives him, and wants him around, she wants to take care of her son - however she is alone in that sentiment. She was a nurse for years and recognizes this as a disease, she’s read books, she’s been to AA, she’s doing work. No one else in the family has, they’re all angry (except for the aforementioned brother). They don’t want him around and can’t see how being kind to him is helpful. She doesn’t know how to get everyone to understand that he needs his family, that pushing him away makes this worse. I want to help, but I can’t find the right words.

I also know that my SO is a huge part of the problem, which is extremely difficult for me to deal with. When his brother hit their mother my SO essentially said that his brother was dead to him, that he hoped he stayed in jail. He has no interest in opening himself up to loving his brother again. Not to mention his brother has always felt a little bullied by my SO. I feel like reestablishing their relationship would be a huge step forward for the whole family.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice from those who know better than I. Where does one start to find the love for some one who has hurt you so badly? How can you help others find that love or understanding when they’ve already committed themselves to anger?

Sorry for the word vomit, and thank you in advance.",6.6081218637992825,6.629833288888893,6.740215053763442,77.76435483870969,65.18518518518519,10.152927120669057,32.41935483870968,9.857291076455118,2.9865716845878127,2216,81,419,43,31,711,253,540,0.119,0.7240000000000001,0.157,0.9767,4,1,5,0,0,0,59.0,0,3,6,4,27,27,2,0,30,0,47,13,0,5,4,76,86,36,1,9,9,15,4,1,0,1,8,2,0,3,26,23,4,3,15,3,0,10,9,10,1,6,13,8,60,17,78,65,10,68,0,5,2,5,91,37,0,11,23,302,86,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686509463739459,0.0,0.13780093722082168,0.0,0.3014102295199585,0.07060446562283397,0.0730259428538357,0.07780831042756871,0.1127718633666421,0.058669042565804574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04930145339916928,0.0,0.0,0.1255357168620314,0.0,0.0,0.13249084121960691,0.0,0.058871975720260365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07943937082845003,0.0,0.06235938095484062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188850975253501,0.0,0.0,0.060737163107808224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045472399240621214,0.0726915667503964,0.12145840259243584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06170280240936728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176792415413636,0.0,0.05890112781928612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04657045506300937,0.0,0.0,0.06737426338762181,0.0,0.0,0.3988170227815126,0.0,0.07130282392714724,0.05037156316087402,0.06769958905847114,0.0,0.19333153679202345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03683798345657825,0.06763854951799751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07767348858069797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06316211364563244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1890424835197873,0.0,0.0,0.07003123443948284,0.0,0.1627155784324356,0.07548122213228367,0.0,0.0,0.07359295953586187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07342415590177961,0.11624952144645975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034447080783338316,0.07066842840345815,0.06226063925056737,0.0,0.059209707197812225,0.0,0.0,0.05994413454342925,0.3181851181028765,0.0,0.047065229769602514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05627952113253806,0.0,0.0,0.052281446502942135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07508966379161082,0.23889323402494514,0.05362518602826681,0.0,0.0,0.07829177515973343,0.07635425388287947,0.06730871115525383,0.0,0.12313128143593008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746748269333352,0.0,0.0,0.07898609047004303,0.0,0.07052796798583998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961901993304365,0.07570015772382778,0.0,0.06021420448274675,0.13414019635120314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05618645434541555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892892666186525,0.04990655332373814,0.07515309233406252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08001264971675072,0.0,0.0,0.05301390829495353,0.056672372766145875,0.0,0.06491511023927425,0.08063305751465813,0.0,0.09368594335950314,0.0,0.06927462375901336,0.0,0.0411142991901747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22020671486252352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05817721629369525,0.16635187415909428,0.0,0.056557976345161576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872065463012197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051331309696329,0.0,0.07185457988065487,0.05008749052460863,0.0,0.0,0.045405411683374086

alcoholism,kolty910,2018/01/03,"1 year sober today I can’t believe I made it this far. As of today, January 3, 2018, I have been sober for 1 year. 

I still struggle every day. I think about drinking multiple times a day and still physically crave it, but I’m very thankful that it’s not as all consuming as it was. 

I also struggle with the same and guilt associated with being an alcoholic. My family and the few friends I’ve shared my sobriety with have been amazingly supportive, but I still feel ashamed. 

But today... today I am celebrating. One freaking year sober. Last year on this day I was just hoping to make it through the next minute, the next hour. And now here I am. Thank God.

I’m a senior in college so drinking is apart of the culture, I used to think I was just a normal college kid with a little drinking problem. But now I’m ready to be honest to myself, I am an alcoholic. I do not drink everyday but when ever I do drink I can not stop. It’s either all or nothing for me, so I’m choosing to stay sober. The longest I’ve been sober during college was one month(best month ever). It’s really hard to stay sober in college but I’m ready. I’ve had too many bad nights, from waking up in the hospital all alone, bad hangovers, getting in trouble at school, black outs, and being kicked out bars...My last drink was on New Years and I really want to stay sober when I go back to school (I’m on winter break now). I’m just nervous, I attend a party school and I don’t want to fall back into bad habits. I still want to go to parties because that’s just something my friends and I do. But I have bad social anxiety, so not drinking when I’m at parties are really uncomfortable.",1.2131545873481355,3.3099713732718925,3.265113112693758,89.22156577293677,81.81105990783409,5.7887725178047775,23.22769166317553,6.980632752743323,0.8525410138248843,816,29,169,10,22,276,113,217,0.163,0.701,0.136,-0.8829,0,1,9,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,0,17,9,0,1,9,0,16,9,1,1,4,34,33,15,0,5,12,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,4,8,8,1,3,6,0,4,4,7,0,1,5,2,16,2,27,26,3,43,0,0,1,0,5,14,0,1,21,105,20,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20892157558055155,0.0,0.1012354163531694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477545126721896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15032133891539984,0.3264554343654703,0.059585077311606574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102578436072861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5745234276096062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17683377425944613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10707600646793948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07551834622657506,0.0,0.05106827035841526,0.0,0.1111026515209836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756125046492218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07967606668274826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796720854077208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09909914033996843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560399094172113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09440373226612772,0.0,0.09172803484571296,0.09577036345792432,0.09378995935997034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06623524480574415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09352975714987452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18785584396598068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2967726255714043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963977594557634,0.0,0.07524967522998999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125528118642037,0.07806011193896893,0.0817200642615866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06263171412050351,0.0,0.0,0.05699650061235038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08442119292664922,0.0,0.0,0.17295943657310875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294524352330218
alcoholism,formerlyachimp,2018/01/04,"Minor/functional alcoholic - withdrawal? I consider myself somewhat dependant on alcohol, but at the very low end On an average evening, I will drink between 3-6 cans of beer (440ml/15oz per can). When going out or if I'm feeling particularly merry on a weekend, this might go up to 8/9 cans.

It is extremely rare for me to go even one day without a drink, which is why I consider it to be a problem.

I've not had a drink since December 31 (so tonight is my fourth night) as part of a dry January project. This has been largely tolerable, but I have noticed somewhat disrupted sleep and found myself sweating in my sleep last night.

My basic question is, should I be suffering withdrawal symptoms at this level?",6.698880597014928,7.093061835820897,7.585783582089558,70.50986940298509,64.97014925373135,11.476119402985075,40.630597014925364,11.20814326018867,4.9418686567164185,562,32,98,16,8,189,98,134,0.084,0.847,0.069,-0.6136,0,0,6,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,7,0,16,10,3,1,0,17,22,8,0,3,6,0,1,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,6,2,6,0,3,5,0,3,2,3,0,1,3,1,11,0,17,14,3,21,0,2,0,0,1,10,0,7,8,71,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34172638037368913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031094294586695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4698648543391328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14160630201144198,0.0,0.0,0.21119857897834124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084017576262467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17530026295645387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725906133582648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13032360968104265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16960750649077716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3000732618401246,0.0,0.0,0.1820245385391487,0.0,0.0,0.10833888456822056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17313455384102908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15298365082324264,0.0,0.0,0.17910228753141394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322544599847212,0.0,0.3199911006422593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661766272129341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13191781563568492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426691061141414,0.0,0.0,0.1541186983742459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,sortitoutlad,2018/01/04,"Hair cut and a tan to make my gorgeous girlfriend happy and take her for a meal, or 6 litre of strong cider... Why is this such a fucking dilemma? Why is my brain doing this to me? If anyone else in the world asked me the same question I would say they were a fucking idiot for even asking.... I've got a small amount of cash on me right now that could get me my hair cut and a session on the sunbeds (which completely gets rid of the psoriasis on my face) and a meal already paid for that we could go to, it would be lovely, I would feel so happy and gratified afterwards the whole night would just be great... so why am I about to choose instead to buy 6 litres of cider and lay on my own in my bedroom getting smashed on my own probably causing fights through internet conversations and talking to girls that don't come close to my girlfriend? Please don't take this in a douche way but my girlfriend is by most people's standards a 10/10 but what is it stopping me from putting her before drinking? I get bad anxiety and I love what being drunk does to me and at the same time I absolutely HATE it - where do I go from here?

alcoholism,rob_dawg45,2018/01/04,"Hey guys I'm currently having a debate with somebody. Hey guys and gals, just need a quick second to pick your brains.

So the debate I'm currently having stemmed from a friend indirectly (or directly) calling me an alcoholic.

Now I strongly disagree on definition alone. 

But I figured what better place to put this to the test than to ask the beautiful souls of a community hub like you guys.

So the question generally is; is having 2 beers a day after work alcoholism?

Thank you so much in advance and I wish each and everyone of you peeps the best in the new year!

Edit: thankyou guys so much for the help it is much appreciated.

Unfortunately it seems impossible to sway my friend from her opinion towards something more logical.

alcoholism,Isaacizme,2018/01/04,"(Maybe) Alcoholism doesn't always affect the people around you, (Maybe) it's the people who affect you negatively. Hear me out folks. I've been drinking everyday for a few years. I'm 23 almost 24. I never really had a problem sippin drinks then passin out to some television( drunk or not too drunk but preferably drunk enough). Well I've always preferred to drink alone but there's been a lot of times I'd hang with friends or family and drink too. Nothing was ever a problem. I'd never start shit, no one started shit with me. Last year my gf and I moved in together. I quit drinking on week days. Soon I couldn't stand the boringness of sobriety anymore. I can't stand how late it makes me stay up. I can't stand not feeling ""good""! I started drinking again. However I moved on from slamming 2 cheap 40s to just a six pack, which is 8oz less beer( I know I accomplished a lot). Well this continues for the past year. My gf eventually just starts whit with me at any given random moment. I mean it could be a week or every day for 4 days, just randomness. Eventually I just get tired of being harassed. I mean this shit never happened for about a year. September 2016 to 17. So I started to be a dick and an asshole every time she's start shit about me drinking. I tried quitting during the week back early December 2017 but I just started getting antsy and I wanted just one fucking tall boy. Oh boy!! That was a nightmare 3 hour argument and I didn't even drink it until she called her cookies. So ever since then it's been on and off drinking. No booze nights equals a happy fucking family while any kind of booze night causes a Fucking war. I lierally won't do anything I just sit there and drink my six pack. Sometimes nothing will happen and other times shit will start. Btw she does smoke weed everyday allday oops forgot to mention that... for her health problems which I won't go into detail it's it's also to get baked as well. I've never started a fight with her over weed. Well new yeas I told her I was gonna quit for good and that was my last night! Yippe. I got a 12 pack and killed 10 of them then she hid one from me and that enraged the shit out of me. I was like I told you this is my last night and you can't even let me enjoy it. Mind you piss water beer like icehouse doesn't get me really drunk due to my tolarance anyway. I usually get a 6 pack of IPAS 7-8% abv. So why is it people around me making act negatively? I can't have the six pack a day or else I'll get into an argument. If I try to leave I'll get called a pussy and less of a man for not standing up. If I say I'm quitting and just want one beer or whatever it's like no you can't just have one! Which I actually can just have one. Sorry for venting. I just want one damn beer but I'm not allowed to have it. I find it utterly controlling. I am sober as we speak btw.",1.3290099633531829,3.399226760135136,2.973558176820891,91.61512024736601,81.22972972972974,5.973018781493358,21.182546953733393,7.134242097396668,0.5286137425561157,2230,66,483,29,59,735,264,592,0.107,0.757,0.136,0.9458,2,1,16,0,1,0,66.0,1,6,1,6,36,33,16,0,27,1,37,36,8,8,6,89,78,37,2,12,26,0,1,3,3,5,3,3,1,3,24,26,23,2,7,18,1,5,24,20,4,10,15,4,66,13,53,52,8,83,0,0,0,4,32,17,12,13,58,299,90,1,0.0,0.0,0.04799512381366937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052561242989820636,0.04924927040039268,0.05093834184744617,0.0,0.03933130817934916,0.08184772778794329,0.0,0.0,0.06689171032546919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048775924344619866,0.0,0.0,0.04047308992057522,0.08756588425542651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037818384239789456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044186894915402,0.0,0.0,0.050524079106546285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05516246900313655,0.0392683048027805,0.0,0.0,0.12687483525017715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043040025492922296,0.0,0.0,0.4818022488106654,0.0,0.0,0.04108575208764079,0.0,0.0,0.0508187740790123,0.0,0.06496928809912926,0.08897695656209735,0.08287692499141637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09272995799902163,0.0,0.02486820079241548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04495200621471988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03799835546112856,0.1364055660730638,0.17987115327306333,0.0,0.027951605511208868,0.08250406438291735,0.03933581886463167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698402311514182,0.05235579321651629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052278804886298214,0.05543236570926298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048434954816834866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054413260899468296,0.051216110426276835,0.02702947122455747,0.12027115217031513,0.05548011607092476,0.05207727295779824,0.0,0.050292541654666886,0.0,0.07208440348796326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08362657701617397,0.0,0.0,0.06565953603450632,0.0,0.09882106641195362,0.10714854153121953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049660406536619364,0.0,0.0,0.10454664251630016,0.0,0.0,0.1517306153349601,0.047500862436036684,0.0,0.18461815693689687,0.0,0.09438406407238888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23329182263110784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04695035769685027,0.10229106841414744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14118332044948742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20924700029947105,0.0,0.0,0.06301526707212843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03911197828948877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30291139837310305,0.0406843557125604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048642849896836295,0.0550558950810304,0.3133052825964248,0.052422108617856567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08603631032162543,0.05652816469433376,0.0,0.09399216568905397,0.0,0.06678351517572267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05416768643795671,0.0,0.08702751688368862,0.0,0.11835394740616992,0.0,0.1768842592476578,0.0,0.04437964745797604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266879298871114
alcoholism,gnarlycharley22,2018/01/05,"holy shit does the nightmare ever stop.. just came out of a horrifying bender a few days ago. jan. 3rd i couldnt even keep down any water yet i was trying to hold down listerine cuz i was too weak to go out for booze. racing thoughts, unbearable guilt and dread. didnt eat. yesterday i went back to work, with determination to stop altogether. but by the end of my work night i was so out of my mind i had two beers. it sort of helped but i ended up laying in bed ALL NIGHT, racing thoughts, resentments i cant get outta my mind, by 7 am i didnt have sleep but a bout of a terrifying sleep paralysis. electrocution, choking, demons. maybe got an bour of sleep after that. im back at work and only on day 2 of my work week. this is a nightmare. should i just stop and start my abstinence now. or have a beer a night til i feel semi normal again. dont know. a six pack will make me feel so much better tonight but after those DTs Im deathly afraid of tailspinning into another bender or stoking the flames of this addiction. i feel like worst may be over. I dont know though

alcoholism,Ab_Royston,2018/01/05,"I went to my first ever AA and it was really good Hi, I have been getting myself back on the straight and narrow but never been able to go to an AA meeting. I went tonight and it was helpful to connect with friendly others, get in touch with true honesty and understand what alcoholism actually is. 

I would encourage anyone at all who would like to get a healthy relationship with alcohol or substance abuse to go to just one. 

Hope y’all good tonight :) ",5.309655172413791,6.489111862068968,5.798333333333336,79.31750000000002,68.3103448275862,9.018390804597699,34.04022988505747,9.2995712137729,3.1223885057471263,360,17,67,7,6,116,62,87,0.049,0.586,0.365,0.9892,0,0,2,0,1,0,7.0,0,1,0,1,3,7,0,0,3,0,8,2,0,0,4,18,17,6,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,2,2,0,0,0,5,7,2,0,1,0,0,4,1,0,2,2,6,1,7,7,13,9,1,15,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,2,7,49,12,0,0.18719483119815333,0.22179526464448945,0.18267515207036025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4001086899347898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13089097847036749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439412703440358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693284419250706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15922782778862538,0.0,0.0,0.14462626222683714,0.0,0.2934047193579073,0.0,0.21277427295297674,0.3140202860208012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547274945443196,0.0,0.0,0.1859267053458927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145393894726267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443761940153025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12684806226017845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11992180226313863,0.0,0.0,0.20097719299690908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.194876421057576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3470629678908987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2659556744021567,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,BornOn8thOfJuly,2018/01/05,"A question about AA — is it necessary/advisable to go to a newcomer meeting for my first meeting? It might mean delaying going to a meeting. Which is fine. I’ve been sober for a couple days, and had been sober for a couple of months before December.

Which isn’t to say I don’t need help, but just that I don’t need immediate attention and help and can hold off of it’s advisable! I don’t think I’m in immediate risk of relapse. 

What I really want right now is emotional support and a feeling of safety from learning how alcoholism... I feel like attending might give me some comfort as I deal with other things without partying as a way of coping.",4.557907986111111,5.684180710937504,6.089479166666668,76.73538194444446,70.015625,10.06388888888889,32.19097222222222,10.25414643259724,3.4718618055555552,513,23,97,14,9,175,81,128,0.043,0.7490000000000001,0.208,0.9581,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,1,4,5,0,1,7,0,13,1,0,1,0,24,25,8,0,3,3,0,2,1,0,2,1,1,0,0,9,5,1,2,7,0,0,3,5,1,1,1,3,3,8,4,20,20,1,12,0,0,0,0,10,3,0,4,6,67,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19008144376330807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15134830349948142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936040288712446,0.0,0.11470691373421335,0.18336893182873584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20007192303832186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17986574295184135,0.12706535495471075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15129016767064035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17062238619987685,0.20216727112416225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384356248112218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08689487226968423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19374493745640092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3773690479688094,0.0,0.0,0.14196854099103587,0.0,0.0,0.263766305453952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1992472536539557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113943585262247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15189402086808287,0.0,0.14144378783327086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20183681226360933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816426670364663,0.11396742162521124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10490819924477368,0.14117936191019145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145357444083362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,dudewhodoesnothing,2018/01/05,"Repeatedly told my friends they wanted me to die even though it wasn't true.... Went to a new years party and got way too drunk. My friends were trying to cheer me up but I kept thinking this other person was mad at me even though they weren't, and I kept allowing myself to get super negative over it. I started talking all suicidal which didn't help, and now my friends aren't really talking to me. This has happened a lot in the past where I get too drunk, lose control of my alcohol and just have a rage.... I feel more dumb than I usually do most days. It sucks. People are starting to really get sick of me and my drunk rants about bullshit, where it affects those relationships for good. I want to exercise but I just don't have any motivation.

alcoholism,Exodus5000,2018/01/05,"I'm an adult and need help in addressing my parent's alcoholism Hi everyone, I'm in my 30s.  My family recently received a scare when my mother was notified she was not producing enough blood oxygen.  Her oncologist suspected cancer but after weeks of testing we were later told it was just 'severe anemia'.  


My parents drink way too much.  Mom didn't tell me, but I suspect she has stomach lining wear from her drinking causing the anemia.  My sister and I discussed confronting our parents about their drinking which has been going on since our childhood, but she is pussing out now and I'm left wondering if, and how, I should raise the subject to my parents.  

They drink every day, usually 6-15 drinks.  I'm worried about their health and I don't even know if they want to live.  You guys... how do I help this problem?",4.222377171215881,6.299252825806455,4.894838709677419,81.20533498759308,72.35483870967742,7.607940446650125,29.342431761786603,8.384062270229773,2.346022332506203,648,27,114,11,13,208,109,155,0.135,0.8220000000000001,0.043,-0.9258,4,0,6,0,0,0,19.0,3,1,4,1,9,3,1,1,4,0,12,12,3,4,0,26,22,13,0,6,7,7,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,2,3,7,6,0,4,5,0,2,3,3,0,0,7,0,26,0,11,14,2,17,0,0,0,0,29,5,0,3,9,76,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12694355142011998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202348478056713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766055997554096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5818135670618665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12273521883141016,0.0,0.07845545211076589,0.0,0.10008031194417147,0.11350282679338113,0.0,0.0,0.11197861315526833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0675074611948244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117614446005339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12626141960819834,0.0,0.0,0.15923629576541787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06528036391600893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12905873649937108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488810114695307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911792482785298,0.0,0.0,0.08731961851985925,0.08807653944638287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5275805536708359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11365986976762668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172844816947857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11892311251740145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13419166543574454,0.0,0.09825902713891443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038221080673146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11350282679338113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308233614257827,0.0,0.0700616489519311,0.09428489826930496,0.09528104457270294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12881575475991036,0.0,0.1206305187437898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,jpaul631,2018/01/06,"Question-4 days sober couldn't get off hooking up with dream girl Back story- I've been in IOP for alcoholism for around 6 months. Was able to make 3 months sober and relapsed with a week or so long binge. I'm currently sober, at first when I quit this time I exhibited more withdrawal symptoms then I did the first time I detoxed. Most of those symptoms have passed. (Mostly shakes, slight confusion, and general cramps and pains.) This is day 4.

The issue- there is a girl who I've been extremely attracted to for several years. About 6 months ago me and her hooked up which was great. She goes to school out of town and was in town last night. We arnt a couple but remain friends. While hanging out last night we hooked up. Once again it was great, she got off we had what I would believe is mutual fun. 

The question- I couldn't get off. Emotionally and general fun it was great I had a good time, I was able to get the Johnson to work but during everything oral, and intercourse I didn't really feel any sexual pleasure at all. I was not able to get off. Just nothing, is this normal for someone just getting sober? Is there any explanation in terms of recovery to this? 

I should also say I'm generally quick and most times don't last more then a few minutes of actually going at it. We probably went for 20 minutes not counting foreplay and nothing!

alcoholism,dumbus_albacore,2018/01/06,"enough is enough I dusted off my journal a couple days ago to write down my latest system I had concocted for moderating my drinking.  I was pretty certain it was going to work.  Before writing it I flipped back to my last entry.  It was a plan that was almost word for word identical to the one was about to write down, written one year earlier.  What the fuck?   Underlined was “if this doesn’t work you’re done.”   Now I’ve spent some time thinking back about how many plans like this I’ve made.  I’ve got a scar on the bridge of my nose from 6 years ago when I was hospitalized for jumping off the top of a car and landing on my face.  It was my first night drinking after a 3 month break (the only break I have taken since I was 19).  My most recent Thanksgiving featured me blacking out, almost got there on Christmas, and made it there again on New Years.  All required multiple days of recovery before I could function remotely normally.  Worst of all I have developed an anxiety disorder starting about 7 years ago that is obviously related to my drinking.  I get fearful of celebrations coming up because I know I’m going to be hung over for a few days.  My first few drinks make me feel anxious because I’m already wondering if things will get out of hand.  I feel pretty good around a .08 but then I think I’ll have one more to feel a little better.  OK one more seriously last one.  Ok a .15 never killed anyone, this is fun.  and now at this point my inhibitions cease to exist and I drink a beer every 20 minutes until I’m stumbling and barely forming memories.  Most days of normal life are very anxious for me.  Even when I’ve had several days off drinking.  I suspect that my nerve endings are a bit fucked up from a decade of having to withstand near lethal doses of a depressant.  If that’s really the case I hope they are able to return to a somewhat healthy state.  Even as I write this I am having surges of thoughts saying “hmmm let’s not jump to conclusions.  Maybe you should give this new moderation plan a fair shot first.”   Anyway.  Enough is enough for me.  Moderation is too stressful.  I’ve cut my drinking down somewhat but my life is flying by, I’m 32 right now, and I don’t want to wake up at 36 in a horrible anxious depression thinking “god damn I wish I had quit drinking 4 years ago.”  My biggest influences for finally making decide to stop are, oddly to me, some interviews I’ve been reading with Colin Farrell. Damn he has good words to say about sobering up.   

OK time to stop my rambling.  This is written by the way, without the influence of alcohol.  In case anyone notices the 3am post time and thinks I’m just spouting drunk nonsense ;). Nope just seething in anxiety from thinking all night about whether I should stop drinking or not.  Work is gonna be fucked tomorrow but hopefully life will get better from here.

alcoholism,Magick8Ball,2018/01/06,"Question about alcoholism Hey guys, I'm looking for advice and I figured this might be the best place to ask... I don't know anyone else with quite the same ""condition"" that I do, and I figured maybe someone might have some insights...

I'm 34 years old, American, so I've been a social drinker for about 15 years. To this day, I don't feel any strong cravings about alcohol, but I really love drinking with friends.

I've had a strange life, and like many other people, I have my own fair share of minor issues; I tend to block off my feelings from other people. But as many of you have probably experienced, when I drink, my ""walls come down"" and I have a much, much easier time expressing myself.

A few years ago I went through a tough breakup and I spent about 48 hours alone and with a lot of alcohol. When I got over the worst of the hangover a few days later, I found an open text file on my computer where I wrote a long letter to myself. It was a bit hard to read at times, but I felt like I was able to express a lot of things that I usually couldn't even admit to myself.

So, for the past couple years, I do this about once a month.... get really drunk and sit down with my laptop or a notebook and write out all my emotions and thoughts without any kind of filter, and then go through them the next day. They're often brutally honest.

This issue is.... I'm nervous about where this leads. I wish I could do this without alcohol, but every time I try, I feel like I'm just writing down things that I want to hear, or that it's all fake. I came to realize that this is part of the reason I love social drinking, is because it creates conversations without filters, and I've become super close with some people that I've had some really, really important conversations with.
And, to be honest, I've also ended friendships when, after drinking with them over multiple occasions, and with brutal honesty, they revealed that they had little respect or loyalty to the friendship.
I've come to love all of the forms of honesty that alcohol brings when myself (or others) are too inebriated to filter words and thoughts.

Does anyone else struggle with this? How can I be more open and honest without alcohol?

alcoholism,justcupcake,2018/01/06,"Helping Mom My mother in law has been admitted to a rehab center for treatment for alcoholism.  She had an accident at home that injured her and our neighbors called an ambulance, doctors recommended rehab, and it was the wakeup call to father in law to get her professional help. My significant other was trying to get her to see help, either rehab or psychological, for a while before we had to move out of state).  I'm incredibly happy she's gotten help and has started her journey, and I want to be supportive in the best way possible.  Problem is I don't know how. I was raised in one of those churches where alcohol was a sin, so we didn't have drinking or drugs around at all when I was growing up, and I've managed to avoid any extreme behaviors on my own after getting away from it, so I don't know how to react.  I'm so happy she's getting help and so afraid that I might screw it up that I'm even petrified to leave a message for her with the rehab because I don't know what to say.  How can I be supportive from a distance, and what would be encouraging?

alcoholism,JayN1988,2018/01/06,Any good suggestions on ways to stop cravings? I'm positive this question has been asked before on this sub just don't want to go searching.  29m been drinking heavily for most of my 20's.  The last 3 years have been pretty soaked by alcohol and depression.  Decided to quit on the 1st after at least 2 40's of malt liquor a night.  Before that I couldn't tell you the last day I didn't have a drink in my hand.  Got 5 days in and buckled.  Sitting here drinking hating how much self control I don't have.  Looking for ways to fight the cravings.  I've been an avid reader and gamer most of my life but when work problems creep in it's not enough.  Suggestions are greatly appreciated.,2.3698147108366108,4.524780299270073,3.4207299270073013,89.30780460415498,78.12408759124088,6.55115103874228,25.13700168444694,7.61054688173877,1.2609723750701851,539,20,111,8,13,173,96,137,0.093,0.7959999999999999,0.111,0.5233,0,0,4,0,1,0,11.0,0,1,0,3,4,6,2,0,7,0,13,7,1,2,0,16,20,6,0,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,4,3,5,2,2,4,0,1,5,4,0,0,6,2,7,2,18,13,5,20,0,1,1,0,8,7,0,3,9,63,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720506749304559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10947956378218056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505050771214139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27398337524298355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18056536495261416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20765206257309124,0.0,0.13866151905517776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.473130375400028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16634698652628382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09149503170091884,0.13503181388172072,0.1287594014074729,0.17749341037982125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15894551931868192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624586955268387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371287384427654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13519209486741998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11834708524335945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15107937283542505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16378596841168555,0.0,0.1540468742780775,0.0,0.0,0.18034703330583654,0.1712340004766892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16794897413934495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13459588529807198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407134396812933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495680445418736,0.25557470547357336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720354007073082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367308021445143
alcoholism,TheSaintMan,2018/01/07,"Alcohol Is Destroying Me &amp; I Don't Know How To Stop I'm a young man. I am between 18-24. I don't want to tell my exact age. 

After months of not drinking ever since the holidays I am drinking every day. It all started when someone on the 22th of December brought me a drink to toast. They don't know I have a problem with drinking. Nobody knows. I decided to drink that shot of vodka. I thought you know it won't be so bad, because there are lots of food I eat I won't feel anything. Sadly it wasn't that easy I started having another ones until I made a decent buzz. I was only a little bit tipsy. I'm having a low point in my life. I'm battling loneliness in terms of having no girlfriend. I miss my ex-girlfriend. I'm battling anxiety and OCD. Ever since that day I am drinking. Last few days I had headaches. Today I didn't drink and I was feeling really low. Friend noticed I was silent and in a bad mood. I told him I had a hard time sleeping. 

Alcohol is destroying my life, my opportunities my health and my look, but I don't know how to give it up ever since it helps me with my problems.",0.8156168831168848,2.8882777532467543,3.18193181818182,89.39289772727275,83.15584415584415,5.927922077922077,23.910714285714285,7.1686216300943375,1.0159883116883126,855,33,182,12,24,294,125,231,0.151,0.7829999999999999,0.066,-0.8961,0,1,10,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,1,1,8,15,4,0,10,0,24,15,1,3,5,30,45,10,0,3,2,0,3,0,2,2,5,0,0,1,8,6,11,1,9,9,0,1,10,12,0,1,11,4,35,2,20,31,5,29,0,4,1,0,10,9,0,1,19,116,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19959269048852585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10117873601138068,0.0,0.0,0.09791856719371084,0.0714365352618335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684495695046739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15593918026068662,0.05692445052906956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10194833156909328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18066988347128413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6403477273122771,0.0,0.0955525114538037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534065379002129,0.07867787887767468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09443290952476834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291719093586933,0.0,0.07214625805267602,0.0,0.0,0.08957997278685302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08365141567724417,0.0,0.0,0.09926008908124337,0.0,0.0,0.06259160142381412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.256599947856847,0.07611832560884299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13191612554228846,0.0,0.09359272099096412,0.0,0.0,0.07841687909180027,0.0,0.0,0.07938954899828292,0.0,0.08835976311008624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07453616328907843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10631537238135423,0.0,0.0,0.06327767095958703,0.07102078236943675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827563107480707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17870682640993524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0598225326369039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2317382415890009,0.0,0.09344886490725643,0.0,0.0791217791802164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13219170784957568,0.0,0.0,0.07807105344453306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816194822404403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413442140432516,0.05445146042977152,0.0,0.08851467300484739,0.08922995427617078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507878445947655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,threefoursix346,2018/01/07,"I think I’m officially done drinking Hello. I just wanted to post an overview of my relationship with alcohol and why I decided to quit drinking. 

I’m a 25 year old male who first started drinking when I was 15. I remember the first time I got drunk, (Captain Morgan) I thought it was the best thing ever. I drank quite a bit throughout high school, pretty much always binging with friends on the weekends and what not. I used to have a lot of fun with drinking when I was younger, and for the most part, it provided euphoria and good times. 

I’ve also had bad experiences with alcohol. Typically making terrible decisions, getting injured, drinking way too much, driving, getting in fights/arguments, etc. I just don’t like the way I act when I’m under the influence and hate not being in control. I just wish I figured that out a lot earlier in life.

One of the main reasons why I decided to quit drinking was the nasty hangovers and feelings of guilt and emptiness the following days after drinking. I got hungover when I was a teenager, but since my early 20s my hangovers have gotten much worse. I seriously can’t even produce a fucking thought the morning after drinks. I’ve thought I was going to die from a hangover before, I think actually i was in more of a withdrawal and drinking for 48 hours straight. Severe anxiety, twitches, abnormal heartbeat. This shit is what made me get sober for good. Not to mention I came not to even enjoy drinking at all. As soon as I had my first sip my head began to cloud up. 

Now I go to bed sober and wake up with a clear head and never have to worry about what I might of done or said the night before. Alcohol is just one of the shittiest things you could put in your body.

alcoholism,Kliquid2018,2018/01/08,"16years of DRUNK i'm 30 now FIRST TIME Please excuse the grammar, I'm on my phone.

I'm a 30/M/UK and I've realised I'm addicted to alcohol

I always said I'd stop drinking at 30. 
I knew it was bad at 20-25 

I always used the phrase 'stop at 30' as kind of get out / it will never come. Well it's now come, and its come as a big fucking shock! I drink every day, and if I can't get a drink, I get either make my excuses and go to the shops, or swig from my SO's booze or just have to get out and grab a can. 

Background: Started drinking at 14, properly started at 16, my dad's way of thinking was this: 'you do a day's work, you have a drink' I worked with him for a fair few years, he drank very strong Beers, I followed with the same and Cider, I liked cider.  At 18/19 I started working in a pub, that didn't help, i was drunk most nights. After that I had gone from dad to pubs then to working in security. Age 21 now and I was king of the world, the girls loved me, I could get into any club or bar I wanted and the drink followed, so did the drugs, but tje drugs came and went, didn't care for them, I just couldn't stop drinking. On nights out I would drink myself into oblivion! Every single night, but I'd always get home  and get up for work. But feel like shit. I never shook the craving .

NOW: I found K-cider @ the age of 22 ish had have been drinking that ever since. 

I'm getting married in August this month and my SO knows about my past drinking, and has asked me to stop. Which I didn't, I just lied and carried on, and have done till this day, I drink every day. I drink K every day, morning noon and night, it's actually liquid crack to me, I fucking hate it, but I can't stop drinking it,I drink one before work, 2 or 3 on my lunch break, and maybe one or two after work on the way home. When I'm out I will drink and not stop, I just cant. I have said to myself I'm stopping now, but every day I keep getting a can. I NEED to stop, If my SO ever found out she would leave, but that isn't enough for me to stop and I just don't know why.theres more to the story, but it's long enough now.  Long rant over.

alcoholism,mercury_girl,2018/01/08,"How to approach my boyfriend about his alcoholism? He started his master’s program last fall and obviously has been extremely stressed out due to the intensity of the program. At first, it was just a shot of whiskey every now and then after dinner, and then it was a shot of whiskey nearly every night. I don’t think I’ve seen him last 24 hours without a drink in the past two months. It didn’t really become apparent to me until we went to visit my family for Christmas break and he went out of his way to get a drink everyday we were there. If he couldn’t have a drink, he would be irritable and moody. My parents even approached me about it. How can I tell him that I’m concerned without seeming controlling or nagging? I don’t want him to spiral out of control.",5.040986842105261,5.81075165131579,5.70905263157895,81.20436842105265,68.67105263157895,8.71157894736842,31.647368421052622,8.841846274778883,2.5126242105263157,609,25,119,10,10,198,96,152,0.078,0.913,0.009000000000000001,-0.8765,2,0,6,0,0,0,12.0,2,0,0,4,8,3,1,1,8,0,13,7,0,4,1,25,22,12,0,4,5,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,10,7,2,2,5,0,6,6,3,0,2,8,1,16,0,24,11,0,29,0,0,1,0,15,6,0,3,15,83,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16431939760015302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16981244901160514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34490294221116324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4518697662970035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015550020861116,0.0,0.25909368985394826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449483494981053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13078556603043087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08033164979211183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15141960398147908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25066483907328097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272731452349556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14429046293576306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17072887475363066,0.0,0.14677838755358685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098500626468349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399745342790858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088299463693357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17612804371574078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343903338479877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09852123225040596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15019817876145825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09068982096265844,0.12204509416260392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850684288934009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2964323871991665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922451150268037,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,bgusterson92,2018/01/08,"I have a problem Hey guys,

	As I write this I am completely lit, I have to write this out now while im still thinking about it. I have been to many support groups for sexual addiction in the past and I gave up on recovery about 6 months ago, I knew then that I had aquired a taste for alcohol and its numbing qualities. I have been drinking between 40 and 60 drinks a week for years now. I came to the realization a couple of months ago that I may have a problem. I know that I will get some smart ass replies but I hope that I will at least get a little serious advice. I feel like I am dead inside. I feel like I can barely hold myself together without at least 6 drinks in me. I feel like when I am sober I am just counting the time until I can get some nicotine and alcohol in me. I feel like I have nothing left to live for most days. I dont want to kill myself most days. So when I feel like I cant deal with that back and forth which is pretty much every day, I drink. I dont know how to live any more. I dont know where the problems began, I dont know where to go from here. But I know that I am lonely and am tired of being here. My question is, is AA right for me? Please dont me a smart ass in your reply. Chances Ill be drunk when I read them. I need an honest answer. I have taken many tests and they all say that I am at serious risk of alcoholism, that I need treatment, But they arent shrinks. I need to hear it from people in the program. Do I need a meeting. Do I need treatment? I dont know how to really deal with my life without alcohol. I dont know that I can handle my lackluster existance without it.",1.9430775761434769,3.0203901060171963,3.6516841770136885,91.90429693303619,76.30659025787966,7.00418125862252,23.52764512363366,7.526774132740827,0.7843236973363039,1253,37,295,16,27,420,163,349,0.122,0.742,0.136,0.8256,1,2,8,0,0,1,32.0,0,1,3,0,17,19,1,1,14,0,39,17,2,2,1,55,70,20,2,10,7,0,5,5,0,3,9,2,0,1,16,11,10,1,16,6,0,2,12,9,1,0,8,9,58,10,40,57,9,40,0,1,1,2,16,16,2,7,27,203,74,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07263305564825953,0.0,0.06510694606413041,0.11812129123974753,0.28481518271659395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04530851444633757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05123190303636856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762033192315823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06985694098506692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372129623851194,0.0,0.12890633856959233,0.13737862778541626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5466028626845055,0.26107562858597416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05613595967229868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684425812070424,0.23799102618769605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044292724152693,0.0,0.037865550632235324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06597101537331862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07509325536191372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06617545417923237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196838629564116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07371269191773658,0.0,0.2563144602065596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239022227996209,0.0,0.04706048516560273,0.16275246568415008,0.06677756551289406,0.11766538496350586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13509825246413154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063617656248447,0.0,0.04897837035685615,0.2470146710371899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06393021960001569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636028276035424,0.04619063985082017,0.0,0.0,0.0731362279741574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06778341691836469,0.0,0.19125857249106412,0.0,0.0,0.07463727367556075,0.0,0.06664483856606124,0.0,0.04268283954148282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056898930335581875,0.0,0.05298431224831186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05320825525797165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07560731261513529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04269176855361908,0.0,0.0,0.03885062777983424,0.07657771506263862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03929821783863256,0.0,0.053444006835744524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19267759715903465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04290548016740762
alcoholism,FreeDoom78,2018/01/08,"Loving an alcoholic The man of my dreams is an alcoholic. We’ve been off and on for 2.5 years. He’s the best man I’ve ever been with. My best friend. Everything I’ve ever wanted and needed in a man. Except for the drinking and all that comes with it. He’s had addictions to so many things, pills, porn, liquor and lying. This last time we broke up and I asked him to move out was because he was texting a girl he works with about having sex with her. He says it was about cocaine and that was it. And that while I was at work he went over to her house and did cocaine. But the text messages were all sexual. He even invited her over to our house to do it. Needless to say we aren’t together but I can’t seem to let him go. I can’t be with him because there is absolutely no trust and all he does is lie. But I can’t seem to let go of all the good and how good he did make me feel. I’m almost 40 years old and I’m scared that I will never meet someone who treated me as good as he did.

alcoholism,SmokyEck,2018/01/09,"Alcoholic mom - helping from overseas My mom is in a bad place and I don't know what I can do to help her. 
She's always liked to drink but it never seemed to be out of control until a few years ago when I moved to Europe. I'm an only child and after that she just seemed to spiral. It came out that she was in pretty big trouble financially, despite having a very good job and now every time I talk to her she's totally out of it, probably on pain pills too. 

I'm thousands of miles away and have no idea what to do. I'm worried that confronting her will throw her even further into her spiral, and even if I did I'm not sure how I could support her. She has a lot of family in the area but over the years she's done a goodmjob of burning most of those bridges. 

I'm just at a loss.

alcoholism,gamergirl1117,2018/01/09,"I’m afraid childhood best friend is killing herself Let me start by saying that I don’t mean to come off the wrong way. I’m just really worried about my fiend and I need the input of people who have seen this kind of stuff before. I’m sorry if this offends you in any sort of way cause that’s not my intention. 

We had my friend over for New Years. She got there an hour before the ball dropped and she was so drunk that she fell into the house.  When I looked at her I barely recognized her. He face was swollen and stomach was swollen too. At one point her head was shaking in an unconscious manner almost the same way that a stroke survivors head would shake. I don’t know what causes her to do this. 

she won’t get help on her own and I don’t know what to do!!! Does anyone have any input? Ways I could get thru to her? Why she looks the way she does? Her friend who’s a doctor said that she needs to go to the hospital because to him it looks like something with her kidneys but she won’t go :’( ",1.6479904306220092,3.4533848038277566,2.419617224880384,97.30732057416272,78.95215311004785,5.356937799043063,19.61244019138756,6.05967700443912,-0.2721157894736845,780,18,180,5,19,243,124,209,0.077,0.862,0.061,0.3635,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,1,1,0,1,6,12,2,3,11,0,18,10,5,3,0,25,38,8,1,5,4,0,1,1,3,3,4,2,0,0,14,8,1,0,3,2,0,6,6,6,0,1,8,7,31,6,23,25,3,27,0,0,4,0,29,9,0,3,7,113,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532164203581036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566330183290466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08052641586604471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020383777494088,0.0,0.19599476630027154,0.0,0.12085911792319713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23661344493207526,0.0,0.09920490609766823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195030409594128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787679928947604,0.2015642616735034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26692980692782864,0.0,0.12033847162570176,0.0,0.13090244866101053,0.0,0.09210839440692226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363861167752085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771930267502053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341484809819935,0.13288555847072764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12741359505296568,0.11992717668764775,0.12658392620373926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177645564821268,0.0,0.05626406041362418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29013011846815706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544902341359293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17078756153850935,0.0,0.11122758590545977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803914320708938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079841277371308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10886865004154098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377798709506407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954879106983778,0.09158425135932262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08866005098619155,0.0,0.128918381386724,0.08151475444040336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318369780148727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4570651834908779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391897740242197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169561853410409,0.0,0.08181028780257359,0.12591542737623887,0.0,0.07416282506279938
alcoholism,spectra007,2018/01/09,"How to lower my alcohol tolerance? I’ve got a very addictive personality, and while I don’t normally think of myself as an alcoholic (even though I guess I probably am), I’ve had a bad month or so. Normally, I smoke a lot of weed and that does the trick for me so I don’t drink too much, but over the Christmas break I haven’t had access to any weed, so I’ve drank a LOT. Like, I drank 8 or more shots worth of booze in mixed drinks tonight (granted it was over the course of about 9-10 hours) and I really feel like I’m only barely drunk. I’m returning to college next week and I want to get my tolerance on a more normal level, so I can go out with my friends on the weekend without drinking excessively. Also, I don’t feel like I can take a complete tolerance break because my mom and I usually have a glass or two of wine together every night while we watch movies or tv together and if I didn’t participate, it would definitely make her question a few things. Any recommendations as to how I can lower my tolerance? Exactly how long would I need to abstain from drinking and does smoking weed make help anyone else as well?",4.4880058224163015,5.0873110174672505,5.8740436681222725,80.14020669577876,69.82969432314411,9.774788937409026,30.113828238719073,9.888512548439397,2.73601461426492,889,34,185,21,15,301,133,229,0.046,0.779,0.175,0.9832,2,0,8,0,0,0,22.0,1,0,0,0,13,7,1,0,13,0,15,12,0,5,1,38,31,27,0,8,7,1,2,3,1,2,3,0,0,1,4,10,11,1,4,8,1,1,6,2,1,1,7,3,25,5,25,22,6,22,0,0,1,0,7,7,0,9,15,116,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12567357172393834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24640118038361905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921903688931063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15679039768205996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806073259791529,0.11811925742160766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09625502314298433,0.07027437612430003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087019064455548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20176678636102585,0.0,0.0,0.4517269229779118,0.0,0.0,0.09630268649948052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0761421741843566,0.0,0.09712941981035586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657932120164526,0.1647138869888358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906600287279816,0.0,0.06022969174675648,0.0,0.06551698742087378,0.0,0.09220094168509832,0.0,0.12699528679752534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07727058759105923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352880335237382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689617776935285,0.0,0.0,0.10202027293683108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19601598170174106,0.0,0.0,0.1539022506134071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13501599926354954,0.0920163888303861,0.0,0.08474497850912696,0.08547958143958713,0.0,0.0,0.12260291045387292,0.10818363779541312,0.3388534267400599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767658056397286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065913534614047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124292678670782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12914137623465888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07385211662407089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08667714829340592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658773581075777,0.07386756607524865,0.1132632365665725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11261302402151298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696600306377032,0.09511909923581677,0.06799586433597453,0.0,0.09247165999476348,0.0,0.10365168275783032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11112700505320716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16378497581018128,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,tangledrhythms,2018/01/09,"30m, just talked to my record-label mates that I’m coming down. My friend Ryley started tearing up and told me a story I hadn’t heard. She came up to me at a bar asleep and I thought she was someone else. I’ve been drinking for a decade, got worse after my mother passed almost 5 years ago. Didn’t help that I’ve been getting a discount at some bars. Anyone been in a similar place? What’s the best course of action?",1.5719318181818205,3.358435056818184,2.779545454545456,94.7268181818182,79.11363636363637,4.854545454545455,20.090909090909093,5.148860815047168,-0.3122772727272727,327,8,72,1,8,105,67,88,0.038,0.8340000000000001,0.128,0.8105,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,6,0,6,4,1,0,0,8,15,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,4,3,0,1,3,1,4,2,0,0,0,11,1,9,2,11,4,2,15,0,0,0,0,9,7,0,2,4,40,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22889107707550446,0.0,0.2585639608575437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18054918983481635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2709795983156996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29532795709527593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22242844451649876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25295135702470045,0.0,0.0,0.2157046126414655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19949544864778213,0.0,0.13490612567510313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20651727521090252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17307536031196566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26977860808943005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21878383247324285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827651549558742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20754258309790036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20499302469022546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467344841107183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2631420635480075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16628131075924085
alcoholism,vyts18,2018/01/09,"Struggling with my father (alcoholic) and mother from 3000 miles away Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this.

I (29M) have been having to hear from afar some of the horror stories my mother has been having to go through for the past few years.

So my father (60's M) was a hardcore alcoholic/drunk through his 20's. Sobered up the first time after marrying my mother and having my older sister. He remained sober through our childhood, save one bender after he lost nearly everything in a failed business venture.

Upon the time the nest emptied (aka: I went off to college), he decided to start drinking again. Only this time, according to my mother, it was different. He was in control. He'd have a drink or 2 with dinner, and not even every night of the week.

Fast forward to ~2 years ago, he was in really rough shape and decided he was tired of being in a bender so he went into rehab for a few weeks, came out fine, and then went back to his ways. He finally did the full on inpatient rehab where he was stuck for a full month. That seemed to do the trick for about 8 months, leading into now.

He had a checkup at the doctors office and had a clean bill of health. My dad had had heart surgery about 10 years ago to correct a faulty valve. Everything is functioning as intended with no noticeable signs of deterioration. I was happy to hear this since he's been working out a lot too to try to be in better shape. Well once he gets this news, he's back on his bender.

So here's where things get interesting. My PREGNANT wife and I were visiting for the holidays, and he has the BALLS to want to drive us to see a play that my mom surprised us with tickets for. Everyone knew he had been drinking- where or how- we don't know, but he was. And he knew it. So we convince him it's not a good idea. He then tries to tell us later that he's going to a meeting, but he didn't. He got smashed instead. It's getting annoying because he know's he doesn't like what he's doing. He just seems to have no sense of self control and no sense of responsibility. He's home alone a lot and gets bored, so he drives to the liquor store and gets a pint of vodka, and has it finished by the time he gets back to the house. It's scary to think that next time I visit I'll have his grandchild with us, and I don't want to leave him alone with the baby.

I want to threaten to not let him be near the kid if I hear he's been drinking, but I also know that attacking and threatening rarely works. My mom's in shambles. When he's sober they have a really strong relationship, but the moment any amount of alcohol touches his lips it's a nightmare.

So after that long winded read, I'm not exactly sure if I'm looking for advice, insight, or just need to confide in someone besides my wife. Probably a little of all three.

TLDR: My dad was sober all of childhood, then decided he could drink again when the nest was empty, then decided to get clean, works out a lot, get's a clean bill of health, is a mess again.",4.1894038831835685,4.930398911184213,5.021046213093712,85.47671373555842,70.57894736842105,7.971181001283697,27.32926829268293,8.096554002634818,1.5715589216944799,2350,76,491,31,41,764,276,608,0.105,0.8290000000000001,0.066,-0.9772,1,2,9,0,0,0,74.0,7,0,1,12,29,22,3,1,40,0,47,18,2,5,5,80,86,39,0,7,15,13,2,1,0,0,9,3,4,2,19,29,9,2,14,13,3,13,11,8,1,3,32,7,38,14,87,48,11,90,0,2,2,0,71,32,0,11,47,305,57,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627872998544877,0.12024721847497312,0.14497061935937938,0.0,0.1404944507913218,0.0,0.054240384955119285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046123969508148385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07716180587777084,0.06372470948196451,0.156461898764696,0.0,0.041346067482195575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059986537910732114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07757481382048076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521451328372507,0.05415349927659128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086367813303356,0.0,0.0694227303303862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33221803008136164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04479839801777901,0.0,0.0571462852815967,0.06481059855029724,0.12191517464253886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430000914482437,0.0,0.05769271549070273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834900612978481,0.0,0.07709409695341034,0.05688918599001753,0.05424660547809347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722019813260495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14419161900723276,0.2293343136210781,0.08037407323676449,0.0,0.0,0.0680349545842246,0.0,0.0,0.07826203583846138,0.0,0.07656723785790026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11182609927450243,0.0,0.0,0.07181788410808312,0.0,0.06935662570086536,0.0,0.03313633146583336,0.06797941696351682,0.0,0.06002382834302598,0.05695671270497444,0.0,0.0740400328419147,0.1729895828465398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588738577160123,0.1082760468857022,0.0,0.0,0.05029207995101508,0.0,0.0,0.07213366362973034,0.06365005618615313,0.0,0.0,0.07722028970010811,0.0,0.07223241948154621,0.04596061673489843,0.05158468870921317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474754065248196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312784208535995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13568860243860656,0.0,0.08690207629138813,0.0,0.0,0.07281968344806512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05404849794935723,0.12349238875837296,0.07075725454606538,0.0,0.0,0.056106323884211017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05746870441245655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048007554069793984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07090640593102956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06392515194089322,0.0,0.050996670766091864,0.0,0.059282866838596564,0.06244501888444912,0.0,0.0,0.04506054507747078,0.04346012786069671,0.0,0.0,0.2372991292678782,0.07795594796505909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09209873099743894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32634505006808245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12001650176329134,0.053837079337339284,0.10881176625663624,0.0,0.06098367152158145,0.18862599592643767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14813429068529024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310330574610535
alcoholism,bellahzarah,2018/01/10,"Alcoholic in Denial? Hello Everyone,
I myself have had drug and alcohol problems in the past but have recovered and rarely drink now if ever, I don't care for it, but I know everyone has their own journey of recovery. Currently, my boyfriend has been approached by his mother that she feels he has an alcohol problem. My own mother has pointed it out after being around him with his drinking and feels the same way. He doesn't drink every day ( more like social drinking) but when he does, its quite a bit and I have to help him in a sense of that he is very out of it and withdrawn. Also, when I have pointed it out to him he gets very sad and defensive and says he feels he doesn't have a problem, also emphasizes he has gotten help before. I hope this is enough info, and appreciate the feedback. Not sure what to do.

Question is for anyone with specific experience like this...what are my odds?",2.537352941176472,5.333009892156866,3.9210784313725497,82.08985294117647,82.43137254901961,6.929411764705884,24.18627450980393,8.07648339933343,1.8195333333333337,427,16,77,9,12,140,79,102,0.07,0.903,0.027000000000000003,-0.4767,0,0,4,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,1,1,2,0,0,2,0,11,7,2,0,1,5,15,1,0,1,1,3,2,1,0,4,2,1,0,0,2,2,3,0,1,3,0,2,1,1,0,1,2,3,5,1,8,5,0,7,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,1,6,32,7,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006585518421001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15457121261915915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5127218902665963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43248077228949855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24915217025005554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799939313676407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14979686935708286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24763926704454686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21827138127715506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18286420561906128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33242119758562505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095402802792818,0.0,0.0,0.1500861232427821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14235624022170365
alcoholism,younggun1234,2018/01/10,"Trying my best to quit but having hard time, what do you all do to help combat the urge? Hi there! So I've been in and out of heavy drinking for...probably about 6 years now. It's reached a point where I am worrying my family. The love of my life left me a few years back due to it as well and although we are still friends and see each other regularly, he is obviously very skeptical of devoting his all to me again. I know I need help and I have looked into programs in my area and am just waiting on a vacancy for one so I'm not in the denial or angry stage, I just want to feel normal and not have friends or family worry about taking me out or inviting me places.

 So, I am curious what things you do in your day that help you say no?

Lately I’ve had a few close people to me express concern over my drinking. Many family members are alcoholics, including my father. Yet for me it really doesn’t seem like a big deal. I’m not sure if this is denial or it’s not really a problem. Swap any of those things in the DSM 5 for internet/phone and the results would be the same.

alcoholism,C01nd3xtEr,2018/01/11,"Alcohol withdrawal I am a 50 yr old guy who has been drinking normally for most of my life, by that I mean occasionally, weekends, occasions etc.

For some reason and I’m not sure exactly why but my intake took a sharp increase about last spring and for some reason I started drinking everyday, I mean every single day. At least 3 pints, maybe 4 or more but every single day. 

I lied and hid this from people close to me but I guess they suspected,anyway.

Over Christmas I had an epiphany and told myself I would have my last drink on New Year’s Eve, but I failed and by 2pm on New Year’s Day I was back at it. I hated myself but there it is.

So New Year’s Day is last Monday, and I have not touched a drop since and I am not going to touch a drop.

Here comes the question though. How long can I expect to feel this rough, stomach aches, terrible headaches, no appetite which leads to no energy. I have also had to take time off work this week due to the anxiety that has started since I stopped drinking.

I did not think I would feel any effects after daily drinking for 9 months, I thought that was reserved for lifetime/longtime drinkers.

Please put my mind at rest and show me light at the end of the tunnel.",3.309864106988784,4.764033209016393,4.07169974115617,88.74370578084556,73.46721311475409,6.940120793787749,25.956859361518553,7.475848149327749,1.191995081967213,949,32,198,11,19,303,148,244,0.138,0.804,0.058,-0.9654,0,0,7,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,1,4,8,4,1,0,9,0,18,8,1,5,2,44,34,18,0,4,10,0,6,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,10,10,6,1,10,7,0,6,6,3,0,0,9,7,28,1,26,23,10,47,0,1,0,0,5,9,0,6,30,127,38,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087192337288288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813540442268344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918039867135772,0.0,0.07782374549788912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07822466748376941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876320334908414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624316717651073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4982870297575206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09010324944197626,0.0,0.11345667784678586,0.0,0.0,0.17142508940691162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287624799473144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057815929757552835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11206789063513506,0.10072943684096812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043805449727372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24877241784735515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185543744277581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002851269811223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220221217612764,0.22162922084418396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271905758334124,0.0,0.0812005142877847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2947565775701629,0.0,0.0,0.09967453576916464,0.0,0.0,0.10674930944138114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705272931327181,0.0,0.0,0.11166981461208553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022675022308249,0.11396172246463715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20919230899504307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16830545573959452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440110972755014,0.0,0.0,0.08505146241695682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09588002818397584,0.0,0.07648886364576551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06518495705752357,0.09994994561303217,0.0807628522695991,0.0593200185723307,0.0,0.0,0.09720809144682988,0.11302660669612735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08160227155252574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179617890165093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406119779504762,0.0,0.0,0.14453321237061306,0.0,0.0,0.1965338033770309
alcoholism,A00087945,2018/01/11,"Why do they say you shouldn’t have a relationship in your first year of recovery? What’s your opinion? I’m 85 days sober- and I kind of want to keep this topic pretty open for discussion. 

I feel each situation is different. I don’t believe something magically happens at 1 year that makes having a relationship okay. 

I’m confused. And probably over thinking everything. I’m just looking for insight.

So...
What is the reasoning? What’s your experience?

alcoholism,BlemishedInsistence,2018/01/11,"Walking and talking drunk So the other day I drank a lot and started walking down the road drunk. I was yelling and evidently, walking in the road. The cop pulls up and gives me a ticket for disorderly conduct.
I ran my mouth and the cop warned me I would be arrested. Lucklily, I took heed. I am then taking to a detox here. I tell the cop I need a hosp because I feel like hurting myself. 
I get to hospital and as soon as the cop leaves, I flee the ER. All I want to do is drink although some benzos would have been nice. 
I get home and drink some more. Pass out then wake up thinking was this a dream? Nope. I have the $200 ticket.
This is my 2nd ticket in 2 mths. I am feeling so paranoid. I cannot control my drinking. Its as if I am getting worse, doing really stupid shit. 
I can go a couple of days with no drinks, but then I cave in to the urges. Should I go to a detox even if I am 2 days clean? It seems on day 3 or 4 I go back. Should I down a drink before detox just to help with the anxiety? I am really concerned that alcohol has a serious grip on me. Will detox help with psych meds?
I need to see a psy Dr because I am using alcohol for a myraid of psychological reasons- boredom, depression, anger. My neighbors are tired of my drunken antics. Passing out outside, screaming and I dont know wtf I do the bizarre shit drunk. Massive Blackouts that are truely scary.

alcoholism,jenkemjar,2018/01/12,"Dissociate from problem drinkers? I was a once a week binger for a very long time. Nary a drop the other 6 daya, but would usually hit it hard on day 7.  Anyways, i am a month into my no drinking phase as alcohol is my allergy and i really need to lose 30 lbs! I have friends with severe alcoholism, but they support my decision and never push me to drink. But, i know if i am not around them i can just watch football and not have a drop. I have to get thru to the end of football season and its usually super easy from that point on as i have fewer triggers. Any thoughts?

alcoholism,TomBradysHouseCat,2018/01/13,"Ready to change, have no clue what to expect I have drank heavily everyday for about 4 years. Everyday and heavily. I feel my body starting to turn on me. I am having withdrawals. I have no health insurance. I am waking up at 5:30am in panic attacks then drinking to fall back asleep kinda, then having another drink - then heading to the office. I can't think straight for hours. Then I get home or start drinking again at work. 

I gotta stop but I'm afraid that I will hurt myself if I do. For reference I drink about half of a fifth at night and a another 2 drinks in the morning. I'm in my mid 20's.

What do I do? Feel free to post here or dm me.

alcoholism,StellaZaFella,2018/01/13,"I can't tell if I'm an alcoholic or just depressed I have bipolar disorder and I've been severely depressed for several years. I've tried all the treatments/therapy whatever. 

I've been especially depressed since April 2017. 

Since Christmas Eve I've drunk every single day. Between 8 and 32 ounces of hard liquor (80 proof or higher) each day. 

I don't know if this means I'm an alcoholic or if I'm just doing it because I'm depressed and it's available/I'm not doing anything important so it doesn't affect anything. I can just drink and go to bed. 

I don't feel that I need to drink, it just ends up happening each day. Like I'm bored and sad and just drink to get through the time I have until I can go to sleep.

I've tried to take a day off because I feel like two weeks straight of drinking is a lot, but at some point each time I decide to do that, I just fuck it, I'm not doing big anything else. Why not? 

If I didn't have alcohol in the house, I don't feel I would be desperate to go get it. 

I also feel like it doesn't do anything to me anymore. I had 20 ounces of Bacardi white rum tonight, and never felt drunk/impaired. Maybe a little warm, physically. No fun from it, no buzz. I drink just because that's what I do now.",1.4964897039897025,3.34236837065637,3.1979005791505806,91.35636180823678,79.57915057915058,6.47882882882883,24.69128056628057,7.492282038375204,1.0762392535392542,964,36,214,14,24,320,130,259,0.138,0.802,0.06,-0.9272,0,0,8,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,0,10,12,1,0,8,0,24,13,1,1,3,44,46,18,0,6,18,0,7,3,0,1,4,0,1,0,13,10,10,0,8,8,0,3,13,7,0,1,5,8,19,5,20,39,7,26,0,5,1,1,1,8,1,9,18,123,32,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011331387130913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511212703520649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931487813455518,0.0,0.0,0.3091704814657285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17176819867882134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422965109481364,0.0,0.3235913176447477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764667235654156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.460055784993136,0.0,0.0,0.07846263887465088,0.0,0.08319004645301044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913622005472735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189966064544751,0.1342006822677246,0.0901831357890876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683254029647484,0.09814431403391398,0.0,0.16013994762815234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08305794158263344,0.0,0.0841387303948059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837732775673414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051618956253771234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13766165232428773,0.09413794918616314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985203603851093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436071208516901,0.10231232109584053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06964451121191527,0.07244107672570023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878988434687103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122179869174936,0.0,0.155392161414649,0.0,0.09399325506300044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706202291175621,0.0,0.08209495984728676,0.0,0.10741190716317683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10953733924554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1275383939141464,0.0,0.091751490613193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07534130903344805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847530853141416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672192582164882,0.0,0.0,0.06048489310421856
alcoholism,herewegoagain29,2018/01/13,"I can't let anyone find out I've been going on a 3-4 day binge and no one has any idea. I called in sick from work 3 days in a row and claimed to have a stomach bug. I'm lucky in that I think my job is still secured but I feel very unstable on so many levels. I worry that I will break down and loose it and the truth will come out or I'll do something crazy. The past 3 days have been a blur of vomiting, sleeping and lying to myself. I live alone but thank God I'm best friends with my neighbor. He's been amazing in motivating me and making me feel better. He thinks I'm just sick. I have officially stopped drinking and am going to sleep semi sober tonight (I drank this morning and a little this afternoon) . My anxiety is getting the best of me and I worry ill have another panic attack like I did at 4 this morning. I know I have until Monday to get back to normal but I worry that I'll still feel horrible and weak and tired then. Every bad feeling is joined by extreme anxiety of wondering how long this feeling will last. I feel like I'm just barley on the verge of loosing everything I've built for myself and it's terrifying. Luckily my neighbor has been talking about getting sober again for the new year (he used to be sober but smokes weed and drinks very occasionally now) and invited me to go to an AA meeting with him tomorrow. My very first. There's a lot of anxiety there but I'm making myself do it. I am posting this 1) to vent. I feel so alone in this world with this awful secret. 2) to ask how horrible the detox will be. I feel there's still time this weekend to get the worst of it out unnoticed but I HAVE to go back to work Monday. I'm terrified my behavior will be noticed by co workers. Not just in the short term but also long term. I'm scared of the withdrawals and I know my body has learned to live off of alcohol. I have no idea how it will react without it. I've been shocked before of what my body can withstand but this time I'm worried.  I can't let this binge session affect my job or my relationships.

alcoholism,seeds_of_change_TA,2018/01/14,"Brother wants to go to rehab - how do I help? He’s had two convicted DWI’s, served some time. Has never been able to support himself because he works long hours in a restaurant for little pay, and spends all his money on booze. I also think he’s depressed and has been for years - when he’s not at work he’s sleeping or drinking almost 100% of the time. He’s been in countless accidents, one quite serious, and has lost most friendships and lost his serious girlfriend years ago, all because of his addictive and toxic behavior. 

He also has a heart of gold, when he’s sober. He’s smart and empathetic and honestly reminds me a lot of myself. But he has no clue about the joys that exist in life when you can see the light and smell the roses, finding happiness in the mundane moments. 

Mom and step dad are huge enablers and also alcoholics. He lives with them. They mean well but they have their own issues.

He has good health insurance that my dad pays for. 

Something happened at work recently that prompted his boss to tell him “go to rehab or don’t come back.” He has now expressed interest in rehab. 

What can I do to support him? As the adult child of alcoholics (all parents and step parents, mind you) I’m a codependent, and have trouble discerning the line between support and enabling. My default has been to let them all lead their dysfunctional lives and love them for who they are, without engaging with or validating their dysfunction. But my brother seems to on some level recognize that this life sucks, and I don’t want to just stay faded in the background if I can help him turn his life around. 

Any advice you have would be great. Thank you.

alcoholism,RuffSamurai,2018/01/14,"Battling Psychological addictions. Tapering down. I’ve been drinking 6-10 beers everyday for about 5 months with stints of sobriety here and there. Went 96 hours a few weeks ago, but that’s the longest I’ve gone. 
Went 20 hours tonight, but decided to have 2 or 3 beers, to be safe. 

Is that safe? To be honest I don’t really get withdrawal to bad. Just way heightened anxiety (I have extreme anxiety in general, so that makes sense), mild shakiness (which is hard to attribute to withdrawal because I shake constantly due to ptsd) and loss of appetite.

Tbh I am more worried about going into serious withdrawal then actually having serious withdrawal.

Anyway, would it be safe to go from 6-10 beers a night to 2 or 3 for a few days then down to two, then down to none?

I desperately want to quit drinking.

alcoholism,TitanonymousRex,2018/01/16,"3rd night sober. It sucks, I'm lonely and bored. The 2 biggest reasons I drank and smoked. I literally drank and or smoked every night in 2017, and most of 2016.

I'm diabetic, more than 150 over weight, single, 46, I live in my mom's basement, I have a shit job making 12.00 per hour, and I haven't had a significant relationship with a woman in more than 15 years. I have no genuine social circle and only a few acquaintences that even come close to being ""friends"".  I'm really fucking bored, when I go to bed tonight I will just toss and turn until about an hour before my alarm goes off, AND to top it off I have PTSD which gives me really fucked up dreams.

alcoholism,reducemess,2018/01/16,"He says I'm an addict because I drank two non alcoholic beers after having wine... Am I a real problem here? I need some help and support.  I have started drinking 3-4 (sometimes 5) glasses of wine a day — if I have a glass at brunch—it’s 5.   

I don’t slam drinks, I just like to have a glass while cooking…one with dinner …and sometimes I have one hanging out before bed.

My SO likes to work on his laptop pretty much all night after dinner.  He will watch tv and work on the couches I usually sit with him (bored).

I said after the first of the year, that I was going to cut back on drinking and improve my eating.  I have stared eating more protein and i’ve already lost weight and look better.  But, I still like my wine.  

I was trying to just have 1 or 2…. and see how I do with that.  Most days that works.  But, my SO and I argue and I get stressed and I will pour another glass sometimes just to deal.  I know — not smart.

So, the other night, we went to dinner.  I had 2 glasses of wine and came home and drank 2 NON ALCOHOLIC beers.

He said what are you doing?  I said I’m drinking this to fill me up and give me something to sip on and not feel deprived.  

He said that it was weird.  I said noooo…it’s better!  

And it was. However, last night I had 3 glasses again (we didn’t have any more O’douls) and he laid into me.  He said I was acting weird.  I was just tired and quiet.  I told him I was exhausted.  I had a 6 hour road trip that day and had come home to have dinner with him (we agreed we would go out when I got home and he asked the time and I gave it to him) and I was STARVING and I found out he hadn’t even left the gym yet when I got there.  I held my words.  I asked him to please hurry.

When I got home after stopping at the store to bide time, he came running out of the shower dancing naked and I said ‘haha…hey i’m starving.  It’s 8.  I just did a 6 hour road trip for work appointment, can we please go?”

He said yes.  But he delayed and delayed.  I only had 2 glasses at dinner but then he told me that  he lost his driver license somewhere between there and the place we  ate and we needed to go (at 10pm) back to every place we had just been to find it.  

When we got home with NO LICENSE FOUND — he laid into me and said that I was an addict (since I was pouring my third glass) and that NON ALCOHOLIC beer still has alcohol and I drank two the night before and that makes me an ADDICT and WEIRD.   He also told me that O'doulls beer still has alcohol and it doesn't count if I want to say I'm 'better"".... He said YOU HAVE A PROBLEM!!!  YOU ARE AN ADDICT.

I said YOU have no idea…. I do not…I am just stressed and need you to be kind! and telling me that I’m an addict because drinking O’DOULS instead of wine makes me weird and an ADDICT.

He said that I need help and I am causing the problems and he wants to warn me.  

So, is he right?  What do I do?

alcoholism,DumbledoresaidCalmly,2018/01/16,"I think I’m getting ready to quit... I just realized I’m drinking about half a handle a day. I weigh 115 pounds. I’m terrified to let go, but the thought of quitting enters my mind daily. I’ve been through rehab several times already. My longest period sober was close to ten years. Any advice, I guess??

alcoholism,canniboob,2018/01/17,"I went a day I went a single day and I felt like proclaiming it around the town because I was so proud I made it for 24 hours with nothing at all. 

I can't remember the last time I did that. 

I'm drinking whatever I can find in the house. Idefk why. I just need it. I don't feel like how the typical stereotype portrays it, I just feel incomplete. Empty. Wrong. Uneasy. Uncomfortable. 
I just. I don't even enjoy it anymore when I'm drunk. I used to feel colors and life and love and now I just feel barely more comfortable than when I am sober buthere we are. 
I hate when I see people romanticize getting drunk, like it's some troubled shit and beautiful tragedy and all that bullshit. It's not. It's slowly and quietly addicting. And numbing and painful at the same time. 
I wanna stop but I don't wanna. Just because this is who I've become. This is who I am. This is where I am. And Idk what to do. I guess I'm here. And I'll be here until I crack and fold and lose my shit again. 
Then I'll seriously consider changing.

When I do, I just want to get drunker and drunker until I pass out because it reminds me of smoking myself to sleep.

alcoholism,whatisayberight,2018/01/17,"I need advice guys.... About 3 weeks ago I was let go from my job. I had already been drinking more than I should have been for a while, but that sent me over the edge. Because I had nothing else to do besides apply for other jobs, I started drinking a little less than a fifth of vodka everyday. I'm ashamed to even admit this to strangers who will never know who I am, but it's the truth. Two days ago I'd had enough and decided not to drink anymore. All day I was feeling very weak, and around 8 PM I started to notice that my hands were very shaky and it was difficult to hold objects. I did some research into withdrawal symptoms and found out this was fairly common with heavy and prolonged consumption of alcohol. 

If any of you have ever dealt with this and successfully quite drinking, how did you do it? Are there any natural remedies that helped with fatigue and the shakes? This kind of behavior is not like me and to be quite honest I'm scared. 

Please be kind, I already feel like an idiot and a loser over all of this. 

Sincerely, 
A person who wants to be better",3.8893485915492967,5.275241840375589,4.504222417840378,86.48055897887325,71.91079812206573,7.202934272300472,27.397007042253517,7.6454224807358475,1.5069063380281698,844,30,168,10,16,269,132,213,0.15,0.715,0.135,-0.6944,2,0,6,0,0,0,22.0,0,2,0,5,6,18,1,4,9,0,25,9,1,1,5,38,38,14,0,4,5,0,3,2,0,2,4,0,0,2,15,15,5,1,6,5,0,3,3,9,0,1,14,3,17,9,27,18,6,21,0,2,0,0,10,6,0,3,14,120,32,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171233030040072,0.2124927772141283,0.1280911521813631,0.0,0.0,0.2645313305477573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16301433831446324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11886637363624256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10669853268338526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07306398283136223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10600416540000893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15459626623711312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.469658643237809,0.0,0.0,0.10012551119011713,0.0,0.0,0.12384477523649386,0.0,0.07916470859176676,0.10841791627566147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12120704576164193,0.08562617894858691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314174962742616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811774515954802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11867770937129145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08033791541793862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2378800294092269,0.0,0.0,0.2496261588037498,0.0658705143764786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225623527952542,0.0,0.1171125817156148,0.12012864236840005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887277291067137,0.09244144655790494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11500644607028485,0.13645848963292775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465489332472433,0.0,0.13156747639721744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549662815626721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11999820654878475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16967142560010434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245777725561656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11708330272675985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19778988065885386,0.07069502339885428,0.0,0.09614240852589656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hes 52 years old now and just 3 months ago he decided to turn his life around and quite alcohol. He even went to the hospital to get proper withdrawal treatment. I was so proud. 
He's been doing great and for the first time ever I could actually get to know my father whom is actually a very kind and gentle man. (his alcoholic side is very verbally and mentally abusive) I still have PTSD from my childhood, so I've been taking baby steps in getting close to him. I was kicked out of my apartment so I even moved back in with him. My sister moved back in as well. 
My sister found him drunk last night and I found him drunk today. He says is girlfriends dieing and thats why hes drinking, tho, he does have a habit of blowing things out of proportion. Likey, shes just become sicker, but not deathly. His girlfriend has had lung issues for a long time and continues to smoke everyday, never leave the house, and only consume junk food. Shes caused a lot of strife and drama for my family so its a little difficult for me to feel pity. 

Survivors of alcoholism, I'm so scarred this is going to continue. Is a set back okay every now and then? I mean do you think he can get back on his feet? Is there hope for him? Is there anything I can do for him?
I've just been trying to encourage other healthy coping mechanisms but Idk what I'm doing. I know screaming at him today may have not been my best move.

alcoholism,WhenItHits2018,2018/01/19,"Extreme Paranoia The other day I got blackout drunk once again. Sadly it rolled into my work day thus there’s a good portion of that day at work that I just don’t remember. It was during the last day of a work trip and I won’t go back into work until the first weekend of February.

I had one friend who could tell I was out of it and pretty much babysat me that day. Once I began to sober up, it finally hit me that I just can’t do it anymore. I’m tired of telling myself I can just have a few to only wake up not knowing what happened and supporting a fresh bruise somewhere. Today marks day five of being sober. The longest I’ve gone in quite a while.

Here’s my issue though, I have crippling paranoia of what I did during my last black out. I feel like everything I could’ve done wrong, I did. Normally after I black out, I get this feeling. It’s usually calmed down by me simply asking people what I did. This time is much worse than any form of paranoia I’ve ever had. Perhaps it’s because I have two weeks off to stew in my paranoia before I find the truth.

I asked my friend who watched me, they stated they were with me the entire day except a ten minute period I went to the restroom. I also spoke with anyone else at work who I’m close to and anyone I might’ve texted (friends outside of work). Everyone said I was fine. I laughed a lot and kept sleeping. I’m still paranoid though. What if during those ten minutes no one knew where I was, I fucked up.

Everyday I keep getting paranoid thoughts that I cursed out my boss, broke some equipment, or tried to start a fist fight. Everyday being sober I keep thinking of new scenarios and the more I think about them, the more real they seem. Obviously the only way to know for sure is to speak to my boss, which I won’t be able to do for two weeks as I’m off and out of town. I don’t wanna send an email or something going “hey, at work I was drunk, did I curse you out?”. My only plan is to simply wait out the two weeks and see what happens. At the very least this sense of dread and paranoia has finally made me realize I can’t keep doing this.

My question to you guys is about my possible memories. When you guys blacked out, did you ever create fake memories? Even when they made no sense, you fully believed them to be true? Everyday they get worse and seem more real. Combine that with my constant shaking and mood swings since my last drink its becoming unbearable. Wish me luck.

TLDR: I blackouted and now I keep having memories that I’m unsure if they’re real or not.",3.4874969400244815,4.650877096899226,4.341448388412893,88.12213586291311,72.6046511627907,7.214524683802531,25.78824969400245,7.573540080772713,1.2051674418604654,1986,63,416,23,38,640,250,516,0.12,0.794,0.086,-0.9373,0,0,2,0,2,0,51.0,0,5,7,10,20,22,2,2,21,0,38,7,2,5,6,78,82,25,0,6,11,0,2,1,3,2,1,3,0,2,30,26,3,6,14,4,0,7,10,8,0,9,25,10,69,13,61,49,11,73,0,2,5,1,32,25,1,11,40,278,99,9,0.06973195261371473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055764617311727084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047420118987870616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915535945818338,0.09751640523233056,0.0714486259936625,0.0,0.0,0.1303799251443079,0.0,0.0,0.053619567263389394,0.0,0.04250795108473635,0.07701346310057182,0.059336755673278375,0.07856403151432287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535546804541364,0.0,0.11135058004284996,0.0,0.0,0.31479938458737394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135999794066393,0.0,0.0683107663298192,0.0,0.0,0.05825209860003425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04605729704365048,0.1261530867374681,0.0,0.06663186901958358,0.06267058266694599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07051714090447449,0.04981652088034075,0.0,0.15277589123481702,0.06373374138809823,0.059313963270641236,0.0,0.0,0.1616242008353056,0.0644660665456647,0.10929620148137777,0.0,0.07926055128770534,0.05848785344230077,0.055771012640289414,0.0,0.0,0.13809119265910014,0.12332747080599578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278204159866145,0.0,0.24792385389102184,0.0,0.0,0.07664571501678072,0.17052254513974066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034067509750082214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592836124739569,0.0,0.13196411922234955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07397458207405552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10252201726476397,0.0,0.0,0.06734755436162587,0.0,0.0,0.06832250806602343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14852450745773682,0.0945043515363426,0.1591028766145774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04834335587069386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861229915355418,0.0,0.0709424648976351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07811574583442225,0.07416851508039475,0.0,0.2381106850250045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07899270887957789,0.0,0.06633105539211513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055567338006790964,0.12696270142108826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05768299179218021,0.0,0.06978231219593854,0.0,0.0,0.053683063917005856,0.0,0.0,0.04935663496837769,0.0,0.05568802743374788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913099346501877,0.06572154009466467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189760028922506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08936283916405884,0.13702257878902632,0.05535938124059736,0.0406612623385654,0.08014662154484095,0.06609773753459515,0.0,0.0,0.047343418499126565,0.0,0.20435395576377566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07679989414794669,0.057536163827175565,0.0,0.055349978229541734,0.1678042986605424,0.0,0.0,0.0646422186874519,0.0,0.0,0.08018830412897245,0.0,0.0,0.3553598440443214,0.0,0.14212563416150475,0.0,0.0762409434777847,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,SamealLJohnson,2018/01/19,"Very Difficult As old mate Yoda would say, ""Difficult it is very, to quit."" 
Or some crap like that. There's a certain mindstate so many alcholics and addicts have. It's like I could probbably quit alcholol, but then I'd still smoke weed everynight, and if not that then something else. 

I started using when I was 13 and never really stopped and it was *always* as an escape, for anxiety, to try and be more social ectra. I rarely just drank for fun, not so much with other stuff recently. I have started getting into drugs and I know that is not good. It's stupid and really is one of those things were it's like ""I don't give a fuck I just wanna have a good night hey lets get fucked up"" and so on and so forth. 

And I'm just thinking, how many lives have been ruined by that train of thought? Or how many lives have been ruined by the person with an ""addictive personality"" that feels they need to ""escape"" who drinks themselves to sleep? 

One thing always leads to another when we relapse we don't tend to think so much about the future, its just that relief now.

How do some of you that have struggled with this get over it? I get very bad anxiety and sometimes I just honestly don't care about my health, who or where I will be in a few years from now, and everything like that. But I *know* that drinking and drugs in the long run only make it harder. 

It's so stupid. If only it was as easy as waking up and saying ""I quit.""

I have said that so many times...

I hate that there is even a way to hack into your brain and change how you feel. Like chemicalwise and stuff.

alcoholism,ABitterPanacea,2018/01/19,"I have a problem. I never really thought I had a problem. I work hard and I play hard. I'm a full time student and also bartend to help pay for school so why couldn't I get lose a little bit? My first wake up call was when I had a friend of mine pass due to alcohol poisoning at a party when we abused alcohol to the point of no return. My second wake up call was getting let go when I should have went to jail for a DUI. My third was yesterday when I blacked out and took a coworker car for a joy ride.

It's scary because these are one off instances and all my friends and co-workers laugh at my most recent endeavor.. but I just feel like a loser wh could have killed someone, myself and ruined my entire life.

Im currently in therapy for depression and anxiety and I'm scared of telling my therapist. I'm scared of telling my girlfriend that I need help. I already told my co-workers I'm off the wagon.

This is so hard because people are saying what I did wasn't that bad, and they don't understand what standard I hold myself to.

I feel like drinking and being able to let a little loose is a big part of my social identity and without it I'm not that much fun and I won't be able to go out so much too.

Knowing all this I know I have to stop or at least until I can get my drinking under control because that was the last straw.

I'm sorry for rambling I just need to vent and I don't know where else to turn.",2.1629928017718707,3.4646456245847155,3.8454360465116295,89.83078972868219,76.14285714285714,6.877131782945738,25.49847729789591,7.492282038375204,1.1408370985603544,1107,39,245,14,24,371,158,301,0.187,0.7170000000000001,0.097,-0.9789,1,0,4,0,1,0,21.0,1,0,1,5,12,19,2,2,15,0,27,8,2,1,3,44,51,24,1,7,6,0,5,2,3,2,4,1,0,0,11,16,4,3,7,3,1,7,9,11,0,4,12,7,37,8,33,31,9,39,0,4,1,0,14,17,0,2,17,165,48,4,0.19474559524337687,0.11537084266400273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2081238153977593,0.0,0.0,0.10745330350353324,0.07786899107824143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07448992365952432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08130221874963603,0.1780726609456477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10630587566940633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988570266063546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10921187230976276,0.07774425560426346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838670479098022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1907765429160723,0.0,0.0,0.08134247780843276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984692244054701,0.13912629215387828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282525191409147,0.0,0.0,0.1504599637976968,0.0,0.15261980352995794,0.0,0.11067840969081462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616807021072675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13053386743067025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051793306873874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10772857358818808,0.0,0.16054062916267922,0.07937182623585153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1991405655541125,0.06877728661593749,0.09514286085593487,0.19518624793744346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089352535416478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14316042021926265,0.14440139126048668,0.07509990436840842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598232769626568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10544525091443048,0.0,0.06750603749226593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204876742212176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18634523368078415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237950752943615,0.0,0.09614389050958376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743475692668837,0.1949743144823955,0.0985464696787098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925930472975844,0.08250365543818496,0.0,0.0,0.10900087490912166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140801887698733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17021623400228308,0.0,0.11135428020386,0.1130573230465013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0773031246645801,0.05677886134450225,0.0,0.0,0.09304388094709244,0.1081847609675632,0.0,0.10591364250967823,0.0,0.10136851636032504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09026555893161972,0.08786380448375468,0.0,0.0,0.0938639021509214,0.0,0.2126656691190351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Zer0Byte1,2018/01/20,"Sister-In-Law drunk and driving We recently found out last month that my sister in-law was an alcoholic. She was caught at work. They took her to get a breathalyzer (willingly went) and she blew 3 times over the legal limit.

We had suspected it for a while now. Slurring speech and weird things going on. She was living alone in Florida.

She was given a warning at work with a promise that she would get treatment. So she talked to her doctor and got some drugs to help ween her off the alcohol. And she started going to AA meetings.

Yesterday (Friday) she called and said she was moving home to NY. Said she was fired. Found out they caught her drinking again.

About two hours into the trip she calls. Wife puts her on speaker phone and it's obvious she is drunk. slurred speech. does not know where she is. keeps saying 'hold on'. avoiding the questions about drinking. We made several attempts to get her to pull over. Then the phone calls stopped and she would not answer her phone.

This morning she finally answers. She is drunk again.

We seriously do not want her on the road. She denies drinking and will not listen. She is only halfway home to NY and should of been almost here.

Should I call the cops and report a suspected drunk driver. For her safety and others?

At a loss here.

alcoholism,PM_ME_4THROWAWAY,2018/01/20,"Concerned about substance abuse Clearly throwaway: I've been concerned about my substance use lately, and I'm just looking for some advice. 

I use cocaine frequently in conjunction with alcohol. Coke usually once a week, but about a quarter to third of a fifth of whiskey every night. I had a lot of issues in college with my drinking; essentially blacking out and doing awful things. I don't blackout so much anymore but I'm concerned I'm on track for those behaviors again, or worse. I sought therapy in college after an incident, and am considering it again. Any advice would be appreciated.",5.198301886792457,8.033683547169815,5.687396226415096,73.16656603773588,72.01886792452831,8.013584905660379,36.071698113207546,8.841846274778883,3.8053388679245286,480,27,72,10,10,154,75,106,0.102,0.838,0.06,-0.6652,0,0,4,0,1,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,5,1,7,4,0,2,1,16,13,7,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,6,4,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,2,6,0,17,9,3,13,0,0,2,0,0,5,0,3,8,53,9,2,0.0,0.2420626471953309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39928010581352696,0.0,0.2183350686199544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13893132404465675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2026111671454713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20013668070159146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17213195575032436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2132366097301811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304598266775069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17156093878553266,0.0,0.0,0.17368895209360186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15018435113971454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19172214958421607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217573330841514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23363539019280494,0.0,0.13572815298737434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529000180933769,0.22500810221907971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16387751226617106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2081996308338557,0.1451291908454301,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Kappa_rino,2018/01/21,"My dad is an alcoholic and he will never admit it. 1. He drinks beer everyday after work. When he doesnt have to go to work he drinks vodka and/or beer. He get's so drunk he cant stand up, and it is especially bad because he has serious health issues and alcoholism is only making it worse for him. 

He lost 100 euro this weekend just by drinking, and it is really a lot of money for my family. 

Is there a way for him to stop drinking? I don't know what to do. Our whole family tries and he just doesnt listen.

alcoholism,justalcoholasking,2018/01/21,"Drinking problem of my girlfriend I love my girlfriend (20ish year old, 2 years together) very much, but am not quite sure I can cope with her drinking anymore. Thing here is, she is not alcoholic by how most people would describe it - indeed, she can do months without alcohol. But once she starts to drink, she is nearly impossible to stop (not so much problem when I am around to stop her but I am not always), becomes gradually extremely mean person from person she usually is, and moreover she almost never passes out or vomits, so when I am not around, she gets extremely intoxicated and literally anything can happen (hospital visits, injuries including pretty serious ones, making out with another guy, beating her friend,...). And what is worse, she does not drink commonly, but when she does, even if she promises (be it to herself or me) that she will just take two glasses of wine or so, it is extremely likely alcohol will get stronger than her and she will get this intoxicated. 

True problem is, I think she fails to see quite how much of issue it is. Always after something bad happens, she stops for some time, but then starts partying again. 

So what is your advice guys? My not very educated opinion is that only way she can beat this is stop drinking completely, do you think I am right? Do there exist people that are not alcoholics by definition, but always when they dirnk they can not manage, so for their own good they should not drink? If she does not become abstinent, do you think I am wasting time with her and it will become only worse?",8.392564102564101,7.976004503496505,8.060685314685315,71.2312843822844,61.657342657342646,10.983310023310022,35.84988344988345,10.355215969177356,3.689590023310025,1232,48,212,24,15,393,149,286,0.14800000000000002,0.777,0.075,-0.9722,0,0,12,0,0,0,46.0,0,3,4,5,18,13,0,0,0,0,34,15,0,3,3,59,49,28,0,7,24,0,0,1,3,6,7,0,0,4,13,12,11,4,4,7,0,2,13,6,0,2,0,1,41,7,24,42,6,31,0,1,1,1,38,6,0,9,23,165,54,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576181314613778,0.0,0.331425692013003,0.07763550001446297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19353452001028934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08129738823016414,0.0,0.0,0.07688932738244154,0.0,0.0,0.063800916187565,0.13803699330182204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473464860278735,0.0,0.2568787187394802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08128915315208161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2035421361136517,0.0,0.0,0.4557016766795855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0512081004058832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0598997975395082,0.0,0.12151930787722205,0.0,0.0,0.06502882417870462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15353457785752175,0.13711975980378782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08092159838205781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037877439012698584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997421628551727,0.0,0.051752146471553656,0.0,0.0,0.08445333839433239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061884028512299516,0.0,0.17098130234169345,0.0,0.059796226894651874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135511661571446,0.08256734957136028,0.05253660801761138,0.11793073126317025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749963980898093,0.13539311596472778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07887629319792593,0.0,0.2225583767574091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16492625538109892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06621054110038206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06178169381591369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059686692524577124,0.0,0.0,0.10975283750419952,0.0,0.0,0.2592755561409299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730714879079261,0.0,0.05829321476896127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05150775516024463,0.14903505636026407,0.0,0.0,0.09041720370562938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573593876031634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538878621040209,0.12794140530821854,0.0,0.06154002567618265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473654244218908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15802020985935192,0.055075374298847145,0.0,0.0,0.09985407603626854
alcoholism,hovathatnova,2018/01/21,"Long standing, high functioning alcoholic. My story. I knew I loved alcohol from the first time I tasted it age 13. Split 200mls of vodka we bought between three of us.

We used to get drink by asking strangers outside a liquor store to buy it for us. We were always in our private school uniforms, always found someone who wouldn't mind buying for us.

15/16 I never wanted to mix spirits, always wanted them straight.

17/18 no alcohol, studied obsessively to get into top college instead.

19/20 first 2 years of college went out 3/4 times a week, always got too drunk. Grades above average but nothing special.

21, studied abroad. First time living alone. On nights where I wasn't drinking with gf/friends happily got drunk alone. No problem getting up to study in the mornings. Drinking every night. Excellent grades (first sign of high functioning)

22, final year of uni. Hang out with a group that probably partied too much. I study obsessively in spite of alcoholism/party drug use. Still drinking every night. Graduate with top GPA and accepted to big commercial firm.

23, working in great job making a good salary. Living at home to save up for a mortgage. Still drink every night. Alone or with company it doesn't matter.

On holidays - where I drink more than normal I start getting shakes from withdrawal and becoming irritable if I don't get a drink.

I've known I've had a problem with alcohol since I was 15 or so but don't know how to acknowledge &amp; move on.

How do I approach this issue. My problem hasn't affected my life or relationships but I know it will eventually affect my health and future.",3.556137647663072,6.501664796610173,4.016363636363638,82.18931176168468,79.0,6.965588084232153,27.58346173600411,8.101407402915765,2.2722429378531066,1285,55,217,25,33,403,181,295,0.14300000000000002,0.733,0.124,-0.4325,3,3,14,0,0,0,47.0,7,0,1,8,10,14,1,3,9,0,11,19,0,7,1,47,32,13,0,8,7,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,1,0,7,14,15,0,7,12,4,5,9,7,0,5,10,1,24,7,40,20,2,49,1,0,0,1,13,21,0,4,22,121,31,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30387960035801315,0.0,0.22087267275765704,0.0,0.0,0.2365988073686585,0.07702224412279968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06645632559418001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850950632595008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4874642728386969,0.08243782619334739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1796804457005283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787183770511072,0.0,0.24186472271905934,0.0,0.07794272978224437,0.05492128997988939,0.0,0.18569893444905194,0.0,0.0,0.0596240230597481,0.11370881124952115,0.07837316917559678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556167544933974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502136799440483,0.07130560282072816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419588634578939,0.07054242919885476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07813461446486017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05021053052149798,0.0,0.0,0.12554144697497086,0.06290935725265842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06415838419483155,0.0,0.047450822209728016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177714811123727,0.0,0.0,0.07555374963444565,0.052256791468304885,0.0,0.054826327498324966,0.0,0.0,0.26683963581151515,0.06964972309074638,0.06820945919229228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07664332099201086,0.20406067548533988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632034822704017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.071943380831807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588035263794581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06023140070422903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05031542394369596,0.0,0.11353961673896075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435341189456313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2565250906487088,0.12279190551291727,0.0,0.0,0.08385737458012306,0.0,0.05702134023851236,0.0,0.0,0.06589794138121638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05175185295209421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915548113838726
alcoholism,Gottaquestion11,2018/01/21,"Do you get drunker after eating? Probably barging into this sub, but I decided to do an experiment, because I rarely drink.  I've been having health issues, and I've been trying to figure out what's anxiety and what's bodily problems.  I know how I feel when drinking a fair bit, even if I don't drink often.  It's a distinct feeling.  It hits me very quickly, because I'm not a drinker.

I drink 3-4 times a year, it's just not my thing (even though I like it).  I'm more of a weed smoker when I want to feel open and creative.

Well, I drank 3 glasses of 13% wine and felt nothing in my body.  Was very weird.  It was like a low grade buzzed feeling, but none of it was in my body, all in my head.  I used to get a heavy, comfortable disassociative feeling, which I think is normal with drinking, where your body feels heavy and you feel somewhat distant from yourself.  I used to get face flushing every time, which I didn't get.

Until I ordered some wings I didn't get that feeling, then it hit me like a truck after two hours of drinking...once I finally ate.

Just curious if people with knowledge and experience know anything about food affecting their body after drinking.  I'm trying to figure out if I have kidney/liver/diabetes issues here, and I'm not sure why my body is reacting differently day-by-day.  It's a bit odd.",3.537339622641511,4.864330460377361,4.850707547169812,83.88511792452832,72.69811320754717,7.413207547169813,27.966981132075468,7.908726449838941,1.7294943396226414,1032,39,206,14,20,343,144,265,0.064,0.795,0.14,0.951,1,0,10,0,1,0,43.0,0,3,1,0,14,9,0,0,10,0,14,19,7,5,3,53,42,18,0,6,10,0,9,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,15,13,11,0,16,7,0,0,7,3,1,1,10,9,28,6,24,30,7,23,0,1,0,0,4,9,0,6,16,126,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438771374882228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06926247294933931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026151453885798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837776696806816,0.4674541875790262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085618229509073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793685926142905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4947111568303793,0.0,0.08612410628424795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111833459796246,0.0,0.07091453588800782,0.0,0.0,0.16466343642292486,0.0,0.0,0.3404599131054307,0.0,0.0808137565199047,0.0922011052689852,0.0,0.0,0.1017753694331852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2198695639919607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637987790102067,0.08946584795889867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08288778431265911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17569747752453052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09251223581889786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12335959662215372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08246603187873804,0.08076074371256743,0.0,0.0,0.08963537136947257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05835097157887247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09074652808001264,0.08053668855627573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07932663442812961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05591697912267542,0.05393097349526748,0.08269389305500371,0.0,0.0981571974202565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428807196084086,0.0,0.0822191705563881,0.0,0.0,0.1453869555416019,0.0,0.1388935873304604,0.049644023109622966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756764633324708,0.0,0.07594784923986335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05420094767926936
alcoholism,bearsrbig,2018/01/22,"Rehab options for friend with no insurance? My friend had admitted to being an alcoholic and has sought treatment. However he’s only been able to go to a couple days in a rehab facility and few sessions because it’s expensive and he can’t afford it.  

He said he’s like to go back, but needs an in-patient program since just the individual sessions didn’t help... basically he doesn’t trust himself (which has shown to be valid).  

I don’t have money to help fund his rehab, but was wondering if there’s any way to find funding for this via government grants.  Or would my insurance be able to pay for it?  I’m willing to do the work and try to figure out a way to get him there, I’m just a little lost how to do this.

alcoholism,[deleted],2018/01/23,"Is this alcoholism? My girlfriend doesn't drink every day. She goes out to clubs/bars every other weekend on average.

However when she goes out, she will drink herself from buzzed, to blacked out, to unconscious. Every time. 

She has seen this type of drinking in her parents and older sister.

She is only 21.

I don't really understand it... She says ""I don't go out that often though"" which is true. 

I'm a bouncer where she drinks and can see how much she drinks while I'm completely sober. Last Friday it was about 15 mixed drinks and tequila shots within an hour and a half.

alcoholism,empathicc,2018/01/23,"Guilt of loving an alcoholic Two months ago I started dating this guy. He's a wonderful person, very sweet and goofy like me.
He revealed early on that he was an alcoholic but he didn't elaborate. I looked past it. I escaped an abusive relationship last year so it felt great to feel appreciated by a guy for the first time in years!
It became apparent that his drinking was worse than he said. Slowly I learned all the info: he's been drinking for 10 years now, his longest sobriety is 6 months. He has ""wet brain"" for sure.
He tells me he loves me and wants a family with me already. Asked me to move in. Tried to adopt a dog with me. I keep politely declining him because it's so early and he ALSO: 
· tells me he doesn't feel like he is healthy enough to live much longer
· went on a week-long binge of not working, just drinking, and told me he was seriously contemplating suicide
· has a victim of the world attitude
· Punched a wall in front of me several times
· Has said some pretty questionable things in regards to his sanity, like always thinks every number ever is a code from the Universe.
He spent last week sober but relapsed again this weekend. I made a promise to myself that I would sit him down and tell him why I can't take a future with him seriously. I told him that his promises to me aren't real because he can't take care of himself so he definitely can't care for me if I need it. I told him he needed to clean up his own life because I don't have the energy and mental strength to carry him, since I'm riding the waves of PTSD. I told him that he is wonderful and very loved but I cannot silently enable his poor behavior.
This morning I woke up feeling extremely guilty. 

Did I do the right thing?

alcoholism,TangyTemper,2018/01/24,"My mother is an alcoholic. My mom has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember, but in the past couple years it has just gotten worse. She's always been the typical good mom, but after 5pm she turns into a full blown alcoholic mess. Her boyfriend is in and out of rehab also. She tried AA but gave up after a few months and was back to her old self. She gets crazy, loud, insulting, immature, and very defensive when she is drunk. It is like dealing with a toddler with a bad attitude. Every single night she passes out on the couch. I have to give her her nightly medication and a glass of water and put her to bed while she stumbles and incoherently babbles. I am a college student so it is difficult to balance my mother and my schoolwork every night. I live with just my mom and my sister who has completely given up on her. Any time we try to make the tiniest comment about her drinking she FREAKS out and screams at us and/or starts crying and goes in her bedroom and slams the door. I cannot even begin to explain how defensive she gets when her drinking is mentioned. She is going to die early or get very sick if she does not put in effort to stop her addiction, but she just does not care. I do not talk to anyone about this, as I typically would confide in my mother when I have a big problem, but I obviously cannot talk to her about it. It feels nice to finally say all of this for the first time.

alcoholism,alreetlike,2018/01/25,"My dad is dying of liver failure He was taken into hospital a couple of days ago. His liver had failed, his kidneys have failed as a result, the doctors are concerned about internal bleeding. He's on dialysis but if he goes into cardiac arrest or needs a ventilator he will most likely not make it. 

I went to see him, he was asleep but struggling to breathe, highish HR of 119 and very yellow. 

I went straight to the pub and drank several ciders. I can't be like that, I just can't. At this stage I want him to die because no one else in the world is as much like him as me. I almost feel like I need him to die for me to stop and move on. Am I awful? I feel it.

Long time lurker, first time poster. I wanted to run my feelings by you guys to see what you think might be happening. 

Life seems to go along normally for me when I'm sober, however when I drink I start to think and believe that life is a simulation, family and friends are out to get me and other paranoia related stuff etc. But when I'm sober something also keeps dragging me to drinking again, and I'm not sure it this is alcoholism or an undiagnosed mental condition.

alcoholism,GuiltyBreakfast,2018/01/25,"My brother is ruining his life with drink, is he an alcoholic? Hello, would anyone be able to please offer some advice with regards to my brother’s drinking? Honestly, I do not know the right terminology but I think it would be fair to describe him as a problem drinker/alcohol abuser rather than an alcoholic (?). He can go stretches (a month or so) only drinking ‘socially’ - although I do not really know the extent of how much he drinks with friends. He is well-functioning during these times. 
Then, when triggered by a life stressor (eg family argument or work issue), he will go on a bender and cause a lot of damage. When he drinks heavily, he goes into a very angry and delusional state and this has caused him to lose jobs and relationships, get restraining orders etc. He also loses control over things like rent, hygiene/sanitation, car maintenance. What is most damaging for his reputation is that he will drunkenly send incredibly rage-fuelled, abusive messages to his entire circle of contacts, including extended family and all professional contacts. He has an enormous amount of resentment and anger towards my parents, and when drinking, is also very confrontational face-to-face, with (incoherent) threats of violence and self-harm. He can be very manipulative regarding getting more drink during these times. He was previously (as a teenager) a cannabis user with a history of cannabis-induced psychosis and to me it is as if when he drinks heavily it ‘flips a switch’ back into a near-psychotic state of mind. 

TL;DR my brother is capable of drinking ‘socially’ but has ~monthly drinking benders where he becomes completely irrational and delusional. He is slowly wrecking his future opportunities by destroying relationships. I am the only family member around at present and would appreciate any advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation and I suppose some input on whether this constitutes ‘alcoholism’ as such.

alcoholism,aldusfinkster69,2018/01/26,"I relapsed last night. If anyone could provide a little support or input I would appreciate it beyond belief. I relapsed. Been around 9 months or more since I drank except for one other day two weeks ago. I know how dumb that sounds but didn’t know how to word it.

I drank a six pack of Miller lite tall boys and basically I small glass of fireball. 

I’ve had anxiety issues for a long time.

Right now I am having a massive panic attack waiting for my Ativan to kick in. I take 1mg or less, usually less, per day.

I know I’m ok but being hungover and feeling guilty about what I did is killing me right now.

I want to seek more serious help next week. I haven’t had a real issue not drinking . I don’t know why I even drank last night. 

I really just need to know everything is fine. I know I literally can’t be going through DTs and I don’t have any crazy symptoms. I’m just have an insane anxiety attack thinking I may have to go back to the hospital which I did like 9 months ago. I drank regularly back then.

Sorry for this rant and thank you for any help and advice anyone can provide. Also, please, I know I still have a problem. But I just need to get through this right now. I went back to my doctor this Monday to discuss getting into a psych and substance help.

I’m pacing around my apartment trying not to completely freak out.

I know this is pathetic but I really think I need reassurance that I’m not going to die which I know full well I’m not but this is just what happens when I’m hungover. Been this way for a long time.

Again, thank you

Edit: thank you so much to the few that responded. I’m still have major issues but every little bit helps. Thank you for restoring a bit of my faith in mankind. I know that seems dramatic. Sorry :) I hope all of you are doing well",1.0224523889074533,3.3480005616438366,2.753184096224522,91.17984630805212,84.4794520547945,5.4239893083862345,19.86134313397929,6.807656815369643,0.32009054460407604,1395,40,292,17,41,460,184,365,0.131,0.6759999999999999,0.193,0.97,0,0,1,0,0,0,36.0,0,5,0,0,25,21,4,1,12,1,30,7,0,2,1,59,74,22,2,9,19,0,1,1,0,2,2,1,0,1,17,10,5,1,15,1,0,4,9,8,2,3,12,2,42,13,34,57,11,51,2,0,0,0,13,16,1,7,31,188,59,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752658241431532,0.1365521940662963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06159513431209721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10475633973513447,0.0,0.11784451780288525,0.0,0.0,0.10771231593577436,0.0,0.0,0.13713330808311305,0.0,0.17524919119722035,0.0,0.17767742019367108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16817797686483305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807569783749602,0.0,0.0,0.06149646733096944,0.0,0.0,0.09934671486674644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07993754367766548,0.0,0.0,0.07883613662681165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075453056613421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05087285691565605,0.0,0.06489506149836342,0.0,0.06922315874973542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03894506027931412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08048250586824778,0.0,0.1313215584783651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811103971360948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065071342350107,0.0,0.0,0.07650105553931763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2411754896147437,0.0,0.0,0.08521435641496625,0.0,0.4232973647532345,0.12556778327027288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037629467212244465,0.15439423307155875,0.0,0.1363255726069845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12295778608920632,0.0,0.0566206469961939,0.17133437135341356,0.0,0.0,0.08191466014434208,0.14456142827904506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05219266720166783,0.0,0.0,0.09036970282836526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454794466591015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370045211870142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08766885008388238,0.09868560235325118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19733124390536394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011869733582883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06371408606825962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17244151843234798,0.0,0.0,0.12302107302854615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740460180119475,0.0,0.08005621836875021,0.05791158724087859,0.0,0.0,0.28364911705487955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987062468312323,0.0,0.0,0.08982527042346118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05229344989397565,0.0,0.07524011914888001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482977241202762,0.0,0.04543006440616023,0.061137142287952514,0.12356614656883007,0.0,0.138505559697806,0.07140094085157891,0.06950112956916123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05471481297047984,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,willibeokintheend,2018/01/26,"I’ve come to the conclusion I’m an alcoholic Today I fucked up by starting my morning with my usual Natty Daddy. After working an hour I asked for a sick day. Bought a fifth of vodka on the way home. Drank 3/4 and blacked out before noon. Woke in piss on the couch.

I usually drink at least 2 natty daddy’s a day. It doesn’t seem like much, but I’m miserable without it. I drink what I buy, so I try to manage my habits by “trying to” buy one at a time. Things always go wrong if I break that rule, like today.

I’m hardly ever drunk, and never hung over. Work and sleep is when I need it most. I’m always dehydrated and sleep deprived. Dark rings under my eyes and no color to my skin is raising eyebrows at work.

TLDR; drinking a minimum of 2 natty daddy’s a day up to consuming fifths lasting 2 Days, am I endangering myself by quitting cold turkey? Or is it hard to say and differs that much from person to person.

Edit: would like to add I’ve got an enlarged heart from drug abuse and my liver probably isn’t the greatest from binging on robitussin 3 months straight (two ER visits) and taking a good number of Tylenol PM’s and benedryl’s to make my pulse explode my fingertips while I was in rehab.",3.458333333333332,4.573701906504064,4.945691056910572,83.94626016260165,72.6178861788618,7.255284552845527,25.861788617886177,7.594959193182576,1.357993495934959,943,30,188,11,18,317,152,246,0.129,0.784,0.087,-0.8881,0,0,6,0,1,0,26.0,0,0,0,5,3,9,2,1,14,0,8,18,7,1,2,25,25,15,0,3,4,0,3,3,0,1,5,2,2,2,8,13,6,0,2,5,3,3,5,5,1,2,5,9,19,4,35,19,5,38,0,2,3,1,5,14,2,4,22,109,27,5,0.0,0.13690027451384248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12348097146087453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1922830657006679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080176706093017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09831909509453524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995305821739952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980642583674131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071847186450722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3395662260880902,0.13399389562819444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10451580298479264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10681819818349456,0.0,0.0,0.0656660917072232,0.0969124914097464,0.0924107736104033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070087445912224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13691972466421062,0.0,0.0,0.1158996536329966,0.0,0.11378717346171995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09418345701087116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16934630278045731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712625153082213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922258007482582,0.0,0.1698756841415458,0.08567411681872664,0.08911434888224412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829533499194509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2017764330447079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12457554532691525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228948432462706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09188490987319374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051865557262054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312540923702295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178235617940176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08687440910846861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07676203502903264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737440349017278,0.0,0.2190436490319977,0.0,0.0,0.15689304252312608,0.0,0.11286930999010485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25450990740239177,0.0,0.0,0.09171313313783842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137990912335567,0.0,0.25235135507205464,0.0,0.0,0.08207885973699477,0.12632879042399536,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,MammalFish,2018/01/27,"I think my drinking is becoming problematic--what should I do? Hi everyone! I appreciate that this space is here and hope that this is an appropriate place to post.

I'm a cocktail bartender, and I think that just about every one of my coworkers has a drinking problem. For the longest time I didn't think my drinking was problematic, but it is starting to be.

I do not crave alcohol or binge on my own, and I plan to stay that way. My issue is with social drinking, and that because my life is suffused with free alcohol when I DO start drinking (about once a week), I often over do it. Not to the point of blackout, but to the point of impairment and hangover the next day.

Last night, though, I drove home. I really shouldn't have. Nothing happened, but I don't want to give myself a pass on this. If I ever do that again I could end up killing someone. I want to take this seriously.

Maybe this is an unpopular opinion and I'd like to hear from people, but I don't believe that my relationship with alcohol is problematic enough that I need to quit entirely. However, I do think I need to fundamentally change the way I think about drinking, to the point that EVERY time I consider having another drink, I stop and assess the decision carefully. I never want to be hungover, and I certainly don't want to drive drunk like that again. I've had month-long stints of sobriety that were lovely, and typically I can maintain a level of carefulness (mindful, restrained drinking) for a few weeks at a time, and then I end up forgetting to be careful and overdoing it again.

Does anyone have advice for me? Anything is appreciated. (And if the majority opinion here is ""The only option is sobriety,"" then of course that's interesting and I want to hear that too. I'm not averse to the idea that healthy, careful drinking is not possible. But I'd like to know if it is.)

alcoholism,Nc068740,2018/01/27,"Is it alcoholism, or just his personality? My boyfriend/father of my son is an alcoholic. I didn't realise how bad it was until I was pregnant, at risk of pre-term labour, and he still couldn't miss a night of drinking in case I needed to get to the hospital. It was my first big red flag that something was very wrong. 

Once I realised the role alcohol truly played in his life, I began to notice certain patterns of behaviour. Typical of an alcoholic I think, like lying, denial, playing victim. But over time I began to notice these same patterns in almost every aspect of his life. He's cheated on me throughout most of our relationship (I found out while I was pregnant) with multiple women. He wanted to sell drugs, but I obviously put a stop to it because we have a baby, that just couldn't happen. But tonight I found out he has been selling drugs behind my back. He lies about where he is going, how much he is drinking, who he is with, and what he is doing... Then when he gets caught has a million reasons why it's not his fault.

I was holding out for him to get help, but it's becoming clear that he isn't ready to take that step yet, he just says he is going to to keep me off his back. So now I'm wondering, is it worth it to keep waiting? Will he one day get help for his alcoholism and change for the better? Or is his alcoholism just one aspect of a selfish, dishonest personality? I want to kept our family together. Our son deserves a normal life with a sober father who he can trust. I just don't know if that's a realistic future I should keep holding out for.",4.844684542586752,5.239796583596217,5.965001577287067,80.52706072555208,68.96845425867508,8.863659305993691,29.41466876971609,8.841846274778883,2.1970442902208203,1235,43,248,20,20,413,167,317,0.086,0.7959999999999999,0.117,0.7865,0,0,11,0,0,0,41.0,4,0,0,2,16,14,2,1,13,0,28,13,0,3,3,53,54,17,0,8,13,3,0,1,0,2,11,1,0,3,17,11,8,8,6,4,3,5,6,8,0,4,14,2,33,6,41,36,3,36,0,1,1,0,40,13,0,6,19,167,50,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6050557267547303,0.09448835745132844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451147186234223,0.07878703190585255,0.05752125274173455,0.10421370031911326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08345414735635298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09982084130311268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06085468214673065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18487462955842307,0.21885632239755864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07950274643046741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08895463167905497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08026294811536143,0.0,0.20692271964766154,0.0,0.0,0.1971977561433784,0.0,0.10725443327016547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08344263175716614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264956373420078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2516157030000518,0.0,0.0,0.05185803399771825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19994872311029369,0.046099748132053225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936578588466137,0.06996707590185168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855088746918714,0.09245320355668953,0.0,0.21485998892361932,0.0,0.10049079658988587,0.1278821620707953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478380554438493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09485831188496634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701825534860327,0.0,0.10130780679427336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07503921490005151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264328222654763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535637495958898,0.07888955897260998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07094731293094733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06046236440599175,0.0,0.0,0.05502233554170137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07785725109863496,0.11131247301133523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514562669622298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232987975336602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316833597347104,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,InternetIsWow,2018/01/27,"Poem I Wrote People often say to live life day by day
To take it in stride

I live this way, anway
Because I’ve torn so many memories out of my brain

How many experiences of mine, that I can’t share
Even though I was surrounded by people

College blackouts were normal and fine
But forgetting Tuesday’s dinner is progress

To snap a quick line, an impulsive lie
When asked have you been been drinking?

I thought I was holding it together? Acting fine?
No, why?

Oh you just seem a bit off
Yeah I’m off, off the fucking rails

Careening down a path that I see clearly
But the breaks are cut

So when I end up in jail, in the hospital or at your wake
I’ll remember writing this in shame and regret

All alcohol is doing is taking and taking
Your life, your energy, your relationships and your finances 

A brief high
But the more you down the more down you feel

It’s time to take recovery for real
Before you fulfill your destiny

Remember what it is like to remember
Day after day, her

alcoholism,rearrangerranger,2018/01/27,"Advice on how to help brother Hi all, kind of at a loss of how to best approach this. My brother has been struggling with alcohol for a bit, and doing horribly the last month. In and out of the hospital, can’t stop drinking, destroying his life. I’ve just arrived in the UK to try to help him, but am at a loss of what is the “best” thing to do. I want to get him into rehab. I’ve discussed it with him before on the phone, and he was against it.

alcoholism,Ihatealexjones,2018/01/27,"Am I experiencing alcohol withdrawal?? So long story short, I've been a regular drinker for a number of years.  Started binge drinking in college and slowly declined that habbit over the years.  For a while, I would only drink a few beers each week and nothing more.  Over the last few months, I've been drinking almost everyday, but nothing really too crazy (2 drinks at the most each day).  I've noticed now that whenever I take a day off from drinking, the next day I feel strange.  I feel disconnected and disoriented at times and notice increased anxiety throughout my day.  I also notice a heightened sensitivity to light and noise and crowded places make me quite uncomfortable.  I'm also noticeably more tired.  I feel much noticeably derealized for those of you who are familiar with that feeling.  

I'm wondering if these are acute symptoms of alcohol withdrawal?   I'm certainly not a heavy drinker, but perhaps even the habbit of drinking everyday to get a buzz has developed a dependence within my body?  

Any advice from you guys?

alcoholism,nameless33395,2018/01/28,"I am basicly an anti-alcoholic, but I selfharm. If I started drinking one shot every morning (as new method of selfharm), could I get end up addicted? I probably haven't drunk any alcohol for idk 3+ years, and the most I've ever drunk in one night was like 3 beers. I view alcohol as unhealthy and therefore don't drink. But I like to selfharm (cutting myself etc.) in order to punish myself. It feels like drinking might be a good punishment, because it goes against my principels, but I don't want do end up addicted.

 So that's why I have the question whether one shot of idk vodka, tequila or what ever (I really have no clue about different types of alchohol) every morning, monday to friday could cause an addiction? Would it even have any noticable effect?

alcoholism,Gjab,2018/01/28,"I've accepted that I have a problem, I'm just not ready to change yet. Hi, I'm 23Y old college student, there hasn't been a night I've been sober in the last 2-3 weeks. And besides that, 3-4 days out of the week for about 2 years. When I was 17 years old I ended up in the hospital with a coma because I drank to much.

Either I drink with the fraternity, or alone at home. I don't stop until I'm drunk. In the fraternity it's because I'm more comfortable drunk, When I'm home alone it's to deal with my depression which I've had for some 5-ish years now,

Some friends have pointed out that I drink more than them. And I've come to accept that I have a drinking problem.

But, I don't want to change yet. If I'm an alcoholic, I'm a high functioning one. I get my work done, my school work done, and I'm able to maintain good relationships with my friends, pay the rent, buy groceries and cook food. Beer in the fraternity is cheap, and the booze I have at home is even cheaper. So moneywise I've never had a problem.

I know I have a problem. And I'm okay with that. The only one I'm hurting is my own liver.

I just wanted to get this of my chest, an official statement of me accepting that I drink too much.",1.4596454896454922,2.9124798803088865,3.3071551421551426,92.32043085293087,78.38223938223938,6.716812916812918,23.74183924183925,7.520522993642371,0.8267976833976838,935,31,221,13,22,314,127,259,0.125,0.779,0.096,-0.6061,1,2,6,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,1,2,12,14,0,0,18,1,18,15,2,0,1,36,35,13,0,7,7,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,4,0,10,14,12,1,5,8,4,1,5,6,0,2,8,0,23,8,29,27,8,31,0,2,0,0,6,11,0,4,19,130,33,9,0.10383764948014594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109708682485752,0.0,0.21508897812970548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659693467375874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21969292953804204,0.0894469406133079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06696669364028268,0.10705205711814232,0.08943521534245141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21252393416011253,0.0,0.4068854603380683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196933679217688,0.0,0.0,0.06858378816544043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12556089792340286,0.0,0.1604494208158685,0.0,0.10850177222488584,0.0,0.0,0.08709409384003544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971017775833446,0.3124728864990664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111603513898448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057066456565152426,0.0846415433527778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526652401619723,0.0,0.08008599666712599,0.0,0.0,0.09744459988183146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21792029151332587,0.0,0.14072615725447524,0.07897321153334093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816014205315196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3974344278864857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11148277538617507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050892449014372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868129245075616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249227200824005,0.0,0.1665845980450205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15119009104396555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006041254424396

alcoholism,Burnz5150,2018/01/28,"I quit drinking last July and drank after New Years and this weekend. I feel intense headache hang overs the next day, even if it’s one beer. Is this normal? I can have just one beer, or even half of a beer, and I can feel it all the next day, like that sort of out of body feeling. It hurts. After this weekend, I’m wondering if I can even enjoy alcohol anymore. I mean, if this is how it’s going to feel, I’m just gonna not drink anymore. What I’d like to know though, is if this is because the last two times I quit for extended periods, I went through minor withdrawals? Is this what happens when you drink again? Your body absolutely rejects it? I couldn’t even enjoy my buzz while I was drinking.

alcoholism,dietcinni,2018/01/28,"I'm 23 and no one believes I'm an alcoholic I drink heavily any chance I get, if I'm depressed I run to the nearest liquor store. I've drank at work, I drink as soon as my daughter is asleep and I drink instead of telling my husband I'm not okay. No one takes this issue seriously because I'm in my 20's, and that's just ""something kids do"". I don't know what to do. I've been to one AA meeting where I was dismissed for being overdramatic. 

I have MDD and PTSD from an entire childhood of abuse ranging from emotional to sexual. Medication never worked therapy is hit and miss. I can't afford therapy but I know I spend too much on alcohol. What can I do to beat this... I don't want this to be my life...

TL;DR people dismiss my alcoholism because I'm only 23 and I want to get better.",1.1788253012048209,3.0957745180722926,3.6682981927710863,87.2417243975904,80.92771084337348,6.800602409638555,25.435240963855424,7.8658589789855275,1.4950012048192771,614,25,132,11,16,214,98,166,0.08800000000000001,0.858,0.055,-0.2275,1,0,7,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,4,5,5,0,0,3,1,14,11,1,0,1,15,30,10,0,3,4,2,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,6,6,8,0,2,4,2,1,7,3,1,3,3,1,19,2,17,24,1,9,0,2,0,0,5,5,0,1,3,80,25,2,0.0,0.16825513285549368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4552870474231392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656966349731902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1731323589999207,0.0,0.0,0.15999331609166875,0.0,0.12559369547291854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12231046391294728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173385384841811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15973881740540258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483856447976096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14821846540765551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15608672153638334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030377892538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14305716278019762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10439152114798568,0.0,0.10952459126732214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886829563596618,0.10800276046021187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984498079804098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1659986419200765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10932396477740504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10677162845871364,0.0,0.1241204207445385,0.0,0.3247948749805604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675188745027525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20676564710915016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Shepflexxy,2018/01/28,"My father My father's been an alcoholic for the majority of his life. It's been a constant in my home, growing up and it's becoming a bigger and bigger issue as of late and im not sure what to do. 

Without getting into details, my mother just got out of the hospital and I can't leave my home because of my father. I cannot pursue a life or maintain a job because of the unyielding fear that something will happen without me present to care for my mother. This isnt new as well, and I've the accepted that I have to stay until she passes, but it's getting more and more difficult to keep peace. The fights have been constant. The gaslighting and one sided power struggle is becoming increasingly draining. I just want some advice on how to keep myself above water and keep my mother stable. I'm on mobile and don't want to write out the entire schpeal in one post, but if I'm asked I'll provide details. 

The bastard broke my mother's heart. At the peak of a fight, when confronted about his drinking, and it being explained to him that if I'm removed from our home, my mother wishes to be placed in a home because she cannot trust in him or his care.

He didn't even hesitate. That's how much of a threat I am to his masculinity and his lifestyle.

alcoholism,orangeman3199,2018/01/28,"How I stopped drinking Recently I have been prescribed Adderall for ADHD symptoms and since than I haven't drank at all and the desire to drink is pretty much gone. I know getting prescribed a strong stimulant can lead to other forms of abuse, but I went from drinking at least 10 drinks throughout the day to literally zero. This won't work for everybody, but I suggest exploring the option since it has had such a profound effect for me.

alcoholism,JonWo,2018/01/29,"Been Drinking heavily/daily for 2 months - trying to work out a taper schedule Hi,

After a few traumatic events in my life early December 2017, I've gone from being a weekend binge drinker, to full blown alcoholic.. again.

I had a similar period at this exact time last year and was able to get signed off work for a couple of months, got in touch with a substance abuse centre, tapered down and then went onto Naltrexone for a few months.

However, my drinking has now become worse than ever.

Previously (last year) I would drink 8-10 cans of 4% lager mid-afternoon/late evening and then sleep it off. Now I'm doing 10-14 cans of 5% lager each night, sometimes drinking early in the morning and don't know how to stop.

I can't afford time off work, but I've got a few vacations days planned for this week, so need to develop a taper plan asap. I reckon going for 10-14, to 6, then 4, 2 ,1 by Friday might be workable, got a couple of Librium tablets from last year left over as well.

I know people will tell me to get inpatient treatment, but that's just not possible atm, so I need some practical advice.

Got some gatorade and rehydration sachets, as well as some thiamine tablets, not sure what else to do...

alcoholism,ivzoso,2018/01/29,"My father and me My father is a recovering alcoholic. I honestly don’t remember a time my dad was “sober”, from what I’m told my dad has been struggling before I was born (22f... I also have an older sister she’s 27)
I always kinda knew that I have to be careful with drinking cause it runs in my genes.
I have major depression and anxiety, I used to self harm and got addicted to NyQuil when I was a freshman in college. Sometimes I get unbelievable urges to self harm even when I’m not depressed. So I know I can easily get addicted and stuff.
Recently I’ve been noticing I see alcohol in a new way. Like I kinda always want to grab for it when I feel shitty, or just to put myself to sleep.
I rarely drink but when I do, I feel like I kinda can’t stop. I like myself better when I’m drinking. But I know when to stop, and I do but I don’t want to. I only stop because I don’t want to deal with hangovers and etc.
I don’t know why I’m writing this in this thread, like I don’t know what I’m looking for. I guess I’m just scared.

alcoholism,SanarySurMer,2018/01/29,"Is a 40oz almost every night doing damage? I was never really a big drinker, I've always just been smokin' fat as shit for a long time (weed, TB). To be honest I've been trying to stop smoking Tobacco as much to the point where I stop completely so I guess me drinking quite a bit more now defeats the purpose a lil cause I'm still doing some damage but whatever it definitely does less in small amounts than tobacco.
An it's also money you know, shit gets low, always been low I guess, but 40s are fuckin cheap and they warm you up on those freezing ass 3 am nights.

It's the norm around here sure, but you never know, I just don't want to wake up one day close af to my death bed. I might not give a fuck about my body compared to the bougie ass people out there, but I still wanna live. I just wanna enjoy it as much as I can...

It takes me a bit to drink one definitely, like 20-30 min (i'm a small boi), but it's definitely been getting easier and easier, so I just wanna know how many 40s are enough 40s...

So y'all tell me please... I'm hella fuckin' light too, like 55 kg (120lbs) so that probably doesn't help my case...",2.7708413998510792,3.5867363248945128,4.23608835939439,89.52268056589728,73.9367088607595,7.433010672623483,21.114172251178953,7.724431198458867,0.5387073219161085,867,17,199,11,17,289,144,237,0.163,0.6829999999999999,0.154,0.1817,0,0,5,0,0,2,37.0,0,4,1,2,19,16,5,0,13,0,16,12,7,2,3,34,30,17,1,4,10,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,8,5,3,2,3,2,2,0,5,10,0,2,5,3,21,6,23,23,9,27,0,5,0,5,8,14,7,5,15,116,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125336893929761,0.0,0.0,0.10009618338131812,0.2082983137160872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114253658740558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.273300379988866,0.13903256833619967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12858121739455364,0.0,0.0,0.13123545239438786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807225043072951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10953468073909983,0.0,0.0,0.2452324546672724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933120114467458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10545878418526876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157150811733466,0.1307894163450822,0.12007180610624756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2757716162430656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838969514751039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063658978279732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12230076588625508,0.0,0.11052495148725766,0.1107690539815247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268999188184574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13278264408144472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840246223405608,0.0,0.19307335809774384,0.0,0.0,0.2349219203186746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16963309994283776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08677519272572276,0.0,0.0,0.13739602435009826,0.11832348379409725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13495143697289352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331307492904827,0.0,0.0,0.08018532844003258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25696471236592155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19991741268455104,0.2092908068638805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11796862682019656,0.0,0.09411017479066874,0.0,0.10940167027495194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07298601456915246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08498032853872894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738268713691401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Incredadex,2018/01/30,"Wet brain symptoms question A very close friend of mine is displaying some of the symptoms of wet brain,we are planning to take him to a doctor to confirm our suspicion. 

Are the symptoms of wet brain only when they are drunk or also when they are sober?

Most things I read around the topic seems to not clarify this

I just want to make sure I'm as well informed as I can be.

Any help around this would be greatly appreciated.",5.978214285714286,6.167447059523809,5.852476190476192,83.02585714285719,66.5,8.624761904761906,31.08571428571429,8.238735603445708,2.0611028571428576,339,12,68,4,5,106,56,84,0.056,0.7709999999999999,0.173,0.8581,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,1,0,2,1,7,4,0,0,5,0,9,7,2,1,1,15,14,6,0,2,3,0,3,0,1,1,4,0,0,0,3,3,1,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,8,4,13,11,2,5,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,5,2,47,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171080506445673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200188128667234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29323644814638633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.55158015852415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16857778035966625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12724707670766966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1815827099757138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11039516840661064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993875809862062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252620327918341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1845020779851844,0.0,0.16474491359203675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14993700686450445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15522812444951328,0.5135601580964404,0.12383416098109867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10941958973388093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13589503207088474,0.09714452974072513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14808538837878926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699839842508022,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,PuppyBreath,2018/01/30,"Severe recoil anybody? I've been sober for about six months. I've noticed almost a Pavlovian response to seeing someone take a drink of hard liquor on TV (rewatching Sopranos). I have had someone take a shot near me but I didn't get the same response. 

When I see it on television my stomach churns and I feel nauseated. Is this normal? I have no idea because I haven't read the ""Big Book"" mainly because it's so spiritual. Nothing against that, but spirituality just doesn't work for me. 

Does anyone else have the same strange response?

alcoholism,Jenology,2018/01/31,"I'm looking for advice on how to support my dad's journey to sobriety Hi all! My dad has recently given up drinking...which is HUGE. I never thought this day would come. He drank a lot growing up but in the past few years it got really bad. When we were younger we tried to get him to quit, but we soon realized the will has to come from himself. 


His mom recently passed away and he took this opportunity to turn his life around. He's rather successful, he owns his own business, it's just the drinking that was holding him back.

I am concerned he may not have had the best intentions when he first stopped drinking. He had met a girl and ""fell in love"" very quickly (not the first time). His new girlfriend mentioned not wanting to date someone with a drinking problem, so he quit for her. But stated it was for his mom. Well, they ""broke up"" a few weeks after it started and I was scared since he quit for her the sobriety might not last, but he's doing so so good! 

He's been sober for about 2 months by now. I can't even begin to describe how proud of him I am. I've told him I'm proud but I really want to be more supportive. He's mentioned getting to a point where he can drink casually again, and even mentioned trying a drink at his year mark. I'm looking on advice on how to be supportive but maybe also let him know that might not be a great idea?

I've seen such a huge difference in his personality in the last few weeks, even though I live a few hours away from him. I would love advice on how to show I'm his number 1 supporter!

alcoholism,TheStickyMicky,2018/01/31,"What is the best advice you can give for alcoholism? I have struggled for three years to ""tame the beast"". I've willingly been trying to stop for two years without success. I did try to moderate, and succeeded for three months. I thought it would be OK after 3 months, but I've felt that I've been spiraling out of control. I've been drinking everyday, but I'm sober as I write this, as I'm just worried about myself.

It's hard as I'm a student, albeit in my final year. There are so many expectations for you to drink, and even strangers have challenged me. It's difficult being challenged whilst sober, as often you'll have to admit you're an alcoholic to stop. I feel this will continue until I'm not a student. It's just difficult as I feel the circumstances warrant addiction.

I just want to know that things will eventually be OK, or what to do. Those three months were the longest in three years that I've gone without alcohol. I feel it's a permanent coping mechanism now. Whenever I stop, I get alcohol withdrawal symptoms. I just don't know what to do to replace it, as I've tried to change my environment so much. Moved to another city, engaged in voluntary roles, widened my social network and friendship groups as well as seeking higher education. My environment is OK, just not my feelings due to trauma.",5.145208607817307,6.4967158023715434,5.842654808959158,78.20813680281074,68.84189723320159,9.574791392182696,33.02788757136583,9.861636050157227,3.340424857268335,1050,48,194,25,18,342,136,253,0.112,0.774,0.114,0.3435,0,0,6,0,0,0,33.0,0,3,0,6,13,14,0,1,8,3,23,8,0,1,0,34,40,17,0,3,12,0,6,0,0,5,6,0,0,0,16,4,6,4,9,2,0,2,5,4,1,5,8,6,21,10,36,24,2,24,0,0,0,0,9,4,0,2,18,130,37,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251804924628852,0.0,0.1122095098205833,0.0,0.490868854616668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12040815424261556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050588667909146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214737912658258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12879041874371724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2249772879907242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584343096836628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322438463206511,0.0,0.11025378863908243,0.12578948944308366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05999338102929565,0.11015438123221924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10286417428425863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621396323772505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11641852062670607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2749660897777281,0.12204498920414905,0.08441248225865806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11705364215437092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2880064031095195,0.0,0.1200441386611801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11935123442163505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07628724443726316,0.0,0.0,0.09116135073218648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23388393522150885,0.0,0.11217118771569476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772908310200833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032450062033244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22138199826202995,0.0,0.0,0.116614361078513,0.0,0.0815711833788634,0.0,0.0,0.2957842865773108
alcoholism,EducationalSupport,2018/02/01,"Relapse and new worries Hi, early last year due to a lot of personal problems I started daily drinking between 10-12 pints of lager a day starting about mid February 2017. I had an ultrasound done in May 2017 which showed a fatty liver, so I stopped drinking at the end of July and started eating right and exercising. I got a fibroscan done on the 26th of October 2017 by a Hepatologist and the reading was 3.9 Kpa and he said no damage, but Within the last 3 months I have had a couple of major traumas, which has sent me on a 8 week binge of 10-12 lagers a day (very irresponsible I know). Could this have caused me to develop cirrhosis in this time? I am trying to stop now. Thanks in advance for any help.",5.042907801418437,5.57984378723404,6.253333333333334,78.13333333333334,68.57446808510639,8.819858156028369,31.97872340425532,8.841846274778883,2.5905659574468074,558,23,108,9,9,188,97,141,0.14400000000000002,0.8029999999999999,0.053,-0.8672,1,0,2,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,3,4,0,0,13,0,11,5,1,1,0,14,19,7,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,4,5,3,2,1,5,0,2,1,3,0,0,8,1,9,1,20,9,2,29,0,1,0,0,6,9,0,2,18,67,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137632714059187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16824764490751185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13076536810588058,0.18121996069444507,0.0,0.21124969129922325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352085420715323,0.0,0.320884992292851,0.0,0.16758829551154675,0.0,0.0,0.1450608724293862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309901932210627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10977858809107782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000945602663991,0.2670058641451043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392402878336175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13072799834911852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15818018610661574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14300677788616428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1567157784690897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638247784785971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398676155341873,0.15579272010731568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34777395165559816,0.0,0.0,0.27385559157983463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15078704035536605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955017016580634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119617958068408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13513602963479088,0.0,0.0,0.1313748036495834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16632700433946562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546924465839867
alcoholism,SwampRat7,2018/02/01,"Am I suffering from withdrawals? I suffer from anxiety and boredom. This plus a fun college lifestyle has lead me to drinking. I have had thoughts over the past few months perhaps my drinking was getting out of control. I’d say 5-6 days per week. After work, I’d feel little anxious, playing video games and I’d have a beer or 2 sometimes more. I always look for beers with high ABV. I find that after 2 days I feel successful like oh I haven’t drank so I’m good and will drink the third day. This has been on going since the holidays. Anyway. I also take clonazaepam for anxiety and my anxiety felt better controlled a few weeks ago so I started a slow taper. In addition, I now have cut back the alcohol. My legs feel like restless, jello. It’s so uncomfortable it’s like akithesia. I’ve upped my clonazepam per my psychs Rec and it has helped a little. What do u all think? I never had shakes. Really just increased anxiety and this leg thing.

alcoholism,bqfm,2018/02/02,"Is quitting cold turkey dangerous? I’m 26 y/o female. I am a very heavy drinker, for around the past three years. A little wine before work and sometimes straight vodka after. I drink 6 days of the week, usually sometimes 7. I need to quit because it’s ruined my long term relationship last weekend- he left me and I worry my family so much. My question is, is it safe for me to just start going to aa without seeing a doctor. I moved provinces lately and don’t have a valid health care and can’t afford doctor expenses, so I was just wondering if anyone has done this and is it okay to just stop without going to get medical attention with as heavy as a problem I’ve been having. Thank you.",2.512909698996655,4.675746768115946,4.112318840579711,84.48647157190638,77.69565217391303,6.564994425863991,24.3835005574136,7.61054688173877,1.3667039018952063,546,19,103,8,13,182,99,138,0.103,0.8059999999999999,0.091,-0.3818,1,0,4,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,3,6,7,1,0,7,1,13,6,0,0,0,20,23,10,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,7,2,2,3,4,1,3,4,3,1,1,3,2,12,4,15,20,2,20,0,1,1,0,4,4,0,3,13,64,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10252324504656686,0.0,0.0,0.1305268726840348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938092160195903,0.0,0.12476663239721016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494934285551072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094560659144383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3001527349475843,0.0,0.15004774915488026,0.0,0.14363616909514426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13822450974660389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766052386805251,0.0,0.166660140985207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15585496492132933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11951852025768844,0.1653987990519561,0.0,0.15930792566975469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14695624779259722,0.0,0.1297580500899564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477087371178416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15583861698310605,0.10778586304183184,0.1087201934558065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13996965630337696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402998245272865,0.0,0.0,0.1642529732940281,0.3119063639891546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15741981798278035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11684072638819695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2900307182168152,0.0,0.1037815610508021,0.0,0.0,0.12258463002193902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349921208285952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614861488899483,0.12098055109884735,0.0,0.0,0.11761331296311513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2826815312868108,0.1590079931123853,0.1067443671477366,0.14890427595061154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442135733331647
alcoholism,throwaway3132314s,2018/02/03,"Heavy night drinker 57 hours into Cold Turkey So to begin I mostly drank due to boredom and nothing to do the next day.  Drank heavily 4-6 times a week on and off for a few years now.  I have gone 6 months sober cold turkey before ( 2 years ago) and never even thought about withdrawals.  But now that I feel that I had a mild withdrawal I am kind of freaking out about the 72 hour mark.  Looking for advice on this subject seems to be like most medical ordeals on the internet as in ""YOU ARE GOING TO DIE IN 2 MINUTES"" sort of thing.  I have read up on the risk and symptoms I have had:

Day 1: Bad Hangover - Depression - Moderately High BP

Day 2: Felt fine during the day and when night hit I had a little bit of the sweats and High BP with normal heart rate.  I measured my BP over the following hours and it dropped back down considerably to just mildly elevated.  I also took the [CIWA-Ar](https://www.mdcalc.com/ciwa-ar-alcohol-withdrawal#next-steps) test multiple times throughout the night and scored 9-10 or below.  I couldn't sleep after looking up symptoms but I managed to fall asleep around 6 am and slept for 6 hours no problem.

Day 3: 48 hours in started at 6 am this morning, My head feels cloudy but i am alert.  Some acid reflux(usually get it anyway) very slight tremors in my left hand.  My Blood pressure is slightly elevated.  And a little anxiety due to the following question:

Is there a strong possibility I could go straight into full blown Seizures and DTs at the 72 hour mark?  I feel like i was having a mild - moderate withdrawal but feel fine atm.  I'm just worried about feeling ok then all hell breaks lose between now 57 hours in and 72.  I feel like the internet got to me.  Let me know what you think please.",5.023414475397033,6.121261182634733,5.265095027336631,83.17926711793805,68.91017964071854,8.203905233012236,29.79120020827909,8.456263369488248,2.0781246029679767,1361,51,267,20,23,430,197,334,0.107,0.7879999999999999,0.105,-0.4066,0,0,2,0,0,0,50.0,0,2,0,2,16,16,1,2,19,1,20,13,8,0,2,47,48,22,1,4,7,0,8,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,17,2,0,13,1,1,7,3,8,0,0,12,13,25,8,43,31,7,72,1,2,2,0,3,28,1,7,38,153,33,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08228529733818797,0.07464369133563308,0.08999078981980158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673396458373545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06441749158716882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07496134639492141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474934902331926,0.07030863686021774,0.0,0.0,0.07165325083896731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09193133131537333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06723177693440965,0.0,0.0,0.27153007574972704,0.0,0.07252665310631716,0.0,0.08739271276018372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05561738286139063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554630259950617,0.12031381311840746,0.08085113102565612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043994249722791784,0.0,0.09571261688664218,0.0,0.06734736864047161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641982661003315,0.0,0.0,0.09978472001531187,0.0,0.17793688926769494,0.0,0.0,0.5804828260603074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768777080959506,0.04627751030128038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09149025295729417,0.08610651666714302,0.0,0.12341664760149178,0.168793413481149,0.0,0.0,0.14142395430218765,0.09420516807937364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482885999613184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06721256362749888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06494499148584609,0.0,0.17910843980167754,0.23706536622019664,0.08250417052388306,0.08079809370111338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243309091965812,0.0,0.09492980744166696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0805739349244594,0.0,0.0,0.09433018484472903,0.0,0.08422896002620439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665813700878668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426698533082191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05960156240138291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17504491068122488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05594283944086651,0.053955915331482966,0.0,0.0668502951554005,0.098202592868971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355615614994407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06947891121180927,0.0,0.0,0.0675451124537725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08551545578080821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108452028744685
alcoholism,ParkingPossible,2018/02/03,"I've got a problem, and I'm only 22. Hey reddit. So, as the title says, I'm 22 years old and I've got a drinking problem. This all started about three years ago. I got a job as a bartender (in my state it is legal to bartend at 18, crazy right?) and drinking on or after shift was fine, if not encouraged, even though I was underage. This was in small town Minnesota for some context, if you were curious. Fast forward to today, and after three years of being at university and all the partying that comes with that, I'm an alcoholic.

As I sit here typing this, I'm sipping on some coffee, after taking a couple shots of vodka to calm the nerves, it's just after 11am here right now. I'm just so disgruntled. I'm only 22 years old, why do I wake up with the shakes and extreme anxiety every morning until I have my first drink? Or the better question, rather, is how I let myself get to this point. This is not who I am. I used to be confident and constructive, I felt like I had something to work towards.

Anyways, I could ramble on. I just feel like it's difficult to talk about in real life with people about this. I don't want to tell my parents, that would cause too much judgement. My friends are all halfway to this point too, drinking far too much like 5 days a week. I don't want to go to the doctors, in fear of being labeled an alcoholic, medically speaking, for the rest of my life.  So I just feel stuck, and I WANT to get out, but it's an uphill battle. I'm using a throwaway, but if anybody would like to talk I'll be here. I'm not sure what the purpose of this post was, but I just wanted to feel like I'm letting some of this out there. Thanks for reading, anyway.",2.6414590671363034,3.9252759423631134,4.180723663144416,87.97941936172484,74.87896253602304,6.754573593766676,25.24378268758673,7.2427474758485975,1.0608325114740098,1300,43,276,14,27,434,172,347,0.07,0.835,0.095,0.851,2,0,8,0,0,0,52.0,0,1,0,3,25,18,1,2,18,0,24,11,1,4,4,57,54,25,0,13,17,1,4,5,1,2,6,2,0,0,18,14,6,0,5,6,0,4,5,6,0,3,11,6,24,12,50,34,9,46,0,0,0,0,12,21,0,9,25,187,42,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08407707094164651,0.2027274344124607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07255849641337107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388538990636339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743507145850787,0.0,0.08170319414803923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572844774557494,0.10494756006645826,0.0,0.06116914378992463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970809952525512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37165990847840696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06264624056974492,0.0,0.07991357043609901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10673042230303953,0.1438740674210276,0.13551892758534287,0.09106899936647933,0.0,0.0,0.08067770040165373,0.0,0.0,0.07327936590102313,0.0,0.09910837979155268,0.0,0.05390433093538137,0.0,0.22757594337574275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941220514431243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1939771086027588,0.13398796129940246,0.2316898242414341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955494289225894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394484559347231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1990541405243052,0.0,0.0,0.14427242765735787,0.0,0.0,0.10531753178389708,0.0,0.0,0.06575569336937012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17932412419647528,0.0,0.0908382106904388,0.0,0.0,0.18151354311325274,0.0,0.0,0.1062515197361742,0.0,0.09487371431862256,0.10795784246859556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16199942794796512,0.0,0.07542697396786753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301866050624818,0.0,0.0,0.06713393591056037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939316190184686,0.0,0.07131392742661866,0.1524705349416363,0.0829013737536099,0.08732333852351021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09318772469614092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08990485835032214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16383651908139404,0.0,0.0,0.22377534240751165,0.0,0.0760813822296367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08558560982877991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06905050791634908,0.0,0.0,0.13475466265871994,0.0,0.0,0.24431613044247985

alcoholism,GuyAsAnRobot,2018/02/03,"This is wrong, but it actually felt better being an alcoholic. I wasn't a real alcoholic I guess, only for about 8 months. The kind of starting at 8 in the morning with vodka, drank about 1-1.5L a day. But it all seemed so much easier.. Can't really explain it, just woke up, little dizzy as always, drank some vodka and got to work, get home, eat, drink, sleep,drink repeat kinda thing. I wasn't as hot headed back then. But after I stopped drinking, I quit my job 2 weeks later because I was getting real sick of taking shit. When I drank I was so much happier. Now I just sit at home, don't drink a lot, sometimes a beer but that's it. But for some reason I seem so drawn to alcohol. Alcoholism is a big thing in my family, I guess that has a lot to do with it. But I feel like shit, and recently I've been thinking a lot about just drinking Vodka again, to feel happy again.


Now of course I know how it will end. But how do I prevent this? Any experienced people? Nobody even gave a fuck when I drank so much, so it REALLY makes me wanna give in again..

alcoholism,SimilarSandwich,2018/02/04,"I dont enjoy it anymore but I need it 21/m (legal age is 18 here) who has been drinking, increasingly heavily, for three years. 

I used to love drinking, couldn't wait for a social event or any event where drinking was involved. I'm finding now that I can't explain my drinking, I don't even really enjoy it anymore its just a routine for me that I need, like eating a meal or sleep. Its so ingrained in my life, I will think about when I can get a drink in at every available opportunity, at the zoo, at work, but when I'm actually drinking I don't get that buzz anymore and I'm not especially happy. This has meant I'm drinking more and more to try and reach that level and has also lead me to hard drugs. I have almost choked on my own vomit twice already this year having never done so before. I know that I'm not getting anything out of alcohol anymore other than problems and yet that doesn't seem to be logic for me to cut down or quit.

In this situation, how would I even go about changing? Completely stopping feels like an impossible goal &amp; I would be disappointing my friends/family. I feel like alcohol is now a part of me and this would require a complete change of me as a person.

alcoholism,EZP,2018/02/04,"Thoughts on winnowing down my meds I’m an alcoholic, sober about three years, I guess (I don’t keep close track). When I first started sober life my psychiatrist put me on naltrexone (brand names include ReVia and Vivitrol). When I relapsed while taking naltrexone she added generic Campral. Of anyone who has used any medications to treat alcoholism/alcohol dependence, do you still take them, and how long have you been taking them? If you no longer take such medications, what was your experience like in stopping them?
I ask because while I’ve been stable and sober for the last number of years, my psychiatrist is thinking about cutting out one of my two alcohol medications. I know that the only way to know how I’d do with using only one alcohol medication is to try it, but any experiences or advice would be very welcome. I’m not overly concerned about going back to active alcoholism but any change such as removing one of my regular anti alcohol meds could potentially lead to relapses, which I obviously do not want.

alcoholism,coolrunnings456,2018/02/05,"A beer everyday for 8+ years, can I just stop? I'm male in my 30's and everyday for the past 8 years+ I have been drinking a beer (yes a single beer 473ml can), sometimes two, every single night. Not to get drunk, but because It relaxes me a bit, and I like to tell myself it's only a beer. I'm not the biggest person, so a beer to me probably has a more of an effect. I just like to come home from work, eat, have a beer and play some video games. It's almost like a ritual to me now. I may go a day without a beer, but I always have to have a beer at night. 

I tell myself, I don't even drink to get drunk, I can stop anytime! I guess my question is when does stopping cold turkey becomes dangerous? cause I'm tired of doing late night beer runs in the middle of a work week just so i can have my beer for the night.",3.0536515151515147,2.7419020722222243,4.8207070707070745,89.64590909090911,72.7222222222222,7.878787878787879,24.141414141414145,7.348242739294969,0.7534444444444444,623,14,152,6,11,214,94,180,0.084,0.794,0.122,0.7596,0,0,12,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,3,8,6,1,0,18,1,15,16,0,2,0,22,23,8,0,0,8,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,1,2,3,4,15,3,2,18,0,3,4,1,0,1,1,1,19,5,18,21,5,25,1,0,0,0,6,5,0,5,20,93,22,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13233627395839173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10996531765200293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08056175878791354,0.145957165175105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14428135573316295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1357617751447147,0.0,0.11384166405886617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523041468224161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11565159358710245,0.0,0.0,0.25892734602569484,0.0,0.13522973533823765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08728853685413679,0.0,0.11134808050278966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13809328992946396,0.0,0.07510794158848566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14558597637477128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13256437514211444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14907899710828468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19369589215344588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4960820494489954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051145131833364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12615893287558885,0.0,0.1153945069140446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14248773664625572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14804622930203787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13070677916100315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3314678306488829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310223104319957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15189517790896642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12909831119029386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10600847674605084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12739475566577144,0.0,0.192423926806679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1702097153974145
alcoholism,WaywardGuy,2018/02/05,"I think I'm an alcoholic. I think I need help. About seven months ago me and my girl got into a huge fight. I went to the gas station, got a four loko, chugged it and went to sleep. We had made up, but casually I would continue to grab a four loko chug it and go to sleep. It gave me a nice feeling that I liked a lot. Soon maybe a month or two afterwards it wasn't enough for me. I would get a four loko and another malt liquor down them, then go to sleep so on and so forth, maybe once or twice a week I would do this. I kept this up for months. Fast forward to the present. For the past two months I've been drinking maybe three times a week, but when I drink I get fucked up. The other day I took 10 shots of vodka within an hour and man that hit me real hard. But when it did I loved it. I loved being that drunk. I fucking love it. It feels so good. I love binging, drinking as much as I can and getting drunk quick. After my hard binge the other day I've had a hangover for about three days now, my head is still hurting. After about three days of no alcohol I start to crave it really hard. It's been two days since I chugged shot after shot of vodka, and I'm really craving alcohol right now. I've made some extremely poor decisions while under the influence that I'd rather not admit publicly, even if this anymomous. Just know that they were very bad and if I was caught.. but anyways I'm not sure how to kick this craving. I know it's bad and I know I should stop.

alcoholism,positivevibezz,2018/02/05,"Is it awkward for you guys to sit through the Budweiser super bowl commercials? I’ve been watching the Super Bowl with my dad and when the bud commercials came on I felt awkward and pretty guilty about how I’ve effected my family with my drinking problem (Budweiser was my go-to beer as well and he knew it so it was extra awkward when the ads came on)

 It’s weird to think that just one year ago I was very drunk and stoned while watching the super bowl, and now I’m completely sober and full of regret, wishing for the commercials to be over with. Not to mention it sucks not being able to have a beer or two and fully relax and focus on the game.",4.364189991518238,5.281926877862599,5.0393384223918565,84.85805767599663,70.29770992366412,8.264970313825277,27.53265479219677,8.515128840125781,1.8274675148430881,515,17,104,8,9,166,80,131,0.134,0.718,0.14800000000000002,0.7269,0,0,3,0,0,0,8.0,0,1,0,4,8,12,1,3,8,0,8,4,0,2,0,25,16,15,0,3,4,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,13,4,0,4,6,0,2,2,7,1,2,8,3,7,5,18,6,2,14,0,1,2,0,7,5,1,1,6,70,13,0,0.2282643644883004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20234258643523428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5221472453081237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393308432547097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22361217604737185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2151873278313724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21916958654127533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12972789869304502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260176085156793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15467784090545786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322269212049471,0.0,0.21841816903951072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462625878530339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22298111599566348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883420064809989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052370771231062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26249275397164823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469947667893012
alcoholism,Golbstar,2018/02/05,"Could this be the answer?! I discovered a wikihow page on CORE (commit, objectify, respond, enjoy) then after googling it found it was a short version of RR (Rational Recovery) and AVRT (Addictive Voice Recognition Technique). So I bought the book - Rational Recovery: The New Cure for Substance Addiction and am reading it. 

I’m currently at the end of my 4th day sober. 

This time with relative ease by using the RR techniques. 

I’ve tried AA, rehab, therapy etc etc over the years and really struggled. 

This time I am full of hope, faith in myself and a sense of liberation.

alcoholism,gay_joke,2018/02/06,"If you wonder that you have a problem, you probably do? So, here's the deal. I don't really fit any of the diagnostic criteria for an alcoholic but I worry that I have a drinking problem. I drink almost daily, ranging from one drink to a full 6 pack, usually closer to the 1-2 drinks side of things. But I think if I let myself progress...I will be an alcoholic. 

My father is an alcoholic, as were my grandparents. I'm constantly worried, even when I'm not drinking a lot that I will develop a problem. When I wasn't drinking as much as I do now, I would be constantly watching myself. Now, I drink way more than I would have felt comfortable with a few years ago but I think part of that is that its finally legal for me to buy alcohol. 

Now, I feel like I am truly drinking too much even though the amount I'm drinking is probably ~socially acceptable~ for my age and lifestyle (I'm a 23 year old living in Brooklyn, NYC). But at the same time, I have a serious history of blowing things out of proportion. At the same time as that, I have a problem of not believing that I have problems when I do. For example, I was suicidally depressed for four years before I finally went to therapy. (No longer suicidal!)

But I am constantly plagued with the wonder that I might be an alcoholic. Is thinking your an alcoholic a sign that you are? People who didn't have text book realizations (DUIs, etc), what made you realize you needed to go to AA, etc?

But I'm tired of waking up hung over every day and not feeling like myself until after I get home from work only to repeat myself that night. So I figured it was time to make a change and had some questions about quitting drinking if anyone is willing to lend some advice. 

I had my last drink somewhere around 40 hours ago. First day was like a normal one where I felt kinda shitty throughout the day then a little better once night came around again. Had a little trouble sleeping without having a drink but woke up this morning feeling way better and so far have felt good all day. I had read up on how shitty (and also dangerous) quitting drinking could be and I was curious if feeling better today meant I managed to luck out and Dodge the worst of it or if other symptoms might hit me later by surprise (the internet said they peak between 48-72 hours)? I'm doing my best to be cautious going into this. 

Also what was the hardest part for you to stop drinking and how did you overcome it/any other advice you guys/gals could toss my way.

alcoholism,ThrowAwayHelp8400,2018/02/07,"Looking for help with alcoholic father Going to try to keep this brief. Father has been an alcoholic my whole life. It has gotten very bad the past two years. Every relationship around him he destroyed. There are 3 others plus me in the household. Can't lie, he's been a strain mentally on all of us and we're only just now recently finding the strength to put our foot down and say enough. This has been verbally said during altercations he starts and we actively avoid contact with him because it is that bad. 

He's drunk just about every day and acts very weird. Don't trust him any more. Feel like he's losing his mind. Aside from the typical alcoholic behaviour he's threatened suicide many times, plays victim and tries to turn the tables with mental gymnastics to manipulate us, I just saw him standing in the dark staring down the hall. Just very odd behaviour. What do I do for his safety/mental health as well as our own?

Edit: we've tried to get him to willingly get help and we're way passed the talking phase.",3.6474546485260784,5.991375729591838,4.06891156462585,85.28481859410435,74.86734693877553,7.416780045351475,24.66439909297052,8.344100000000001,1.6438875283446708,817,27,154,15,18,256,129,196,0.168,0.75,0.08199999999999999,-0.9556,0,1,3,0,0,1,19.0,5,0,0,2,9,13,2,2,10,0,13,7,1,1,1,23,24,9,1,0,4,2,1,1,0,1,5,2,0,0,7,12,4,2,2,2,0,5,2,8,1,1,6,6,16,5,24,17,5,21,0,1,3,0,27,7,0,0,8,89,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3985759195108759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454082461416315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11066979790175066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20760146412191535,0.07578338717963419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017513039094831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284542148979781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094873504106756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285915523558991,0.08881314185883699,0.0,0.0,0.11362483198479195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12990254203839585,0.0,0.07065305305275316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214472326768367,0.0,0.0,0.16665610368858766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049997077627258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08780981392260688,0.06073572627600701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10439620680392353,0.1390805717085021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12603941893501322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25056756127358953,0.0,0.12552621838649125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09454980062310908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11867604928350448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497440222766824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274949406750395,0.13347151497344945,0.0,0.0,0.11825533634387354,0.09886303940491847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879932549615532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13598423161591394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09992247939341636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249110127358402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25321224780098217,0.13522279953517738,0.12144108381405808,0.0,0.2990796318672444,0.0,0.0,0.30772727940618544,0.0,0.0986782172161639,0.0,0.0,0.11177723715915104,0.0,0.0,0.13879713529152718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08005702058749503
alcoholism,MasterOfKarats,2018/02/07,"Did my father relapse? Hello guys, recently I moved to live with my dad and his family for college (he's close to the college I'm going to). Well, they recently bought a house which was out of their reach financially, this led to many problems with money. My dad started to drink once again after being clean for 2 years. He's been drinking daily for the last 3 months. I'm living in a constant state of anxiety waiting for when he turns from a drunk that just cries and talks about the past, to one who gets irritated and snaps because of small things.  
Yesterday he took me to the dentist when we got home he already had a cup of cider ready he drank it, I and my step-mom did not notice, then he went to return something which meant he was driving. When he came home at about 12 he started drinking again...by 2 he was asleep when he woke up at 6:30 he started drinking once again. He doesn't want to search for a job and just sits there justifying his drinking. He barely does anything anymore but drinks, complains and sleeps. 
I don't know what to do? Last time the only reason he stopped drinking was that his wife threatened to leave him and started going through the divorce process. People tell me to just ignore it and leave if I can but I cannot leave my brothers knowing he is drinking and my stepmom is working until early mornings trying to make ends meet. 
Is there hope he will stop drinking and this isn't a relapse?",3.686311310536905,5.5061127046263385,3.9562772706173597,88.4585471143432,73.19928825622777,6.0257465573263165,27.519882407550675,6.498293943080001,1.131591242457063,1134,43,221,8,23,352,161,281,0.108,0.856,0.036000000000000004,-0.9437,2,0,10,0,1,0,28.0,1,0,2,1,14,5,0,0,12,0,19,14,2,3,0,36,43,19,0,4,7,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,11,16,11,4,4,10,2,8,5,3,1,1,16,0,20,2,35,25,0,45,0,0,0,0,38,7,0,2,28,125,31,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887923168490412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061553555711945984,0.0,0.07979713169514581,0.0,0.0,0.06621374233080747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04904916404708435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09202760989642572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695132603865988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838422553664127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07041323416354664,0.0,0.0,0.7094031371902141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126585014472846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585283897699692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04203831031906448,0.0,0.09145733170773723,0.0,0.06435317342424987,0.0,0.0,0.079670477985304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614208001655571,0.07991737031057325,0.0,0.09284286676483804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07984656826708117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08844011892904605,0.1311752754774828,0.0,0.2555943571162189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14209963889927826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05370931165721311,0.0815762974685832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423665156621586,0.06422436170445422,0.08551885293055181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09160703515261738,0.0,0.17137977120527026,0.05452344000807239,0.0611953206893382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768105151590636,0.055782533200940065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699170008183487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272880188339342,0.15889392900695287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0805205612394826,0.0,0.0,0.06194392675775956,0.0,0.0,0.2278069512736697,0.0,0.0,0.13454042585001594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06467267122993146,0.07032772976535008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05345567794343805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04691830295066776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939674501262583,0.054628723362469,0.08752004263923074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04745883902888545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07234540769672043,0.07458949932561762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0585776235184487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051815181163769784
alcoholism,NYPatrioT84,2018/02/07,"Encouragement to continue to not pick up another drink! I have been sober for 1 year, 7 months and 4 days. I use an app called 'Sober Time'. I also use an app for quitting smoking called 'Iquit' as well. It's been 3 years since I quit smoking! Just seeing the money that you have saved along with your health goes a long, long way. It's helped me out tremendously. I still have my moments where it gets me down from time to time because a lot of relationships I had, have changed. Overall, despite the down moments from time to time, this was by far the best decision I made in my life. Plus, my son who has Autism, told me that he is happy that I don't drink anymore so that's even more encouragement and the will to stay sober!

So I can't figure out how to add my photo so I'll just write it here how much I've saved - **$2,337** - from quitting drinking!

alcoholism,BirdieSA,2018/02/07,"Binge drinking Right, so we know there's a problem. It's not that we drink everyday but when we do there are no brakes.  Perhaps it is just the desperate want to be out, social and not worrying about everyday life for a while but it is now drastically affecting life, our marriage, relationships and friendships. Last year it even got me in trouble with the law. 

Thing is. Is it really necessary to stop completely? Can one learn through AA how to know when enough is enough or is the only way to get back in check by going tea total. Obviously one drink is just the catalyst for more ... A temptation that is always going to be there. 

We are social people. Having not too long ago moved to a new province - the pub was where we made all our friends. It is still where we go to see our friends.  I really am just a social drinker and don't like drinking at home unless there are people round. My husband has really been battling with the binge lately and I love him and respect him greatly for now admitting there is a problem and something needs to be done. I am also guilty but manage more often to know when to call it time before getting absolutely blotto. 

Is it possible? Have any of you managed to deal with the bingeing but still are able to go out and enjoy a few. Any pointers, advice and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,Broship_Rajor,2018/02/08,"Advice for helping alcoholic mother? About a year ago (I think I have a terrible memory) my mom kind of dove into a rut or alcoholism and depression. There were many days were she’d be stuck in bed because she drank so much or would be unintelligible. This began after she broke up with her wife for whom she left my dad. She lost her job and we are losing the house. One of the motivating factors that seems to help lead her back to alcohol is that she thinks she if a bad mother for “abandoning” me and my sister when she meant her wife, and generally all my bad things that have come out of her spiral down into alcoholism. Basically creating a negative feedback loop.

She has been hospitalized multiple time and been sober for up to a month because she relapses again. Recently she had been in rehab for addiction and going to AA meetings multiple times a week. She was in rehab for (i believe) just over 100 days, got out yesterday and has already relapsed and is in the hospital now.

I am currently away at college so I cant do anything as directly as I’d like, but I do feel somewhat like it is my responsibility since as this whole mess of alcoholism and family drama has happened Ive basically become the stoic “rock” and mediator in my family. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to go about maybe atleast cutting off the negative loop where she blames herself and drinks because of it only to feel worse? What are experiences with similar situations in the past?",7.689139784946238,7.350220637992834,8.412387096774196,67.87858064516128,63.05017921146953,12.314551971326166,35.804301075268825,11.729898335038438,4.363092043010753,1174,48,210,34,15,396,168,279,0.13,0.828,0.041,-0.9751,2,0,6,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,0,4,12,13,1,0,13,0,27,10,0,3,1,38,42,22,0,2,5,7,2,2,0,1,8,0,1,0,10,19,7,1,7,3,0,4,3,10,1,1,13,2,34,3,43,25,4,42,0,5,0,0,31,20,0,5,20,157,44,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11636614743930453,0.0,0.20861698347680607,0.09462165311266828,0.5703815784897696,0.0,0.0,0.11779408281392754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07258922573560647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07463752204148974,0.0,0.08784078763025788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002890117838854,0.08207914604607543,0.17825269165476654,0.1952095011172769,0.11788978553845755,0.0,0.12026334686657375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195005497085364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13768142586475854,0.0,0.09193800157593136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341193732289517,0.0,0.0,0.10456797121398738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10441560439138628,0.20125650311205653,0.0,0.10794541997361454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12132955741472325,0.0,0.08537251091851633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09439290546727327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309580709768518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12316764247714147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10592643157235107,0.0,0.0,0.11115690667628868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11597710166274618,0.0,0.0,0.10429894349827472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11941864846080905,0.11652311617463858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082211330965134,0.1072381714013282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12501667185428253,0.08520162610632237,0.0,0.07846873872253725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07233214354041761,0.08118322540631616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10189872845653623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10539630733983622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717525377588286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829930843021967,0.11998414215383248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07091562398635592,0.13679382175556715,0.0,0.0,0.12448596138460999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08562317974494403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191752816596525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878072389068208,0.0758275044706162,0.0,0.0,0.0687393003991613

alcoholism,mdw080,2018/02/09,"23(M) 6 months sober into the trash I. Sorry if i break some rules.


I am on mobile and cant see the sidebar. I habe been a lingtime lurker here and you guys have helped me so much.


Begin self hate.

I will start with this. 

I am so depressed because of my failure.

I spent 5 years in the Marine Corps (US). 

I drank alot.

It is expected in the work I did in the marine corps.

I have been married for 4 years. Have 2 kids.

I decided I would quit drinking after my daughter was born. 

I am a complete failure, and i have never felt worse about myself in my entire life. I got a new job and have been in training for a few months. 

I promised myself I would not drink at all the entire time I was I training for my new job (~2 1/2 months) 800 miles away from my family living in a hotel with extreme loneliness. 

Skip ahead to the last fucking day in my training. A few arguments with my wife (and supposed to be DDing for the guys I work with). Pretty blonde haired, blue eyed bartender offers me a shot on the bar. I decline. She then fixes myself and her a shot.


TIFU: Taking the mother fucking shot.

I lost it. I had 3 Manhattans and 4 long islands along with a few more shots. I couldn't control myself. I lost it.

I am laying in bed now super drunk and completely hating myself. I can't even live with myself because of the choice I made tonight. I want to say I am angry at myself but I'm just sad. I'm so possed that I let myself do this.

I am a failure. I hate myself for the decision I made.



P.s. I'm sorry if none of this makes since. I am pretty drunk and extremely disappointed in myself. I just want to cry because I have failed on a promise that I made myself. 



Edit

I'm sorry for the rant but I can't tell my wife because of how disappointed she will be kn me. K didn't just promise myself. I promised her too.",0.3098989898989899,2.532399915343916,2.369978354978357,93.37237012987015,86.88359788359787,4.600384800384801,19.17291967291968,5.985473137389443,-0.10690687830687827,1400,40,301,11,44,468,184,378,0.175,0.759,0.066,-0.9901,2,0,2,0,0,0,53.0,1,1,0,9,12,17,5,0,25,0,34,11,2,6,2,44,59,18,0,8,8,4,2,0,0,4,1,1,1,4,8,17,6,1,3,6,1,0,8,12,0,0,17,7,69,5,41,34,9,38,0,7,4,2,18,17,2,4,20,212,77,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09235563824488498,0.0,0.0,0.23968990881409905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2061303605363372,0.0,0.11025127429583624,0.0,0.0,0.10797741088485284,0.06339506060547684,0.0,0.08466523563719798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19259222021753608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492590825308257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266804241675797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943829580800677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18175265118203296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786191088555018,0.0,0.0,0.19466396598667765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2911512856260716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588809860422405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19509421861587334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012723159685319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005179228777481,0.06943186058114327,0.0,0.0,0.17360056053956865,0.08699198508061498,0.0,0.0,0.2146110839696361,0.0,0.0,0.2790401580408299,0.0656156953114815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2353852257166973,0.0,0.07226146033433657,0.0,0.07581465257392449,0.1898765848724605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000119096362116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045536432764012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07817172662090285,0.0,0.0,0.0783319934271807,0.0,0.102547841444568,0.0,0.0,0.08131438172138057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301148063098657,0.06957690874913287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07390900822073837,0.0,0.08591811635351097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057319242715138184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11824222358999895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595921174453486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14312644784532474,0.0,0.10017561251190674,0.13965832242901605,0.0,0.0,0.12660334064417414
alcoholism,aviciinh,2018/02/09,"How to fix myself So, first off. I have HALF accepted to myself that I have a problem with alcohol. But half of me, probably the alcohol infused side, says I don't have an issue and can stop whenever I feel like it. However that's not the case. I am a restaurant manager, and drinking comes with the high stress environment that I'm placed into. 

I moved 4 years ago to a different city when I was 18, at this point I refused to drink alcohol, and only smoked weed. My brother convinced me to drink with him one night at a party, and I feel that was my downfall ever since. It gradually grew into if I wasn't drinking I was smoking. And then came some bad times with law enforcement and I convinced myself I wasn't going to smoke anymore. This ultimately turned into more drinking.

Fast forward to now. I'm 22, have a wife, a beautiful daughter, an amazing job, &amp; I generally love my life. However, I cannot remember the last night I spent stone cold sober.

One of my interests is beer as a whole. I love trying new beers and researching the brewing process. I don't drink liquor, ever. However, this being one of my interests is also one of my downfalls. I am clear to myself that it is a problem since I have a ""regular"" beer that I drink every night, miller light, and then on occasion I'll buy the beers that I'm really interested in tasting. The issue is the ""regular beer"" is an every day thing. It's past an interest onto an addiction.

One of the reasons I'm posting this is because of my general worried of what's happening, considering half of me says it's not a big deal. I was drinking some high ABV beers, my face turned flush red, I had red splotches all over my chest, stomach, and arms. It is clearly a reaction to the alcohol.

I truthfully just would like some advice. I haven't been drinking hard liquor for 20 years and trying to stop, so I know this isn't as severe as some people's cases. But do know that alcohol is a demon that's risky to bet with. Does anyone have any advice on how you handled quitting alcohol while still dealing with a high stress career/life?

Thanks again.

alcoholism,kirrirhubarb,2018/02/10,"Is it time for me to seek help? I'm an 18 year old girl, with Borderline disorder. I've struggled with addiction to self harm before, and I have an addictive personality. Yesterday was a party and I got too drunk. I don't remember much, and tonight I got a text from a guy friend saying I went too far, and what I did to him was not ok. It was something sexual, but I have no memory of what. I'm freaking out a little bit, because it's not the first time I've done something reckless, but now it might be a matter of assault. What the hell have I done? 

It's not that I drink often, but when I start I can't stop. I can't remember one single time where I have had some type of alcohol and not ended up smashed. Even with family. When I'm drunk I think I'm a hoot, I am the life of the party. But I don't think others think I am, after enough drinks. But I don't know if I need help? All I've read is about how you need help when you drink everyday or when you're violent, or if you started drinking early (I started at 17) and especially not about some 18 year old girl. 

I don't want others to know, and I'm not sure if cold turkeying it for the rest of my life is something I want. What help should I get? Should I get help, or is it a waste of resources? Help me please.

alcoholism,LindyRyan,2018/02/10,"How can I best support a crumbling family? Good evening, everyone! Thanks in advance for your time. I’m hoping to get some insight and perhaps advice on how best to handle the current situation I’m in. 

Background info: my stepdad is a (more or less) functional alcoholic. He and my mom have been married for nearly twenty years and though he’s not my biological father, I treat and think of him as such. He raised my sister and I and has always been a loving, generous person. When he’s sober. Though his drinking has been a consistent problem throughout my parents marriage, he’s managed to mostly keep himself in check. Going to work. Paying the bills. Showing up. Etc. 

However, in the last several years, his drinking has gotten much, much worse. It worsened after the 2008 recession in which he lost a high paying construction job at a company that laid off 30% of its employees. Since then, he’s been fired twice for drinking on the job, and at his current job has noticeably shown up drunk on at least three occasions. In the last six years, he’s had four seizures directly related to his drinking, the most recent of which was a month ago. 

Today, I went over to my moms house for dinner and found that my dad had been admitted to the hospital again due to his drinking. 

I’m at my wits end. I love my dad. So much. But I can’t stand by and watch him drink himself to death. He’ll either end up killing himself or killing someone else (because no matter what you do or say, he will always drive home drunk from the bar). 

My mom continues to enable his behavior but she won’t do anything to change the situation. From what I can tell, their marriage is a complacent one. I’ve been telling her for the better part of the last year that she needs to leave him but because their financial situation is tied, leaving him would put a huge strain on her budget. And I know that to someone outside the situation, this sounds harsh but Mom leaving my dad might be the best thing for their marriage. When Dad is drunk (which is obviously everyday, sometimes first thing in the morning), he’s mean and spiteful and belligerent. The thing is that I know dad loves us. When he’s sober, he’s the most loving, helpful, generous kind person. But that person is long dead. 

What do I do here? My mom is upset with me because I continue to tell her that she needs to stop enabling his alcoholism and dad barely talks to me as is because he only likes me when he’s sober. Do I just walk away altogether? I don’t want to stand by and do nothing or say nothing. 

Am I wrong for wanting my mom to leave him because she deserves a partner who doesn’t take advantage of her?

alcoholism,leavingsober,2018/02/11,"I have a problem I need to stop. I've realized this in the past but didn't actually stop. Last night I drove while intoxicated. I was honking the horn like a madman, swerving from lane to lane just for fun, not because I was actually drunk. I was buzzed. I don't know why I do these things, it's like the animal inside me comes out.

A police man saw me and pulled me over. I managed to slip away. I think I gave him some money, not sure how I got away.

But the worst is that I didn't have any memory of this when I woke up. At all. I had to ask my friends how I left the party. I don't remember being so intoxicated but apparently I was... this is awful. It's been a few times that I can't remember what happened last night. The last time this happened I woke up with a mangled face, hurt all over... it seemed like someone beat me up, and they probably did. But I had no recollection of anything, and to this day I don't know what happened that night.

It's a problem. It's not crippling alcoholism but one of these days something bad's gonna happen to me. And every time I drink I think I'm going to control myself, not gonna act like a lunatic. Most times that works. But when the alcohol intake gets to a certain point, something is set loose inside me. At that point everything seems like a good idea, like driving and honking the horn like crazy at 3am. 

I think of all those things and I feel shame, guilt. But when I'm doing those things it feels normal. I know it's the effect of alcohol on the forebrain. When I'm sober all these ideas seem crazy, I wouldn't ever do any of it sober. But then alcohol comes in the equation, and I end up doing some fucked up things...

It sucks. Right now the idea of stopping my drinking is calming my anxiety, and I know the actual stopping is going to be hard as hell. Alcohol is everywhere. I'm so used to drinking. All my friends drink. 

One of these days... I'm gonna end up in jail or something bad's going to happen to me. Or I'm gonna do something stupid while drunk and go viral, since there are cameras everywhere now...  I don't know what to do except write this post. I didn't think I'd end up like this. My therapist used to say to me when I was around 20, stop drinking or you'll develop a habit. I guess he was right. I drink every day usually. A few beers. But every now and then there's a party... and last night someone brought tequila. I have 0 recollection of last night after 1am. I could've streaked for all I know. I wasn't that drunk, but I'm a lightweight and 'small' amounts of alcohol really get to me. 

The shame, the guilt... Not knowing what I did last night... or if I said something rude, or whatever animalistic drive I had going on at the time. When I'm sober I'm a really nice person. But when I'm drunk I get these crazy ideas... I hate myself for it.

God help me... thank you for reading.

alcoholism,BELLaa12230,2018/02/12,Day one Today is the day I have to put an end to my drinking madness. I'm about 105lbs but I can drink an insane amount and it's frightening. I worked nights at a job I hated so vodka seemed like a way to cope. Then the drinking started happening on days off then before I knew it I was drunk more times then I was sober for about a year and a half straight. I've embarrassed myself in front of family and coworkers plenty of times (plenty of times without me even remembering) and have said and done things I reget. All the money and time I have wasted because of alcohol hurts to think about. Wanted to write this as a way to cement my decision and reflect. I will not drink today. ,1.89487577639752,4.163092876811593,3.218053830227741,89.54739130434784,80.3768115942029,6.2616977225672885,20.726708074534162,7.447530270364453,0.6981142857142855,539,15,110,8,14,175,89,138,0.208,0.7509999999999999,0.041,-0.9786,1,0,6,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,5,5,2,1,10,0,9,6,0,0,1,19,18,13,0,1,3,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,4,7,6,0,6,6,1,2,2,4,0,2,5,1,14,1,20,12,3,25,0,1,0,0,2,5,0,1,17,75,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15249246688899884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698264316425575,0.0,0.12141888078690988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27607019230664576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14602165191875405,0.0,0.5591284322407254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263811959564828,0.0,0.0,0.09424555481095656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13451565493345188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261805040201061,0.0,0.0,0.14087706631581656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275284830352787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14159804127953854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06971124150818579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13390511992486562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966905964341666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14344309799545055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16164022103425915,0.0,0.13573108970553469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12989983133821234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10099688311687187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479705210050043,0.09143014133587847,0.0,0.0,0.33281529524236403,0.0,0.2705073178650941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08416239788055642,0.2265217345287821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754829511909586,0.0,0.1038801908840731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918878333855593
alcoholism,newacct0987,2018/02/12,"Withdrawals!!! So, I know my withdrawals are not as bad as what I’ve heard about or witnessed in others (no sweating or DTs or vomiting), but I am extremely tense. Wound up. At any given point in the day, I feel like I’ve drank 6 cups of strong coffee. I get pissed extremely easily. I’m not sleeping more than 5 hours a night. Every dream I remember includes me using some substance or another. I’m stressed out about everything and anything. 

I tried meditating, I tried doing simple math equations,  reading... none of that put me back to sleep. What helps? This is my fourth day without weed, a week without alcohol. I feel lost, frustrated, lonely. I’m finally going to be working after almost a month and a half of being unemployed, and I’m scared I’m going to make a terrible first impression.",2.8149751655629127,5.44019100662252,4.188638245033115,81.84136796357619,79.33112582781456,7.483609271523179,27.31829470198675,8.472884824447931,2.4123539735099344,626,27,111,14,16,206,105,151,0.175,0.6829999999999999,0.14300000000000002,-0.8522,2,2,1,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,4,4,11,2,2,6,0,6,8,4,2,0,21,23,11,0,0,9,0,2,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,5,4,2,0,4,2,0,3,6,8,0,2,4,3,12,3,19,17,3,19,0,2,0,0,2,6,1,6,11,66,17,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17574400182628575,0.1646700757983613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11182970752688767,0.17243718504519168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532600038196455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12644971486294398,0.13730650913841494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21210962688073334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.138553824344196,0.0,0.1477945032566633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16629884975608794,0.11748108353504068,0.0,0.18014382501148146,0.0,0.13987866977965635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08591685348145592,0.0,0.1869182207491122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022546454995864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16194732665348907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09037585814270288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034057553705355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17951350038356376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10976975585410076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13126015371743466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543225191428936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554557196544157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1653148158094306,0.0,0.0,0.16449166113901822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18628657454485334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16464029460052765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3291318423480909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18837366548628626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22329765327812004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14202954618402167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13190959197271598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3170423867063401,0.0,0.11971949060103053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,PrincessDuo,2018/02/12,"My husband is an alcoholic and we are only 3 months into the marriage! My husband is an alcoholic, we have been dealing with this since before the wedding; (I was stupid to think that maybe after our marriage things would change), we had many fights and eventually my family and his family got involved because he became a little more aggressive (he wasn’t but he escalated to insults and throwing stuff and breaking others). After our last fight over it and me leaving for around a week he decide to “change” but my trust was already completed broken. He had lied and hide alcohol for months and many many false promises about stopping for good. He denies any treatment even went to a psychologist and thought it was stupid. But he has gone for now almost 4 weeks with no alcohol whatsoever but I can hardly HAAAARDLY believe he is not hiding any. My intuition tell me he is drinking but he denies it and I really don’t want to put anymore pressure on him so I follow what he says and stay as calm as I can and frankly is eating me up badly.  He has no job and has been looking for one, he got offer one really really good job and might have an interview tomorrow but he has to call and push a little. The night before that he started acting as he was drinking again, waking up constantly, wanted to be alone just because, been aggressive and in a bad humor. I asked him many times what was wrong. He decided to play with his mates until 2:30 am before I intervened because it was too much and I really want him to get a job so he is not bored anymore (his reason to drinking said by himself) we had a HUGE fight about it, he even insulted me (you are a f*** bi***) and I lost it, I slapped him as hard as I could, and told him how dare him treat me like that (I know I shouldn’t have but I’m a human being too). Before the huge insult he did insult me with swears and I asked him would he insult me or treat me like that (that’s why he said the huge insult) even asked if he had any respect or loved for me which he responded with none respect at all... I didn’t insulted him at all. Just the slap and how dare him. at this point I really just don’t know what else to do... I tried so hard and I’m at my limit, I cannot leave just like that bc this isn’t even my own country and my family is miles and miles away... I’m afraid of him in some sort and also very hurt and emotionally exhausted... what can I do for me? For him? For us?

alcoholism,fuckmethishurts,2018/02/12,"Could use some advice Howdy, all. I have been a heavy drinker for a long time -- ten years or so. I was always able to limit myself to about 6-8 standard units in the evening. I never drank during the day. 

Last year March, I was drugged and raped. I am male and I am not gay. I was raped by another man. My place of employment has good resources available, but those are just not geared to men. Not a whole lot of sympathy there. My very own doctor asked me ""whether, if we asked the other party involved, they would tell the same story."" No, of course not. What an idiotic question to ask. I ended up with an STD, which required treatment for myself and my wife. It was all super humiliating. My wife, by the way, is the most awesome person ever. I did tell her what happened, and she has been supportive.

That said, the whole thing has led to my intake of alcohol to spiral completely out of control. I used to only drink in the evenings, but over the past few months I have also found myself drinking during the day. A shot for breakfast, and another for lunch. If I do not, I go into full-on anxiety attacks.

I visited my doctor a few days ago to discuss this: it has to end. I am now on an average of 16-20 standard units a day and I cannot go on like that. She has agreed to set me up with a psychiatrist -- there is not one where I live, she gets beamed in over skype -- to determine a benzo tapering schedule. I'm all for it. I do not want to be the drunk that I am.

I just want to know what is appropriate going into to that meeting. I currently consume between 16-20 standard units a day. I've been trying to taper that down, but frankly, it's hard to taper when under the influence. I'm at a point where I can have ten drinks and not feel drunk. It ain't right.

I have never had a seizure. I do get super anxious during the day when I do not drink. I am ready, more than ready, to put down the booze, but I would like to be able to go into that meeting with the psychiatrist knowing what I'm talking about. Can anyone here give me some useful pointers for what to discuss with the psychiatrist when I do talk to her in two weeks? What is an appropriate regime? While I have started imbibing during the daytime, it is limited to a drink for breakfast and one for lunch; the other massive quantities are all during the evening. Does that make a difference in how this should be done?

Any help appreciated. I really want to get this behind me. I don't feel I can engage in a constructive approach to my trauma until I get this under control.

Thanks for listening.",2.9334250509542343,4.557401410505836,4.288693718732631,86.11216601815826,74.77821011673151,7.152047433759496,25.467667222531038,7.8761006319780495,1.3768126366499909,1991,68,409,29,42,658,242,514,0.097,0.807,0.096,0.8873,2,0,8,0,0,0,76.0,1,0,1,7,20,13,4,0,37,0,50,21,0,9,7,76,84,24,0,9,19,2,3,2,0,3,5,2,0,4,28,17,14,5,6,7,0,8,15,5,0,5,13,5,54,8,72,64,15,66,0,0,0,4,31,26,0,8,32,308,82,4,0.16224670736866087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07927280233391501,0.07191095833808543,0.08669619390130429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06487431663229863,0.06750112892173174,0.0,0.0,0.05516666234367668,0.17012981922705978,0.06205914352412936,0.09164629881870738,0.0,0.05672333510800725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2275181545412077,0.09228952616351244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08505629290162807,0.0,0.1819734784315052,0.06477039684957027,0.0,0.0,0.3139071117527313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08475663837444468,0.0,0.16606637997347345,0.07099159348979095,0.08301735624587991,0.0,0.3973500131367083,0.0940773353135944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14370242535452632,0.0,0.0,0.16074363004778988,0.0733807178071251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203681021369158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08894757010917907,0.0,0.0,0.16953441622846147,0.07782091289409254,0.18441708554889708,0.06804242019897011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07173711374906361,0.0,0.07267059065061185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05437527396770171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08916654725185202,0.066126360642513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07926554582258298,0.0,0.07163340755200108,0.07179161520756659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896817430383714,0.0,0.0,0.054150468517455634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06475188694889314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513466291494948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10994256789079483,0.061697966035254063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07744142039049627,0.0,0.07083378336353773,0.08475663837444468,0.0,0.07668779061687572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08155137687338791,0.09087672207811874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051969697652372485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06927890079594423,0.0771668864148678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057419527277379034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09205782040574338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304077575868854,0.14181077355331434,0.0746874848062315,0.0,0.0,0.05389475151031173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04730367991006218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507743207486985,0.0,0.07924572886526958,0.0,0.0,0.21019359319907951,0.0,0.0669352627144639,0.14354596750991044,0.06439194217332135,0.06507226104030849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811426546131539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11525540582924824,0.0,0.0,0.10448156007816407

alcoholism,alpradanny,2018/02/12,"Once it wears off Hi, this is my first time posting. But I need to know, why do I feel like SHIT minutes after my last drink??? Today for example, after almost a month of sobriety I had a six pack. It was amazing while I was drinking. It was amazing for about 20 minutes after my last beer. After that, I began to feel like utter SHIT. Do I really have to drink myself into a blackout in order to stretch that good feeling??? Why can't I just drink a six pack and chill without feeling like death after 30 minutes?",2.4462998921251327,4.277014708737863,3.995663430420713,86.79947141316076,76.66990291262134,5.742826321467099,25.036677454153185,6.42735559955562,0.9204528586839268,397,14,77,3,9,132,64,103,0.076,0.703,0.221,0.9252,0,0,5,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,2,8,2,0,4,0,9,8,3,0,0,12,16,3,1,1,3,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2,5,0,5,5,0,0,2,2,0,3,5,4,11,6,17,11,0,19,0,0,0,0,1,4,2,1,16,54,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14949927691465953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5850164863557211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019559889037491,0.31997320013040426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12699186471165252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12522315424664968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820496703931825,0.2433937956437453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21881676846504397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11916735917758545,0.0,0.0,0.11070175773293499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15899632327194035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14298515829303848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09564341547882343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065022395785327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870562215231362,0.0,0.14151600196465644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26943445662261123,0.0,0.0,0.14391688147983284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,throwaway22361,2018/02/12,"Should I be concerned? I drink socially, and all my childhood friends just tend to all be heavy social drinkers. My wife and I also just really have fun with drinking. I’m curious though if I should be concerned. I don’t think so, but I’m beating myself up because we got really really drunk this weekend. We were fed shots by the people we were with which we don’t normally do.

Anyway so an average week for me would be maybe 3-4 beers on Thursday and then one or two nights of the weekend it could be 6-14 beers. Once i drank 24 at an all day event.

I don’t think I have ever had any real withdrawal symptoms. For New Years we decided to stop drinking, I had planned to make it all month of January but gave in after 10 days. The 10 days weren’t bad, I didn’t shake or get anxious or anything like that.

After this binge drinking session this weekend I’m obviously hung over and I don’t want a drink or anything but I have this weird “thirst” in the back of my throat, like I want a beer. But I think a soda would also satisfy this “thirst.” Or something carbonated.

I get “hangover anxiety” when I go really hard, especially when I do 2 days in a row like this weekend and I think it’s making me try to find something wrong with me, ie like I’m an alcoholic. 

I know I can’t be an alcoholic because I can definitely have 2-3 beers and stop and I don’t think that would be possible if I was an alcoholic. But I’m wondering if I should be concerned.

In the past 2 years my drinkin has either stayed the same or decreased slightly.

Edit: I feel less anxious today and a little more clear headed. I think I should definitely cut back, especially if it is causing this anxiety which sucks (happens ~3 times a year at big weekend events/vacation). I don’t think I need to stress myself so hard about it, though. Just time to make some lifestyle changes and not get so dang drunk. I’m 30 and need to start acting like it. I think it was a wake up call that if I continue to binge I could end up with worse issues and dependency.

One thing I’ve been thinking about that has made me feel a little better is that although I gave up after those 10 days, I only had 4 beers that night and didn’t go crazy/excessive, if I had real problems I think I would have taken it further, especially with an open bar.",3.752819667894293,4.683954123667379,4.973196355882923,84.7205711701234,71.72921108742004,8.243483879304774,28.07139626542612,8.575989854853784,1.894059843638948,1800,65,379,30,33,597,207,469,0.132,0.774,0.095,-0.9608,1,0,17,0,0,0,46.0,5,0,0,3,19,16,2,2,20,0,49,25,5,6,7,96,92,41,0,22,22,1,4,5,1,8,4,0,0,0,25,23,21,2,16,18,0,4,11,8,0,3,19,4,52,8,36,55,9,61,0,0,0,0,12,17,2,15,44,243,77,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22311405146526012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113033992115041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04732409804643313,0.0,0.10647347031862613,0.15723548413605784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145345195285958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702198613331236,0.05810537150262598,0.08484375357225896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06154736532492184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105993898181003,0.0,0.0,0.07148887243905791,0.07361778870605203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11112510638834353,0.0,0.0,0.2244013912108892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3408622197095536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061636751056476966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294881975255252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07037435083136523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06360468701244419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053765642729005886,0.0,0.10907488773552933,0.0,0.07910005669351322,0.0,0.05565808198442131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061538872579953025,0.0,0.1246792903879912,0.0,0.07142018896414923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726346653308829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03824525760069145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16999263245449547,0.13949643223801428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584845261867713,0.13935710295916212,0.0,0.06991326448640288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05554667468499138,0.0,0.0,0.10320132234674333,0.0,0.06721118238046381,0.0,0.1306124139676377,0.06818416190228756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411188018134231,0.09431298978951146,0.05292690313088223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643224758793051,0.04824546546801184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07845311720432244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06658895167491409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15841902332508492,0.1783264720147613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14187801674086034,0.0,0.10714872229195144,0.0,0.0,0.04925669277807946,0.07417448278602705,0.0,0.11636197026077627,0.079715971828824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0723314376368714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046233003707437235,0.445909442296979,0.1367451219353883,0.0,0.08115785479552272,0.0,0.06596389630601064,0.0,0.0,0.04724755286841571,0.0,0.06798005322884887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08209285767902127,0.0,0.05582150397988735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546820250816802,0.0,0.0,0.07091892206861544,0.1977410955865078,0.07608656328378535,0.0,0.13444248889973168
alcoholism,Ayrton777,2018/02/13,"Venting... My mother died from alcoholism.. Sharing to help someone in similar shoes. My Ma was a great human being would lead through her life the way she wanted for so long until she lost her sense of worth

The list is enormous of things piled up to end with this volcano eruption, but I will try to keep it as short as possible…. 

It all started when she stopped teaching and took over the books for my fathers business.  My brother was born and was also a sick baby with an iron deficancy, she would take a sip of whiskey to help with the sleep.  Sips turn into morning coffees, which is this play button to a tumbling avalanche of sorrow and false hope. 

She was possessed by the liqueur, there was a great individual inside the body that she became.  One of the highlights of her life was being awarded “Teacher of the Year” and also graduated High School &amp; College within 6 years.  She had life by the horns and was steering to the American Dream… We had a small taste of it all, then everything seemed to slip away through our hands like quick sand.  It went from good years to good months to good weeks.  For over 10 years I was unsure if I was going to come home to my mother dead or alive.  The thoughts of a kid getting off the bus not knowing whether he was going to walk into his house with his mother dead or alive on a daily basis will scar you deeper than cuts, this whole experience has mentally strengthen and weakened myself.  

Back to my ma…when this all began, nobody notices because drinking alcohol is typical from most adults.  She was not a social drinker though, not someone to drink to get a little loose for conversation.  She was the type of drinker that drinks until they can’t feel anything, the more numb… the better.  They drown their pain with another form of pain.  I could never get through to her that fire doesn’t fight with fire. Although I will never understand how she actually felt, considering no-one will ever truly know what someone else is feeling.. she confessed it was to help escape the reality of now and enter another state of no issues.  Its a much easier place to deal with life there.  No responsibility and no stress is easy to get used to.  

My Ma never understood the ripple effect of the lack of efforts and negativity this would impact her immediate family.  While trying keeping my brother away from the scenes of reality our mother was putting herself in, and being the only outlet for my mother to talk about her real issues since my dad was escaping his own reality by becoming a workaholic himself.  Questions from my brother due to not having a distant relationship from being raised to this being normal only lead to me becoming the middleman of the truth to everyone.  Dad couldn’t listen to my ma because conversations were fights, there was no peace with them together.  I was voice my opinion and perspective to my dad on the situation at hand but, In result of me being there for my mom, my dad felt betrayed in some ways.  I only did this to keep my mom in a forward motion during the days of sobriety. No-one was holding on for her, but me.  Everyday I feel as if I was living through her myself and felt what she was going though.  I am not trying to ask for a pity party, but I only want people to see what it was like through my perspective. 


My mother committed suicide on 1.27.2018…
Most people feel lost in the world, but I have never been so lost in my life.. I am 22, College Dropout, and Unemployed… I was living for my mom until the moment she passed.  Now that its my turn to call the shots, I have no idea where to begin.  Where do you start being broke and lost in this world.  I expected more support than what was offered, so I guess that is why I turned to Reddit to express my feelings.  I have never done something of this nature, but it feels good to get a summary of what I went through off my chest. I appreciate you taking the time to read my story.

alcoholism,iwegian,2018/02/13,"Advice wanted: am I being unreasonable? My BIL went through 28 days of rehab in December. The first time he has ever confronted his alcoholism.

The inlaws are planning a vacation this summer to bring the family together from around the country. Small family, just 10 of us total. I emailed my FIL to confirm whether it would be a dry vacation in order to support BIL in his recovery.

This is the response I got, and I just am so disappointed. For background, one of his first reactions when told that his son was now a recovering alcoholic was to figure out how he could keep drinking around his son. 

So, thoughts? Is he being a dick? Am I being unreasonable? Is a recently sober alcoholic really the best person to decide whether alcohol should be present? (Note: my father is alcoholic, as is my sister, and I have a lot of experience being around those who are suffering and those who are in recovery.) I know my BIL will never say no to attending this vacation. Why the hell can't they just step up and support their SON instead of reassuring themselves that they can drink?

alcoholism,Semperdrunk,2018/02/13,"Paid clinical study Anybody ever done one of these? 

I replied to a Craigslist post thinking it was a scam,  but they replied with detailed instructions including study #s and Dr. references (which I checked out with the university).   Sounds pretty legit.   

Its some addiction research clinic wanting people to take home a breathalyzer and email them results 3 times a day and fill out some paperwork.   Pay based on number of responses,  and follow up apts.   First apt is next monday at the hospital. 

I called the uni today (not via their provided number) and it sounds real.   I'm just wary of Craigslist scams.   

Again,  anybody ever do one of these types of things?

alcoholism,workinparadoxes,2018/02/14,Liver Failure &amp; my Father I’m going to try and keep this as short as possible. My father was admitted to the hospital on Sunday for liver failure. He stopped drinking Friday and went into withdrawal on Sunday. It wasn’t an intentional stoppage but relied heavily on not being able to afford the alcohol. He is currently going through Delerium Tremens but is slowly coming back. He has been an alcoholic for all my life and it has effected our relationship immensely. I would like some advice or input on how to bring up the topic of rehab. He is currently living with his girlfriend who is also an alcoholic but supports him in going to rehab. He has a great support system with my aunt and grandpa to where he could possibly stay with them through this process. Please let me know your thought or any encouragement that you can provide.

alcoholism,croftonguy,2018/02/14,"How my alcohol use stopped after 19 years drinking daily So, I'm kinda new to Reddit and just stumbled across your this thread I started drinking in the very beginning at 15, but by 19 was drinking  daily, all through college, after graduation, after getting married, through the birth of all 3 of my kids, through some really good and really bad times, I always drank
.heavily, up until 12/24/2016. I was 38 at the time and on XMas Eve 2016 I'd been experiencing stomach pains for awhile but never got checked out, that night it got bad and everytime I got up, I'd faint to the ground. Rushed to hospital, BP down to 58/28...get to hospital and they immediately send me to the main trauma hospital in our state, telling me it was life or death. I get there and am put into a medically induced coma for 6 days. I wake up to find out my spleen had ruptured (causing the low BP), which was caused by such an inflamed pancreas that it literally took out my spleen. They had to remove the entire spleen, half of my pancreas, and 3/4 of my stomach. It was a long period of get better/get worse. Drs came in and told me I'd never eat, work, drive a car, maybe not live...2.5 months in the SICU and ICU. Then once out of hospital, onto inpatient physical rehab for 3 weeks to re learn how to walk, then an infection caused them to send me back to the hospital for another week as a precaution before finally being released. Was another month before I was allowed to eat real food (I had a feeding tube during this time). 122 days without any food or even allowed to drink water (I still cannot drink soda to this day, nor alcohol obviously). During the stay it was daily CT scans, procedures, 6 total surgeries, 10 transfusions, over 300 needle injection of various medicines,.. a $600,000 hospital stay (thank God for good insurance).. point of the story isn't a woe is me pity request; but just how bad pancreatic issues can be and how unbenownst they are to most heavy drinkers. I mostly binge drank during my drinking career (which thankfully ended that Xmas Eve), but it was never a problem for me to down 18 Heinekens in a sitting. About 6 months before this happened, my best friend surprisingly committed suicide via booze/Xanax binge. That sadness and desire to escape it had me drinking like never before. Easily 35-40 Heinekens a day, I'd consistently drink the first 12 pack in just over an hour. When I went to the fridge I'd grab 3 at a time..so I wouldn't have to get up for another 20 minutes. Stopped eating altogether during this time as well. I'm 6'2"" and normally weigh 250-260, my weight dropped below 190, probably ate every 7-10 days, usually threw it up. Horrible, but as bad as it was I was so fortunate to have this happen to open my eyes to stop, and the months hospitalized meant when I came home I was nearly 4 months sober. Any WD or cravings were just gone. I know better than to think I'm above them every coming back and that is the focus on my own recovery, just constantly checking in with myself, preparing should I one day want to drink again. Thankfully since then I've never so much as even wanted a drink and rarely does it even cross my mind, but pancreatitis is so dangerous. On my hospital discharge, it has ruptured spleen listed as the #2 reason for visit, the 1st was ""alcohol induced pancreatitis"", the shame I have in that is the moral high ground I use to prep myself should I ever want another drink... additionally the Drs had to set a hernia in me to allow everything some room to heal, so I'm going back in 3 weeks from now to have that hernia fixed ..open surger, lots of chances for things to go wrong with it, I'm not yet out of the woods
I've been sober now 14 months. It wasn't immediately better. I mean aside the hospital crap, I wasn't working, money was tight, my dark secret alcoholism was now out to the world. I lived with being the guy who nearly drank himself to death at 38. Straight up,it was a long time before shit was even OK. But, everyday gets better. I recently won back some of the big accounts at work that I thought were done because of addiction and corresponding laziness. I've been in the gym for the last 7 months daily and am in much better physical shape. I'm limited in what I can do because of the hernia, but make the most out of what I can. It took a long time for things to get better, but they do. And I can honestly say now that my life is better than ever. I never have the anxiety that once crippled me. I can sleep again like normal, not just on nights i drank. My family is closer than ever as I've been a sober from booze contributor for 14 months now. I just wanted to get this out there as I never knew Reddit when I drank and I'd have loved to at least seem a story like this. It may have not stopped me, but I had so many questions and I hope this story of my past can help any of you out there struggling right now. PM me anytime of you have any specific questions or worries for yourself!",5.858649336870028,6.012811711794875,6.4210088417329825,78.9681923076923,66.75384615384615,9.677984084880636,30.65649867374005,9.494082108488547,2.5914127320954914,3909,135,766,72,58,1277,413,975,0.104,0.774,0.123,0.9455,2,0,16,0,0,1,138.0,1,3,6,13,47,40,3,2,50,1,67,54,7,16,15,137,124,60,3,12,26,0,3,3,1,4,18,1,2,2,41,39,32,6,15,12,4,20,18,17,1,3,53,7,77,23,140,64,17,171,1,4,2,1,27,61,2,17,87,490,118,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04584793851880842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797830047196492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03499448832013482,0.0,0.0,0.1143998123815134,0.17640018965464296,0.03217320966188368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293558212386327,0.14046212971109245,0.05127466708867018,0.0,0.1789354882810144,0.0,0.04413584237380734,0.2603697236441439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09620316986188744,0.0,0.1296112435101747,0.0,0.03622806597858395,0.0,0.04544828013043095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16273829684501212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03680404356032085,0.04303853802035618,0.0,0.4531943888175595,0.0,0.1291033071573913,0.0,0.0,0.037249694382703986,0.0,0.0,0.11111203963745782,0.11412789889197615,0.07086905554995833,0.0,0.037797790536821516,0.0,0.03964725130220866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04607098649982316,0.038439001276205656,0.03577335113552208,0.1017100968039707,0.0,0.03249285086603645,0.0,0.19775569753441424,0.0,0.04780350824767077,0.0705502179582059,0.10090959573522076,0.0,0.0,0.041642679491644866,0.0743810845629746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02818967504933473,0.044435142567187766,0.04218623268344825,0.041771726765241386,0.04141731252492177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043896198920125584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02311322600226249,0.03428176968477992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059411688281065786,0.061640240580875486,0.0,0.07427355613019719,0.1116563921224719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03575504600723251,0.03795775390949276,0.0,0.028073129565894583,0.04263882551609533,0.042251541341454237,0.04581200341747403,0.0,0.04236763386449145,0.0,0.0,0.042465211032403714,0.0,0.2685536301672388,0.0,0.06183292972684892,0.0,0.2270566802985704,0.04061855889319091,0.0,0.07893460345474303,0.08241314310268555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957788460826023,0.02849866342532678,0.0,0.044751223463623896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04014781566827085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03975711274623158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04534416434470255,0.040242518572765465,0.0,0.042278532982696536,0.09422610970024876,0.0,0.0,0.04786965651270946,0.053885112932129886,0.04324122395993925,0.04152585202278592,0.0,0.0,0.035916135381180714,0.0,0.033445123143186394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03828677977837255,0.0,0.0,0.04317053011688185,0.03478968199298331,0.0,0.04208700649193605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029767901792957945,0.08965355140938451,0.03358648199484095,0.14064491575850935,0.0,0.043966725011190665,0.0,0.04600313119343119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03675935156977096,0.11616029345564592,0.0,0.0,0.055881117319712716,0.0269481926987114,0.0,0.03338826938150938,0.1716649292224488,0.0,0.0,0.04018691579211192,0.09345293499666896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264685652592341,0.04631944029754804,0.0347011273245883,0.09922436881023827,0.0,0.10120588419699952,0.05121364971627558,0.037813964489614604,0.038986920781772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040541094086596,0.0,0.09185319066408601,0.042710552993893855,0.04285930273297767,0.0,0.04598232678348554,0.0,0.027083093218072483
alcoholism,valentinakaruki,2018/02/14,"Motivation to stop for the non-conformist who cares not about legacy?? I don't flatter myself (ever), I'm sure this toptic in general has been discussed ad nauseum.  However, I still have never seen the same old question answered in a new way.  It's the same old ""legacy"", ""health!"" ""family/friends/children's opinion!"" ""your OWN health/legacy!""  And honestly, maybe i'm a depressed stubborn nihilist, but really?  There MUST be something more.  I have always been a bit of a non-conformist who has no qualms about going against tradition in any walks of life.  So any motivation to stop drinking that revolves around my own legacy or what others think of me has no bearing on me what so ever.  My only motivation conceptually speaking has been health because I still want to live as long as I can, as healthily as I can, and without a painful demise.  However that still doesn't motivate me in the short term (i am in my early 30s).  In the moment, how do you all deal?  The moment when you know your own actions don't really mean shit ni the grand scheme so why not make yourself happy in the moment?  How do you get past that??",3.965398322851154,6.038526839622643,4.922201257861637,80.75036687631028,73.05660377358491,7.7299790356394125,28.28721174004193,8.515128840125781,2.2433953878406707,878,35,159,16,18,286,126,212,0.099,0.77,0.131,0.8424,2,0,2,0,0,0,42.0,0,5,0,4,15,10,2,0,13,0,19,6,1,7,6,34,30,14,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,10,3,1,3,9,1,0,3,9,4,0,0,4,2,19,6,24,24,9,33,0,1,1,0,12,10,1,3,19,113,29,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11267915801451164,0.0,0.0,0.1841786400510138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12055130148831195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254994703982413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478420835617794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380683303421583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13961067332918062,0.11663587762279312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13265871440228585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24498782847305334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07075065106412858,0.0,0.07696153477386455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14415566213648653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4318310508402969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0744225439477442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565019140284617,0.0,0.0,0.1195771415620165,0.11984123648465465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09039299484476956,0.0,0.1360462270405916,0.14751060009266673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10444320473540096,0.13078816795312906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28419816908974405,0.0,0.0,0.10299197917299084,0.14409498244039395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12927241639420406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516998706607483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17350529886775828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139005289636183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10425188629888096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32443650644870925,0.2264320961305843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12763046714190734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08677079760461869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07987342342155401,0.10748901452332674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221942610673728,0.0,0.0,0.13053873812569394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,bud_babe,2018/02/14,"My mom is going to give my dad a heart attack and I’m scared My mom has been an alcoholic for about 10 plus years. She is 65 and my dad is 77, he’s got heart issues now due to the stress of my moms addiction. She’s never happy, always screaming at my dad who still works his ass off as a mechanic even though he should be retired. I’m afraid she’s going to give him a heart attack or at the very least put him in the hospital. We have Baker Act laws in my state...would that constitute harm to herself and others? I want to help her and I fear that maybe this might be my only hope of getting her help and at least some peace for my dad. I don’t want her to regret not being sober before he passes and get even worse. 
They had a huge fight tonight and my dad told her that she’s got one chance and if she doesn’t make an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow he’s done. I’ve never seen him that upset and I don’t know how to help him or my mom. Just needed to vent too...any advice is welcome.

i'm sure my coworkers have noticed--so it's really impacting my life.  not to mention the only time i'm happy is when i'm drinking, and when i'm not--it's all i'm thinking about.  my family has noticed that--activities that don't involve drinking are a drag.

alcoholism,DBsAreNotWorthFixing,2018/02/15,"Strange feeling I am a steady drinker and sometimes I can go weeks at a time where I drink to the point of buzzed/drunk on a daily basis.  I know this is a problem and I intend to curb it someday.  That being said, there are certain days where after a night of heavy drinking I feel, for lack of a better description, 10% dizzy until I have my first drink after work.  Once I start drinking, this feeling goes away and I’m back to “normal.”  

Does anyone have any insight as to what this might be?  I should also add it’s helped a little when I eat lunch, but it never fully goes away until I start drinking again.  It actually scares me a little.  Thank you in advance to anyone willing to offer me help or guidance.

alcoholism,skylinepk,2018/02/16,"Is my parent considered an alcoholic and what should I do? My parent is very high functioning and really doesn’t drink much. It is really only on the evenings on weekends\some weekdays. However, they seem to be a lightweight so a little goes a long way. When they are under the influence, they don’t remember how they act like an idiot and looks to argue and cause problems. When confronting them, they get angry and it seems like they actually don’t remember so its like the person speaking up is just acusing them. For example, lets say they said something and you talk to them the next day, they just get pissed at you saying something and then try to turn it on you.  Unfortuntely, this has gone on for awhile and they hide their drinking, as I see it happen. Unfortunately, sometimes we come home and they are acting strange but they will deny everything. The main problem is they are just speaking aggressively and pretty much causing a lot of problems where none exist. Is this considered an alcholic if it doesnt really happen all the time and they dont drink much but are just a lightweight? Its hard to deal with it when they deny it and then turn it around on you.

alcoholism,Illadiel,2018/02/16,"Roommate has an alcohol abuse problem; escalated to violence - need advice The Situation: Friend (Jane) who is romantically involved with my roommate (Joe) was assaulted while Joe was drunk. 

Joe has a history of alcohol abuse, and has exhibited the following problem behaviors:

Throwing water on our cat in anger while drunk

Cooking while intoxicated and forgetting about the food and dishes. Luckily, no kitchen fires yet.

Missing social events due to intoxication and/or hangover

Drinking to excess more often than not; ie he has trouble stopping himself when he starts drinking, and he drinks more days out of the week than he doesn't

He recognizes that he has a problem, and has successfully undertaken self-prescribed dry-months, including one that just ended fairly recently

The ugly mess: I only have sparse details of the actual encounter because they are on a trip together. 

Joe got drunk and had an argument with Jane about Sally (Joe's on-again-off-again old flame).

Jane knows about Sally, but Sally doesn't know about Jane and thinks that she and Joe are still in a relationship. 

Joe hasn't told Sally, because Sally is emotionally unstable and is coming to visit in a few months.

The Sally situation has been a sore point for their entire relationship, but it came to a head this morning.

Sometime last night / this morning Joe and Jane had an argument about Sally. The argument escalated and Joe hit Jane. 

Jane escaped and called the police. The police are watching Joe while he sleeps off his intoxication. 

Jane does not want to press charges, and just wants to get her things and make a clean break. 

With Jane's permission, I will be making a different post on the domestic violence subreddit for her situation.

This post is about Joe. 

Joe is my friend, and when he has a handle on his drinking, he is a great guy. But, he has not had a good handle on his drinking for some time. I have no concrete proof beyond the situation I just described, but it seems that he is getting worse.

I can only speculate as to why Joe drinks so much, but here are a few background items: he was in the military and saw some terrible things, he is currently involved in a legal dispute with a former employer who screwed him out of money, his work situation has been terrible for the past year because every place that he gets hired at ends up closing up shop, his inability to deal with the Sally situation is coming back to bite him in the ass, and most of all, he has depression.

He needs help. I want to help him. 

Joe gets home tomorrow.

How can I approach this topic and situation without making him throw his guard up? 

I have no experience with this sort of situation, so any advice would be appreciated.

alcoholism,redheadedpsycho11,2018/02/16,"21 &amp; I’m finally ready to admit that I have a problem. Ever since I first started drinking alcohol I’ve loved it. Now, in my final semester of college, I’m realizing it’s slowly ruining my life.

I turned 21 back in September and ever since then the drinking has been constant. I’m at a party school and all my friends drink. But they don’t have the problems I do.

Two days ago for taco Tuesday I went out with my friends and blacked out. I don’t remember the ride home. When I was home, my bff/roommate and I got into a horrible drunken argument. Idk what was even said. I kicked a hole in the wall of our house. This isn’t the first time my roommates have seen me have an aggressive blackout. My other roommate and also best friend witnessed it too. Hasn’t spoken to me. 

The scariest part is I kept saying how badly I wanted to die. I feel anxious and depressed when sober but I know I don’t want to kill myself. When I was obliterated I did though. So what did I do? I drove drunk. Scared everyone. Made a huge scene.

My current roommates and friends don’t want to live with me ever again due to this. I don’t blame them. They said I need to stop drinking.

I feel so out of control. I know I need to stop because this has been a horrible cycle since I came to college and it’s all coming to a head now.

How do I stop when it is my coping mechanism, my way to be social, and at every single one of the social gatherings my friends have?

How do I confess to my parents that there once straight A only child daughter now feels like she is an alcoholic with little motivation to ever do homework and attend class?

I’m supposed to graduate in May but I’m terrified of the real world. I won’t make it out there if I keep going at the rate I am.

But I don’t know what to do.",1.4076056763285043,3.434118703804348,3.306992753623188,89.55998792270529,80.71195652173913,6.154106280193236,24.624396135265695,7.279313950308263,1.0976066425120776,1385,53,293,19,36,465,180,368,0.16,0.736,0.104,-0.9724,2,0,6,0,0,1,39.0,1,0,3,5,24,16,2,1,19,0,35,10,1,7,6,62,68,27,2,8,5,2,3,1,5,2,3,3,3,1,15,20,7,6,11,5,0,7,9,8,0,4,16,8,51,8,36,49,5,54,1,2,2,1,22,17,0,2,30,205,66,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07626516669201881,0.183891296465862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880245634791789,0.0,0.0932192902173419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719548199114396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06615589084761421,0.07183594238289484,0.05244636455761991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09028881553502377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840154611730384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411185536298323,0.0,0.0929736731050996,0.09649598605582102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05548569776871096,0.0,0.07410214031211791,0.0,0.08929113347776538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33712764437903336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05682555215316525,0.3112956803734561,0.07248851205215552,0.08221048544048723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305062083114065,0.061463687343443735,0.0,0.18849509051481014,0.0,0.1463632878869265,0.0,0.0,0.3323535770772609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04889588490852461,0.0,0.068810346912499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829711344625375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1726009871348412,0.0,0.0,0.09927326859738143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07647219221280936,0.09518539253035048,0.0,0.14184837220934446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060769328003320314,0.042032537215482314,0.08623004560272463,0.07597081020650649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07765028277543166,0.08140874975912155,0.05742927925558535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758827719747334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09162486387948326,0.05829979505570933,0.06543377772988311,0.0,0.0,0.09553209962161424,0.09316792439041313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16464846440712685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09792708950687083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746130551043887,0.0,0.16367868240234784,0.06841878146214744,0.0861364169189078,0.08707239023423555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21350804772567725,0.0,0.0,0.17540445525824105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06089627951553767,0.0,0.0,0.21578827159298367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452931670911472,0.0,0.05016791761452757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09358177965987956,0.08404405755693367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15223767549642575,0.06829087411661294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07975565230931242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,dpcaxx,2018/02/17,"Going to my first AA meeting tonight I have come to the point in my life that it is clear that I am going to hurt someone or myself. I attempted to go to an AA meeting this morning but ended up in an al anon meeting in the same building, I was a little confused by the signs I suppose. 
I caught the last 30 minutes or so of the al anon meeting, so I got to hear a few different people speak. The stories that I heard were pretty hard hitting, the sadness, frustration and yet love from these people was something to remember. 
At the end of the meeting the host / moderator, I'm not sure what the position is called...got me over to the right room and introduced me to a few folks. 
I walked out with a pamphlet and a list of peoples phone numbers, I'm not quite sure what to do with the numbers...I don't know any of the people and I'm not craving a drink as I'm still basking in the glow of shame from my disaster last night. So I'm just camped out waiting until the next meeting, about four hours off still.

alcoholism,earlyygreyy,2018/02/17,"Is blackout drinking a sign of alcoholism? My spouse of 13 years suddenly had several episodes of blackout drinking within a few months. He also got in an alcohol related physical fight. These instances were totally out of character and nothing I have seen in our 13 years together. His parents are recovered alcoholics, and he has always enjoyed his beer and could drink a 6 pack an evening or just a few, or none for weeks.

alcoholism,11cg,2018/02/17,"is it common for alcoholics to talk about their accomplishment of ""sobriety"" while still actively drinking? What is the thought process? My 30 year old brother has been an alcoholic literally his entire teenage and adult life. Until the last 2 years, he completely denied there was a problem even as we watched him stumbling drunk, falling asleep anywhere and everywhere including in public, and basically every other 100% sure sign of alcoholism you can think of.

I will spare you the gut wrenching play by play details, but in the last 2 years there has been some level of acknowledgment that there's a problem, although he resists anything that I would consider a genuine shot at quitting the drinking, especially any kind of real treatment plan. He has claimed to have quit drinking a few times now, but it never sticks. (which I know is common and even to be expected.)

But here's the thing. Quite frankly I'm used to the broken promises, the worry, and the lies: except one. And it's still such a fucking mind fuck that it throws me for a loop.

And it is this: He can look you square in the eye, with tears streaming down in his face, crying about how no one acknowledges all the work he has put into sobriety...WHILE the unmistakable smell oozes from his very pores. He did this to me about a year ago and few things that have resulted from all of this have fucked me up as much as his ability to produce genuine tears over this.

Today, he and my mom came over for a visit. He lives with her and she has mentioned that she is pretty sure he is still drinking regularly, just not as much as he used to. Yet, on their way over, he was talking about how he had 60 days sober. He then asked to stop at a convenience store to go to the bathroom, went in and bought one of those fruity beer drinks that looks like an energy drink. He brought it to my house and drank it right in front of us while claiming it was a red bull.

I was unwilling to play along with the lie, so I waited until my mom wasn't around (she's too emotional) and I told him that I know he is still drinking and that I'm not mad but that I do not believe he has any real chance at sobriety unless he gets professional help. Luckily, he didn't try to argue or deny what I said.

I know that the things that addicts do don't make logical sense, but I'm just looking for some insight here. Is the lying just a really ineffective method of ""throwing us off the tracks"" so he can continue drinking in peace, or is there some other kind of emotional issue going on here which causes alcoholics to brag about sobriety while actively drinking? Is there anything else I should be doing besides straight-forwardly letting him know that I know it's not true?",7.626523617307553,6.85445974952199,7.193889951136607,77.98669357694219,63.35946462715105,10.57797606401813,34.85794207209121,9.816601858774405,3.134146576021529,2151,81,417,37,27,675,261,523,0.11,0.7929999999999999,0.097,-0.8691,0,0,15,0,0,0,57.0,3,3,2,8,31,18,5,0,30,0,42,25,4,8,6,77,73,38,0,5,16,3,0,1,0,3,6,1,0,1,35,22,16,2,11,14,2,11,9,8,0,3,18,9,38,10,69,49,9,62,0,0,7,3,52,22,3,5,29,283,73,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708540653686156,0.0,0.0,0.05761408229509689,0.2778392481778965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08839755991768174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10697057599215076,0.057859265838405324,0.060761484212823326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07322702717108734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433688303418358,0.0,0.0667676949561581,0.0,0.0,0.06814594565561362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139387672002755,0.041916351803921635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5730325724284623,0.0,0.0,0.05429492255854903,0.14622109233264247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585707421155886,0.0,0.054761030231368635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18026029146780345,0.033957167426820034,0.0,0.07387623102923427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043564730349789055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499542077669574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06783781884641138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536443209865426,0.17859756392013842,0.1059590825092718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06646171764333249,0.045907839928283165,0.03175323890635315,0.0,0.05739171237818728,0.0,0.16373811093479373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04338461927895655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06562634952818351,0.15224254879367416,0.0,0.0,0.09555750130405284,0.0,0.05012809545143282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06820124384034892,0.0,0.13212673632607802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06612320809550055,0.0,0.12438273709439435,0.0,0.06533785457804715,0.0,0.20739031962894336,0.0,0.14795691502392302,0.041637415306274864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05550531357134538,0.06182506042348145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2076201345269245,0.0543386702699226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12251390132290603,0.0,0.0,0.10448092267393216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12953922686680613,0.04164612562148786,0.0,0.051598713000627565,0.037899065318892325,0.0,0.06160759229254675,0.06210543920811715,0.0,0.04412728988042917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15636179206201986,0.11226949972899228,0.0,0.0536276225988303,0.0,0.051589948754027816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06025094961378659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04731708182807524,0.06600550453359243,0.0,0.04617053221000012,0.0,0.0,0.1674184113181358
alcoholism,makei_train,2018/02/18,"Just tryna see if anyone relates Hey what's going on, I'm an alcoholic, been trying to go sober for probably 5 years now. I'm constantly on and off, I will go 6/7 months sober then it'll all come crashing down and i go on a mad bender.

Just wondering if anyone else can relate to having this crazy destructive side in them. When I am sober I like to shoplift, do graffiti, sometimes get into altercations, anything anti social. I feel like it's a backwards way of trying to connect with people but was just wondering if anyone else has previous experience with this stuff.

I just really like to feel a rush, and I have deep down anger about when i was a kid being shouted at by teachers, or authority figures. Now I'm an adult I feel like I can do whatever I want, and that I have to prove that to the world.

Sorry if this doesn't make too much sense, I'm just trying to figure it all out myself, was just wondering if anyone else has had any experience with this",6.7915544041450815,5.850459269430053,7.588813471502592,75.02995595854925,65.11398963730569,10.82880829015544,31.735233160621767,10.125756701596842,2.944187979274612,761,24,149,15,10,256,112,193,0.08,0.85,0.07,-0.4069,0,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,1,0,12,7,3,0,7,0,19,1,0,1,3,36,38,14,0,6,13,0,3,4,0,2,1,1,0,2,11,10,1,0,9,0,0,6,1,3,0,0,5,5,14,4,25,30,3,29,0,0,1,0,5,14,0,9,12,101,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12755968319765398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08116898395380971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3338375229957085,0.366895686930989,0.09822321989795003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10281818631962823,0.0,0.12898590107238067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2991302272618512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335142283578448,0.0,0.0,0.18105620991823831,0.1705418067384136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06236074345380348,0.0,0.27134045856306105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332533288630493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07967381609571741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09527211996242953,0.0,0.08774343202728334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08274928786967742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869041203738316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07646515804328477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09511457295547522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167262493770042,0.0,0.0,0.1180502242664457,0.1336138975263507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366387964321507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24311308734529144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07040169937452287,0.0947425183793098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3883229203268493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686401273128299

alcoholism,kookookachu26,2018/02/19,"Is it painful to be an alcoholic? Recently, there's a friend of mine at school who was sober for 6 months. He didn't so much as touch a drop of alcohol for 6 months. After winter break, he came back, and everyday by noon, he is drunk out of his mind. It's gotten so bad that he's passed out on the floor, and then woke up and immediately starts chugging his flask. 

My question for you guys who know, is it painful for someone to be an alcoholic? I would imagine constantly being dizzy and constantly recovering from hangovers has to take a toll on how you feel every day. What is it you feel every day when you drink? Do you just get used to it?",3.240916030534353,4.5623418320610725,4.201442748091605,88.27285114503815,73.42748091603053,7.9880916030534355,25.31374045801527,8.548686976883017,1.4580680916030535,504,16,111,9,10,163,87,131,0.131,0.845,0.024,-0.9253,0,0,4,0,0,0,15.0,0,5,0,0,7,4,0,0,6,0,12,7,0,2,0,17,22,10,0,1,1,0,3,0,1,1,5,0,0,1,9,7,5,0,5,2,0,2,1,3,0,0,5,3,10,1,21,13,1,26,0,0,0,0,16,7,0,1,15,71,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5000320369952561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1199261574474404,0.1302228482787786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17838047619852931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370818597228862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011668633415884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15278466679865854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2628116286581905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15771947023204633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204968655160208,0.0,0.08148439171392106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15442819625520826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08571335573842025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15747848177364832,0.0,0.24897685025789398,0.0,0.1146509773561542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33191191364560363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747145997662605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15399495191288462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784319501658536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214720544904549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11039163272649184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11726499836462913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13470222322221326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107918597847598,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,trashtaker,2018/02/20,"""The shakes"" question Hi there,

I've just discovered this sub.  The reason I went looking for a sub like this is that last night, I started shaking really badly.  Uncontrollably.  I've been a regular drinker for years, but just moved houses and decided that enough is enough.  To my unpleasant surprise, I think I'm suffering from alcohol withdrawl because I was shaking uncontrollably for a LONG time.  Was pacing around my apartment (kinda freaking out), and just shaking as if I was cold.  I could feel my heartbeat going pretty fast, too.

My question is, is this normal?  Also, how long will this last before I start feeling better or not shaking like a crazy person?  Any help is appreciated!",5.145299334811528,7.749588422764231,5.46359201773836,75.80740576496676,71.27642276422766,7.724759793052478,31.507021433850703,8.575989854853784,2.9176081300813004,548,25,86,10,11,174,81,123,0.184,0.618,0.198,0.6021,0,0,2,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,8,14,0,7,6,0,11,1,0,2,0,22,20,8,0,3,7,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,6,4,1,0,7,0,0,8,1,10,0,0,5,4,11,4,8,13,2,21,0,1,1,0,5,3,0,5,12,57,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17718391384554408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258581272958073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1127459546721944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475922676973903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843149372267546,0.10106679672046832,0.0,0.1410789198408742,0.0,0.0,0.1466317742455029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323734283906471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3426201046994156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16766137541878065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422484288854843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11112856775453177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1913046088463395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27028931397704953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619976496077445,0.0,0.0,0.2934458548030576,0.1392256351175018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17621332988678087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15558691990677131,0.16244342194655498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14476537439609774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16867262466651342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714555984680338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10621221090627844,0.17046437315120433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2347004203148516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10623442990881876,0.0,0.0,0.09667611423983814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536931752514103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10676623105514993

alcoholism,Foals-Forever,2018/02/22,"Need Advice Hello, I need some advice about my situation.
     So, I am a 19 y/o male. I have never craved a drink or had withdraw symptoms; therefore I don't consider myself an alcoholic. However, within the last year I have lost about 40 pounds and have also significantly decreased my regular alcohol consumption. With this, my tolerance has significantly decreased. In the last 2 months I have gone to some big festive cultural events/parties. At these parties I drank my regular amount and got blackout drunk. At the first event in January I really just did careless/reckless things, however after the fact I was very embarrassed at the stories my friends told me from that night. This month at the second event, I was mindful of what happened and told myself that I was not going to get that trashed and enjoy myself. However, I ended up blacking out again and there was a big portion of the night I don't remember. Now 4 days after the event I was embarrassed at the dumb drunk things I was doing, but I found out that I violated a girl. This is a girl that a had a 'thing' with about 4-5 years ago and lost touch; I set my good mate up with her and they have been dating for about 4 months now. So the guy leaves for a minute and comes back him, as well as another one of my friends saw me do it apparently. This is something that myself and anyone that knows me would never expect out of me and I have no recollection of even talking to her that night. I am seeking guidance of how to go about repairing my relationship with these people ( I already talked and apologized to my mate and he told me not to talk to the girl). In addition, I am abstaining from alcohol for 40 days and re-evaluating my relationship with it.

alcoholism,supersandysandman,2018/02/23,"Not sure if I should worry about my mother. I am worried that my mother is an alcoholic. First off, she is a extreme lightweight because she is small. Because of this 1-2 drinks has her quite drunk. She can wake up the next morning and go to work completely fine. Just about every night she will come home from work and spike her drink and proceed to get a bit drunk watching tv until she falls asleep. When I ask her if her drink is spiked she usually says no when it is. The parts that concern me is that she does it alone reguarly, tries to hide it, and is very defensive when accused of excessive drinking. In social settings she also tends to get drunk even when we ask her not too, probably because she is a lightweight, but it is quite embarassing as she usually gets emotional too. 

She has a very stressful job and she is grinding through the last 5 years to retirement. The correlation between higher stress days and more drinking is apparent and concerning. Me and my brother over the last year or so have not handled this very well and usually digress into yelling at her. I don’t blame her for being defensive we are pretty confrontational and ruthless. I’m not really sure how to handle it though as I try other ways but always come back to yelling and I know it’s not helping. The argument usually comes down to us asking her to stop then she goes on about how much she does for us and that my father is fat and he won’t change so why should she. Oversimplified, but she is dodging the issue which is also concerning. About 5 years ago we had troubles and were essentially homeless staying at grandparents for a year and a half and that hit us all hard especially my mother. I think she is still dealing with it and what not. I am seeing the signs and understanding what the causes may be. I am not sure though if she is considered an alcoholic. If so I am not really sure how to help or where to go as I have talked to my father about it and he thinks its normal (sounds like denial). I’ve been working on being more calm in  addressing it but it is going nowhere and I don’t know what action to take.

alcoholism,mattyc5063,2018/02/25,"Mom's Heavy Drinking I started to notice my moms heavy drinking about 2 years ago. I noticed that at night her personality and mood would be completely different when she was drinking. I hate to sound mean but I absolutely hate her personality when she drinks. She doesn't eat very much and I can start to see the effects after just one drink. I can't remember the last day she went without drinking under 2 drinks a night. I have spoken to her about 5 times and all she does is make excuses. In fact, the day after I speak with her she drinks even heavier than usual. At this point I don't know what to do. I want to tell her she needs to get treatment but I'm afraid she'll get mad at me and play the victim game like I'm the bad guy. How can I go about speaking to her in a way that might make a difference?

alcoholism,MaverickOCD,2018/02/25,"Just looking for hobbies and a way to meet sober people who do sober things Never posted here before so thanks for reading. I recently quit drinking about 2-3 weeks ago. I had a bad habit for a year or two of spending too much time on the computer and subsequently getting plastered because I didn't realize how much I would drink. When I started waking up with the shakes I immediately recognized a problem. My family said they don't think I'm an alcoholic, just that I need better habits and hobbies. I don't know how true this is, as I can hold my liquor just fine in a social setting and no one has told me I need to think about quitting, but I just decided to go all the way anyway and stop.

I feel better already, and I substituted some of my computer time for more gym time. I'm also trying to read more, but tonight I was invited to hang out with a friend who is a known alcoholic in our friend circle. I know that if I go over there he will definitely drink and want to play videogames but otherwise it might be pretty boring. Video games, tv, and computer stuff in general is more boring now, and I realize I was using the alcohol to help make them more fun.

A coworker of mine a long time ago told me my whole friend group would change if I stopped, and I'm starting to believe it. I don't want to hang out with him, mostly because of the alcohol. I need a good way to be sociable, and it's not that I can't have fun without it. I just feel like I dropped off a cliff a bit here, and am out of ideas for what to do and how to meet people or have fun that doesn't involve the computer. Maybe rock climbing or something? I'm not sure. Really just looking for more activities that you guys like to do when you think about doing something besides work or gym. Honestly, if I were still living outside the city I could work on my garden, take care of the animals, and do more target shooting which I'd love. This apartment living has me so cramped.

Thanks for the input",6.426015037593984,5.5571795213032615,6.902706766917294,79.41466165413534,65.81704260651628,10.306766917293233,33.285714285714285,9.606745405546679,2.8333037593984964,1555,57,321,27,21,510,203,399,0.049,0.745,0.206,0.9972,0,0,9,1,0,0,35.0,1,2,2,7,24,25,0,1,22,0,31,11,1,5,4,76,64,33,0,12,19,0,2,2,3,4,5,1,1,1,17,20,8,3,12,14,1,6,11,5,0,2,8,5,41,20,45,49,13,44,0,0,2,1,24,12,0,10,22,219,58,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15155043686439135,0.3654198571085949,0.0,0.0,0.09433223856929718,0.068360450577507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137444866971138,0.10421886957585604,0.0,0.07273944571264425,0.09630968259823673,0.0,0.1512049283409565,0.09332492252911276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715526677166635,0.0,0.0904293173814456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825094648497851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512213832382493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058544203437824,0.0,0.08644520052419828,0.061068827829429385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19813106815685927,0.0,0.0446611605462456,0.0,0.09716352877955993,0.0716987976852135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08464127080969155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05729722364207308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09649951569798372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09395806635044317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835250174335718,0.0,0.1509655059462776,0.07564946219152746,0.1435678064286374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715143615159574,0.0,0.05706033788097591,0.0,0.08587881943395201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906835912384492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12567917852204766,0.19015292288814672,0.0659294955522625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057925261249850875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11852582332899535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08186875660589009,0.08696659457683474,0.0,0.08179535885208572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18184265772748934,0.1710115812896697,0.0,0.05476237951035682,0.0,0.08440381189613423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131358292192553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713880456622965,0.0,0.13161745259483326,0.0,0.0,0.12101013036875224,0.0,0.06826656096038533,0.14293465920115347,0.0,0.0,0.09785719166133283,0.0,0.0,0.08056639335305113,0.0,0.06427232023532661,0.0,0.0,0.15740189273339525,0.0,0.0,0.056790879476847064,0.16432150648478516,0.0,0.0,0.19938250084108453,0.0,0.0,0.16336468565856244,0.0,0.0580371134332014,0.0,0.08350413557767962,0.0,0.0,0.07382957018792706,0.0,0.0,0.10083977272731873,0.2035564646705269,0.0685690318716661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954383346983564,0.0,0.0824022316862016,0.0,0.12446478597825762,0.0,0.0,0.12144885500124415,0.0,0.0,0.05504802897937744
alcoholism,eoganharl,2018/02/26,"21 or an alcoholic? I could easily have 1-2 drinks every night but love having more than a couple if I’m in the right company. My dad is a binge drinker and we’re close so that doesn’t help. I’m a recovering anorexic and have suffered from several other EDs, and my stomach feels better when I have a slight buzz eating a meal. Lately I’ve been drinking every night but only getting drunk 2-3 times a week. I work 20-30 hours a week and go to school full time. 
I have noticed that I’m gaining a bit of fat but no actual weight. Some times I think I drink too much

alcoholism,WorldTravelerGypsy,2018/02/26,What’s the difference between appreciation and addiction? I usually go anywhere from having 1-4 drinks every night. I’m a 21 year old female and I know that the official definition of alcoholism in women is more than 7 drinks a week. It doesn’t affect my relationships or job but that definition still worries me. Is it time for AA? ,3.856190476190477,6.394059301587305,6.111349206349207,69.94892857142858,75.03174603174604,9.914285714285716,29.54761904761905,10.125756701596842,3.727742857142857,268,12,46,9,6,94,53,63,0.07,0.893,0.037000000000000005,-0.4423,1,0,3,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,0,1,0,6,7,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,5,2,3,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,6,7,1,9,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,7,29,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2644382459426661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25923467856064525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25343511538572244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4752545563826099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043765690092734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785871600021912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24071433471292536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13331070359046462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276364952939945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545375088701465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2604305246810103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19371755138908064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14144512814692475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671577379712468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1945758621561008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24634267279679897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15620780119373925
alcoholism,skepses,2018/02/27,"Suicidal alcoholic friend. Waukesha, WI. My friend who is struggling with alcohol addiction is going through an extremely difficult situation, he's extremely depressed and he confided in me that he's considering suicide very soon, he really hates being an alcoholic and it severely affects his mental state, he confided in me that he feels like he's damaged himself to the point of no return and there's no going back, but i heard him out and I told him that there's always hope that he can get better, which he then told me he wishes he could do. Unfortunately his mother is also an alcoholic and either encourages his alcoholism or thinks she's helping by buying him more alcohol.
I'm doing  the best that i can to try to help him unfortunately, I live at the opposite end of the country, and verbal queues and words isn't my forte. I've asked explicit permission from him if I can provide help in any way. I was wondering if there is anyone from Waukesha county Wisconsin that can or knows of any evidence based treatments centers or any place that can help him, preferably with home visits because I doubt anyone in his home is in the right state to drive, he also doesn't have insurance. Any information or help is welcome, private messages are also welcome.

alcoholism,ExtraConsideration,2018/02/27,"Withdrawals? 27/M/225lb here (weight for context)...wondering if I am experiencing alcohol withdrawals. approximately 48 hours since my last drink (had one 20z beer, 6%).

I don't drink everyday (usually 2-3 times a week, 2-3 drinks each time), but over the last ~7 days I've had 3-4 drinks every night (except one night, I believe). These drinks are always 6-7% beer. This is after ~10 days of having no alcohol at all (with no side effects except the morning after hangover).

Anyway, yesterday I was fine, a bit tired but no issues. I didn't sleep very well last night, lots of tossing and turning. Today, woke up with a slight headache (probably 1 or 2/10) but no other issues.

Right now, though, still the same headache (1/10), but feeling really nauseous. No sweating, no shakes, no craving for alcohol. Definitely anxiety (I have GAD anyway) and mostly due to me thinking this is alcohol withdrawal. My heart rate is normal though (I have a chest strap monitor) at 65-70BPM.

The only ""saving grace"" possibility it seems like it could be, is food poisoning, as I cooked some chicken earlier (expiry date on the package was today) that had a slight smell to it (though not super strong, it was kind of a, yeah its getting to that date better cook it now).

Is there any other way to really tell? It doesn't seem like one bad week of everyday drinking after a week of zero drinking would cause worse withdrawal symptoms than anything Ive felt before.

I do have alcohol and Xanax at my disposal if I need it, but I guess at this point going to see if I vomit or if any other symptoms show up.

alcoholism,zZChicagoZz,2018/03/01,"Supporting my alcoholic father My dad (56 years old), is an alcoholic. He's also in poor health. He suffers from heart disease (has already had a quadruple bypass about 3-4 years ago), and has breathing issues because he smokes. 

He isn't managing his finances well, and doesn't have anything to do with his free time other than go to the bar. He also lives alone, which doesn't help things. 

The last couple of times he has had to go to the hospital for medical issues he has started suffering from withdrawals and delirium tremens. Honestly, I think that has been the hardest thing I've had to see in my whole life. He has to have someone hold a straw up to his face to drink, can barely talk, and even when he can talk doesn't appear to be fully conscious or coherent.

Frankly it's terrifying. He's in the hospital right now going through this. Each time I go visit him I've gotta take a day off work and rent a car. I went to see him yesterday (first day of withdrawals), but feel I can't go see him today just because I need a mental health day after seeing him yesterday. 

I don't know if I can keep seeing him like this. Those who have helped loved ones through alcoholism, or those who have suffered from it yourself... how can I support him? Is it fucked up if I can't bare going to see him during withdrawals? 

Once his withdrawals are through and I'm taking him home from the hospital, I'm considering telling him that if he drinks again, I won't be able to visit him during withdrawals the next time he's in the hospital.

I just have to find things to do soon that I can do instead of drinking.  ,2.7504347826086963,4.634501652173917,4.286304347826088,84.81467391304352,75.95652173913044,8.078260869565218,28.89130434782609,8.841846274778883,2.4269304347826086,270,12,54,6,6,90,52,69,0.029,0.754,0.217,0.9255,1,0,3,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,0,9,5,1,0,1,1,6,3,0,0,0,12,9,5,0,0,5,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,3,2,0,4,1,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,1,7,4,9,8,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,41,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30195918675481553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802129023312522,0.19756498374927006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18222087175152168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2952037966598009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767906673281781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18662109457962928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14286537494532836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582448676532059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16057923269224522,0.23698887971368424,0.0,0.3115115117932165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3052016425614812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19957286958304468,0.13803927645031042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21244184924889592,0.0,0.24696047155183065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18771314638025607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,mellowyellowbay,2018/03/01,"I drink, smoke, eat to not think. Hello there, 
I’m curious as to why we do things to forget. I drink and smoke, but I don’t do it to please others. I do it to forget. I do it to feel free. How does one feel free with out chemicals? I know that I used to be able to do it. But it seems like the older I’ve got, the more that I want to be alone.

alcoholism,luciferav,2018/03/01,"I know people who have to ask if they are obviously are. Deep down inside I know I’m on the brink of alcoholism. I’m not addicted to the point where I can have withdrawals, but I drink almost every night and I started probably at 17 (can’t quite remember but it’s been a little while of drinking maybe a year or two more) and now I’m 19. I can go without drinking forever if it’s not in the house, but the instant it’s bought, I drink. And honestly I like it. I like thinking back on the day (I’m a sous chef so I can have some rough days) and being able to laugh or just rant about what pissed me off earlier freely, However, I’m feeling that night. And lately I’ve been drinking a lot more and it kind of worries me. Like 5 or 6 double shots of vodka till I can start to half way feel the affect. It’s added to my weight gain because liquor makes me so hungry. It makes me less functional in the morning well because sometimes I just can’t drink enough water to keep up. I guess I’m worried about my own health and that’s why I’m posting here today. Maybe someone has a similar story. Maybe I need to work it out on my own because alcoholism runs in my genes for many generations. Maybe inspiration stories will  help me stop it. Maybe it’s something personal. I think it all goes in to deep thought and caring more about continuing what you have to offer the world to quit. I fully believe I have control over my mind and body as well, but I still hate this world as well. I don’t know. Maybe I really do need help.

alcoholism,zalein1,2018/03/01,"Liver issues? Hey what's up guys, I've had a drinking problem for 3 years now.  I started when i was 16 and now im 19. I am somewhat healthy. I used to drink a pint of vodka a night, then just half a pint, and now I'm drinking a 4th of a pint of everclear once every three days. I've slowed down because at first I was having sharp pain in my side every now and then. Now it's to the point where it's discomfort in my liver. I can't sit in a chair without feeling like my side is being squeezed. It'll stop some days when I havnt drank in a couple days but as soon as I drink there it is again.  Sometimes it feels like pain in my upper right back.  I'm worried that it may be cancer or hepatitis. I'm not sure if I'm far enough for it to be cirrhosis. Surely if I drank every night for 3 years my liver would have been inflamed already and now I'm on to the next stage of liver destruction. I also noticed bright blood in my stool at work about a month ago. Now I'm just afraid my insides are wrecked. I've started a diet and have lost 20 pounds. I'm not sure if it's my diet or loss of appetite due to my liver not working properly. I don't have jaundice and my legs are not swelling which I guess is common on alcoholics. This road sucks, sometimes I feel like even if I had a fresh liver I would just end up ruining it again. Any alcoholics  have these issues early on? Thanks for the help! I don't usually reach out for it.",1.7549837133550523,3.06835711074919,3.382261889250813,92.68545798045605,77.24104234527687,6.214931596091205,23.029185667752447,6.742157984588678,0.486554762214984,1111,33,255,10,25,369,155,307,0.18,0.7559999999999999,0.064,-0.9843,1,0,7,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,5,21,18,2,2,14,0,26,22,8,1,3,37,45,20,0,7,15,0,5,3,0,4,6,0,0,1,15,7,10,1,3,5,0,0,8,10,0,3,8,6,26,8,34,30,3,60,0,3,1,0,3,23,1,10,38,159,41,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09013241313282784,0.21732813318989225,0.0,0.0,0.1122054475643694,0.08131276294388354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914529463148672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818497413277715,0.0,0.06198265345320478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11250602257252043,0.0,0.1967238800295985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3984273481545805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005752857130098,0.10506172108343738,0.0,0.06715810592604587,0.0,0.2570071553919226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542360686291343,0.21791877080703936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08648821541672468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120110243004988,0.10067832395010656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06815337704756941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10983090784092144,0.21225318778756408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14902585965461268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11099478080425658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115931091015392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10813690750630474,0.19083794977900725,0.0,0.0,0.11576236260193212,0.0,0.10828495422785124,0.0,0.0,0.2163875249160328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09611964276191944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729319464781218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868334208337362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011265175590104,0.0,0.1439380220779351,0.0,0.0,0.08500830496217031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2874941280499337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09361248121264143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781812127076613,0.11198519577492157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801505219088964,0.0,0.14804723420651775,0.10326009139902226,0.0,0.1444598722374657,0.0,0.0,0.1309560511410949
alcoholism,IroquoisPliskin-,2018/03/01,"Withdrawal questions Hey there

22/M/5'7/140 lbs

So I've always drank what I'm aware is probably too much,  but I've never felt any physical repercussions from not drinking. About 6 weeks ago I injured my leg and it led to depression. Since then I've been going through about a 1.75ml a week. Only one or two days without drinking. This weekend I made a conscious choice to at least go this week without drinking. Yesterday I started getting splitting headaches, leading to nausea/dizziness. No shaking or throwing up or any other symptoms. Though the headaches are pretty debilitating right now. 

Does this sound like mild withdrawal? Any tips or do I just have to tough it out? I googled a bit but some personal experience might help.",3.854318181818183,7.0276442045454575,3.629015151515155,83.73852272727272,80.43939393939394,6.330303030303031,32.49242424242424,7.6454224807358475,2.686824242424243,593,32,98,10,16,179,100,132,0.115,0.7859999999999999,0.099,-0.504,0,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,1,8,4,0,1,5,0,6,7,1,3,1,21,14,10,0,0,10,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,7,2,4,0,3,4,0,6,5,3,0,2,4,2,6,1,13,9,4,21,0,1,0,0,4,4,0,7,12,59,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13310040164022185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124938223301254,0.0,0.0,0.30632486695167704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639267418645905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968354096454922,0.0,0.12932541900515035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13139874401543275,0.0,0.0,0.441274439077248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468771515273743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416915642868056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844805372277268,0.0,0.17066931607610997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10064350373933408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07335652471502091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.142077146880495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592872005616936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11037875894786103,0.0,0.11580622952338335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10174666199568656,0.11419711612058765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311066523555157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275823556769702,0.161888903146145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682042415771602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822871137081787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420701847833787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10627812949842412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15606508400011052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14752325986240974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14667637011108042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36132785379034416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2894817160652096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,throwdave,2018/03/02,"I have no memory of drinking This past tuesday I wasn't feeling well and spent the day sleeping. When I woke up my wife and mother were waiting for me. They said I had been drinking all day, stumbling around, and telling them to leave. I have ZERO memory of this at all. They have recounted nights where they say I drank until I went to sleep. I have ZERO memory of this. I do remember having a drink at night before going to bed (I have trouble getting to sleep). How is it possible that I don't have any memory of the events they are recounting to me? 

BTW, after these events I have not had any problems that I would normally associate with drinking too much. No throwing up, no headaches, no nausea. I have had trouble with my hands shanking but I had attributed it to nerves after learning of my wife's affair recently.

alcoholism,Grimcicle,2018/03/02,"I Don’t Know What to Do Hi all,

Coming here for some information or support from those who have struggled. I’ve always been a moderately heavy social drinker, but two years ago after a divorce and a really unpleasant living situation (which I won’t go into, but it culminated in a suicide attempt) I began drinking daily. For the past year I’ve been trying off and on to stop but a couple months ago I made my most valiant effort to stop drinking in a while and ceased drinking during the week. I did this for a few weeks but some unrelated disasters in my life occurred and I’ve been going hard ever since. Last night I passed out on the couch incredibly early before my partner even got home from work and I’ve just had enough of it. My partner has been supportive and kind but I feel like I’m losing her and just don’t want to put her through this crap anymore. I’ve tried going to meetings. I’ve seen numerous councillors. Nothing works. What can I do? I want to stop but just seemingly can’t.",4.081363636363633,5.566228045454547,5.172141414141418,81.49154545454549,71.57575757575758,7.906262626262626,27.84646464646465,8.447377352677275,1.9753228282828283,795,29,153,13,15,262,121,198,0.17,0.755,0.075,-0.9699,0,0,4,0,1,1,16.0,0,0,0,5,6,7,1,1,10,0,15,5,1,1,2,35,31,15,1,2,10,0,2,1,2,1,1,0,2,2,9,10,3,3,4,3,0,6,4,3,0,1,10,3,15,4,22,20,6,32,0,1,1,0,10,8,1,5,19,99,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22307107208235555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10469579006684736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247837679435981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706710236879803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838638232179493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13922205230425092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3697793582681248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001000385045666,0.0,0.08310567845257817,0.1138151664899924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06362048159109593,0.08988881310129976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2145263284680168,0.0,0.10063308402718207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1127137430784627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621190286689285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310265120400771,0.06914967394760149,0.10256349311936168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887333323591623,0.06147133446166304,0.0,0.11110504844345973,0.0,0.0,0.14076506308264924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11905787316368573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043165308085678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180774611805466,0.0,0.1207316858371519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12011340878584326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264880450029002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08060618603222511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11454559990539293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040830547116206,0.14143164034170613,0.0,0.12826189720559586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155839236635593,0.0,0.13153874317544784,0.0,0.13763122128789435,0.2855675569629861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17085270596341556,0.0,0.12291193237068185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14842871242233555,0.0,0.20185712120313515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183202990496918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1620532819900508
alcoholism,Fishtacosforme,2018/03/02,"I believe my fiancee has a drinking problem and I need help Please let me know if there's a better subreddit for non-alcoholic people who are trying to deal with alcoholics in their life because that's what I need.

My background:  I'm a 28 y/o male who comes from a family with an alcoholic ""functioning"" dad.  As far as being provided for, I always had food, clothes, presents on my birthday, etc, but my father was never ""around"" even when he was home.  You could never have a conversation with the man because he was there but checked the fuck out.  He would have a drink or two at the bar before coming home and would continue drinking at home in secret until 8 or so, typically while out doing yardwork, at which point he would pass out for the night.  This went on for pretty much my entire childhood.  My mom always treated my dad harshly with passive aggression and a cold shoulder.  Until I realized my dad had a drinking problem, I assumed my mom was being cruel towards my dad, and in some sense she was cruel regardless...But I've since learned that the drinking came first and then her emotions hardened.  So I grew up for about 15 years in a household where my parents hardly spoke and my dad worked/cared for the house, and my mom barely tolerated him out of necessity.

Flash forward to now:

I'm 28, engaged, own a house with the woman of my dreams.  She shares my sense of humor, my interest in TV, video games,and card games and all had been going well until recently.  

During the first 4 years of our relationship she has always had migraines that would leave her incapacitated some weekends and they were often drinking induced, but as far as I could tell she was drinking responsibly enough the night before.

Over the past year she's changed her habits.  She has a drink more nights of the week than she doesn't, and typically has anywhere from 3 glasses of wine just alongside dinner to as much as 4-5 shots of whiskey in a night.  These may not sound like a lot but she's not a big girl and I can tell when it's really starting to get her buzzed. Off the top of my head these have been the kind of ""problem"" incidents I've seen:

1) skipping going out with our friends because she doesn't feel well or is too busy, and then when I come home she's drunk and hasn't done what she said she was going to do.  This has happened a few times

2) being so hungover she couldn't stomach food or leave the couch until 4PM

3) blacked out on multiple occasions despite a stated goal of not drinking too much

4) Ordering shots alone at the bar when we're with friends.

5) Drinking heavily when I go to my office for an hour or two of my own hobbies. 

6) For my birthday we planned to have some people over and she had planned to make a few of my favorite snacks for the party, but she ended up not getting them made because she drank, felt like crap the next day, and overslept.

So here we are.  We've spoken before about how she needs to drink less.  Most of the time SHE'S the one who brings it up, so she knows it's a potential problem.  Her family uses alcohol pretty heavily socially, so I understand it's engrained in her upbringing as much as a disdain for alcoholism is in mine.  But she never does anything about it.  A lot of the times it comes down to her being lonely, but she never wants to do anything about it.  She doesn't have her own friends and won't hang out with my friends who are girls when I try to get her to.  She doesn't have her own hobbies, she just sits around and watches TV every night.  I can watch some TV but I can't sit there for hours on end without more actively engaging my brain.  

What it ultimately boils down to is I feel like I have to hang out with her from the time she gets home until bed time in order to keep her drinking in check (not even stopped completely), and it's frustrating, and I resent her for this feeling of obligation.  And I resent her for this feeling of constant doubt and worry that she's drinking too much when I'm not around her.  And I resent her for making me feel some of the same ways I did growing up with my alcoholic dad, even though she knows what I've been through.  And I'm afraid that I'm going to end up in the same hell my mom lived in for 15+ years.  And I'm afraid that I'm going to become just as cold and passive aggressive as my mom was towards my dad.  And I'm afraid that I am being silly and blowing everything out of proportion because of my childhood experiences.  And I'm just a wreck.  I really just have no idea what to do, so please offer any advice that you can.

alcoholism,chocolatelover94,2018/03/02,"Are most alcoholics depressed? My dad(52) drinks a lot. He's not a severe alcoholic but he drinks almost every day and some days he drinks until he can't even walk. 
I've always thought he was kind of depressed inside, judging by what he says when he's drunk. Normally he's a cheerful guy but when he's drunk he blames himself A LOT and his worthlessness at work. I myself have suffered from depression for years, so one day I tried to talk about depression when he was sober.(I never really talk about this ever because no one in my family understands depression. They think it's a weakness you have to get over).

HE FREAKED OUT and said to me that he was never depressed and never understands people who are depressed or suicidal. I wanted to share the hardships and depressive feelings but I could tell from his expression that he had no idea what I was talking about. He even added that life's full of great fun experiences and it's waste of time not enjoying- blah blah.

So I just wanted to ask if he's hiding his feelings or he's just a happy alcoholic guy? Are most alcoholics depressed? I know there is a connection obviously, but I just wanna know that if someone's alcoholic, does that mean he/she is depressed?",5.177993966817496,6.674709760683764,5.5115686274509805,80.06382352941179,68.91452991452991,9.095625942684768,30.43137254901961,9.478462496947786,2.8232536953242837,980,39,179,21,17,312,125,234,0.307,0.601,0.093,-0.9968,0,0,8,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,1,1,15,21,0,0,8,0,14,12,0,0,5,46,28,20,1,7,13,0,2,2,0,0,7,2,0,2,11,7,10,0,10,5,0,1,8,14,0,2,7,4,18,7,21,20,6,19,0,12,0,0,35,5,0,10,13,113,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4108557703107423,0.07699341102535985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06397796044323369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188100764079035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04687093282703381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06138975678968605,0.0,0.0,0.14876148813638798,0.0,0.6622454139967815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672862429509638,0.0,0.0,0.2259663845212607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10156916157282596,0.06955066879850193,0.06478245361307079,0.0,0.0,0.07521237570167108,0.07248427958971451,0.0,0.07775496325144984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04017142508760044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477059665840732,0.0,0.15226476106146136,0.0,0.08184996597727964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679852960464889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006825297332952,0.08451256925722482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054309104450096346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307368690846404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375486207015209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17790503600316593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07533507507227155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10420420179491643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053305278843757666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04925718004665633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07313922130550436,0.06114536511861806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686289213608031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651479559775022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841042875333258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18540184045051927,0.06720453572960446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04926748437418372,0.0,0.061041423386927474,0.04483470144054154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052202708708571806,0.0,0.0,0.16008870410099854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907024655521781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05597624160250479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04951411350081932

alcoholism,xWaffleicious,2018/03/03,"Am I safe to drink socially again? If so how long should I wait? Hi, so I'm a 19 year old male living in Germany, and I've drank a good amount in my time here.  I went about a month drinking every day, not more than a few beers most days, but every day nonetheless.  I stopped to cool it for a while and went through some detox symptoms like puking and light headedness, and that scared me a lot that I might be becoming addicted.  My family has a long history of alcoholism, and I never want to become an alcoholic.  After the first night I felt already a lot better, and have now not drank for 9 days and feel fine and everything.  I don't think my body was heavily addicted or anything as I didn't drink so much, just consistently for that time.  My question is, can I after some time begin to socially drink again with friends, or am I out for life? If so how long should I wait? Can my body become unaddicted after time since it probably wasn't heavily addicted in the first place, and I'm young and whatnot?

alcoholism,yellak1717,2018/03/04,"Need advice on sharing car with alcoholic Here's my situation: I currently live in Wisconsin and have my car registered here and I'm the only person on my insurance policy. I'm leaving for six months to work in Alaska. My Dad (also in WI) is currently serving a sentence in Huber for 18 months because of a DUI. He does not have a car, and does not have a license but will have one at the end of March (right about when I leave).

If you are unfamiliar, Huber is basically jail but they let you leave during the day for 8 hours so you can still continue to work. You have to check in with an officer every time you leave and return (although im not sure if they breatholize you every time, or if it's random drug testing ? If anyone can speak to that I'd appreciate it).

He is hoping to use my car while I am gone because the Huber facility is about 45 minutes from his work and he'd love to not rely on trying to hitch rides back and forth. He's been sober for a couple of months now. He's also willing to make my car payments while I am gone. He knows I have nowhere else to keep my car while I'm gone except for at his house, because it's a rural area that's safe.

What I am wondering is, if I add him to my insurance policy, is his terrible driving record going to make my payment sky rocket? If they're breatholizing him in Huber, and if he's not drinking, it's it safe to let him use my car if I DON'T add him to my policy? Is that too risky in case he gets pulled over during that course of time for speeding or something minor?

It's very difficult for me to handle this because he's really been trying... and is paying the price for drunk driving. Doing this would help him out a lot (not to mention he'd save me a lot of money). But, I don't want to screw myself over by letting him use my car if something were to happen.

If anyone can offer some advice I'd appreciate it, or if you've dealt with people borrowing your car and how you handled them being added (or not) to your insurance. Idk what to do.

Thanks if you read this far.",4.163262411347517,4.48171558628842,5.5838297872340465,82.93333333333334,70.4420803782506,8.536170212765958,26.777777777777786,8.515128840125781,1.6860033096926714,1595,47,336,24,27,540,194,423,0.05,0.853,0.097,0.9759,2,0,5,0,0,0,44.0,0,10,3,3,13,11,1,0,14,0,37,6,0,6,1,63,59,37,0,16,27,1,0,0,0,3,2,1,0,1,16,15,3,3,2,3,5,17,9,3,0,2,6,1,48,8,55,44,3,58,0,0,0,2,40,19,1,22,22,223,64,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19151127858020245,0.0,0.10472254325095684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15672668253778907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13703512569304244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07534900534980994,0.0,0.2389375369599576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10842514166860626,0.0,0.06319606741662237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17150511193495732,0.0,0.0,0.09599384255287634,0.11363841217214544,0.0,0.08185887938056037,0.0,0.08679091190317167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16512323278961946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051196236066090084,0.0,0.055690525006194175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866530888984286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06568127992271182,0.0,0.0,0.09732714100894194,0.09650136416382794,0.11306841992147355,0.0,0.0,0.10584706018353347,0.0,0.0,0.08709887428509272,0.0,0.0,0.0538532730269032,0.0,0.0,0.4150331430153663,0.0,0.3006072099351645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08652781953862676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16661683267653707,0.08844067394901169,0.0,0.13081946337423955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23464636599754515,0.0,0.0,0.07265906072725911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06640121557223175,0.07452654639001118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06793459861836304,0.0855619330920292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801748520031772,0.0,0.0627755229524309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368375079119672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014595307761192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15087646830147033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825571318795073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923553271488601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021691732891736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17141796343275384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330588692089151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25389820088207443,0.0,0.08085281059292443,0.05779761146212167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10626702418781764,0.2140157741174257,0.0,0.0,0.06960997178030932,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,jiey_reddit,2018/03/04,"As of today, This is how I feel about my mom my mother loves to drink. Her favorite math equation is; n+1 with n being the number of drinks she's already had. I really hate the fact that she laughs at me when she buys alcohol and tells me it's supposed to ""cure her depression"" when in reality it makes her even more sad because she can barely afford food for herself, let alone the cats she has. The only reason why I go to her house, is because I have to bring food for her and the cats. I hate her Dying liver and her boyfriend has trouble dealing with her as well. Like I said she can barely afford food, so she can't go see a therapist or go to rehab to fix it, so she just drinks her day away then yells at me for causing her ""anxiety"" which is really just finalizing a divorce in which she still my my dad loves her and is just joking about even though they're almost done finalizing it. Her yelling doesn't help with me being overweight as she just calls me ""Tubsy"" all the time making me feel like I weigh 400 pounds even though I've been losing weight rapidly since she started calling me names. Welcome to the second semester of my freshman year folks, It'll be a long one with this shit.",6.250584869675777,5.5460749421487625,6.395619834710747,82.36517800381439,66.10743801652893,9.099046408137317,29.77240940877305,8.139509932561175,1.849227844882391,944,27,195,10,13,302,137,242,0.12,0.778,0.103,-0.757,2,1,4,0,2,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,18,15,3,0,10,0,20,15,2,5,2,24,35,16,1,0,5,3,3,2,0,1,3,3,0,0,10,8,10,0,3,4,1,4,2,7,1,2,4,7,43,8,27,26,2,21,0,3,1,2,38,5,1,2,14,135,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461898596325312,0.10739665030022776,0.11107996609468583,0.1183544387982544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08204692478866342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10076609472874012,0.0,0.0,0.13075875234083095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2190310676145081,0.0,0.0,0.11017659371261533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06916819377467186,0.11057134566773354,0.0923753580894288,0.0,0.11130988112459037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10975528177263777,0.0,0.31519622854536616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21251534867960103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084589250718158,0.07662032572787685,0.0,0.2349770385992137,0.0,0.0,0.3890659690355467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18286009790674687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21177684138785152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188826271597469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375356091963677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967168579116318,0.0,0.10479510201279496,0.0,0.0,0.09491399524554617,0.0,0.11998673263538465,0.0,0.0,0.19359690953360792,0.0,0.14318210550215288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561138627915594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267623340065353,0.08156942057925408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374158144130979,0.11027216393066484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202051408257516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854653729861641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009188311674203,0.08871935538596495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591299796291892,0.0,0.08565099942177093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937423336129919,0.0,0.0,0.12452698600152053,0.0,0.0,0.21074764823715356,0.0,0.06253907558841595,0.0,0.10166165943103796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060314810313525,0.09643176832668404,0.0,0.0967775855305593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906629881382666

alcoholism,KiLl3rZd3LuX3,2018/03/04,"I need some sort of help/advice to keep my sanity Hi well i'm a 22 year old man that still lives at home with his mom. My father is a drunk and has not had a job in over 10+ years until a few months ago (Which he just quit). Said he was on prozac and doing better but still drinks.. My mom and dad split like 3-4 years ago when my dad left her out of nowhere. Now he's been back for a few months now. He's always been a alcoholic and has always ran his mouth without getting physical because he likes to provoke people so he can call the police on them. Well today he decides to go on a binge of drinking beer and starts running his mouth saying that me and my mom want to fuck, we're crazy, that we want to kill him and starts calling me a faggot because my sister told him I had nudes on my computer... I got in his face and told him to shut his fucking mouth or I was going to knock him the fuck out. It took me everything not to break that motherfuckers skull right open. Then he starts saying that I threatened his life with my gun (Never happened). He starts saying I took his gun and he can't find it (Not true) and then started telling me to shoot him in the head while he was sleeping. My mom says she's done with him and that he's out tomorrow yet she is laying in bed with him right now.. This isn't the first time either. He's not even supposed to be living with us because it's my grandmothers house that my grandpa is letting us live in and one of the conditions was that my dad wasn't supposed to live their. I just don't know what to do anymore. If I call the cops, my grandpa will find out about it and kick us out, if I don't call the cops, my father will continue to be vile and abusive. Please help.

alcoholism,fookman7,2018/03/04,"Cold turkey after 20+ years! So I managed to make a clear decision to quit the night of May 29th, 2017. It was after I chose alcohol over yet another relationship in my life. I managed to quit without much convincing or self discussion as it was a total 'falling out of love' feeling. I have not had an urge to drink since that day and likely will never again. I am curious if others out there have gone through something similar and if you have found that depression takes over with a vengeance. Without the numbing effects of bourbon/whiskey my life is now a new hell. So I say in the immortal words of Huey Lewis ""I need a new drug!"" 

If anyone knows the way forward, please advise. 

Cheers to those who quit and stayed sane. You are the luckiest of lucky!

alcoholism,LuckOnMars,2018/03/04,"[Text] Wolf In Sheeps Clothing - A Goodbye To Alcohol You’re a wolf in sheeps clothing,
You snuck up on me,
By seeming so harmless, 
Then you showed me your teeth.

You devoured my dignity and swallowed it whole,
consumed all my confidence, and nipped at my soul.

You sliced me wide open and threw salt in the wound,
You wanted my life and you wanted it ruined.
And I was so beaten that I couldn’t fight back,
But that didn’t stop you from your attack.

You bloodied and bruised me and shattered my pride,
Like a buddy that used me and stood by my side
Just so he could confuse me and so I couldn’t hide,
Now it’s time to lose me, hope you enjoyed the ride.

You’d of buried me broke and then pissed on my grave, but that’s not gonna happen cause I won’t 
be your slave.  I won’t live a life of sickness and fear and sacrifice everything that I hold dear and trade moments of pleasure for I lifetime of pain, I’ll just follow the sun, I’ve had enough rain.
I’m done with you know, I mean it we’re through, and I’m not coming back because I don’t need you.

I’m good as I am, and my future is bright, you’re a Wolf In Sheeps Clothing and you’ve got Quite A Bite.",1.4209981447124278,3.117832281632652,2.3833858998144706,97.80995825602969,79.24489795918367,5.2708719851577,21.34044526901669,5.852544927426893,-0.12418367346938775,899,25,212,5,22,283,133,245,0.129,0.7509999999999999,0.12,0.1727,2,0,1,0,1,0,29.0,0,15,0,4,9,20,4,2,9,0,14,9,2,2,1,41,32,25,1,7,6,0,0,1,0,3,6,0,0,0,9,19,2,2,3,1,1,4,8,11,0,0,7,2,41,9,21,17,3,24,2,4,1,0,17,11,1,3,10,127,50,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1993904887916078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122544589793322,0.0,0.28692723725505603,0.0,0.11373356396373015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19166253033154346,0.0,0.16071667719000987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14896387610469186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19092961865081373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19278045242131991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676803642731855,0.0,0.0,0.20994722429762794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15648912381876218,0.14921998994498706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16498646054991084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18530973003547027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253599748938516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2635649701098056,0.09115046009915223,0.0,0.16474794916443347,0.0,0.0,0.20872818815852567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20323339835547008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13834199575185488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985275156425108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19844404020263265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16984964170936442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15598392374670733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10879259439747056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16113972791216274,0.0,0.0,0.22009194281699376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083028148008628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,IWantToBeAPerson,2018/03/05,"First Steps This is my first experience with Reddit and also my first attempt at getting sober. I'm new to a lot of this and I'm trying to figure out what my resources are. I don't think I'm ready for meetings or anything like that. It's still a little difficult to talk about, I tried to approach the subject with my mom and she said ""good"" and even that single word just reminded me of the damage I caused and it hurt a lot. I'm trying to find things that work for me that don't feel as dated if that makes sense.

I knew I had a problem over five years ago when I was around 17 and it started so fast and got worse and worse. I blacked out multiple times a week, I've woken up in hospitals. I always knew but every time I wanted to stop it was more like a ""hey, lets just cool it for a while we'll come back to this later"" or ""maybe i'll stick to beer."" I thought I was too young and I didn't want to give something up for good so early. Yesterday morning was the first time I've ever said out loud that I have entirely no interest in drinking at all anymore. I'm tired of feeling unsafe at my own hands and hurting the people I love. 

I just was curious if there are any common tips or things to keep in mind that aren't just the typical things you see and hear on TV. Last night I went to a concert and didn't drink there which I always do at shows and instead I ordered a soda water with lime and it was honestly really nice. I did have a pretty deep sense of regret when I realized I couldn't go out and eat at nice places and pair my meal with a nice drink or beer. I realize I could order virgin cocktails but I felt embarrassed even thinking about it and I'm not entirely sure why. Also at the end of the night at the concert, I kept kicking myself for not talking to someone I really wanted to end up talking to. I kept thinking ""if I had been drinking this would have been no problem"" and that bummed me out a lot. I drank a lot to cope with pressure in social situations. Any time I met a new person I'd drink myself into oblivion if it was available to me. I remember chugging 3 beers before going on dates several years ago. I don't know what to do really or how to handle this, but I do want to make the change and be consistent with it. Any advice, any words would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",3.546370523415977,4.207025799586777,4.855619834710748,86.37312672176311,71.99586776859505,7.767493112947659,26.03030303030303,7.898369717300924,1.3289815426997242,1813,55,391,23,33,604,229,484,0.1,0.785,0.115,0.9448,0,0,9,0,0,0,37.0,1,2,0,6,23,23,0,2,23,1,35,17,1,4,3,95,77,40,0,15,18,1,4,2,0,3,1,6,0,1,28,33,14,4,15,13,0,6,11,9,0,5,27,13,49,14,62,42,8,71,0,4,2,2,18,27,0,13,38,265,77,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07293911960119938,0.1323309341018332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11938206801262242,0.12421594218151605,0.0,0.0,0.20303598027152991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07402462550870956,0.0,0.0,0.06142385541241674,0.06644704202373504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057394949830483134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06351468855096036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07667770698941234,0.07896114512679135,0.06429731601983023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05959541713345959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36560282061981664,0.0,0.07637721303708837,0.0,0.0,0.13222098981395472,0.0,0.0,0.098600432195315,0.0675177967092743,0.06288895001207406,0.0,0.0,0.07301401956836928,0.0,0.0,0.07548229071898678,0.0,0.07166784962245891,0.0,0.06822126839461656,0.2539611652919841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03899726860203634,0.07160323220500445,0.08484132932942143,0.12521202931473666,0.059697879633396934,0.08229286663925674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412675244652004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15981121753704455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663450764436277,0.0,0.0,0.04102119051521383,0.0608430430827952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763263149164397,0.0,0.07293244286551763,0.07481070964109214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2538312140415791,0.06736715396191288,0.0,0.09964798476578887,0.0,0.0749877376165304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536695707723691,0.08741959382743363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14417906376616707,0.0,0.14009257756761914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051747237556133065,0.06517435544659858,0.07798481195793895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759375620032409,0.0,0.14284427634842933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14345237765422747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455462799329469,0.0,0.14200292134893264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947986415941965,0.0,0.0,0.08432400714671222,0.0,0.0,0.08390052956334389,0.0,0.07608793246227616,0.06324376923616999,0.05746291731762861,0.0,0.0,0.05283186218001639,0.0,0.05960905139383419,0.062403901166384765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07034902907713106,0.0,0.0,0.1799827951235042,0.0,0.06872015655568461,0.0,0.0,0.14876611942122853,0.14348238709209074,0.0,0.05925726504548124,0.17409697474821084,0.08578978826988186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15203068216943152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761027100378889,0.0,0.05987316319091356,0.0,0.0,0.06919371206918794,0.06735262995887431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05434013168178976,0.0,0.15213277649659135,0.10604681029256023,0.0,0.0,0.0961337657089578
alcoholism,txt11,2018/03/05,"Blackouts... am I ok? Hi all - I'll try to keep it brief.

I'm a 29 y/o female, who struggles with alcohol blackouts. I would say I have 1-2 per month. I'm the type who goes out on a Saturday night with friends, not a ""alone"" drinker.

Basically I'm wondering how f*cked I am as a result of the blackouts. It's typically the last hour of the night (leaving and getting home) that will be missing. Nothing ""bad"" ever happens, I just forget. I'm scared.... I read things online that say my brain is basically destroyed and I can count on getting dementia.. is this true? How much of this is meant to scare me? I 100% need to stop this from happening at ALL, but the anxiety of the unknown is keeping me up at night. 

I feel like this community has experience and has seen it all. Looking for some perspective.

alcoholism,Lordarshyn,2018/03/05,"11 months and i almost threw it away I hit 11 months sober this weekend. I forgot about the date until a friend reminded me.

The first thought I had was ""maybe I should get a drink and celebrate. One night won't hurt.""

Needless to say, I struggled with this thought for the next several hours, as the rational part of my mind knew this was a bad idea, But the addicted part of my mind kept trying to convince me all sorts of reasons why it was a good idea.

In the end, the rational part won. Instead of drinking, I ended up exercising and talking with a friend.

But God damn, this is such a crazy addiction. I used to think that by this point I would be totally over it. Sometimes I feel totally over it. But in that comfort, it still creeps up on you from time to time.

I just wanted to share. I don't have a ton of people to talk to and just needed to share my weekend experience.

alcoholism,Dustyfang007,2018/03/05,"Thought of the day: Food for Thought Food for Thought

In the recesses of our minds, each of us has old tapes stored away which tend to be played over and over again. These tapes may have been recorded so long ago that they have little if anything to do with our present situation.

The tapes, which are recordings of positive thoughts and experiences, can be helpful when replayed. Unfortunately, we each possess many tapes which are negative and self-destructive. They include resentments, fears, and hates. When one of these negative tapes begins to play, we may find ourselves opening the refrigerator or going out to buy food which we should not have. Often the tapes continue to play while we are eating.

Taking an inventory each day makes us increasingly aware of our negative emotions: anger, envy, irrational anxiety. Admitting mistakes and making amends relieves us of the guilt associated with our character defects.

By giving our lives to God and staying in contact with Him, we are able to turn off the negative tapes. We receive new thoughts and positive feelings: hope, faith, love.

I pray that my thoughts and feelings may be purified.",8.286313939867238,9.88502029441625,6.971776649746193,72.06907458024213,61.79187817258885,10.528543537680594,39.011714174150725,10.560738912317856,4.4573525185474425,926,47,148,22,13,278,119,197,0.175,0.6779999999999999,0.14800000000000002,-0.765,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,14,0,2,0,5,14,3,2,8,0,18,5,0,2,0,45,38,14,0,4,3,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,22,4,0,10,3,2,3,5,7,0,1,7,2,19,7,27,24,4,26,2,0,0,1,23,9,0,7,13,105,27,0,0.11218695608272283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09944696759374223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582271433408083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232030590792448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1054033382084846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470261135608647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147952635769153,0.0,0.126195225641591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10974037003799693,0.0,0.12624151542343132,0.11345019167258368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253684542153384,0.0,0.4069707378266506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761995086075092,0.06375843249122888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107613929944321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519655186270821,0.0,0.0,0.11142696085003218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112440802565747,0.09906313758135972,0.09928192581558318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012531079358592,0.0,0.14977132866241666,0.1137399650288518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11327684473732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835086126586548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11772133853152245,0.0,0.07602078486289697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11703546226026425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261028390861799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11957636823470333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08435062913525597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5343834703505019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202719292259402,0.0,0.0,0.40484128485583293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,NotRey666,2018/03/05,"am I becoming an alcoholic? so I've always drinked since I was 13, but it has always been under control. mostly weekends. then i'd be high the other 5 days, I've always had troubles staying sober because of my childhood... when sober I think too much and get suicidal. 

2 weeks before 2018 I started drinking more then usual, what originally was 2 days turned into 3, after Christmas my grandfather died and what was 3 days turned into 5 days. 
I took a break around valentines week, but soon after I started drinking again because  I convinced myself I still had full control of myself. see I hate myself already, but I have a phobia of becoming an addict because my dad was one and I don't want to be like him. 
eventually I ran out of money from all the drinking and this is where I start questioning myself, I started gathering coins, selling video games, etc. and got cheap beer steel reserve 4$ would get me drunk. I started doing it daily and here we are now, today was my birthday and I have been drunk for days. 
but my brain still tells me i'm not an alcoholic, due to your past experience... are this symptoms of an alcoholic? or am I just too depressed to face reality?

alcoholism,TryingNotToBeAnIdiot,2018/03/05,"9 months and I have my life back. I work a 12 step program and today I got my 9 month chip. I can’t believe I made it here, honestly. 

So much has changed in 9 months. I have come so far and worked so hard and here I am. Alive and free from a craving of drugs and alcohol. I’m 23 and get to experience life! All of it! For everything is has to offer. I can feel real feelings. I’m not numb to them anymore. Pain is excruciating but allows me to really know what love and beauty are.

I’m flabbergasted and amazed at how far I’ve come. I’m different. I love who I am, and no longer fantasize killing myself. I can sit in a room silently and alone and be okay. That is my biggest accomplishment.

alcoholism,applejuice1212,2018/03/05,"How do I get help? I think I have a problem with alcohol. It's a shitty sentence to type, but one that's been in the back of my mind for 8 years. If I am very functioning drinker but it's still affecting my day to day job where I'm plenty well-to-do, what do I do? I'm tired and not doing what I should be able to do there. I've gotten in trouble with the law once, which should have been my wake-up call, but at the time they told me I didn't have a problem. I feel like in order to be successful I need to do some sort of inpatient time, but I also feel like I'm so functioning that I wouldn't get the time or that doctor wouldn't know that I really want help. I keep telling myself I won't drink or I'll do less or I'll get better, but I'm failing at doing this on my own. How do I ask my employer for time off or tell my husband who loves beer that I just need to not have it in my house?

alcoholism,abp105,2018/03/06,"Alcoholic Hello all, I know someone close, who is a alcoholic. He is getting worse and worse by the day. He does not abuse anyone or cause any harm, he just needs to have his liquor after work. His loved ones and family cares about him, they tried reaching out to rehab centers but simply can’t afford it. Family is from New Jersey. The abuser constantly promises to quiet but just can’t and I feel as he wants to quit as well but is just too far into it. I am asking if anyone can recommend a rehab center or a residential treatment centers that would either be free or a little cost to the family.

Or am I just the standard kinda fucked in the brain? Being serious not satirical. You can look at my posting history and watch a successful recovery for three months turn into a downward spiral back to addiction.

I was doing that and it made me mad. Because I was doing so fucking good. Then I went to infantry school and got some freedoms back. So I stared using on the weekends. Now I’m with my unit and have freedom to do whatever every night! I have not fucking self control for this shit.

My first thought was actually. Get an ironing board and iron. Also don’t forget the mouthwash and Triple C. I know triple C kills but fuck me it takes me back to my freshmen year! Anyway enough about me!

Have any of you been this desperate or am I all the fuck alone out here?",1.6969241417497225,4.345495796511628,2.7659136212624595,89.82050387596901,85.22093023255816,5.601771871539314,23.88815060908084,7.07126945348624,1.1078778516057581,695,27,134,10,21,221,114,172,0.17,0.7809999999999999,0.049,-0.9685,0,2,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,0,3,12,12,9,0,8,0,16,10,2,3,2,27,34,14,1,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,6,10,1,1,2,2,0,1,3,10,0,3,8,3,19,2,17,25,5,23,0,0,3,6,3,9,7,4,12,98,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.11835563661215034,0.1322174041446658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25122718302498764,0.0,0.09699072840040772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08247724279639876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2797796059274916,0.0,0.07393356822428071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13539299558677992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603025926781315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821811208568881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11881209453805198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253187382393525,0.0,0.0,0.1097082734758921,0.10218695607388824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316406315093116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6727503265829754,0.06336585636861206,0.0,0.0,0.10172722025928944,0.09700185171848144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13418271737149692,0.0,0.06665448528671518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184796913073603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476180294168616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968076891826132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113816768028657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12671591038563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615649501078155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274582915583107,0.0,0.0,0.12652560751024353,0.0,0.1244962284457273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09119043398552057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09628590617427676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319221065061997,0.1184767927318262,0.0,0.0,0.10475038899717584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243143373272846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810288525911703
alcoholism,hypertown,2018/03/07,"I think it’s over I was kicked out of the sober house I was living in. I was also fired from my job. I got a new job working from a call center. Not sure how long that will last. So I’m living out of my car currently and I’m pretty sure someone is about to bust me. I feel like I disguised myself well, my back seat folds down and I’m laying with my upper body in the trunk and my lower half in the back seat. I try to disguise my body by being under a blanket and then laying stuff on top of me like clothes, pillows, and books. Last night was the first night. I parked in a random neighborhood and was successful. Now I’m parked near a 7-11 and it seems too public. Too many people around. I’m afraid the fuzz is soon me. There’s way too much shit in my car. A cop could easily tell someone is living in here. Then there’s my job. I haven’t showered in almost a week. I’ve been wearing a hat to hide my hair. I think people have noticed. So I think that my options are to drink or kill myself. My family has already cut off ties with me. They don’t want a relationship with me. Just the basic info. So if I get fired my next choice is suicide and I guess I can go to the ER but my insurance runs out soon. I don’t know what to do. I think my life is over but if I think taking my life is a viable option I’ll go to a hospital. It’s pretty much over already. I don’t have anything to live for. I’m only 25 by the way.

alcoholism,Random_Redditor100,2018/03/08,"Withdrawal and tapering off questions I think I may be going through alcohol withdrawal.  Long story short, I guess I may be what's considered a functioning alcoholic.  I drink alot (for years) but it hasn't really affected my life.  Well I decided to stop because I'm trying to lose weight and I hit a plateau.  I figured I would need to give up alcohol, so I did.  I was fine with it.  I enjoy drinking, but I'd rather be thinner.  Well fast forward a week, I started having chest pains, I couldn't breathe, and I was dizzy.  I was freaking out and I thought I was dying of a heart attack.  After speaking w/ a doctor, I was told it was an anxiety attack.  I had another one a week after that. In addition, I've been feeling panicky, sweating, and having chest pains. I'm thinking maybe I should attempt to taper off instead of just going cold turkey.  I wouldn't care if I was just feeling anxious, but since the effects are physical it's causing huge problems in my life.  Does anyone have any advice about how to taper off instead of just going cold turkey to manage the anxiety?  Or is this short term and should I just tough it out?",2.7145291962939058,4.9603503257918575,4.2654169360051695,83.22573152337858,77.4162895927602,7.105451411333765,28.623357035121746,8.11559375814309,2.2211872872225817,886,40,163,16,21,295,128,221,0.207,0.6920000000000001,0.1,-0.9805,0,0,5,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,3,12,13,2,0,10,0,26,16,5,4,0,44,43,13,1,9,10,0,3,0,0,6,8,1,0,0,8,10,6,1,9,2,0,4,3,8,2,1,12,6,26,5,23,20,2,25,0,1,0,0,4,12,0,7,11,116,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12061210272963112,0.0,0.3957199671476172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08393505653829708,0.12942468683997074,0.18884367837827515,0.13943814880356967,0.0,0.08630350536109757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28083361462649603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07524036956839206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258427482167039,0.12679422953067124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12809844759910233,0.0,0.0,0.12633346300115175,0.10801239662077187,0.0,0.0,0.2418242786583628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481748960288533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11840307979727273,0.21044038887666489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359695075085225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14626239790894954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17436124451941054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092296148692683,0.0,0.13808400501189455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12399969676517544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152006254299656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08363779191852055,0.0,0.2626715127154685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810362277112868,0.0,0.0,0.13826725202483298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07907093388313494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021006543364682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087362748871856,0.0,0.0,0.10319106920075824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581749501635917,0.0,0.09798779280885422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117940439897287,0.0,0.08379929433447604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19801248353460216,0.1503016655353457,0.2219526190681657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876794842540549,0.0,0.0,0.07948338072128612
alcoholism,Knelie,2018/03/08,"Am I a ""functioning"" alcoholic? Here I am. Been wondering this for a while. I've googled and googled and can't really come to a conclusive answer. 

Not sure if this is relevant, but I'm a 22 F.

From 17-19, I will admit I was a full blown alcoholic. I would get drunk almost every night with my friends, and usually come to work the next day either hungover or still a bit drunk. That was the norm. Drinking a case of 12 to myself in one evening was normal. Driving home and not remembering how I got there was also normal. (How I never killed myself or anyone else is beyond me - someone must have been watching over me and I am damn grateful for that).

After my 19th birthday, I started to feel meh about drinking. Some shit happened with my friends, we went our different ways, and I started dating my current BF who's father is a very very bad alcoholic - he helped me sober up quite a bit. He doesn't drink at all so I was dead sober for about a year and a half. 

Then, I started to casually enjoy drinks again. I had made a PSA of sorts on FB telling people to not invite me out to the bar or parties as I am done with drinking like that and it's not fun for me, and IMO a waste of money and time. I will only drink a drink or two on the deck at my friends (which we have now reconciled) house or something like that. 

But I've noticed lately it's becoming a lot more common. But I can't remember the last time I was actually DRUNK... more so now when I drink on the weekend I'll have 3-4 in a night and I'll get a tipsy buzz off of that - but I usually stop at 5 because my stomach starts to hurt. 

Every day for the last while after work, I go out of my office, walk downstairs to the liquor store in the same building, and buy a rockstar vodka. I'll go to my car, pour it in my shaker cup, and drink it on the way home (10 minute drive). I live out in the country so there is really no one out there - I'll wait till I get to the country and then do a big lap (take the scenic route) and finish the drink before I get home and it usually gives me a buzz that lasts the evening. 

I'll usually have just the one - if me or me/my BF are going to do something with friends I will buy 2 and have the second one to sip on throughout the night. 

Another thing though - before I go meet up with any friends, I always have one drink. I'll chug it in my car before I go inside to meet them or something like that - I just feel like I have to have at least ONE drink in me to socialize properly otherwise I shut down and I'm too awkward.

Would this constitute as a functioning alcoholic?",2.7255018587360595,3.7592185669145017,4.153269516728623,89.24161431226767,74.29739776951672,7.387434944237919,25.34591078066915,7.822599999999999,1.1830965055762075,1991,64,445,27,40,661,240,538,0.094,0.804,0.102,0.7253,2,0,20,0,0,0,63.0,3,0,1,4,24,19,3,1,39,0,38,23,2,3,4,78,66,46,2,7,20,1,2,4,7,6,4,0,3,0,19,31,21,2,9,20,4,13,9,6,0,9,13,3,54,13,65,47,11,84,0,1,1,0,22,29,2,14,44,295,73,2,0.0,0.0,0.052818345480261965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2313733288311811,0.05419852626607705,0.0,0.0,0.04328386841281268,0.0450364664112689,0.0,0.0,0.036806962718262455,0.0567549462621503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03784556817248235,0.05545761945246235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045192245196718314,0.03299419327070465,0.05977698339120754,0.13816956603046324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181813060698339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09324806018957923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06981249706753116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05654926900124524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05538882735509657,0.0,0.6362645771177549,0.0,0.0,0.045214623396040696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149831132322539,0.0,0.09120555816321624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054734611208659134,0.03866702289939955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20908480976311966,0.0,0.11311264217344152,0.05192178242993402,0.1538028698863932,0.0,0.04328883239487321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04786269748980361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036278951756339266,0.0,0.16287583637903338,0.0,0.0,0.06245316407237402,0.057942099897561224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05988146679344964,0.0,0.0,0.13235768056986688,0.06105553450170593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10577127076345406,0.0,0.0477935051557604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046015272856885635,0.0,0.051214532144128126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041744657706311424,0.0,0.05756271839270308,0.1523783796174678,0.10606232379330574,0.0,0.061621849862319125,0.0,0.0,0.22005964248643872,0.04116462079044948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03752356879710615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05756876675343747,0.0,0.0,0.06934792291959277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12262650338304187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555869575172378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055173781311141736,0.045860069793048665,0.12500457027748565,0.0,0.0,0.15324025851935494,0.0,0.04322442021142587,0.045251054727019416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051012319827157364,0.0,0.04069538202498911,0.0,0.04730777278773586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03595834921445885,0.0,0.053177691839384617,0.0,0.06312162849510683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052872413592007735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23844485429427315,0.0893178457641735,0.0,0.08592406044668438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050174562696972486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058696423826333964,0.07880751769188035,0.0,0.0,0.07689791706098385,0.0,0.0,0.034854826476407995
alcoholism,penny-lane21,2018/03/08,"I (24F) finally called out my dad (52M) on his alcoholism and it went horribly wrong. My parents got divorced when I was 3 due to my fathers infidelity and alcoholism. He moved back in with my grandparents and still to this day lives in their basement. 21 years. In a basement at his parents house. 

Last night, he picked me up at my moms to go for dinner at my grandparents. He was wasted. He was slurring his words and driving like a maniac and I honestly thought it was the end of my life. 

I have never called him out before because he is very good at turning it back around on me so I just have put up with it. But last night was insane. My grandparents are total enablers so I felt uncomfortable saying anything to them last night while over for dinner. I took an Uber home and messaged my aunt about what had happened. 

She told me he has a problem, we all know it but my grandparents won’t call him out because of their other sons suicide just before I was born. They’re scared to lose another child. 

My aunt called my dad last night, said that he would contact me today. She said he seemed calm and understanding and we should have a phone call. 

So we did. He called me. And it went horrible. He denied everything. In his eyes, he has never had a problem, he was not drunk yesterday, and I am merely attempting to start drama with the help of my mother. 

It was a 30 minute phone call of me bawling my eyes out telling him that it’s been so difficult for me to come forward with this after 24 years. I’ve lived it. I’m not stupid. But he tried very hard to turn it around on me. 

He asked me to go for lunch and I said no. After the convo we just had, I clearly cannot convince him he has an issue on my own. 

I don’t know where to go from here. This will directly affect my relationship with my grandparents due to the living situation. I love them so much, and my grandfather isn’t doing well as of late. But I also cannot keep putting up with this and going over there when my dad act like this. He has a friend in intensive care because of liver failure due to his drinking. My dad thinks he doesn’t have a problem because he isn’t at that point. 

I almost regret bringing it up but I would also regret if he continued on this path and hurt himself or someone else while drinking and driving. 

So now what? What do I do? I circled back with my aunt and told her how the convo went and she was shocked. She said she will help fix it. Do I call my grandparents and get them involved? I can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel for my relationship with my dad and I’m terrified. Thank you in advance for any responses or thoughts.

alcoholism,TheThirstyPlatypus,2018/03/08,"21 and cannot control my drinking. Hi all,

I have drank alcohol since I've been about 15/16 which is the norm where I come from (Ireland), Mostly binge drinking as you do at a young age, The last year or so while my friend group has calmed down and people go for social drinks in the Pub and behave themselves, I have been going and drinking way too much.

This got my attention early on and I would go to the pub the next time and tell myself I am going to take it easy and have just a few drinks (6-7) over the night (5-6 hours) like my friends do. I go to the bar with the mindset of only having X amount of drinks have a good time with my friends and head home. I pace myself through the first 3-4 drinks and am having a great time behaving myself and then there seems to be like a wall that hits me where I drink drink drink, Up and down from the bar drinking my far too much (12+ 500ml 4/5% beers) and end up pissing someone off while being too drunk or getting in an argument etc etc.

I am at the stage where I am afraid to drink and go weeks without drinking without any craving to drink as I know once I have more than 4-5 anything can happen, I have an urge to drink once I have had 3-4 and cannot stay there and not drink more.

I am beginning to piss off my friends and feel of myself as a liability when I am out drinking, since drinking is such a big part of what everyone does I feel like I can't just stop altogether and I do not want to either, I just want to be able to control my drinking like everyone else does.

My behavior when drinking really gets me depressed, It affects my sleeping as I lay in bed thinking of what a fool I have become and people I have offended and or disappointed. I go weeks without drinking and then a social event comes up with all my friends and even with me freaking myself out for days beforehand worrying about what will happen , it happens again.

I am thinking of going to my doctor and letting her know whats going on with me and getting a prescription for Naltrexone and trying that out as I hear people online say it removes the urge to drink more and more , you have a few and your done.

Can anyone shed some light on if they have had similar experiences to myself.

I’m currently ending my  spring break after drinking heavily for 6 or 7 days and I think last night I really started to go through withdrawal. Is this possible? I could not sleep at all and felt very anxious and seen slightly shaky.  Is it possible to form an addiction so quickly?  My friends keep dismissing it and I’m in such a bad place mentally and I have to drive a rental car later but feel terrible.

alcoholism,SatinUnicorn,2018/03/08,"Is it possible to alter a BAC device? First, a quick preamble: the device is to be used in a custody/visitation situation, not for myself. 

The parent who will be using the device insists on using their own mouthpiece. I’d like to make sure there’s no chance the mouthpiece could be modified to submit a false positive. The device being used is the BACtrack mobile smartphone breathalyzer (model BT-M5) and results will be going to a cell phone.

If anyone has any knowledge of this I'd be most appreciative!

alcoholism,throwlemonsatyou,2018/03/08,"Recovering alcoholic not interested in anything physical I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but here goes. Recovering alcoholic boyfriend(clean for 7 months) isn't interested in anything physical. Says his sex drive is low. Prior to going to rehab we'd have sex at least once every two months(not great sex but still) but after his stint at rehab, our sex life is dead. We also had a brief break up before his rehab so things are still fresh in my mind. I tried to initiate a few times but he doesn't seem interested at all. I am now wondering if I'd be able to cope with this for life. He wants to get married after his one year sobreity but I am rethinking things . I feel awful to even think this way. Since he is not interested, I feel my own self confidence going down and my sex drive seems to be declining too. I don't know what to do or who to ask.

alcoholism,ambivertpyramid,2018/03/08,"Bartender making habit as drinking behind the bar I am 25 male. After barbacking got promoted to Bartender since half year.
Finally being a bartender makes me proud. Giving out drinks also drinking makes me feel good. 
Kinda having the power. 
Showing others that I am able to drink without consequences is just good.

Never had issues with alcohol, but behind the bar slowly became a habit. Didn’t even notice, then realised having drinks 5 days a week.

Simply can’t find a reason to not having. I would like to do a month detox..but once it’s get busy, music, party it’s not possible to stay sober..

Less stress, less anxiety, better mood and communication you know..flirting with customers..
Then when getting too much starts to saying yes to coke and the absolute chaos.

It’s the first time I understood how dangerous is alcohol. So underrated, but may catch you easily..

Bartenders, how is your self-discipline in this situation? If someone had the same realisation, how to get the shit together?

alcoholism,dave633,2018/03/09,"I don’t think I have a problem, but that might mean I do. I go on drinking jags where I won’t drink for maybe a week to several months, but then I’ll drink often. I’ve drank every day this week and plan on drinking tonight. I’ll only have 4-6 drinks on a weeknight because I don’t want a hangover. I usually feel this need to drink and often times can’t help but stop at the liquor store on the way home. 

I just bought an 18-pack the other day with the plan of drinking a few one night then only drinking when I watch MotoGP races which is like one or two days a month. Since buying that 18 pack I’ve drank the last 3 days. Now tonight I was maybe planning on not drinking but I had a bad day at work/school so I am going to drink 4-6 beers and try to calm down. My wife smokes weed everyday for medicinal purposes but I can’t do drugs because of my job. 

I would definitely say I have an addictive personality which I discovered with World of Warcraft 14 years ago when I was 14 years old. Basically if I have alcohol in the house I will drink every day until it’s gone. If I get up at 7 am I will probably start drinking then. It hasn’t directly led to me underperforming in work or my masters program, but if I focused on them more and drank less I have no question I would do better. 

Does it sound like I have a problem or am I not quite there yet and able to get back on course? Right now I want to drink a little tonight then whenever my supply is gone be done with it for a while. I’ve definitely said that before recently.",3.4093611032929907,4.028610984520128,4.675847171404449,87.68899169715735,72.28173374613003,7.977990430622009,26.75612158739093,8.150884317080207,1.4105739938080497,1200,39,272,17,22,398,166,323,0.051,0.848,0.101,0.9315,1,0,17,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,7,12,7,0,0,18,0,30,21,0,1,0,39,48,26,0,10,15,1,1,2,0,6,3,3,1,1,12,8,19,1,4,15,3,5,9,3,0,3,11,5,33,4,31,30,3,61,0,0,1,0,7,18,0,10,39,167,45,3,0.06384405551669005,0.0,0.0,0.06959944424972726,0.0,0.0,0.05659390308566487,0.06822987913022792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04909213783397546,0.0533071195884557,0.07783748732775031,0.0,0.05432658890782277,0.0,0.0,0.0564648788723725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470448047279916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05587036322015333,0.0653346349761987,0.0,0.8130572933674194,0.07403883525322676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758274068869393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03228147276846842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667117678825094,0.0,0.0725680960739434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0427933246379055,0.0,0.06404079320934293,0.0,0.0,0.07366746819928391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0633553738009397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05204142639868122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0623819612752921,0.06398851606291399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827986998164465,0.06954489298389653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772845371077517,0.0,0.0,0.10191943201120612,0.0,0.0,0.04733955820053562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05991332118748335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06699359653865357,0.0,0.08652476863050565,0.09711256228753454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0557461666971544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883469007150506,0.12218027760287607,0.0,0.0,0.07151995357720167,0.06790601176212974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06303830261848441,0.0,0.0,0.054522474573260524,0.0607303169379763,0.05077135545962521,0.0,0.064613592654341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07212561024595432,0.0,0.05281246246967164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04518915109826358,0.0,0.0,0.05337648915951941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04090869286512073,0.0,0.0,0.03722798219207611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043345922861962836,0.0,0.062366365335708385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031520733141028,0.0,0.07531375617236848,0.05067643957297468,0.10242370064285124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929584655903634,0.0,0.0,0.09070597052723292,0.0,0.0,0.08222695708633106

alcoholism,jcgordon550,2018/03/09,"Hi, I’m new here. I’m a 26 year old mom of two, an 8 year old son and a 2 year old daughter. My partner of 5 years is my biggest supporter and lifeline. I was admitted to an inpatient behavioral health facility on 2/25/2018 when I attempted suicide while black out drunk. Even with a .300 BAC and two badly injured feet, I denied my drinking problem for a few days in the beginning. I didn’t drink wine for breakfast, I could go weeks without a sip, and I’m a pretty good time 9/10 times. 

But that 10th time I go to a dark and emotional place. I’ve battled a mood disorder and depression since I was 12, and nothing brought those to the surface like alcohol. Had I been asked any day before or after 2/25 if I felt like harming myself, the answer would have been an easy no. 

Turns out binge drinking is just as much of a problem as physical dependency. 

I am new to the process of recovery and eager for any advice, wisdom, and support. Just wanted to introduce myself, as I may lurk around for a little while before participating. I have much to learn.

alcoholism,FrostyFedora,2018/03/09,"My mom isn't herself anymore due to alcoholism, is there anything I can do? I don't know if this is appropriate for this sub seeing as I'm not an alcoholic, I just feel like I'm going to explode if I don't vent. Let me know if it's not meant for this sub and I'll remove it and try to find somewhere else to post.

I grew up with most people around me being alcoholics. My father, mother, and later on my sister and brother. They were never abusive but it killed me inside barely ever being able to speak to a sober person outside of school from ages 0-18. This totally fucked me up emotionally but that's a whole different story. Anyway my dad, sister, and brother managed to eventually quit which made me really happy but my mom has had severe alcoholism for about 30 years now and doesn't seem like she's ever going to quit. 

I've tried telling her how much it kills me inside, how she's killing herself, she even went through rehab but she's always just went back to getting super drunk every single night. It's to the point where she's severely mentally ill and has almost no short term memory from so many years of alcoholism. 

I used to be able to talk to her about something important for ten minutes but then she'd just have no clue what I was talking about if I mentioned it the next day. Now most of the time I call she's just drunk and doesn't seem to care about anything. We talk for a bit, she says she'll call me later and I get sad and relieved at the same time cause I miss her but at the same time hearing her drunk for the 9 millionth time repulses me. Then she just never calls back. The times I still get to talk to my real, sober mom are very cherished and rare, and even then she's always very depressed due to the effects that have accumulated on her brain, and she still doesn't seem to want to talk to me.

I want my mom back really bad, is there anything I could possibly do to help her get better at this point? Or at least cope with the fact that I've basically lost her to alcohol and it's pretty likely she'll die to it? I'm so tired of this stupid poison. I feel disgusted even being around it.

alcoholism,alottowineabout,2018/03/10,"How do i take the edge off without drinking? Okay I didn't think I had an issue with drinking... But now that I think about it I drink at least 5 nights a week. And I do it to calm some anxieties or to feel physically better (like in less pain) or to feel motivated or to just be happier in general. 
Is that normal behavior or a sign of alcoholism?

Now I'm on an antibiotic that I really shouldn't drink with for 10 days. It's day 5 and I'm feeling crazy without being able to drink. I had opportunities Wed and Thurs and Fri to drink and kept my self in control but I really want to drink right now.

I am 20 and currently on spring break from college. I picked them up from dinner tonight and my father was in a drunken rage, I have seen him like this before but never this bad. It got to the point where he was calling my mother names and threatening to divorce her. I've never seen them fight like this and would never think of my dad to say things like that. Not sure what to do, I can't tell if he actually meant the things he said or if he was just extremely intoxicated.",3.4252598566308237,4.480518604838711,4.343010752688173,88.46507168458783,72.62903225806451,7.446594982078854,23.455197132616487,7.793537801064563,0.8775154121863804,473,12,104,6,9,153,85,124,0.126,0.7659999999999999,0.108,-0.7542,2,0,2,0,2,0,11.0,0,0,3,0,2,9,2,0,4,0,12,5,1,2,4,24,22,10,0,3,6,5,0,4,0,2,2,2,0,0,8,7,3,0,2,1,0,1,5,3,0,0,8,5,13,6,14,11,0,16,0,0,3,0,21,7,0,4,11,67,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.1858843307689774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20356883577339072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15904569099913907,0.0,0.0,0.16208735229322016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1945048591111386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866012241803024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10825611169461613,0.0,0.1523469841079832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22572375819976534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3722422900921101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202072796352445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4407376465711616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21150928480804795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1800683922950865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811933433388682,0.15148005321577596,0.0,0.0,0.1517906159395779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17952835981179532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664908963895002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25309742736204,0.12205407785742944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645165073154712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13531394935260682,0.0,0.0,0.0

I think I’m just coming to realistic terms that I have a problem.. I’ve known for a while that once I started drinking I couldn’t stop... I’ve argued with myself that “yes you could stop if you just tried!” For a long time... but at the end of the day.. I drink until I fall asleep or pass out to the point of not being woken.. that’s a problem. I just feel like I’m too young for this and I can’t/ don’t want to deal with this... I know this shit runs in the family.. Well, it def does! That’s for sure. Ugh. I just want to be a do better... but I dont know where to start when I’m depressed and just honesty WANT to drink.

alcoholism,bbychris,2018/03/10,"my mother (46F) is an alcoholic and in love with an enabler. where do i start? My mother has been an alcoholic for almost 10 years. She has a girlfriend who is an absolutely awful person. She brings my mother beer. She even takes my mother bar hopping. She claims that she is in love with my mother, yet i don't believe it.

Today, when i got home my mother was barely breathing. She had passed out from drinking too much. i called 911. My mothers girlfriend comes walking in , trying to hand my mother a beer. Even when my mother goes to the hospital, her girlfriend finds a way to sneak alcohol in!

When confronted, she says that my mother is a grown woman. which is true ! my mothers alcoholism is not her girlfriends fault. But how will my mother get better, if even when she goes to detox, this woman is sneaking alcohol in to her?! 

i am absolutely sick of this woman! My mother loves her so much. She actually loves her more than her own kids. i am just lost for words. 

She takes my mother bar hopping for weeks at a time. And even has the nerve to post it on facebook. My mother is literally dying (cirrhosis of the liver, and stomach ulcers). My mothers alcoholism was not this bad until this woman came along. My mother used to drink for a day or 2 and then be fine. 

is there anything that can be done? why doesn't my mother realize this woman doesn't care about her?

alcoholism,NeyborhoodAlcoholic,2018/03/10,"What medically constitutes an Alcoholic? In the military and trying to build a case against being accused of being an alcoholic.

A while back i do think maybe i had alcoholic tendencies but was not an alcoholic. I would socially binge drink (7+) once a week about 2 years ago. I stopped that because it got expensive and just started regular drinking (5 or less drinks) a week. I accidentally over drank one night (i was given double shot glasses and mistook them as single) and ended up hurting myself. Had to go to an alcohol education program and i think i learned a lot. 

That was 5 months ago and every time i would go out and drink i would think of the program. In the last 5 or so months i have only gone out maybe 4 times to drink and each time i drank no more than 3 drinks. One night i went out to a bar, drank and everything was fine. As i left a situation occurred which prevented me from leaving and i yelled at someone. Im baffled as to how but they decided because i yelled i have an alcohol problem.

I have never come to work drunk, it hasn't impaired my relationships (in fact when i started drinking less it did because most people around me drink daily), and i havent gone into debt over it. In the last 5 months i have only drank maybe 4 days.

I'm trying to prove that i am not an alcoholic and that the accusation is ridiculous. Any ideas on how i can do that or what resources i can use?",4.191321428571431,5.332229775000002,5.378571428571429,81.43642857142858,70.89285714285714,8.742857142857144,30.42857142857143,9.120678840339163,2.5359785714285703,1107,46,221,22,20,368,147,280,0.1,0.877,0.023,-0.9625,1,0,15,0,0,1,28.0,0,0,2,1,8,4,1,0,18,0,24,22,0,3,3,47,43,25,0,4,8,0,0,0,0,3,8,2,0,0,12,19,21,2,7,10,2,6,6,3,0,2,16,2,30,1,31,22,8,45,0,1,0,0,4,15,0,5,24,153,42,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12789751408702346,0.5396784826630234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04905844072514349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422089854464318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05547207426813236,0.0,0.13192968574190495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0621431937832147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04652505934104701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5653667265976715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389562660502746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060782011588444824,0.0,0.06483579397518999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08199893083745075,0.0,0.05769785011494182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722856936262408,0.08143855223207035,0.07792479749806351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11760929540164672,0.0,0.07638703797814256,0.07838154643113769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061331807059993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21742637788947686,0.0,0.0,0.0726745966216851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17274707981790266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05563968511480482,0.0,0.0,0.13539912292279194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768279466697486,0.09776939044163237,0.10973315698332678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05001357459781123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06902931642749895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774525731882097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108965023611851,0.0,0.07353879484034899,0.061124943473722965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021237231230082,0.0,0.0,0.06031321310231987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13867536527950958,0.0,0.0,0.1261982152821836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09795818060933788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06230677184783456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573452246247598,0.0,0.0,0.06687554821680815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05251960023129721,0.0,0.0,0.15374096206605026,0.0,0.0,0.046456521060066015

This was supposed to be my free week for spring break and it has been ruined by his selfish behavior.",3.2731451612903237,5.2366818387096785,4.296438172043016,84.96465725806455,74.6989247311828,7.660752688172043,29.90456989247312,8.472884824447931,2.2940763440860223,373,17,74,7,8,121,65,93,0.126,0.8290000000000001,0.045,-0.7942,0,0,5,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,1,5,0,1,4,0,16,7,2,1,1,11,18,5,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,5,5,1,0,2,2,3,2,3,0,1,5,3,8,3,10,12,1,10,0,1,2,0,12,1,0,1,5,50,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7004691237340834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21667441027864484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663679375134485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14090214832630152,0.2252442820563975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21402816970600547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19419592081047796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18574470399144608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085648032923147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2468213029824298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20591572445265766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17525225202769704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590567450453415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,hok101,2018/03/12,"Alcohol Blackouts... how bad is it? Hi all - firstly, I'm so happy this community exists. I've been reading all your posts and it's nice to not feel alone.

I've been experiencing alcohol blackouts my whole life. I'm a 30 y/o female, and in the past four weekends I've had 3. That's my thing, Saturday nights out I end up overdoing it and blacking out. Is it possible that I'm more predisposed to blackouts? Either way, I know I need to make a change.

My anxiety level if through the roof about the effects this is having on my brain. Does anyone know how likely it is I've done permanent damage and will end up with dementia in 10 years? I know I need to make changes but it's the fear of the damage that's done that leaves me unable to sleep.

Any advice or stories of your own experiences would be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,AcadianaRain,2018/03/12,"Alcoholic roommate may be dying.. help? My roommate gets really drunk really fast, and then nods off in his office chair. He sits there shuffling around with his eyes closed, and says random things every few minutes. He said ""HEY!"" a few minutes ago, so I said ""whats up?"" No answers. 20 minutes later he said ""Thank you, I've been looking."" There was a commercial on TV and I thought that's what he was talking about. But I looked at him, and he wasn't even facing the tv; he was facing me, reclined, with his feet up on the couch, his eyes closed and his mouth open.

alcoholism,throwaway645213846,2018/03/13,"I'm angry, frustrated and hurt Living with an alcoholic, I've become exhausted and cynical towards him. I tried my best to relieve financial stress, provide a great lifestyle, encourage AA meetings. But no, none of that help until he really fucked up things and it was on my last nerve. I got his family directly involve. He's getting better, he's happier, he still wants to be together. I feel hurt, I have horrible memories, I still love him. Alcoholism is one one of the worst things I have ever dealt with.

alcoholism,himeayumi22,2018/03/13,"Survey: gender differences in alcohol use among college students as a way to cope with emotions Hello everyone,

We’re conducting research on gender differences in alcohol use among college students as a way to cope with emotions. This will help us point to the need of greater alcohol control policies (in terms of access, availability, pricing marketing), modifying the role of campus culture, challenge media-driven messages of acceptability of alcohol tolerance and reinforce personal values and consistent rules across gender and health campaigns.

Please take a few minutes of your time to fill out our survey. Each answer that is recorded is anonymous.

alcoholism,basicrerun,2018/03/14,"Somewhat scared what I’m doing isn’t normal.. I’m in college right now, and my family has a lot of substance abuse issues. Mainly drugs, but a couple have problems with alcohol.

I never drank much before I got here, it was only about once a month when I would go out. Now, I’m a freshman in college, and have started drinking a lot. 3-4 nights a week. I don’t ever do it alone, but with roommates, friends, or my boyfriend. It’s always available in my apartment, and it’s so easy to just grab a beer, or two, or five. 
Recently we had spring break, and I went home for a week. Over this time I missed drinking so so bad. I felt like I wasn’t having nearly as much fun as I could be had I been drinking. Thinking of ways to get alcohol, if there were any options. And the day I got back I got very drunk and have been drinking all week. I’ve started getting extremely frustrated if I end up going out to a party to something like that sober. 
Aside from this though, I have good grades, involved on campus, whatever... so I don’t think anyone sees this problem but my boyfriend who’s noticed it a bit. What I’m wondering is, is this just being somewhat new to living on my own and I’ll grow out of it? Or is this something I should worry about?

alcoholism,lum197ivic,2018/03/14,"First time hair of the dog question I went through a pretty hard breakup last week and for the first time I've been drinking in the morning (occasionally). 

Last night I went on a bender, woke up this morning and have been drinking lightly through the day at work.

My question is whether or not I'm setting myself up for a massive hangover or if I can ease my way into tomorrow?

EDIT: I wanted to sincerely thank the people on this board who have taken time to help me understand the path I was heading down. I've spoken to my brother about my drinking and I'm going to work with a therapist to resolve some of the issues I face. 

I truly appreciate all of you helping me see what was happening when I couldn't.

alcoholism,throwawayxexyz123,2018/03/14,"Al anon alternative? My mom died a few weeks ago of alcoholism and lung disease from smoking. It was devastating. We were estranged because I was afraid of her unpredictability. I feel like I need support group with other people who understand what it is like to experience a loved one lose themselves to addiction. I went to an al anon meeting for the first time and just felt worse afterwards. It was just so *cold*. People shared difficult experiences and no one said anything. No “omg that’s horrible!”, no “are you okay?”, no “you’re not alone.” They just said their piece to what could have been an empty room and then the next person was called on to read a random page from their book and share without any response or expressions of empathy. 

In researching alternatives, the only things I find are atheistic groups who splintered from al anon because of issue with the whole higher power thing. I really don’t mind that stuff, it’s just the lack of dialogue and, well, *support* that turned me off from al anon big time. Also most of their approach seems to be in dealing with an alcoholic that is still living, which no longer applies to me. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,Bumblebreez,2018/03/15,"Confronted my mother about her alcoholism. I apologize this is a bit of a long story. So my brother and his gf live with my husband and I and they got into a small fight yesterday. My brother went over to my mom’s house to visit with his family that’s in town from out of state (they’re my step family, he’s my half brother). 

According to him my mother was extremely intoxicated when he got there and as usual she gets very emotionally drunk and clingy and just wants to hug and love and she acts very strange/awkward when she’s like this. Well she could tell my brother was visibly upset from the fight he’d had earlier and she started getting super nosy. He didn’t want to talk about it because he was there to see family, not hash out his personal problems. So he tried to tell her he didn’t want to talk about it and tried to walk away.

My mother proceeds to follow him all over the house as he’s trying to escape what has now become a stressful situation for him and she just won’t stop. So when flight didn’t work, his fight kicked in and he blew up at her and left. Thus she ruined his last chance to probably visit with his 92 year old grandmother that’s slowly developing dementia.

I didn’t know anything about this til my husband gets a call from my mom at that sweet hour of 11pm at night. This is her pattern and she does it frequently when she’s drunk. She drunk calls between 11pm and 2am. So she starts going on and on about how worried she is about my brother and his gf’s relationship and is afraid they’ll break up and he’s going to try to commit suicide or something. Just straight up overreacting about everything.

My husband didn’t feel comfortable talking about it with them in the other room and it echoes pretty loudly in our house so he said he’d text her. He assured her my brother’s fine, he’s an adult, he’ll sort it out on his own and this just went back and forth with her whining lots, “I’m a concerned mother, I love him, I just want what’s best for him, etc.”

Then it devolved into, “He hates me.”

That’s when I got involved. I got up and grabbed my phone and called her. “Hi Mom, no he doesn’t hate you. Everything will be fine. They’re not even fighting anymore just talking. No I don’t know what’s going on.”

Finally I just said Mom I’m *really* worried about you. I didn’t want to tell you like this over the phone and I’m not trying to upset you but you have a serious problem with drunk calling in the middle of the night. Like you do it *a lot*. And I know why you do it too. I know you’re extremely depressed, feeling lonely and you and your husband are indifferent to one another. And I know I’m not around as much as I could be, but if you need me more I will try to be there for you.

So she broke down and cried and agreed with everything I’d said and we talked a little more and I finally let her go and sent her off to bed so I could go to bed.

So I decided I’m going to head over today to sit down and talk about her problems and what we can do to work on them while she’s sober. 

Her first issue is her dog. She has a Jack Russel terrier that’s like 14 years old and gets extreme separation anxiety and barks nonstop whenever my mom leaves the house. So since mom doesn’t work she just stays home all the time and feels tethered to the house because of the dog’s behavior. I’ve already suggested vet prescribed medication for the dog to calm her down when my mom leaves but she turned that idea down, so I don’t know what to suggest there.

The second issue is that my mom has gained a lot of weight and had to quit smoking because she developed COPD. So her self esteem has really dropped. This is someone who used to have men chasing her left and right because she was a petite, cute, 110 lb woman. Most of her weight has gone into her belly and it makes her look bloated/pregnant. I know she’s ashamed and I wish she wouldn’t feel that way after seeing my lifelong struggle with weight (I’m 270 lbs/she’s maybe 160lbs though a few inches shorter than me).

I know that my step-dad has been physically unattracted to her for a long while now and they have a dead bedroom as a result. So she’s become an indifferent bitch towards the man who is essentially her roommate at this point. The loveless marriage has left her feeling incredibly lonely, but she 100% relies on him to take care of her financially and so I don’t think she’d ever try to leave him for that reason alone. (Nor him because he’s 62 and would lose his financial stability plus everything he’s worked years and years for).

I mentioned that she should try to open the doors of love and affection towards him again, because although he’s not interested in sex with her he still takes really good care of her and makes sure she’s got everything she needs and I think he actually cares for her still. I said we all notice when you treat him badly and lash out at him. I think he’d appreciate some kind words from you.

These are all the root causes of why she drinks and I want to do my best to help her. My stepdad drinks a lot too but I don’t have as close of a relationship with him and have no idea where to start with him.

I work and go to college full time so I don’t get a whole lot of time to spend with anyone but I’m going to make an effort to help my mom because I don’t want to see her this sad anymore. She’s only in her mid 50s and still has a lot of life to live. She shouldn’t spend it drunk and miserable.

I’ve already once dealt with extreme alcoholism with my husband who’s 3 years sober, but he more or less realized his own problem and changed his behavior on his own after hiding his functional drinking from me really well. 

This is the first time I’ve actually had to have some kind of intervention. Any advice is welcome.",2.9759903877308567,4.465251987309647,4.019118695323471,88.64399611189114,74.3891708967851,7.2632897721136205,24.588004464125,7.915984808538092,1.157662569751953,4547,142,979,66,94,1473,420,1182,0.107,0.7809999999999999,0.112,0.7296,2,5,6,0,5,2,91.0,4,13,5,14,60,59,8,7,40,0,72,22,1,11,8,180,155,103,2,22,23,24,9,4,2,9,5,5,6,6,42,85,13,1,21,8,2,18,26,29,2,5,27,19,171,30,149,108,28,135,0,9,4,5,207,60,1,13,55,630,213,6,0.0,0.0,0.07431889820975462,0.0,0.0,0.037210195935735935,0.0,0.08138938619481417,0.0,0.039438188110849766,0.08404188055118464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02589491293977592,0.03992897766679459,0.02913020382967918,0.0,0.07552794259949543,0.026625606151863653,0.0,0.03133563590458745,0.033898235495189666,0.0,0.0,0.03577631807809744,0.029280272926119788,0.031794235886282086,0.1624875266568475,0.08411016103481539,0.0,0.0,0.0799227741375633,0.0,0.04157222446215236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15553098817725486,0.0,0.11647172743680158,0.039117451877388236,0.04028235736244989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09120855148235768,0.0,0.04182781117080165,0.0,0.0,0.03279724397856375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033323044294790695,0.0,0.0,0.11190828184630897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0428335630467481,0.0,0.0,0.04246796566228957,0.025150710766706226,0.03444448546181755,0.0,0.0,0.17111400357944034,0.0,0.10769200746745444,0.0,0.0962690132088424,0.0,0.0,0.08342700286842762,0.0,0.0647796735980013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994730957526141,0.0,0.17312863138776682,0.03193871937162682,0.15227561082805782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751899302981085,0.03907986948962849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05104687960632053,0.0,0.03819617532070537,0.0,0.03749998115226461,0.2196893097165626,0.0,0.08597273736464388,0.0,0.07948881913428191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930649188961883,0.1674170508154211,0.03103933207332002,0.0,0.1209599613603846,0.12411829387062392,0.038938187746465534,0.026896206621610044,0.07441357954238736,0.03816499539693805,0.06724861622342365,0.06739713974444991,0.03197663021112231,0.042600475124802216,0.0,0.19423957803579467,0.1031029033087389,0.0,0.07625375226647092,0.0,0.03825530695660837,0.0,0.0,0.038360419219099925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40137723206066656,0.0,0.0,0.027992324441028137,0.056469945920925815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07146881246901801,0.0,0.0,0.04335300496231829,0.07991466159359481,0.04055271551538022,0.02580320344714365,0.02896066920074028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03324896913224263,0.0,0.0,0.03599680635374493,0.0,0.0,0.038739863827150264,0.04105542355671582,0.14574520614685524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0405015272393251,0.0,0.0,0.09757710465287303,0.03915138343471351,0.0,0.0817648343495918,0.0,0.032519116228172135,0.14488676462592778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103170198807428,0.0,0.039724528609885484,0.0,0.0,0.03149920503038765,0.042802204924237884,0.0,0.0,0.032264072528696355,0.029314946823032324,0.0,0.0,0.08085718421541851,0.04058697055805476,0.09122941820666496,0.031835610331623666,0.043619175760976,0.039808265160960365,0.0,0.041652064016968325,0.0,0.035888850457221406,0.0,0.05726108848775782,0.18363794650180792,0.09984773808342236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07319813792948515,0.03741226112731811,0.0,0.08881629744943169,0.0,0.03609428224784298,0.0,0.0,0.2068242301323352,0.0414188368450048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032887886543267984,0.041938455980124655,0.06283805207551202,0.1572191804208222,0.030225206053133023,0.0,0.13910928416299825,0.0684748898084439,0.07059892133858556,0.06872044991109601,0.04251365835462017,0.04378877992143263,0.0,0.0,0.1386092235626491,0.07734180875739202,0.0,0.02705011118122337,0.0,0.0,0.1226076033556769

But when I was drinking I remember that my hangovers just got worse and worse with time. When I was say 25 I could down a six pack of beers and feel nothing the day after, but once I turned 30 if I drank the same amount I would get a killer hangover (LIKE REALLY BAD), and it would take 3-4 days until I felt normal again.

alcoholism,miloea,2018/03/16,"Unsure whether I am overthinking my situation Hello. I should start out by saying that in December, I lost my dad to alcoholism, and I am still mentally going through a lot with the whole situation. He had been a functioning alcoholic my whole life, up until closer to the end (I don't know exact timelines.... I hadn't seen him in 2 years due to living in different states..) my mother and I discovered he was no longer functioning and was lucky to even be alive toward the end.


With all of that said, I had never had a second thought about my own drinking before. Now, I am very conscious of every sip I take. My drinking habits have not changed much since prior to his passing, but now alcohol is always on my mind which is what worries me. Typically, I will drink (at most) 3-4 servings per week; usually more like 1-2. I am perfectly fine with having one drink at a time and stopping. However, with this being said, my fiance and I had a goal to go the entire month of March without a drink, and we ended up ditching that 2 days ago. I simply had 1 drink and haven't had anything since, but it was mentally difficult for me to go even that long knowing that I could not have a drink. I realize mentality is the biggest part of alcoholism, which is why I'm concerned. I know that I inherited the characteristics of an addict, as I struggle to control my food intake most of the time. I know I am not dependent on it now, but don't have the willpower/want to stop drinking altogether.",5.493333333333332,5.888458969072168,6.569982817869416,76.75366838487975,67.55670103092784,9.903092783505157,32.317869415807564,9.861636050157227,3.068135395189004,1164,47,224,25,18,391,162,291,0.07,0.8740000000000001,0.056,-0.2407,3,0,12,0,0,0,41.0,1,0,0,4,7,7,0,1,16,0,32,15,0,2,4,43,47,13,0,2,8,2,0,1,0,2,6,3,0,0,12,13,13,3,7,8,1,4,10,3,0,2,16,4,35,4,37,26,10,42,0,1,1,0,11,13,0,5,25,166,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875301143188612,0.0,0.0,0.07117399945127016,0.3432308510282011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06680936291028386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660734616753179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832256476924581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493827294532877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005428764512906,0.06410661596465386,0.0,0.0,0.051781687418207066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388803421020909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.62924461629879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21334459823028884,0.0,0.0,0.1060641966233522,0.0,0.06764945965250779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970893860034928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13689535484931534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17650549879583036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05671260295580013,0.03922660777483497,0.0,0.07089929306502522,0.07105587937468705,0.0,0.0,0.0876481855247112,0.06826137369743057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427463055889767,0.0,0.08107201536915397,0.0,0.06408829575739917,0.0,0.059023846900345435,0.0,0.06192612805805516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0544079264661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08694839449073406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275212730517074,0.06385140851928492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328367180877034,0.18050310868379155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05683107967659961,0.0,0.06412128229867481,0.13425538805478313,0.0,0.0839386151435511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060369579656894226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06374286675230878,0.09363780335489448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843027702907105,0.06624929582097845,0.0,0.0,0.0644053865865798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245102712031888,0.1792862659321569,0.0,0.07739860754166099,0.0,0.0,0.08154040741970682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051705405348023696

alcoholism,jeremy_jer,2018/03/16,"What is the line between regular ""social"" drinker and an alcoholic ? Am I becoming an alcoholic ? I always enjoyed drinking, actually since I was a teenager (now I'm getting close to 30) but I never considered myself to be an alcoholic.. except maybe tonight. I enjoy having a glass of wine/beer (or a couple more than that, almost never too much except for parties) pretty much every night as it relaxes me. If I am not home or I am busy doing other stuff I don't mind staying sober, not being able to drink wasn't a problem for me.

A couple of months ago I broke up with my girlfriend (had a major fight at a party when I was drunk..things went south really fast) and since that night my ""evening glass"" started to feel more like a necessity, although I don't drink more than before, but I feel the need to have that glass.

I am really sure I can stop without any problems if I want to. My life has not changed due to drinking, I am functioning pretty well in the society. Was I an alcoholic all the time?  Am I becoming an alcoholic ?

alcoholism,IronCondors4life,2018/03/16,"Possible to be an alcoholic if only drinking 2-4 drinks per day and not having problems with personal life or work? I've got in the habit of having a few drinks before bed to help sleep. Usually 2-4 drinks (beer or wine). If I don't drink , I can't sleep. I rarely drink more than 4 though because then I have trouble waking up too early and not being able to fall back to sleep.

But I'm a little worried about needing it to fall asleep. I don't drink during the day.. even put it off until right before bed (9-10pm).

alcoholism,SteamboatWilley,2018/03/18,"Alcoholic ready to come out. Hello everyone. I'm finally ready to admit to myself that I am an alcoholic. I made the stupid mistake of quitting cold turkey, but I pulled through with one trip to the ER. With the Doctor's assurance, I believe I'm over the hump. She informed me that 2-3 days after the last drink is the most dangerous part. Going into day 5 now, and I've never felt better. It was a very sobering(no pun intended) experience. It was the closed eye hallucinations that did me in and made me seek immediate help.

I was one of the lucky ones, not being a heavy liquor drinker. My poison was beer, in multiple 24oz cans variety. Going on day 5, I'm still a touch shaky but I'm free of most of the other symptoms. At least the physical ones. The anxiety and depression are still there but I can manage that with my therapist's help. 

I just wanted to share my story for those that are on the fence. You're not alone, and don't quit cold turkey, especially if you've been drinking for years.

alcoholism,anonymous9183735582,2018/03/18,"Alcohol brings out a bad side of me and I want to quit. Advice? I don’t know if this is the correct place to post this, so if there is somewhere else more relevant, please tell me.  


I’m not necessarily addicted to alcohol, however, it’s always brought the worst out of me.  I’m only 20 (legal to drink in my country) and I study, so I feel if I am not drinking around my peers whilst they are, I’ll be judged for it.  
I used to suffer from depression and alcohol always brought the worst of it out.  I once ended up in hospital due to an ‘apparent’ suicide attempt whilst under the influence (I blacked out and I don’t remember this night).  The past couple years I honestly thought I’d learnt to control my reactions whilst under the influence, however, a couple nights ago proved me wrong.  I haven’t been in the greatest of mental places right now due to stress and other reasons, and this all came out once I drank a lot whilst out, but it ended up with me hurting my SO (mentally and physically).  I can’t deal with how I reacted and I am honestly so disgusted in myself.  
I am trying my hardest to regain my SO’s trust, he says it’s fine, but I don’t feel fine with the situation so I want to do whatever I can to fix it.  I feel like I’ve ruined everything between us.  

I want to be able to be better, and I want to stop drinking alcohol all together because I usually have depressed episodes the day after I drink, but whilst I am drinking, it usually helps break my awkward barrier whilst in social situations which is why I will usually drink a lot.  

What I’m asking is do you have any suggestions to help me stop and how to better myself from what I’ve done?

alcoholism,edgarjungle,2018/03/18,"Complicated problem with my treatment I started my treatment for a month ago because my family, my friends and my fionce was worried about my drinking, so i didnt hestitate to start a treatment because i knew that it was bad.

On next Thursday comes my treatment and im parcitipate in a Research in alkohol treatment by a pH.d student.

But here comes the issue.

My boss do not want me to go there, because we have to practice music in the band, that i play in.
And if i go to treatment, he will snitch so everyone knows that im an alkoholic.

alcoholism,Rustynails77777,2018/03/19,"How to find the thrill. 39m.  Heavy drinker for the past 10 years.  Benders for weeks.  With few sober days here and there.  Sick of it. But feel lost without it.  

I’m trying quitting  again and I’ll spare you guys the details.  Day 4. 

I quit smoking at least, few weeks  ago.  And those two went hand in hand. 


How do you find the thrill again.  To me drinking would make things more fun. 
Doing things at home.  In the yard. Music. Working on my Cars. Playing with kids.   Anything basically.    Anything I do I feel like. Hey wait. Half a liter of Vodka might make this even more fun.  
So then I back down and don’t go to liquor store.   I have to remind myself that I will feel like shit the next day. I’ll miss a day of work. Because half a liter of vodka later, no way I’m going to work.  Doctors told me to quit as my liver is inflamed. That worries me. 

I’m sick of this. But I want to have the kick of excitement.  Source  of adventure.  Being sober is calm. And I love it. But it’s so boring. My life long issue is, I get bored so fast. 
I need a constant source of excitement.  How can I get it ?? 

I read, go to gym, work around my kids as much as I can. 

Thanks.

alcoholism,choose_your_fighter,2018/03/19,"I think I have a problem. It was my birthday this Saturday past, and I invited several friends over for a small get together. Anyway, within less than four hours I got wasted, was sick everywhere, and ruined everyone's day. I have felt terrible ever since and I don't want to drink again.

That wasn't a one-off, either. Last year my depression got worse and worse until I almost killed myself. Twice. Most of that year, I didn't have proper access to alcohol, being a 16 year old with no money or ID, but every day, all I could think about was drinking. I had drunk before, but never to the extent I so desperately wanted to go to.

Anyway, there were a good few occasions where I got to drink, heavily, and each time I made terrible decisions and almost got myself killed. Most of these were accidental, I didn't consciously try to hurt myself, but on at least one occasion I know I deliberately tried to kill myself, and I used alcohol to make it easier.

Honestly, I feel bad saying that I have a problem because, for the most part, I haven't actually had access to alcohol. Obviously, there's been a big temptation, but it's only rarely I've managed to go through with it. I'm posting here because I'm kind of afraid of what I might do if I drink again, and I know that I'm going to feel that temptation again.

alcoholism,CryptoEIGHTY,2018/03/21,"Binge drank 3 days ago, I still feel very dizzy and can't see very much Basically on Saturday I went out and got wasted the entire day, drank all day and had some fluids throughout the entire day to keep me good (About 15 shots in total throughout the day). I was sober and OK by Sunday morning. Sunday night i decided to go out again and I had very little drinks again (3-4 shots in total).

It is now Wednesday. Ever since this weekend I have not been able to see very properly, I feel very dizzy as if I am still buzzed or something. I have been drinking lots of fluids. I feel like the vision is constantly getting worse and I am getting really scared. I don't know what to do at this point, I am planning to see a doctor if this doesn't get better soon. Note, I am not a constant drinker I probably binge drink once a month if not every two months. 

I am not drinking ever again after this. 

Any help would be amazing :(",2.5641129032258085,4.351542978494621,3.598588709677422,89.96788306451614,76.20430107526882,6.155376344086022,22.37768817204301,6.9077264865688965,0.5720333333333332,718,20,149,7,16,231,109,186,0.103,0.8059999999999999,0.09,-0.3296,0,0,6,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,2,10,6,0,1,7,1,20,7,0,0,5,30,36,11,0,4,8,0,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,8,6,1,5,5,0,2,7,1,0,1,9,6,17,5,16,25,6,36,0,0,3,0,1,8,0,6,27,96,23,1,0.10695455141959466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094808756565111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07273276259317017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09459260916120206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2311597475681663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3448841876818161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10947251543034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4190989694728615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19349303004530252,0.0901138224829861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16223830446733506,0.07640835290468828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16763801619126445,0.0,0.060784736340360336,0.08970840330643415,0.08554132525446477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07168938131137002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09506611956652762,0.0,0.0,0.05877942435704565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052252591340545364,0.10719655849126593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092893488598626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17074020507435908,0.0,0.07862390164181463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036960120727613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11390310664292358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110662185767154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153150961216747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685178243672032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070801643433668,0.0,0.25568679008689177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08847391017212675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233883900941467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17082808584502926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447905563279088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4412435305396543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914794069776227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089958252795252,0.07597744465248636,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,hisimaginaryfriend,2018/03/21,"Has anyone here tried CBD oil to help with withdrawal? So it's been an on going battle for the past 2 years of trying to quit. I can never make it past 3 days without drinking until I go back. The primary thing that lures me back in is how stressed, anxious, and irritable I am. I just feel on edge and I also get extremely depressed. One little thing happens and it's like I need to drink. I feel like if I wasn't so stressed out the urge to drink wouldn't be as prevalent which I've read that CBD oil can help. I don't really trust the websites I've been reading because there's not enough evidence to prove that it does work. After all, our government makes it almost impossible for hemp research. I just wanted to see if any of you have tried this and whether it helped, didn't work at all, or made things worse.

alcoholism,lcsnlsn,2018/03/21,"Questioning the Twelve Steps Hey everyone! I'm currently in recovery, I completed treatment and have 120 days sober currently. I'm writing a piece about my experiences with Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous, and my issues with the way the programs are structured. I understand and respect that the 12 Steps work for a lot of people, but they don't work for me for various reasons. I don't feel this means I am unwilling to commit to recovery, or that recovery is outside my grasp. Although much of how these programs currently operate is wonderful, I think many people and the programs themselves could benefit from some potential changes to make them more open and inclusive of different sets of beliefs.

alcoholism,myotheraccount698797,2018/03/21,"what is the likelihood the alcoholic in my life will physically hurt me? so my brother has been an alcoholic for many years and has moved back to our family home where i've been living and assisting my elderly parents.  i won't get really into the dynamics of the situation except to say he's unhinged and we're avoiding having real talks with him because he has a temper.  he's never hit any of us and i'm not much of an alarmist but i'm a little worried about whether or not he'll be killing us all in our sleep.  he stays in his room all day drinking and we sometimes message each other on facebook instead of talking face to face.  so yesterday he was talking about being a sociopath and wrote this to me: 'if anything, you should be more worried about the hate filled suicidal monster I am now, than the charming potential sociopath I once was........ and im right next door.'

soo... i mean... do you think this is just talk or should i be more worried?  because he really is a suicidal hate filled monster from what i can tell.",3.745816831683168,5.404161242574261,4.8723638613861375,82.61666460396042,72.7128712871287,8.020297029702972,30.94183168316832,8.660442795831766,2.5393158415841586,809,37,155,15,16,266,125,202,0.165,0.782,0.054000000000000006,-0.9755,1,1,3,0,0,0,25.0,5,2,0,0,10,8,4,1,12,0,22,7,3,0,3,30,32,14,3,3,9,2,0,0,0,5,3,1,3,0,5,11,3,1,2,1,0,3,4,6,0,0,5,1,20,2,21,17,6,20,0,1,0,0,26,9,0,3,7,108,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25641220332097225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815803139957303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872097358649186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922456802519068,0.0,0.14625910144573664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07736750075236924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11752002916528018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11309232569421533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06267676129669836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23688120277919916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033467667360592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12842501402240564,0.0,0.12958278644774696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13272349856541307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08473482751566168,0.0,0.12023644626143125,0.10593129314712303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12162568107757933,0.0,0.1306770542982095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12750380999649394,0.08818807858827242,0.0,0.09252440385784526,0.0,0.12758413881823827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277588101114068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13320693595960453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13654643405011962,0.15370530217439118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10244945479939847,0.0,0.09540098330049088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13484568670108593,0.1200516376129064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186484528179314,0.0,0.0,0.12786672849459754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624444784948515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3856932922691714,0.10485469795494028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686872823345936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886062489786698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3654908432073125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772535270018686

I've been a heavy drinker for a long time now (41 years old drinking since pre-teen). I quit two weeks ago with one relapse a few days ago. I found the physical aspects to be hard but having quit cocaine addiction in the past something I could sort of drive myself through but I feel no joy since quitting. Nothing makes me happy, I find myself just staring, feeling nothing but sadness, regret, and emotional pain. The things that usually make me feel happy like playing music and spending time with my sons don't work anymore and I'm finding it hard to keep going. My work is suffering and I just need to know how to keep going. Alcohol has been my thing, how my life has been defined. I'm just lost. Will this ever end?

alcoholism,mynamejeff8,2018/03/22,"Trouble regaining my mental state I became an alcoholic over the summer for about two months i was drunk everyday and since then i was getting wasted not as often but still a lot. I finally got sober this past month, i dont really know who i am anymore or why i started i think i tried to forget something. Now i think i'm regaining my mental state a bit but i still not really there, i feel like a shell of a person. This might also be affected by occasionally weed and xanax use but i quit those three weeks ago. I also dont think i can really build muscle so i might have wet brain but i doubt it. If anyone knows anyway to undo this it would be appreciated.",1.6034285714285732,3.8663093481481496,3.904047619047617,84.24750000000003,81.44444444444444,7.116402116402117,19.272486772486765,8.192908349453996,1.0195820105820117,522,13,105,11,14,180,91,135,0.106,0.8290000000000001,0.065,-0.2627,0,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,10,3,0,1,6,0,12,4,1,2,0,26,23,13,0,3,8,0,2,1,0,3,2,0,0,1,7,2,2,0,6,1,0,0,4,2,0,2,3,2,19,1,8,15,2,16,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,7,14,75,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12702691141908484,0.15314424946608204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22919411068007375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421152145739371,0.100198776802336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564466182028406,0.0,0.0,0.15997032771893652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3358933501604409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245684708529171,0.10237363538711072,0.0,0.1569782785793276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07486839895628766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461019782816832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15750799823937114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07000920096525816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12182863878466252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28882563571989683,0.30403756662789483,0.0,0.0,0.2287615795357689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13679618065807006,0.0,0.12512413869519173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15241731830855665,0.0,0.0,0.27540518160505034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853934127504982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11031943449249013,0.0,0.0,0.10142856351458752,0.0,0.2288793241753549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2754627948340519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972913759885157,0.0,0.1399833963216436,0.0,0.0,0.1237652951243254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494671368645965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293060706885739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10179629478730423,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,sobernaut_1,2018/03/22,"Four days. First off, I know somebody will suggest I post this in r/stopdrinking, but I don’t feel I’ve earned that yet, I’m only four days in.

I’m 21 years old, and I’m an alcoholic. In the words of Townes van Zandt, ‘if I had a dollar bill, Yes I’d leave I surely will, but I tend to drink my fill early in the morning.’ I don’t know how I got here and how it got so bad, sometimes I tell myself it’s not that bad and I’m not an alcoholic, but I do tend to drink my fill early in the morning.

I’m an alcoholic just like my father before me and his father before him and probably far down the line. My mother comes from a family of alcoholics; her dad died from the disease when I was a baby and her mom liked to drink. Her little brother drank and ran for twenty years before he got sober. I don’t know much about my mom’s family other than her deceased mother and two siblings. I know she has an uncle, but I’ve only talked to him once the day his sister died. I was 14 and he was drunk. My dad caught three dui’s and a coke addiction before he got sober 30 years ago. Some of his brothers were less lucky; his closest brother died from liver and kidney failure the day my dad celebrated 18 years in recovery.

I didn’t even drink until I was 18 and even then it was a slow start. I was a college student and drank with my friends on the weekends, but I was a dedicated and successful student and I waited tables on the side. When I was 20, I got a fake ID with my friends and realized I could start buying some nice craft beer with all the cash I was stuffing waiting tables. That was roughly in April of 2015. I was in an amazing relationship, I had just published my first paper, I was still making lots of money and killing it in school. 

It only took a year for alcohol to seize control of my life and make me a prisoner. By April of 2016, my relationship had ended in flames and I was no longer speaking with my ex girlfriend except to occasionally fight and bring each other to tears. I totaled my car on the freeway and caught a DUI in the process. I went from a 4.0 honors student publishing in academic journals to dropping out of college. I went from making money waiting tables to sitting in rehab. I ruined everything.

It took me another year of trying, failing, building sandcastles of hope and drowning them in the cheapest vodka I could find. A year of burning bridges with nearly everybody I love. A year gone and nothing to show for it but a probably damaged liver. How did I do this? I just want to be loved.

Four days ago, I lied half-sober, half-awake in my bed at 3 am, my insides churning, dreading a day that had barely begun. I was cursing myself and wondering how I would work a shift that night and write the paper I needed to finish during the day during what would inevitably turn into another protracted hangover. As I lied in bed, a section from the big book that I always chuckled at from my brief time in aa kept going through my head:

“We became subjects to king alcohol, shivering denizens of his mad realm’

I always dismissed it as cheesy hyperbole, but as I laid awake in bed, literally shivering and physically getting ill from alcohol, wondering how I could best structure my day to mitigate the effects of a hangover, I realized I was nothing more than a shivering denizen of king alcohol’s realm. I had become a prisoner. Alcohol dictated my life—how I feel physically, how I deal with things emotionally, what I can and can’t do, how I can and can’t spend my money, what I choose to value, my moral compass, alcohol dictated all of these. I don’t want to be a prisoner anymore.

I don’t want to be a prisoner anymore.",4.857991093518058,5.406049300957594,5.972324708210845,79.9459114590913,68.98632010943912,8.957254707919784,31.148266728759786,9.021347882292716,2.5576960794015773,2873,114,562,50,47,960,313,731,0.136,0.752,0.111,-0.976,0,0,17,1,1,0,76.0,1,0,1,12,19,25,3,1,45,1,47,29,4,12,4,101,98,51,5,11,14,14,3,2,3,4,14,1,3,0,23,39,19,5,13,10,8,15,11,10,1,7,39,4,95,15,87,49,12,93,1,3,0,2,45,35,0,8,42,374,118,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0587567381698379,0.0,0.0,0.09555458901890937,0.576005338351563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896948501521002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303343281613025,0.0,0.0,0.1069045981693169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000509995478598,0.0,0.05952606848477523,0.18345279589670693,0.0,0.056562589683267474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04642832493395588,0.0,0.0,0.06045115148554005,0.12909941950268405,0.0,0.0,0.2780778316857171,0.0555664359077033,0.0,0.0,0.16781273678236147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21119794857094815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060627956860343474,0.04773759978004576,0.0,0.0,0.0711981959430576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04844001614291379,0.0,0.10162041039040302,0.0,0.05450486174538912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04926176413732418,0.09169116405376704,0.0,0.0,0.08328286908446646,0.0,0.028159462482597094,0.0,0.03063145594382417,0.0,0.21553563391609654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05531486229476601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053532841208126083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059630113316155926,0.0,0.1184836494158274,0.0,0.0,0.0570701633450576,0.0,0.0,0.07613945414637446,0.052663647025998614,0.054019921059927666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04582212296493171,0.09729003658737112,0.0,0.1079319317378595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12624929185419673,0.0,0.0,0.03962120631382395,0.03996465857233585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05057958959079124,0.0,0.10343310330682397,0.0,0.056556848309788785,0.05739957435137796,0.0,0.12297549477961027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05161935229500512,0.0,0.11622224588522374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573248866151778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05454761868760974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05330646617059216,0.0,0.07629851496144154,0.0,0.04304298497100963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05079819474539203,0.0,0.0,0.0433211431507678,0.047109197605296964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035807413430872057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03142833719192773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197652459455634,0.036593180704030136,0.05862550940961705,0.05265048073496696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09537124972138426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09992790823007434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169000891741776,0.0392383608967127,0.0,0.0,0.0765751367437182,0.0,0.0,0.27766818198655274

To begin, I need to make sure I have not damaged myself too much. My company does a health check-in program, and the nurse who took my blood said that my liver is producing all sorts of bad levels of whatever it normally produces. I am also officially incapable of being sober. I shake, shiver, cough, hurt, feel nauseous, and so much more whenever I start to sober up. I need help. Please. Are there any recommendations for a doctor in Minneapolis who understands/can help me?",3.738936535162949,6.534211830188682,4.866295025728988,77.33710977701544,76.9245283018868,8.382847341337907,25.674099485420236,9.095868883498916,2.5080867924528305,458,17,81,12,11,150,78,106,0.1,0.7440000000000001,0.156,0.6377,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,2,5,5,0,1,3,0,7,5,2,3,2,14,16,4,0,4,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,5,2,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,4,0,0,3,2,13,1,11,12,4,12,0,2,0,0,7,6,0,1,3,51,18,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14659687750276446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12466043361458665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15306030343667473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18763059116508984,0.16042012424632746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17516526448734296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926895329455123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19485519070356028,0.0,0.0,0.3686163858435384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962424162259336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16222793805999802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12236413440721396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695151214305612,0.4077770773587965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17960970286314815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40244947350864624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18428212929703164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17437447024140298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12975124584754066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17277214526000995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20366962421912352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,ForsterForce,2018/03/23,"Day Two: irritable from withdrawal or just seeing things clearly? I've been a heavy drinker for since high school and I'm in my late 30s now. There's been an ""I need to quit drinking"" loop playing in my head since I was about 22 and I've tried to stop on and off since then with varying levels of success but obviously nothing really took. I'm in a committed relationship how and the drinking has become a problem but here's the thing, the NOT drinking is almost a bigger problem. Every time i string 2-3 days together, I start obsessing about wanting to break up and end the relationship. Is that just my alcohol brain creating an excuse (break up / highly emotional states) to drink? Am I just irritable from withdrawal? Or is it possible that even small doses of sobriety are showing me that I'm in the wrong relationship? 

It's almost feeling like I have to either stay a drunk to keep my relationship, or get sober and end it but maybe if I just manage to power through the withdrawal I'll feel differently. 

Any advice? Anyone been in a similar situation?

alcoholism,eggyvine,2018/03/23,"Someone in AA called me a dry drunk... This is what many twelve steppers in alcoholics anonymous call people who don't strictly use AA and God to stay sober. I find this to be nonsensical. I stay sober because I changed my ways, try to do the right thing and accepted the fact that I can't drink or drug anymore without dire consequences. In doing that I have finally achieved the goal of not needing or craving a drink or a drug. Unfortunately, some people who use AA think that those who get sober without AA and God are dry drunks. Honestly it's funny to me because they depend on some invisible man in the sky who we're all just supposed to believe in. On top of that I see die hard AA people going to meetings everyday, working their steps, praying and still relapsing every so often. I've got 1 year 6 months and 10 days sober and I'm never going back to drinking simply because my life is exponentially better and I am reasonably happy. I know for sure that if I do drink again I'm guaranteed either prison or death. That said, I think I'll stick with what's working for me. More power to those who, like my mom,  need AA but it's a flawed philosophy for those of us who don't have religion. 
I have nothing against AA in fact AA started me on my path to recovery. I still attend meetings every so often and I just take something from them  that helps me stay sober. Even if that something is just reminding me how far I've come and helping another alcoholic by talking with them about recovery. One rule of recovery is to worry about your own side of the street. Calling someone a dry drunk because they don't use the same exact tools you do to stay sober is unfair in my opinion. My mother, who has 16 years sober, is an ardent advocate of the AA program. She gets on me about not working the program and it worries her. I've tried explaining my point of view to her to no avail. I get it, she's my mom she's going to worry about me and I did cause many years of damage to cause her such concern. What I'm doing is working for me. I just don't think being forced to work  the AA program is for me... So there's my 2 cents.

Why is it never recommended to someone who is such a bad drunk that they get DT's to  slowly stop drinking?  I realize that's nearly impossible to pull off b/c of the addictive nature of the disease.  But at the same time, what about those who can't afford hospital care? All the hospital will do is stabalize you in mid-DTs and dump you on the street.

alcoholism,Rush58,2018/03/24,"Coming up on 36 years of sobriety I actually have 35 years of sobriety. I started drinking and doing drugs ( mostly cocaine) when I was 17. I got real bad real fast. By the time I was 22 I had to move back in with my parents because I was a physical and financial mess. I was dying and I knew it. July 17th 1982 I took my last drink and last snort of coke. On July 19th I entered rehab. I was ready. 
I spent 30 days in rehab, and my first year in a halfway house. I maintained my job and healed my life. I went to an AA meeting almost every day that first year. 
After I left there I really cut back on going to the meetings in fact I haven't been to one for 32 years now. 
But one thing I have always done and done often to anyone who would listen is to tell my story. I tell it often to this very day. I have literally had dozens of people that I told my story of desperation and hope to enter rehab or go to AA themselves. People I never even knew had a problem, but they wanted what I had. 
I honestly believe that telling my story often and sincerely has been the main reason staying clean and sober has been so easy for me. 
So get clean. Get sober. Tell your story and tell it often to anyone and everyone that will listen. I guarantee you will save your life and many others along the way.

alcoholism,Tilly3,2018/03/24,"How do I know if I am an alcoholic?? I'm 27 and at a low point. My first time posting on here after another humiliating night (passing out in a taxi for hours and being carried to my apartment).  I can go ages without drinking, but can never control it once I start and usually end up blacking out, passing out, pissing people off and losing stuff. This time though I now live with my boyfriend, so I can't keep it secret and only to myself anymore and now I have someone else I have to answer to and ultimately that means when I embarrass myself I embarrass him too...I can never manage to have just a few, or remain sober on a night out even when i intended to. I usually can rationalise it especially when no one else knows what has happened, esp because i am not rude or nasty when i drink, just manic. The drunken me could do anything and have no idea. I don't know where to start...especially since my friends and boyfriends say not to give up, just control myself better on nights out. But I just can't. I consciously try to control myself, then i'll have one more then suddenly i wake up the next day with no  bag or phone and bruises all over and no recollection of anything after 7pm. Is it time to face facts, admit that I am an alcoholic and give it up for good?

alcoholism,jkouts,2018/03/24,"Hooked on bars not booze I've come to the conclusion that it is bars not alcohol that really controls me. At home, work, out to dinner with friends, I don't drink. But the minute I pass by a local dive, I feel I have to step in. And I can't have a beer and call it. I have to drink my weight in whiskey or tequila. I'm realizing this in the back of an uber after ignoring my common sense and going home.

alcoholism,throw-away1972,2018/03/24,"I’m only 20 and I feel out of control I had my first drink when I was 17 and I honestly hated it. I hated everything about drinking, I grew up in a family of alcoholics and always told myself I’d be the one who broke the cycle of alcoholism. 
When I was 18 I went through a bad breakup and I turned to drugs and alcohol. I would constantly pop pills and take shots. I kicked the drug habit, but kept drinking since it’s seen as “socially acceptable”. 
I thought I didn’t have a problem. I didn’t drink everyday. Once or twice a week I would do shot after shot until I blacked out. 
Only until a month before my 20th did I finally acknowledge I even had a problem. I stopped cold turkey and stayed sober for a month. 
There was a loss in my family and I started drinking again, thinking nothing would come of it, but now I feel like I can’t stop. I stopped last week after I fell down drunk as fuck and hurt my knee and head. 
Earlier today I poured a couple shots of rum in my coke while no one watched. I said sorry to my friends but I really wish I could say sorry to myself. I’m ruining my own life and I’m STILL in denial that I have a fucking problem. I’m hoping getting this out there will maybe push me forward in a step to getting help, but at this point I think I’m just a loss cause and I’m better off dead.

alcoholism,squirrelynugget,2018/03/24,"Is my behavior alcoholic? How do I fix this? I only drink to get drunk. I don’t crave alcohol to destress and only drink in social settings. If friends and I are just going to a pub I can easily stop after a couple beers and be perfectly buzzed. But when I hang with my old college friends (not frequently as I live ~3 hours away) and we go to more rowdy venues/clubs I almost always get too drunk. I have zero self control. I end up getting into risky and often embarrassing situations. Let’s just say I’m very lucky to haven’t been assaulted (I’m a lightweight female), arrested, or any medicinal issues.

alcoholism,Kopesh3,2018/03/25,"Alcohol when out with friends. I do enjoy alcohol responsibly. I drink 2 beers a week. My friends drink way more and some of them do drunken rampages where they end up stoned real good and even forgetting what happened the day before. And of course throwing up and being proud of it and showcasing it as a desirable quality sometimes.

I made a pact with myself to stop drinking when out with my friends and only drink at home, so I can have more clarity of mind and be more in control of my faculties. I'm planning on reducing the alcohol intake massively, to 2 beers a month if possible, so I can maintain my health.

When out with my friends and not drinking myself (and they do), I noticed something. I don't laugh all that much anymore at their jokes. They are funny, but not that funny that I drop on the floor laughing. They are  laughing very hard and are enjoying themselves, while I'm sitting there watching them. My best friend just made a pact with another friend to get really wasted at the next party, so he doesn't remember what he did. They shook hands and strengthened their bond. I thought in my head ""what a fool you are"". This new years party he threw up because he drank too much. He wanted to see ""what it was like"" and he liked it. I think he is on a bad path, a slippery slope towards a bad life. He doesn't listen. My friend for 8 years. I feel our friendship is dwindling. For all these years we've been going out and drinking and having fun, and now that I've stopped drinking when going out I saw him for what he was. A blând guy who is funny, but nothing special. I had some beers the last couple of outings to have a comparison, and i was back in business, reconnecting and having fun as in the old times. When I don't drink I can't have fun as most people do.

I think I've traded having a fun time and being accepted by people for sobriety and clarity of mind. Sometimes it feels like a bad trade. In a world where its acceptable to drink and sometimes get wasted, I feel like an outcast.

I'm flabbergasted. What do you think of this?

I start trying to clean up most of the mess and he yells at me saying to go away or leave or something along those lines. The normal talk for how drunk he is. He then goes back to bed, thankfully for it can usually get worse. I am unaware of how much he drank but he bought a box of Shiner after work. Our absolute worst nights have been me vs drunk him. I think he definitely knows it’s a problem. So while he’s done much worse than piss on a piece of furniture in the middle of the night, it’s getting more difficult look at him with love in my heart because I don’t see him trying to fix this. I know I need to care for myself which I often forget. He knows how much he has fucked up while drinking. He works his ass off to provide for his two young kids (whom don’t live with us but 4x every other week) and to keep his not-having-to-really-worry-about-money lifestyle. His career field is no stranger to functioning alcoholics, which is exactly what I think he would fall under. I only mention this because I think that’s what fuels his thinking of deserving a “treat” after work. I’m worried about his health. His psyche. I’m worried about our relationship. And I’m worried one day this is going to really fucking suck because it went too far. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to show him that there’s a way out of living like this? Any resources? I know I can’t make him do anything. I get that. I just want to help where I can if there’s a way. 

Please help with words or resources.
Please be nice.

alcoholism,Mclovinintheoven,2018/03/25,"How do I guard myself against becoming an alcoholic? I'm 22, and I love alcohol, the taste, and getting drunk/buzzed to an extent. I have a family history of alchoholism, every man on one side has been an alcoholic at one point.

 I dont have a problem right now but I can definitely feel that it's something I could develop.
I drink out of boredom and loneliness, and for about a month I could not feel comfortable without being drunk because of anxiety, the anxiety went away, but I'm scared to think what would of happened if it didn't, I'd probably still be getting drunk every night. 

People who have really became addicted, what do I need to look for and guard myself against?

Tl;Dr:
How do I make sure I don't become an alcoholic? What are warning signs?

alcoholism,BoiledEggsYummm,2018/03/26,"13 days sober I went to my first AA meeting 13 days ago and it was the best decision I’ve ever made for myself. I’ve lived with my boyfriend for the past year and I realized several months ago that I wanted to end the relationship. For reasons I won’t go into here, I felt as though I couldn’t just end the relationship, and in hindsight I see that my drinking became heavier as a way to cope with my feeling stuck in the relationship. Despite this, when I decided to do AA I told my boyfriend and he appeared supportive so I thought I’d give him the chance to be the man I need him to be.

We got into a huge fight over the weekend (which I stayed sober through with the support of the AA fellowship) and it’s like I got to see my boyfriend through a whole new set of eyes. The fight sucked and I spent most of the afternoon crying because of how awful the fight made me feel. We fought because I was feeling insecure about something, and when I shared that feeling with him and asked for reassurance, he became offended and lashed out. Now, I’m convinced he is playing the victim by creating his own suffering and making me feel responsible for it. It’s hard to see him in any other light but this.

Here’s another example that happened this morning (this is not what we fought about over the weekend but it feels like we’re gonna fight about it tonight). I’ve always been the type of person who needs 7-8 hours of sleep to function well the next day and he is a loud snorer. Last night I fell asleep on the couch (it is a very comfy couch) and when I randomly woke up at 4am, I heard him snoring from the other side of the house. I decided to continue sleeping on the couch to get a good nights sleep because I knew I’d have a hard time falling back asleep with him snoring so loudly. I’m trying to make better decisions for my self care and my choosing to get a good nights sleep was one of them. Around wake-up time I went to the bedroom to greet him and he asked me why I slept downstairs. I told him exactly what I said above. He responded by saying, “Well you’re a loud snorer too.” I was shocked and said nothing. He closed his eyes and turned away from me. I waited for him to speak and he said nothing. About a minute of silence later, he said “well I guess MY feelings don’t matter.” So I left the room in silence. 

Now he is giving me the cold shoulder and it feels like he’s trying to make me feel guilty because I didn’t validate his feelings or apologize to him for putting my needs above his.

Or - maybe I’m being a selfish asshole. That’s not outside the realm of possibilities. I was hoping some sober folks could share their perspectives. I know this relationship needs to end but the process of him moving out will take at least a month and I was hoping that we could end it on a positive note instead of in the middle of a fight, to make the time where we live together but are broken up less unbearable.

alcoholism,I_Upvote_Goldens,2018/03/26,"How to be a supportive daughter My dad came over to visit yesterday and told me that he has been struggling with drinking and believes he is an alcoholic. I’m a nurse practitioner, and based on what he told me (and what my mom later told me), I would agree. He has been though A LOT the past 5 years or so including a diagnosis of stage III cancer. Thankfully, he is in remission but has had a lot of time at home alone and has been drinking far more than he should. He also suffered a concussion this winter that has cut his tolerance for alcohol down significantly (2 beers and he can’t walk straight). 

He is a phenomenal father, a wonderful grandpa to my daughter, and an amazing husband. He has never been violent (verbally or physically) while drinking (or any other time), but I have seen him drunk before. 

Basically, I want to know how I can be supportive. How can I help? What advice can I give him or my mom? According to her, he has been going to AA meetings, but he has said nothing to me about this. (Also, I am 28 years old, an only child, married, and have 4 month old daughter for context). 

Thanks!

alcoholism,forbesmetal,2018/03/26,"Let a single moment cloud five years of sobriety...so here's to day 5. So frustrated with myself. There were a million other things I could have done, but I had a beverage that I knew contained alcohol and still I justified it. Reason doesn't even matter now. Just a moment of weakness where I wasn't able to overcome the urge. Immediately regretted it.


So here I am on day 5. F---. 


I did it on my own before, but I think I need support this time. Going to hit a meeting this week and try the steps. If it works for others, it's worth a try.

alcoholism,shannorama,2018/03/26,"Threw away the last 3 months this weekend Hi,,

I was hospitalized in December because my excessive drinking and suicidal tendencies finally caught up with one another. I was held there for three days. They treated me for alcohol withdrawals and made adjustments to my other medications. I scared the hell out of my roommate and I haven't had any alcohol since I was released.

A friend of mine got married this weekend and they had an open bar. I told my roommate that I wasn't going to drink, but I ended up having around 6 vodka cranberries before the reception ended.

Do the cravings ever stop? Am I ever going to be able to be in a bar and have one drink and be fine?

Just, stressful.

alcoholism,BerserkDonut,2018/03/27,"Am I an alcoholic Hi so I just wanted to post here to get some understanding if I’m an alcoholic and should seek help .

I’m 19 years and for about a year now I’ve been starting off my day with 3 shots of vodka . I find it helps calm my nerves for the day , and gives me confidence to be the person I want to be . In school and pretty much wherever I go, I carry around an 8oz flask filled with vodka and take sips during the day . I then finish the day with a glass sometime 2 of red wine . 

I should state I’m never in a state in which I am noticeably drunk . I’ve never passed out, or gotten in a drunken rage , I’m just in a mindset of happiness, pure serenity and enjoy the feeling .

I never really have the urge to drink and don't even like it tbh, but I do it in social settings every so often, and once I start I often lose control. Once I reach a certain threshold of alcohol in my blood I cant stop and just keep on drinking. I can only drink ""responsibly"" if I drink 70g max. Once I drink more than that my self control is gone.

I have harmed my health, wasted money and countless days due to the hangover afterwards.

I know the shows use it as a trope, but if you follow these shows regularly how does it make you feel?",3.688421052631576,5.8453115263157915,4.382315789473683,83.94821052631579,74.08771929824562,7.3670175438596495,27.18947368421053,8.238735603445708,1.912658947368421,235,9,44,4,5,75,45,57,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6.0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,2,0,4,0,11,9,6,0,1,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,2,0,3,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,6,0,5,8,0,5,0,0,2,0,4,2,0,1,2,26,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3986517254381145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4031089661771768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32643787417616504,0.0,0.0,0.3654238120767679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3772266632415021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20500552742705352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489979863745924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297253706441527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221749992094695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Themiddle1991,2018/03/29,"I don't know how to approach my boyfriend on his drinking. Hello. My boyfriend 27 and I 26 have been together for 10 years and have two beautiful children and another on the way.  When we first got together, I thought his binge drinking was just a phase due to us being teenagers and didn't see the harm.  As time progressed he has always put ""party time"" above many important things. like its the only fun thing to do.  We no longer spend quality time together due to me being pregnant and obviously not drinking.  He says terrible things to me when he drinks ( many drinks every night after work, I don't know how many exactly, but he comes home stumbling) and brings home another 12 pack to finish before he goes to bed.  I work days and I have to leave our two year old with him in the morning, he's so hungover that by the time I get home from work my boyfriend hasn't even woken up to feed him or change his diaper and I fear for my son.  He gets bad diaper rashes because my boyfriend will not wake up to care for him, so most of the time I will try to find a friend or relative to care for my son when I'm gone. But when I can't my anxiety runs high, I've even quit jobs because I feared I would come home to see my sons lifeless body laying on the floor or mangled from falling down the stairs and my boyfriend would still be sleeping off his alcohol. On numerous occasions he has woken our 8 year old out of bed to tell her that "" her mommy is a whore"" and "" he doesn't need anyone"".  He has pushed me, being pregnant and all, once into a doorknob that bruised my back.  After all of this, I need change.  I recently have told him ""I don't like him when he drinks"" but he just says ""your no fun anymore and your too pregnant, I don't like you when I drink either"".  I don't know what to do. He has a job and never calls in, but he works at a bar, so why would he. He spends his whole paycheck and sometimes mine on his drinks and its dwindling money out of our account.   My question is, what can I do or say to change my situation without making him feel like I'm abandoning him? I love him, and I want to support him through all this, but he won't admit there is a problem. I just want my kids to be safe and us to be happy. But I see no way out other than to leave, and I fear he will hurt himself or others by drinking and driving or just being drunk and reckless.  I left on vacation for a week  when I returned, I found out he totaled his car and got an aggravated DWI .19bac 6 hours after leaving a party. He was 19.  What do I do? So lost and I just want my family to be happy and healthy.",4.607775837988829,4.4663603426443235,5.325637220670392,86.76962901536314,69.40968342644321,8.500209497206704,29.07175279329609,8.07648339933343,1.6677523743016762,2012,66,447,24,32,654,242,537,0.111,0.758,0.13,0.87,2,0,10,0,0,0,56.0,7,3,0,8,25,25,0,3,18,0,44,19,4,3,7,85,78,49,0,9,21,3,1,4,1,7,1,3,6,2,15,33,13,2,9,11,4,11,17,11,0,3,13,7,76,14,60,50,7,68,0,3,3,2,65,22,0,8,37,288,91,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06482568991337917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05047288762485547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272118464483907,0.04640373023716533,0.0,0.060157118951983876,0.042413964986172836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04664278678166745,0.05064747070738517,0.0739539462984311,0.0,0.05161607570589841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737812776912637,0.0,0.0,0.0619393024255451,0.0,0.12369115007078235,0.0,0.192506546328358,0.10450417713070724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03911983554751508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5348017905192234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012898258556805,0.0,0.051107560769714164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0571836124964685,0.20477366412472814,0.030670855207609638,0.04333457877816039,0.0,0.0,0.0554409418442421,0.05159624896669287,0.0,0.06650912040049141,0.04686475182519049,0.0,0.06338332169797052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09702858803020724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291446024927603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408923419227923,0.2433824392080136,0.0,0.05973658884993927,0.0,0.06493638000307228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038877596505634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000092855755967,0.0,0.0,0.19268637628777785,0.06590584192207115,0.0,0.0,0.11853908373784346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0662161233965348,0.0,0.0547468341311174,0.0,0.040490145216443785,0.1844951664138013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995529699494094,0.046783719621962004,0.0,0.0,0.05692406949112985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12730217818817,0.0645995229612143,0.0,0.04613366555676912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05804217221532231,0.0,0.060978735412787616,0.0679516128757278,0.0645179812402138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05989313641332807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14471466991282442,0.0,0.0,0.1450113623228687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818290673395808,0.060702494910086086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05999299340249711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048442106537802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883476022624438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05301836689168245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12089681076461407,0.0,0.0,0.04815622257610519,0.17685284368436968,0.0,0.0,0.057961975789134215,0.0,0.04118326736437044,0.0,0.1185094481132095,0.0,0.14592986574773145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10733419726253357,0.09629608610038816,0.04865674058268017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05473503100246332,0.0677232588284478,0.0,0.058472810555258575,0.0,0.17664098902132389,0.0,0.0,0.12927057457043306,0.0,0.0,0.11718661876328225
alcoholism,fuicoh,2018/03/29,"I’m 19 and living with my alcoholic mother My mom is an alcoholic and I’ve never had anyone to really talk to about it. I talk to my boyfriend about it but I know he doesn’t truly understand my struggle. I’m looking for help I guess,  I’m 19 and I want to move on with my life, but right now I feel like if I leave my mother will kill herself, intentionally or not. My father left her recently and my older brother moved out at the same time. And I’m still home, basically taking care of her. I resent her right now. She’s been to rehab, baker acted, arrested, whatever, but nothing seems to help. She always says she wants to get better but she never makes an effort. And to top it off, she has never once apologized to me for the way she’s emotionally left me. I don’t know, I’m just so emotionally exhausted I don’t know where to go from here. I love her so much and she has plenty of family that is willing to help her but she doesn’t take it, even though she says she wants it. I just want advice on how to deal with this. I don’t want to leave my mom, but I also want to live my life

Edit: to clarify, my mother is (or used to be) the most selfless caring human I’ve ever known. She truly has a great heart and she was an amazing mother until alcohol took over her life. I want to help her but I don’t know if that’s even possible ",0.6812700339970874,2.66840099295775,3.187056823700825,89.65556338028172,83.08450704225352,6.311607576493444,18.243807673627973,7.503015589744147,0.3684984458474983,1038,24,230,17,29,360,137,284,0.078,0.718,0.205,0.991,0,0,3,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,3,17,11,2,1,7,0,18,10,1,4,4,52,49,25,1,9,14,8,1,1,0,2,8,2,1,1,8,12,3,0,8,0,0,5,10,4,0,0,4,4,48,7,34,42,3,29,0,0,1,1,41,12,0,7,12,156,56,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863579969379802,0.0,0.2908079284676591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253669310277892,0.07547376106385174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342299023843792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08022113217539607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18495942565326895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09351279142015786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2040616566996932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11981949063232375,0.08204779462119262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550852763575577,0.0,0.04586313378319914,0.06479961417731354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047389577874182263,0.0,0.051549697290797114,0.0,0.0,0.10000249637706968,0.099921697402171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10748576892696284,0.2431903881180013,0.0,0.0909844320799133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003515567951161,0.0,0.19939621128346235,0.0,0.0,0.1920868306207438,0.19710232562516775,0.0,0.19220270595349248,0.044313843053989166,0.0,0.16018821528268273,0.0,0.07616928959929788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08186473317963072,0.0,0.06054623956172527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21246501603439086,0.0,0.1928099540587488,0.06667855408242973,0.0,0.20987168215955448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703381868450713,0.0,0.0,0.09659778130888054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10225617053783743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058107895465330385,0.0,0.0895601674432065,0.0,0.0,0.15492301503585698,0.0,0.14426438870989747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257435406576813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243706762803206,0.0,0.0,0.09482447829778394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13639762548456374,0.1458103604222325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911712502401391,0.0,0.05289076926569074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007765054618048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442702235765216,0.0,0.0783399294385845,0.0,0.0,0.3745007902637768,0.07199734486902762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Present-Hour,2018/03/30,"Could this pain be a sign of possible pancreatitis? I’ve been primarily what I consider to be a moderate drinker(going to bars once or twice  a week and drinking 1 or  2(swee) cocktails on average when there). There were times where I drank on the heavy side(going out 4 times a week) for part of 2014/2015 and mid 2017 but never had issues other than  hangovers if I didn't pace myself. Starting in February of this year however, I started to get abdominal pain right below my rib cage on the left side a little bit after drinking. It's a dull, pretty mild one and usually starts an hour or later after drinking and will last for several  hours more or a day. This has never happened before.  It seems to be drinking induced. It doesn't matter if it's just one drink or two. I’m not sure if I should get it checked out by my doctor(I’m worried about it being nothing ending up being perceived as a hypochondriac or something). My goal at the moment is to put drinking aside and maybe see my Doc as a precaution. But  has anyone else experienced this with drinking and know what it may be? I have no other health issues.",6.292626118067979,6.695349711627912,6.666511627906978,76.72381037567084,65.83720930232558,9.592128801431127,32.817531305903394,9.466822959209583,2.9777191413237927,888,35,162,16,13,288,139,215,0.095,0.885,0.021,-0.9241,1,0,9,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,1,6,4,0,0,13,0,19,13,1,1,3,34,30,20,0,5,13,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,15,9,10,0,4,9,1,1,6,3,0,4,5,2,11,1,27,15,3,37,0,1,1,0,0,15,0,11,21,117,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06887987080510119,0.10093424005777103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838240100223512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10754645110054302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865152072773224,0.0,0.0,0.06353023631033049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008282638517581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.675510079299929,0.0,0.0,0.08229173370648624,0.0,0.08724984588751912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293390422653624,0.0,0.11197001201246523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08711129410070298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471059361453784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1940232903791315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056358665110112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05413803898474866,0.08029808489213562,0.0,0.0,0.10703045278538824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873202274624544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09896565680989146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15195262052926936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945221624544315,0.0,0.0,0.10490900336929597,0.13350466537060174,0.0,0.20964130928773972,0.0,0.0,0.10667578296913356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105423741755308,0.0,0.10021919501857232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09902887924909984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412625469320194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07849901878093822,0.08967900785632961,0.0,0.11128727199094396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758371373148079,0.0,0.0,0.20917579756329646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09284368471228133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11488292621041585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622910140425284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10849388416549588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15803615654537034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004079840768476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06343664689317126
alcoholism,Miazj,2018/03/30,"I'm sorry to my boyfriend and everyone close to me I am 22 years old today - will be 23 next month. I am almost 3 years behind in college now. I wasted those years binge drinking, blacking out, wasting money on drinks and cocaine, losing my purse twice without recovery, getting kicked out of bars, waking up asking what happened, swallowing up to 100mg of adderall to get through work days, disappointing my friends, disappointing my partner, lying to my parents, and lying to myself.

About 6 months ago, I decided to step away from my partner and everyone who was a part of that world that I was in. I stopped drinking (with the help of marijuana). Dealing with the depression was the hardest part. I was in bed for about 3 months crying, oversleeping, binge-watching shows, etc until I felt better and I did. I stuck to a routine - work, smoke, aerial yoga, cook. I was happy.

My partner and I reconnected after those few months and our relationship was amazing - so much better than when it was alcohol driven. We got comfortable and went out for a couple drinks here and there and I was able to control it.

I relapsed 2 days ago. I drank to my black out point. We were having an amazing night until we weren't. I fell down, I yelled and screamed at my partner in the middle of the movie theater, I cried, I didn't make any sense. I'm out of excuses. I relapsed. I let myself drown in that feeling again. I disappeared from my body again.

My mother is an alcoholic. She is very self-loathing and blamed herself for every mistake my brother and I ever made. She had an abusive alcoholic father in Korea and left to the US at 18. She only wanted the best for us. I told myself throughout my childhood that I'd never cope like she does or abuse it the way she does.

Over the years, I've found that I am my mother in so many ways and alcoholism is the only negative quality. She is still my favorite person and I don't hold anything against her because she tried her best. Now I need to do my best. I'm resetting my sobriety. I WILL be successful.",3.5050007446016385,5.529103554430383,4.5049329858525695,83.45675912137008,74.2151898734177,7.077438570364857,28.3265078183172,7.928766900206844,1.9433186895011167,1604,66,298,24,34,521,213,395,0.151,0.738,0.111,-0.9197,1,0,10,0,1,0,57.0,6,0,0,11,13,18,0,0,16,0,28,14,2,3,2,44,48,22,1,3,2,5,2,1,5,2,4,2,1,5,12,27,12,3,4,8,1,5,6,6,0,1,22,6,65,12,56,21,8,61,0,4,2,0,34,25,0,2,30,216,77,4,0.08241623189286418,0.19529951598214584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14611403372428655,0.3523115500674254,0.08252795124067197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056045863860162484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782153652976619,0.0,0.07704805144631907,0.0,0.0774327628397993,0.0,0.0,0.050240170002082064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25947225208237074,0.14578091925038794,0.0,0.0915458542234609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243681206228864,0.0,0.0911919930076704,0.18106072153240604,0.10630330289229448,0.08496751619694462,0.07098497976363631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14424599984526265,0.0,0.0,0.3229461242713205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191588430755826,0.0,0.07455020016541819,0.06943922995267261,0.1575044828873152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04167212317572407,0.0,0.0791325072082144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036514433254847,0.0636745763181242,0.0,0.0861181591189881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591578951078926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07288040167907413,0.08773361137355874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05524186297817888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954547709823688,0.08427618098100231,0.0,0.04026440789818025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220268223244174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798423135814836,0.055013474761015715,0.08355712340026436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26313540000066865,0.0,0.06058541337443622,0.061110591656276365,0.06356447883530933,0.0,0.08765059760982648,0.07734205060279163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08648197146910988,0.0,0.0,0.1253625163443346,0.0,0.0,0.09151347221355524,0.1784974954736082,0.0,0.0,0.07196267474659215,0.0,0.0,0.07790997841910792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08848418963917191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08597810417655098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225822408777454,0.0,0.0,0.06581770925102813,0.0689036602170095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07812095115738174,0.0787522414436576,0.0,0.05595521151170976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19827315864826472,0.0,0.0,0.06800202263766375,0.04861122890134935,0.13083633743345666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640067265757962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944630651462749,0.0,0.11999999678117905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122934048668026
alcoholism,JimmyWalkerE15,2018/03/30,"Finally quit my bullshit Been dancing around with my alcoholism for about a year now. Keep making excuses about how i can handle it, and its just certain people and certain drinks that get the worst of me, any excuse to not face the fact that i'm an alcoholic. But this morning, waking up hungover with my girlfriend, i admitted to myself that this actually can't go on any longer, and that its time for me to face facts. GF was sceptical which is fair enough as shes heard about me wanting to quit several times but never actually following through. So i guess the proof is in the pudding. Not going to drink today, and going to a meeting tomorrow. Keep reading one day at a time on here so going to keep telling myself that.",7.981928571428572,6.953217907142857,7.9714285714285715,73.53357142857143,62.78571428571429,11.142857142857144,37.14285714285714,10.290406445055957,3.736928571428572,577,24,106,11,7,187,93,140,0.048,0.9,0.052000000000000005,-0.3506,0,0,4,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,2,10,4,1,0,8,0,7,7,3,2,6,26,22,10,0,1,5,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,11,7,4,3,1,4,0,6,4,2,0,1,3,1,12,2,23,19,2,22,0,0,0,0,9,6,0,1,10,78,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.2891052660455324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3166099164000513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20146573415420213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13186630355648368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955310146242366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902202479245859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305695696566027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16226818777362087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739134057333913,0.0,0.3367407230405474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631809030848218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3949918486966724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887732401408976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11424629323795125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10037611128678346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269406625127224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31510706132181554,0.14816918512305285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16734371892033276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12947136182948968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.259125807047354,0.0,0.14040906584128482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08737038065095783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09539028333629304
alcoholism,lanka2x,2018/03/30,"Sorry to see this one go When I moved to this little town 6 years ago I noticed a pretty blonde that was having trouble staying sober. She was sharp, nice and good-hearted and I thought my wife might be able to help her get going in recovery when she arrived the following year.

As many do, she was able to not drink while pregnant, and made little use of my wife as a sponsor. The following years were full of crisis and drunk drama, but she'd occasionally come back for short sober periods. We'd sometimes take care of some of her 4 kids when she had no babysitter.

Got a call from an AA this afternoon that she had died in a car wreck, driving on the wrong side of the highway. Serious injuries sustained by those in the other car. She'd lost her kids, hubby and home months ago and was thankfully alone in her car.

Sweet lady with possibilities, had hoped she would find an answer.

alcoholism,Thisharryballz,2018/03/31,"One year.... Sober by the grace of God. I year ago I went back to the rooms  spiritually bankrupt, my life a smoking hole in the ground.
I had hurt the people closest to me, ones who loved me unconditionally. All the ""stuff"" in my life was gone. I had a moment of clarity, it involved my 13 yo daughter, I was picking her up from school and had a pint of vodka sitting on the front seat. I was taking sips off of it, leaning down to hide it, checking my mirrors to make sure she was not near the car. As I finished a sip and put the cap back on, she was standing by the door. We locked eyes, and in that instant, I had a WTF ARE YOU DOING??? moment. As quickly as it hit me, it was gone. But something changed. The next morning I took her to school and instead of turning left toward the liquor store, I turned right. I found myself in the parking lot of my fellowship, and a guy in the parking lot walked up and knocked on my window.
I was ready to surrender.
So I did and walked into a meeting for the first time in 13 years.
I got a sponsor the second day, finished my steps(the first time)
in about 30, took a service position as a secretary at 6 mos and started sponsoring guys at the same time.
3/21/17 is my sobriety date, I picked up my chip last night. 
I left the bday meeting and drove over to my now ex wifes apt, 
and showed it to my daughter. The kid who a year ago referred to me as ""the cancer"", hugged my and told me she was proud of me! One of the 2 relationships I poisoned has been restored.
The other, a marriage of 37 years, is headed for divorce. I am now renting a room, rebuilding my life. I am now employable, and starting to contribute financially for my daughters needs, and
life, while very challenging is no longer baffling. The Obsession to drink was lifted from me, and I am now focused on giving away that what was given to me.
If your are struggling, there is hope.
There is a solution.
""Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path""
Don't leave before the miracle!

alcoholism,_blondepotato_,2018/03/31,"I can’t stop I always said I could stop whenever I wanted to. Had a vacation a month or so ago and drank for two weeks straight, don’t remember any of it and that really set off the red flags for my friends. Like I never thought I’d be in this position, I’m a 22 year old girl, live on my own. I have really bad ocd and alcohol is how I deal with it. I also have just terrible anxiety and am still recovering after a really abusive relationship. It used to be fun the drinking but now it feels like a responsibility, like a chore. I’m losing my mind, I’ve literally become that crazy dumb girl that everyone secretly pities.

alcoholism,jill7890,2018/03/31,"My dad decided to stop drinking 2 days ago Hi everyone,

I’m not sure how to start but stating that my dads been a heavy drinker for the past 15 years seems like a good start. His relationship with all his kids (including me) have been damaged due to his drinking so it’s been hard for us to repeatedly tell him to stop drinking. 

A few days ago he said he felt the side of his stomach hurt so we took him to the ER and they said he has an enlarged liver. My dad has a history of lying to doctors saying he barely drinks but this time I wasn’t about to let that be the story so I told the doctors that he drinks a LOT every night. The doc said he could tell automatically from looking at his tests. Basically, he needs to stop drinking. I thought this would be an easy process but after a lot of research I found that alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be fatal. I should mention that our culture finds it very difficult to seek medical help for problems like this and so he’s probably not even considering it. Even my mom  asked me not to tell anyone about this. 

It’s been 2 days since he’s stopped drinking and he says his body aches, his hands shake, he vomits after eating the bare minimum, barely any appetite and feels very weak. I’m not sure how to help him. If you guys have any advice or suggestions please let me know!

alcoholism,oneandonlypost1,2018/03/31,"As great as drinking is I realised something... I've lurked on here for a while but I've come to a realisation. I'm 26 years old and my life is a mess and I drink alcohol to cover my feelings, I'll always be an alcoholic but I won't drink anymore

As great as drinking is I realised that there is more to me than blocking my feelings, loneliness and emotions out. I don't think like most and I have an idealistic point of view but I know that there's more out there... Whether that results in sadness or not it doesn't matter...

alcoholism,herbandspiceforlife,2018/04/01,"Just got my (m22) first DUI last night, what now? Hi guys/gals, I’m new to this sub so I apologize if I don’t have the regular formality within this post. I just got my first DUI last night while trying to take my friends home “safely” from the bars. I don’t know anything about my potential legal rights in this sort of situation.  I could really use some advice from anyone who’s dealt with this before. I feel there may be some way to dispute the charge bc he claimed to have clocked me going 8 over the speed limit and that’s why he pulled me over. I’ve heard stories about being able to ask the officer to prove he reset his speed gun; the idea being they often don’t and the charge can be dropped after this is brought to light in court. Would it be worth my time to attempt this or am I still screwed because I blew over the legal limit to drive? I’ve asked this in r/legal advice as well but thought it may help to get a perspective from someone who’s BEEN in my situation.

Thanks in advance!",5.19347154471545,5.0401490585365885,5.520304878048783,85.91200203252033,68.17073170731706,8.589430894308942,27.815040650406495,8.07648339933343,1.495089430894308,787,22,171,9,12,251,127,205,0.029,0.8740000000000001,0.097,0.8882,0,0,0,1,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,6,10,5,1,0,9,0,18,2,0,1,1,25,33,8,0,3,5,0,1,0,1,3,0,1,1,0,13,3,1,3,5,1,1,5,3,1,1,2,6,3,18,4,28,18,2,33,0,0,0,1,14,10,1,8,15,104,31,2,0.15236586772180818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29778032504293234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10653775739397013,0.0,0.12538412672175148,0.0,0.28488303687927674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09288081875435962,0.0,0.1296521311548336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12165174725236827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704076080223002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2592046584960609,0.0,0.0,0.11771749144199233,0.0,0.07960487721536721,0.0,0.08659303389910314,0.0,0.2437218066080753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10212762939927883,0.0,0.15283538847847136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720025186207608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373629618822248,0.2483970363894819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14715590449753976,0.0,0.28597009061994394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14592438346151582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760947641361194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301196185214669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.342531238397836,0.0,0.0,0.1290991052747587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121679578781651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11456017036059853,0.0,0.0,0.14027801999831427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096147953853588,0.08884576276243697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10344642262487548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13159518914846766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12094093375019943,0.0,0.0,0.13699521348700286,0.0,0.13748649662423496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082363408392631,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,Eurgh,2018/04/02,"Watching my mum die Hi there, never posted here before.

My dad and I have been dealing with my mum's alcoholism years now. We always supported her to try and get help but the fact of the matter is she never found it a big deal; she either thought she was bigger than the alcohol, or she just gave up on life.

I'm posting here now as the last few days I've watched her deteriorate in the ICU. She'd been sick for a while, but every time we took her to doctors she'd make me or dad wait outside. We knew she was lying to them about how seriously she was sick and in pain, but as we all know if people aren't able to be truthful with their doctor then nothing can be resolved.

And eventually, it seems like now it can't be resolved - never again be resolved. I've watched her in hospital as her liver failed, as she got dizzy and light headed and confused, as she began to lose her mental capacity, to when they finally took her to the ICU and her kidneys have now failed too. They say there's only a 50/50 chance of her living but in my heart I know how this ends.

I'm probably going to have to delete my post eventually, but I just don't know how or where else to deal with this absolute grief, anger, and sorrow. Our family never deserved this - we loved and cared for her but it seems like in the end, she only wanted to care about the alcohol.

She just turned 49 two days ago and now I'm going to lose her forever.",6.219793814432991,5.0821704295532655,6.776687285223371,81.03059793814434,66.35395189003437,9.821855670103092,29.70927835051546,8.841846274778883,2.0287830927835047,1109,30,238,15,15,365,152,291,0.18600000000000005,0.723,0.091,-0.9873,0,0,3,0,0,0,28.0,6,0,4,7,21,20,1,1,11,0,19,14,4,4,7,58,46,31,2,2,14,4,0,2,0,0,9,1,0,0,7,18,3,1,11,0,0,4,7,10,0,1,13,5,42,10,34,27,3,40,0,6,3,1,45,10,0,7,25,160,49,4,0.10087698577309673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942136131881817,0.3234204574232041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08393773325005875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08583888495182855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2057016201886873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13011462095766668,0.3119992285154451,0.0,0.0,0.10469438481038117,0.0,0.0,0.2065037389253001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426977736133184,0.0,0.17869413503855308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499321130255462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950978443650527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11050580708631766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11060640810499844,0.0,0.0,0.05270406152239784,0.0,0.11466143145180055,0.0,0.0806805408107726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352889041429736,0.0,0.0,0.11953971384486912,0.06761571716810802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16631805965940952,0.0822282072770116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07125239833843254,0.09856679951073012,0.0,0.08907622658969827,0.0,0.0,0.22571108749291655,0.0,0.0,0.09104541816069918,0.0,0.06733617132617413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10166027513901246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112102011884866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679418851663774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15344298674302762,0.1073402252188999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06993540033801651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28983680218863683,0.0,0.1087624524294746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08022142799250198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18366923834641155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11447400800894435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08008505863518342,0.058822181635523066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22415608587916225,0.06848885160067708,0.10972519296545194,0.09854215710099014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059499859841550776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496147145597941
alcoholism,1233212321,2018/04/02,"Help and advice. Looking to quit In the past year my drinking has slowly become a problem. Drinking alone every single night. A handle lasts about 3 days. I am probably blacking out twice a week. I have attempted to quit before, but never made it more than a few days. My hands start to shake, I feel awful, and I cant get a wink of sleep.

I am heading to urgent care today for an unrelated issue (found blood in my ear canal, probably nothing but just want to see if I scratched it or if there is an actual issue).

I figure I can take this visit to urgent care as an opportunity to mention to my doctor that I think I have a drinking problem. Possibly ask if there is anything he/she can advise me to take that is over the counter to help with my withdrawal symptoms. 

Is there anything I should know before heading in? I am in FL, and am not sure if PA urgent cares can prescribe anything that may help me quit. 

Or if anyone here can advise something over the counter that might help withdrawal symptoms I would greatly appreciate. 

(I am 26 years old and still live with my family while in graduate school. My family knows I drink, but not the quantity, as most of my drinking is done alone in my room. I have also gained 50 lbs in the past year due to my habit. Most of the calories in my diet come from alcohol)",3.7107307692307714,5.193892457692313,4.865384615384618,83.3346153846154,72.5,7.507692307692308,26.84615384615385,8.07648339933343,1.6954076923076933,1029,36,200,15,20,339,141,260,0.069,0.768,0.163,0.9796,0,2,7,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,6,8,9,0,1,15,1,24,16,6,1,2,39,42,18,0,10,13,1,3,0,0,4,4,1,1,0,7,8,7,0,6,5,0,3,4,3,0,1,3,7,29,6,33,35,5,32,0,0,3,0,10,12,0,11,17,139,36,5,0.0,0.0,0.0852425933839459,0.0,0.0,0.0853590049985583,0.0,0.09335233056863143,0.0,0.18093989625327825,0.0,0.06985506951512545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061078292963888524,0.0,0.2156488538597464,0.0,0.08166198544338585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964730160061485,0.14865961221210433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671824352024078,0.0,0.0,0.0752456973643033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11266915399440793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08940809799140688,0.0,0.08939104860845141,0.0,0.4278567271363223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07359751842064242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16469469137966286,0.0,0.04416761037158635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957765571296168,0.0,0.0,0.04563762304414493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09630548398736774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17929595323117067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341998337768516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18234482079940892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09601234633430844,0.07120323972962259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07713309247652336,0.0,0.07335337182158957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08265422741313193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266627876685518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737096458541814,0.0,0.0,0.08197359040140294,0.0,0.08381624794720825,0.0,0.09166084492281028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16677403587585182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984758416150832,0.0,0.0,0.18835966951896801,0.1671674317637435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2787276427171885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840451628504573,0.06960794221067049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08741471751027963,0.0,0.0,0.06724755485623585,0.0,0.0,0.06182793557920881,0.0,0.06975912711457986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.082327880532024,0.18158358648692102,0.1313551142512343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05597139945369571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08279913452038823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05152225646735337,0.0,0.0700682111881242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620520939883607,0.0,0.0,0.16875476354556027
alcoholism,markw19921,2018/04/02,"Need Help and Advice Hey guys, I'm a 22 year old male from the Ireland and I think I have a serious problem with drinking. I'm pretty sure I'm getting worse and it is starting to have a serious effect on my family and friends.

The problem I have is that I simply cannot have a drink without getting completely shitfaced. I can go weeks without a drink, but as soon as I have 1 drink, I can't stop until I black out. I also get really aggressive and horrible when I have a certain amount. I have got in a lot of ridiculous situations such as;
&gt; Thrown in a cell for fighting
&gt; Banned from several bars
&gt; Injured myself a few times

Last night, same story. Drank way too much, took loads of drugs and went on like a complete menace. I always tell myself after something like this happens that it won't happen again, but it always does.

I go sober for 2 weeks and then I get bored as hell with my life and tell myself I'll only have a couple with my friends. Then 10 hours later, I'm still going hard and acting a buffoon. I literally can't  stop myself once I get started. 

Probably doesn't help that I'm pretty sick of my life in general. I have no job, no girlfriend, no meaning ect. I feel like I am becoming something that I hate, but I just cant help myself.

I completely have a distrust of everyone and I am pretty sure I have some serious mental issues. A lot of my friends tell me that I am pretty fucked up mentally. I probably need professional help tbh. This coupled with alcohol makes for a toxic combination. 

I feel like I am a disappointment to my parents. They are really good people and I think they deserve a lot better than me. I look at the kid version of myself and ask how I ended up like this. My life feels like it is spiraling out of control. Alcohol is definitely one of the main causes of this.  

Sorry for the negative tone. Please give me some advice.

alcoholism,flibbles,2018/04/02,"Spouse is an alcoholic (need direction) My spouse is an alcoholic. He's at the pick fights and then bugger off in the family car for hours at a time to get drunk stage.

We live 15 minutes drive from the nearest village and we have twin toddlers. 

I'm doing what I can to figure out how to become financially independent as a stay at home mom in order to have some options.

Yesterday he took off for over five and a half hours, had however many pints at the pub and beer with the town drunk and then a couple of singles of hard booze cocktails and then drank 7 out of an 8 pack. He wasn't answering hos phone while He was out either.

 He was passing out while sitting up playing with the kids. 


All around I'm past being angry or even disappointed. His actions all around made me sick yesterday.

What if one of the kids got seriously hurt, what if there was any emergency, even just being trapped like that was really upsetting. Yeah I could take his truck but there's no car seats in it. What if he had my car impounded? 

I know I can't make him stop, but I also know that the kids and my wellbeing is suffering because of this. 

I told him this morning that he's not allowed to take the family vehicle to go on a bender again. He told me he wasn't on a bender, then thanked me for making hos day more miserable. 

I'm assuming this is all standard behavior as I've been talking to ither people who've been through it. They've also told me what is likely to be next. 

Is there anything I can do in the short term while I get my ducks in a row? Counseling is a possible option, but I have to drive to a different city to get it. Other than that all I can figure is now I've laid a new boundary he's going to get more deviant about it all.

Any tips or a pointer to a subreddit would be appreciated.

alcoholism,aterribleburden,2018/04/02,"Alcoholics and parents of: My brother (30s) is an alcoholic living with our mom. She needs to hear from you. She's no stranger to alcoholics. Her father, my father, his father, and now my brother. She knows she can't change him, but being his mother, she can't give up on him. She wants to understand his thinking. 

Every time he fucks up (crashing his car, DUI, ""horrible"" weekend in jail) he'll sober up for a few weeks, giving her hope. But when he drove home drunk last week, she lost it. 

She doesn't know what else to do. She's threatened to kick him out or call the police if he's driving drunk. She's seeing her son on the brink of ruining his life and it's breaking her heart. 

Any advice?

Thanks!

alcoholism,bobdoleisgorgeous,2018/04/02,"Please help me process what happened at Easter dinner. First time poster. I want to cry. Throwaway because many reasons. I think I just need some help processing something that happened today that is becoming more brutally hard to sit with the more I think about it.

So I’m in my 30s and just had a kid. I was a crazy social binge drinker for years and after baby arrived I decided with the support of my partner that drinking has no place in our new life. At all. Alcoholism runs wild in my family. I had plenty of my own issues and decided to quit while I was mostly ahead. A big concern of mine is that I never EVER want my kid to see me buzzed or drunk. People change with the drink and it’s scary and dangerous to put a kid through the shock of seeing a wasted parent.

When partner and I were talking about this, I made a reference to not wanting to be like my older cousin, Kathleen. She has two young kids (10 and 8) and who has gotten absolutely obliterated at more than a handful of family events with her kids present. One such event was her kid’s birthday (on Christmas) and it was horribly sad and uncomfortable but no one spoke up. Kathleen is a comfortably upper middle class SAHM and social “wine mom” who has friends/neighbors /etc over for drinks daily. She always has a wine in hand when helping her kids with homework. One time she showed me one of her kid’s flash cards with the Spanish word for “grape” on it and thought it was fucking hilarious that she had taken too big of a sip and left a big drop of red wine on it. She literally saved it and had it on the fridge to show guests to chuckle at. No mention of how it must impact the kid to see his mom get buzzed while helping him with his homework. She’s VERY fun and lovable, so I kind of shrugged these things off as kind of sad/pathetic. 

Anyway, (sorry, I’m getting to the point I promise) today is Easter and we went to a family party. Big family, so around 30 people were there for dinner. Around 7:30 in the evening, I was at the table with 6 other people, including my drinker cousin who had clearly had a few drinks and was growing a slight slur. Then her 10 year old son, who is a sweetheart and is very shy, and he - out of nowhere - addressed her, saying:  “Mom, you shouldn’t drink alcohol, it makes you drunk! You drink it and then you have to go to bed so you shouldn’t be drinking it because it makes you weird.”

I got REALLY uncomfortable and looked to my cousin, who was laughing it off, wine in hand. Her son briefly left the room, then circled back and said, “Don’t drink, it’s alcohol and it makes you weird.” He was serious. Then he walked out and my cousin laughed it off again.

Witnessing this made me want to crawl into a fucking hole and die. I wanted to cry for this sweet, NEVER outspoken boy who I think worked up the courage to say this to his mom and in the presence of other trusted adults. This is EXACTLY why I never want my kids to see me drink and I am absolutely gutted about this. 

I am relatively close to this cousin, who is older than me and I looked up to in a lot of ways. I see the kids often and I just want to give him a hug and tell him I heard him. Who know how many times he’s said this to his mom before? I’m getting more upset by this as the night goes on and I don’t know what to do. 

Ugh, help me figure out how to think about this. Thank you for reading.

TLDR: Alcoholic cousin’s 10 year old kid called her out at Easter dinner and told her to stop drinking. She laughed it off. I just quit drinking because I had a baby and decided I never wanted my kid to see me drunk, so this is crushing me right now and I don’t know what to do about it. Sad that kid sees Mom drunk.

alcoholism,Budgie19,2018/04/03,"Help needed I’m a relatively young and small girl and a condensed version of a very long story is a few days ago Im almost positive i had alcohol poisoning. I passed out for over 5 hours and during that time I was almost choking on my puke, shaking, or extremely incoherent, but i definitely puked a lot. I had friends that took really good care of me but Im worried about the health affects. Ive felt really nauseous in the mornings, have a decreased appetite in general, and my stomach feels very sensitive, but havent had any bad headaches, do i just need to give it time?

alcoholism,sluohg,2018/04/03,"70 Days Sober I always wanted to make a post when I was sober. A headspace that an unsober me would look up to.

I wanted to wait until I really wanted to, just so it could really come from the heart.

A lot has happened. Four years of just being lost. Who do I want to be? Where do I stay? Alcohol never helped but I always helped myself to it.

I always told myself early in my sobriety that id smooth into social drinking once I had some sober time under my belt. 

""Yeah, once I feel a bit better i'll just smooth into a beer or so every few nights.""

70 days in now and I could care less about drinking, but dont get me wrong I still have 'those' days. I don't know why, but I always set a 'too good to be true' kind of deal for myself anytime im faced with something thats a bit bigger than me. A high stake gamble.

There were so many days where I wanted to get off work and just down Jameson and feed that negativity. But i'd tell myself, ""I'll get off work, take a late night drive into the country, listen to good music, cry it out, turn around and if I still feel that I need to drink once I pass the corner store, I'll buy some for tonight and tomorrow morning.""

But I've been too busy and just keeping my mind straight.

In the process of becoming sober, I also felt that I needed to shift my anger and sadness. Forgive and forget myself, and others. 

It's too easy to be negative. How did I satisfy negativity? A 12 pack and some jameson. That easy. Within a hour or so and I had filled the gut of that demon.

It's difficult to be positive. It takes a lot. 70 days and counting and I feel that I could be more positive. It's been such a long road already.

A big reason for my alcoholism was failed relationships. Hatred for the person and all that yada yada bullshit. I hated them. Their face, their smile, their mannerisms, their voice and all that. But the biggest part was that I hated myself too. I'm no saint and never was a innocent person in the failing of these relationships. I've done as bad or even worse to some of these people. Guilt ate at me. Because even though these people did wrong to me, it was never a reason to treat them bad or think of them in a negative light. But I did anyways and regretted it all. I think that regret was the true me coming out from underneath my alcoholism. I was still in there.

I forgive us now. Though, no, I'd never want to be with them again, our differences happened for a reason.
No matter how harsh all my friends think they were to me, I still care about them. Once I accepted that, I knew its the right thing to feel. It was true closure to it all. It's easy to feel negative, but the feeling of neutrality or just ""whatever"" about a situation is denying an emotion. Like a wall I build.

It took a long time. A lot of hobby chasing, less time watching tv or playing games, hanging out with friends and seeing family. I realize I'm so lucky to have a support group where many do not. But I honestly didn't see all that in the beginning because I isolated my problem and hid it from everyone who would've cared. Since my problem was me, I hid myself with it. There's people out there that care for you. You just cant see it yet.

To celebrate my 70 days, a close friend of mine visited me at work and told me to meet him up to play lazer tag. My friends' a pro and played in a professional league there. I was the only noobie among a bunch of regulars. Played two, 20 minute games and spent an hour or two infront of the place after it closed talking and conversing with a group of people, who collectively, I barely knew. 

While sitting out there I thought of my day and how it was a busy ass day at work. I was constantly working the whole 9 hour shift, got off and instead of heading home to drink and forget how shitty the day was, I went to play lazer tag for 40 minutes and continued standing talking with people. It took that little push for me to feel so much better. Those rides home (night rides) are the best and one of my most favorite things to do by myself. Not all the time, but a little treat here and there is great. Good music and have the windows rolled down. It always makes me appreciate the route im going in life.

Although it seems cheesy, back in my old relationship, me and my ex girlfriend would always see shooting stars and every time I saw one I would say to myself, ""I wish I was happy."" When and if I see one now, I'd still say the same thing. But thats not because Im not happy now. It's because my standards of being happy have been raised with each passing day I'm sober. My potential to be happy is growing.

To anyone who struggled like I was, it's fucking difficult. But when you wake up that next morning knowing you just fought that urge that you've given into so many times before, it's a feeling like no other. 

Take it from me, it gets so much better.",2.7823257884028507,4.347655533062056,4.015146363173958,88.16135637080367,75.0528992878942,6.786820956256357,23.37600457782299,7.461004344511776,0.8951668463886064,3771,109,790,46,80,1234,378,983,0.155,0.6829999999999999,0.162,0.6516,0,0,9,1,0,0,121.0,2,4,10,12,63,61,5,2,55,1,58,19,7,9,14,169,133,76,0,21,33,1,11,3,5,3,4,4,3,2,62,55,10,2,25,13,4,16,21,21,0,6,43,24,107,40,111,75,29,129,2,6,8,2,54,52,2,19,59,557,169,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413585167164515,0.0,0.0,0.04865513851458274,0.035259284017992665,0.220121761560248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030829213883776938,0.0,0.0,0.039250034211547616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03390299516435711,0.07362771707947302,0.1075090257997317,0.04869466876268176,0.03751790332021849,0.0,0.04627042637110575,0.11698381450651725,0.09627116034527317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17981346107611748,0.0,0.0,0.07596039723145431,0.0,0.047646338811389216,0.0,0.10560841040166394,0.0,0.04843151849839177,0.28434827481601765,0.04545553334402469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0460653543650122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04512005203672606,0.05167392389760787,0.17276824105476704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049596056857470316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058242928790676586,0.0,0.07429656352860671,0.04213051407271319,0.0,0.0,0.04156474927244764,0.0,0.17834849545464715,0.031498375550383484,0.0423339469128628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13625733487542946,0.04076110371474561,0.0921421980674528,0.0,0.02505773754039704,0.1109434585337573,0.03526332770585492,0.048610107125662425,0.0,0.0,0.07797844816295088,0.18774130518015114,0.0,0.08706079515505849,0.045249736219113865,0.0,0.0,0.052247643122056264,0.05910607858114485,0.04658420190626774,0.08845305168174322,0.0,0.13026125298182356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14287643292319066,0.0,0.0,0.039189803501711314,0.0,0.04591363642374665,0.04846214615679748,0.0,0.049736183728641616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031142536319002632,0.06462140654615102,0.08838084656211366,0.0,0.07803769140448337,0.037025048986241815,0.0,0.048130162587059266,0.11245290457999486,0.0,0.0,0.0588617144126883,0.1341030235618944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04451899668679202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06482341490175833,0.06538532985397155,0.13602173708346454,0.0,0.04689091597125476,0.12412828987215445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04626572970144648,0.18782045119436397,0.08963091470158943,0.03353293291857844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047745887019451656,0.0,0.15283455685700786,0.07699652544595742,0.0460653543650122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042226663472531234,0.0,0.0,0.0843776120477554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05649121023471139,0.13599762201132765,0.0,0.14201060167180746,0.0,0.03765318182022113,0.0,0.07012532330357221,0.0,0.0,0.1756727336576929,0.04013847996188378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03647224868842251,0.04955974796518267,0.0,0.0449448743130431,0.0,0.03394314332015883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04699477597212357,0.1760542858845516,0.0,0.0,0.046093129823579666,0.0,0.0,0.0500335572575026,0.0,0.0,0.09945206509881097,0.07087680304930265,0.03853717928057648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878756239399892,0.0847545418215521,0.08663769707936378,0.03500305821720528,0.15425770674381584,0.0,0.0,0.08426102814542638,0.09797268875722803,0.0,0.0479579759660246,0.0861403343054953,0.0,0.0530356339549289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15603487792423615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04087248255489676,0.03978496182236715,0.049225646128798685,0.050702081830839095,0.0,0.0,0.1604926240966747,0.0,0.044932148221556695,0.12528295632849062,0.09641242814796892,0.0,0.02839293878284065

alcoholism,Dollypardonmeplease,2018/04/03,Anger at alcoholic boyfriend and I lost it on him help. I've known my boyfriend for a longtime and we recently started hanging out and dating.  We probably only see other a couple times a week but I've come to know that he is definitely an alcoholic.  He's been in the hospital three times this year in inpatient.  For some reason it didn't hit me I kept thinking it's just a phase or he's been upset about something but it's been ongoing for at least a year from what I know.  He's always drank and he also suffers from depression and won't take any thing to help but booze.  I realized that I can't be with him. A free days ago I went over there because I thought we were going to enjoy the city but i showed to his dad was there and he was passed out.  Btw we are in our mid thirties.   His dad left I eat so pissed.  I helped him and I told him I was passed but he was so it if it and I just had to leave.  Later that night he did call me thank good he was ok but I kinda lost it in him on the phone just yelling at him about drinking himself to death etc.  The best day his dad. Called and said he went over again and he was drunk and he called the ambulance and took him to the hospital.  I was going to go no contact because I can't keep getting pulled into this nothing changes even though I really care about him. But I've been feeling bad about yelling at him and I even thought about visiting him at impatienti just don't know if I should and maybe if it's better if just key my distance.,0.6559828741623228,2.7860888797468384,2.22457930007446,95.66729337304544,84.25316455696202,5.61638123603872,21.00297840655249,6.923569853693429,0.3221410275502605,1170,37,270,15,34,380,155,316,0.13,0.742,0.128,-0.168,1,0,4,0,3,0,16.0,5,0,0,4,19,16,2,1,13,1,23,8,1,1,0,55,51,30,1,5,17,3,1,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,16,23,7,2,10,3,1,12,6,8,0,1,26,5,42,9,35,21,4,44,0,4,1,0,45,18,1,7,14,175,58,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201071843466304,0.2459692160920343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09202875056267523,0.09575506731648986,0.0,0.0,0.07825776473264506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608627909387424,0.1403023571538052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12076846270508995,0.10177815181572004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3525260205465496,0.0,0.1173308578014584,0.0,0.12173847630530847,0.09913049348772923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12733288494046946,0.0,0.14843305634122794,0.0,0.09911749883549956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11273375086876256,0.0,0.11775469472549828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283436663101701,0.1520173796774102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05818747337952381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06012410346959299,0.0,0.19620639006113316,0.09652292681036424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23140537509381906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228763151341416,0.0,0.0,0.18973346529611684,0.0,0.0,0.12185219828345085,0.1250338276007432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512449614691664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561246869406484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799398177027313,0.0,0.1104215431889706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08752287532622632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12407478199184722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372264696329295,0.11832052731426952,0.1136267722916985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094666196150194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09170317910140877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08859354796682767,0.0,0.0,0.08145361103666411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08652519515381117,0.0,0.0,0.10594941521070687,0.0,0.0,0.07645347035394437,0.07373806933013928,0.11306467553017688,0.1827199730974784,0.1342071496124983,0.0,0.0,0.10996305451626506,0.12785716424350213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923095485347489,0.0,0.0,0.2133590404162739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14821439253581914
alcoholism,atmicalizzi5,2018/04/03,"Together, we are strong and can make a difference in one another's lives. My story may resonate with you... Together, we are strong and can make a difference in one another's lives. My story may resonate with you...

For over 15 years, my mom has been addicted to alcohol. From a functioning alcoholic to a full blown debilitating addict, she mentally abused her family day in and day out. Our growing pains were much worse than most. My mom attempted to commit suicide multiple times as her addiction reached its peak. 

Our story is common in nature but unique in how our lives unfolded. My family made mistakes out of love, fought to bring our Mom back, and we were nearly destroyed. Every day we fight and it is worth it.

I wrote our story in my own memoir, ""Too Far Gone."" I'm hoping to spread the word of the struggle a majority of Americans endure. Right now, it is free. If I make profit off of it in the future, I hope to donate a portion of the funds to national addiction foundations. I want to make a difference so no other family's will have to overcome what we have. Please help me do so. Again, together, we are strong.

alcoholism,Abm6,2018/04/04,"Just went through Delirium. Thought I'd share my story. It might be useful to someone someday. So it's been about 50 hours (EDIT: 60 hours now, I first posted this in r/stopdrinking yesterday) now since my last drink. I had been binging non-stop intensely for a little more than two weeks.    
   
At h+18 I started feeling a light dizziness and a light sense of disorientation, all that with shaky hands but I'm used to that. I though it was just a pretty bad hangover so I drank a large glass of water and put cold water on my face for a few minutes. Then the dizziness started to get slightly worst, and I was breathing fast with a higher heart rate than usual, so I sat down on my balcony for some fresh air and tried to calm down because i've already had similar symptoms during an anxiety/panic attack. So I started closing my eyes by intermittence and taking deep breaths to try to get in a more meditative psychological state.    
   
About 10 minutes later as the symptoms were still getting worst I stood up and realized that not only my hands but my whole body was shaking. I actually had a hard time getting back in my place, then proceeded to walk holding the walls not to fall down. Still trying to control my respiration, I took my pulse again. I was at 165 bps. The nausea and dizziness were through the roof at that point.   
   
I grabbed my coat and keys and decided to go outside because I live alone and I didn't want to go into shock alone where no one could see me. In the elevator I started having vision problems, a sensation of white flashes and movements on the edge of my vision. At that point I realize it's something more serious than an anxiety/panic attack. I get out of my building and call my father who is a doctor and lives not far (he wasn't working that day). I had heard about Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Delirium Tremens before so I immediately confessed on the phone that I had been on a long and intense binge and that I thought it was that. I urged him to come at once and to bring benzodiazepines if he had any.    
   
Thankfully he did. I then sat on a bench to wait for him and during the time it took him to arrive (about 10 minutes) I started going in and out of consciousness at a very fast pace (like 5 seconds in, 2 seconds out). I had visions of my past, on an almost hallucinatory level, heard stuff that was in my mind, felt the bugs crawling under my skin... The full deal.    
   
When he found me he immediately gave me benzos and had to actually help me to the car because I was shaking so much. He drove me to the closest ER available and we waited outside in the car for a while because this hospital has a really bad reputation, especially the ER. He gave me water, another small dose of benzos all while monitoring my heart rate. I started to calm down. So after a while he asked me if I really wanted to be in this hospital because they were not gonna do much more for me than he could do.   
   
Btw i've been in rehab before (not for delirium though, just addiction) so I also know the medical protocol to treat this. So I said no, let's just go to your place (which is about 2 minutes away from said hospital). There we spent about 8 hours together. He kept getting me water, small doses of benzos, vitamins also (B1, B6, PP), made sure I ate a little, took my blood pressure and heart rate every 30 minutes. After a while I really managed to calm down, decompress. So we spent another 2 hours together, he gave me the benzos and drove me back home.  
   
Now today, I took the benzos according to the normal protocol we agreed on, stayed in a dark lit room, in silence, tried to get some sleep. I feel much better but two things happened: first I had at least one incredibly vivid dream, the hallucinatory type, specifically I went down the 9 circles of hell in Dante's Inferno (which is a work I happen to know quite well), but in each and every circle, instead of seeing different people, I saw episodes of my life illustrating the nature of the circle in question (so limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery). So that was horrible because I'll confess I'm guilty of all these things. Then I woke up and I had auditory hallucinations about the voices I heard down there, mostly sentences that have been said in my life, either by me, my ""accomplices"", the people who've hurt me and the people I've hurt. Took a pill and it seemed to fade away. Tonight I spent time with my family making arrangements about the future of my abstinence. So here are my first and second days.   
   
The takeway: always consult a medical professional before you attempt to quit. If I failed to get out of my place, or If my father wasn't a doc, I'm fairly certain I would either be at the very least in a coma, or worse, dead. Also I will never drink a drop of alcohol ever again.",5.434402718168812,6.135590988197428,6.281519313304724,77.69377396280402,67.76609442060087,9.13178826895565,30.98397711015737,9.21078282632365,2.632795650929899,3779,144,714,68,60,1249,407,932,0.122,0.8109999999999999,0.066,-0.9966,1,2,6,0,0,0,122.0,4,2,1,11,47,30,5,4,58,0,48,38,13,5,7,112,125,67,1,11,21,2,8,1,0,4,16,7,2,0,30,44,10,5,16,3,4,23,11,19,3,10,64,25,96,11,126,51,23,150,3,3,7,1,43,69,1,15,55,485,126,9,0.0,0.0,0.10695283832739873,0.059739557212187176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712802628871105,0.05487379588106575,0.11351153632661425,0.060472624593764714,0.1314694507688599,0.045597584202270974,0.0,0.0,0.03726554757759323,0.11492413358771986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05123014669017415,0.12468471290629453,0.10297189155191544,0.08427488490507158,0.0915106077297142,0.2004316447176482,0.0,0.13989104659616167,0.0,0.0,0.04846571546996991,0.0,0.06086990459470287,0.0,0.0,0.05595642909853837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04720492763980341,0.0,0.0,0.06146231283762524,0.0875059031260723,0.0,0.0,0.07068230407639252,0.056495891031092114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057253826961343575,0.0,0.05608962298087531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10736531949136896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049569296284113634,0.09234190533700004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051660103245484236,0.0,0.05541656000660202,0.0,0.05261612560134074,0.0,0.0,0.13983731172267272,0.0,0.06008483683796504,0.0,0.0,0.2290438676403045,0.0,0.12457530297609595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969180556489247,0.0,0.04908959937636299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1948130580790844,0.03673095802795684,0.0,0.05496837900193982,0.0,0.21586592471481145,0.0,0.1173280227986255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06023275775219121,0.0446689165877934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05603621419488447,0.07741303242420251,0.026772273721340528,0.10984701551775357,0.09677794682027567,0.04849584402121245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05185262361608089,0.036579100042609496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040948705488564,0.0,0.05813362274604195,0.05533188592453679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12085184074848487,0.0,0.042264762234593016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053691887099780206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058359692228109175,0.07426713563008952,0.04167749852988943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05231233526617776,0.1139732459583666,0.0,0.1717614808840307,0.0,0.1036065039443612,0.0,0.05248278488111334,0.055750804876528906,0.0,0.05243573251726452,0.0,0.055088645674461714,0.06138799532950225,0.11657205365489973,0.0,0.0,0.1053179125678758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15638065572246482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08733623290915571,0.04988741795014827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04533072292794636,0.0,0.0548390879381255,0.0,0.046431449013222936,0.04218734189641882,0.0,0.0,0.2327242615086369,0.058408988895973235,0.08752592275719367,0.04581484611413823,0.0,0.0,0.06273233101309994,0.0,0.0,0.05164789189788588,0.11391535145446728,0.04120241343054658,0.0,0.0,0.050452028458024274,0.0,0.0,0.0728127220776225,0.0,0.10768048537316142,0.08700938333854825,0.09586210907423436,0.0,0.05194353020279785,0.0,0.3044213729800545,0.1488210871015642,0.0,0.10706232184040226,0.0,0.0,0.09465836811693464,0.060353920875999625,0.0904306735747434,0.06464434442293053,0.0,0.04395686338013769,0.0,0.049271342791568036,0.10159939398863986,0.0,0.061181698575170085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079789395351593,0.0,0.055845384774297006,0.03892800132394611,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,cpt_eggroll,2018/04/04,"I don't know what to do I have been dating my girlfriend for a little over two years now, but last NYE we had the worst argument of our relationship. It wasn't even so much of an argument, just me yelling at her really. I didn't care who heard at some point I just kept calling her a fucking idiot. I have never talked to her like that no matter how drunk I was, but for some reason her smoking out of a vape pen really triggered my anger. I overreacted and just kept yelling and yelling, even told her to fucking leave and go home when the uber took us back to my house.

We got over that, and I apologized profusely. Said I would never call her names again. I offered to never drink again if that's what it took, but she said she didn't want to tell me not to drink. Most of the time we do enjoy drinking together. It is just a handful of times I can't control my anger while I'm under the influence.

Flash forward to last night and again, she smoked out of a friend's vape pen and I don't know how how but everything escalated so fast. This time we argued, and I didn't call her anything.. but it got to the point where I got mad enough to lose sight of my promise and I called her a fucking idiot again. We have drank plenty of times together before this and it hasn't been an issue. I just don't know how it slipped out last night and I immediately regretted it in my drunken haze. I sort of really only remember trying to talk to her about how I feel about her smoking, and how she kept brushing it aside as if it was no big deal how I felt. She says she didn't like being told what to do and will continue to smoke anyway(but will try to not smoke as often). She says she's not sure if she can still be with me, but I really want to make this work. I don't want to slip up again.

alcoholism,DonkeyKongSUH,2018/04/04,"scary moment first of all sorry for the horrific spelling and grammar, here goes. 

last week i went on this bender that was pretty epic, im talking half gallon+ some. Obviously I was blacked out for most of it, but when I finally came out of the stupor *still drunk as piss* my hands were shaking and I've never had that before, so I grab a water and pound it, immediately puke it up. im like well at least I got that over with, drink another glass of water and puke that up, fuck! try to eat a cup of chicken noodle soup.. you guessed it, puked that up too. 

so i go and sit down and blank out for like an hour, when I wake up i actually feel sober, I get up im still shaking like michael j fox, a complete loss of total motor skills all together. 

decide to go grab a water, puke it up again. i literally puke up and dry heave for the next 12 straight hours when finally i can guzzle down an entire small baby sip of water. 

couldnt sleep when i wanted to, long story short, im normal now but it literally took a full 24hrs til i was semi regular and like 36 total hours til i was totally back to normal. 

just venting, theres no point to this, just genuinely freaked me out is all. 

when i felt normal but had no motor skills was the worst and i genuinely considered calling 911, thinking i was having a stroke or something?

alcoholism,MoonEagle3,2018/04/05,Husband’s drunk driving My husband of 14 years drinks 2 to 4 drinks most nights.  Not nasty or anything.  However he occasionally goes out with a buddy then drives home drunk.  Once every few weeks.  Tonight they went to get my car at the shop while I was in a class.  It’s getting later and I’m getting concerned.   I already told my husband that I will not help him in any way if he gets a dui and I mean it.   He already hit a mailbox and dented his car a few years ago.  He also had a friend get a dui leaving his (my husbands) house just before we were married.   Short of my moving out does anyone have ideas?

alcoholism,fionaman,2018/04/06,"The 6-month Itch I've been six months sober this time around (3rd attempt). Last drink was on October 29, 2017. I'm getting the itch for a beer though. For now I'm ignoring it and indulging myself (butter pecan Haagen Dazs ice cream). Anyone else have this problem? 

I pretty much just quit cold turkey every time, never joined any kind of program. I was a semi-regular binge drinker (5 to 12 drinks about 3 to 5 times a month). Drinking had a largely negative net value for me and I don't want to return to the drinking life.",3.086494066882416,5.0762177572815546,3.8811003236245964,87.62083063646173,75.31067961165049,6.131175836030206,25.036677454153185,6.937597516519254,1.0448217907227615,411,14,79,4,9,131,80,103,0.108,0.835,0.056,-0.6306,0,0,6,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,2,5,3,0,0,7,0,6,8,2,0,1,8,10,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,5,1,0,5,0,0,3,2,0,1,4,3,5,1,11,6,1,11,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,9,41,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1127130097618762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589350437634055,0.16982643339963382,0.0,0.14754914052677842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6494721849300781,0.0,0.0,0.13845957155516336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964821066976169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865954794957921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17259902389561987,0.0,0.13510516706964104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11707134936307707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39689078996494986,0.0,0.1218424308016427,0.0,0.12783358538907924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16862333771418836,0.0,0.15859660236532258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17629134516551292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16284467005023098,0.0,0.2899435950425941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776132510626097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,SadInvestment,2018/04/06,"advice on talking to doctors about alcohol abuse and meds? finally gathered the courage to make an appointment where I am planning on asking for help on my self medication for anxiety with alcohol. not really sure what to say, it is just a physical but I figure thats where to start. 
I'm seeing a lot on here about how anti anxiety meds aid in quitting drinking. I feel like I'm at the point where I need meds to help my panic attacks past the point of detox but I'm unsure on how these things work and how to ask for them. 
I always denied meds up until now cuz I thought they would change my personality or make me fat or something. But now I know I need them as alcohol has been a downward spiral. 
I also don't want to feel like I'm just replacing booze with something else. I'm nervous and I don't know what to expect. Not trying to go to detox or anything. 
Forgive me if I sound ignorant on this topic. If anyone has any experience with anxiety, how/what medications helped, and also the relationship of those with alcoholism please share. Also if anybody knows anything about marijuana helping as well, (since I started drinking regularly smoking weed makes me anxious as hell but I probably just need to get my tolerance back up idk).

alcoholism,cailedoll,2018/04/06,"Worried that I’m going down that path A little backstory- I’m 18 yrs old and I have a history full of mental illness and self harm. My boyfriend has been an alcoholic for several years, and recently I have been drinking with him and the next morning neither of us remember anything from the night before. Even though I KNOW that I don’t want to go down that path I can’t help but drink when it’s available, and I don’t stop drinking until I pass out or throw up. It’s almost like when it’s available my brain forgets about the consequences of drinking BEFORE I even start drinking. As time goes on me and him are drinking more often and I’m finding myself craving the feeling of being drunk. Even though I know what’s potentially going to happen (becoming addicted to alcohol) I just can’t stop myself, and sometimes I don’t want to. I just need some advice on how to get out of this and how to help my boyfriend.

alcoholism,garbagegabby,2018/04/06,"Coming to terms with who I am. Hello all.
To start this story off, I've always been attracted to the effects of alcohol. My mom told me she was an alcoholic at the age of 10, it's always something I've considered since then. To be honest with you, I do NOT think she was an alcoholic. She never seemed to drink much. She grew up in an extremely religious background and she probably had no concept of what an ""alcoholic"" was. That being said, her and my dad have always loved alcohol. Her, wine. My dad, Belgian beer. I probably had my first taste of alcohol when I was 6 years old. I asked my dad for a sip of beer, obviously not knowing the real effects of alcohol. My dad, obliged. I, somehow, liked the taste. (To this day I am confused about how, no child I've ever met or have even heard of likes beer).

I think this story is important to how I function on a day-to-day basis, no matter how long ago it was. Everytime I drink, I drink to the point of completely blacking out. Nobody knows that I do this. Not even my husband. I'm for the most part, very good at hiding it. I don't necessarily try to do this, but I prefer to do it. Drinking tends to make me feel euphoric. I desperately crave this, to the point of drinking when I shouldn't. IE, now, it is thursday night, I have work in the morning.

Further background, my cousin, Lexi, killed herself 2 years ago, a day after my 21st birthday. I'm lucky really, I lost whole months afterwards. Can't remember them at all. She was my best fucking friend. I loved her more almost more than anything. Even now, it is almost entirely unmanageable, I have recurring dreams about her almost everyday. She was also an alcoholic, she shot herself in the head, but that was only her secondary cause of death. Her primary cause is brain-death, due to alcohol poisoning. Life is pure pain after her death. Fast forward to feb 18th 2016, my mother dies. She's been horribly sick my entire childhood. I should've been prepared. I wasn't. I fall further into this hell. I drink more and more and more. 

My dad remarries 8 months after my mom dies. I hate his new wife, Wendy. My step-sister is cool as hell though. I'll survive, right? My dad no longer seems to remember my mom. My step mom seems aggressive towards her own children, and is obsessed with Christianity, and the Amish for some reason? My dad moved 4 hours away, taking my little sisters with him. I miss them, but I want to puke everytime I have to see him and Wendy together, so I avoid visiting them. I miss my mom.

Fast forward to now, I'm drinking more and more. I don't have anything against living in particular, besides the pain I feel while sober. I'm wondering these days if I should kill myself. The philosophical thought I put behind it tells me I shouldn't care as much as I do. Everyone I know will recover from my death. I'M the one suffering here, so don't I have a right to end it? Well, anyways.

alcoholism,FunkyFre5h,2018/04/06,"How big of a problem do i have? Hello guys,first time posting here,am drunk right now!

Situation is as follows,i love beer and i love the effects alcohol has on me in calming my anxious behaviour and depressive feelings but i certainly don't drink every day and exclusively because of that.

Usually when i drink,i can have up to 10-12 pints and be pretty fine motorically speaking,i will walk home or have a ride home no problem without puking or making any scenes.

The thing is,i have noticed that alcohol has become my crutch over the years in extreme social situations and my tolerance is too damn high,i'm damaging my health goddamit.

I also spend a lot of time the next day contemplating what i did and said the day before when i drank even if it was normal,and then i fall into a trap of socializing and drinking with the same people again the next day just to make sure they don't hold a grudge(why the fuck would they right).

It's like this trap where i drink a few days in a row,then i make a pause like a week or two then again i drink and so on.

I can't stay on a drink or two,if i have a pint,i will fucking have 10 of them or i will rather not have any.

I am 6ft4 and 230 pounds if it means anything regarding tolerance.

alcoholism,JDVanJR,2018/04/07,"Cold turkey to the ER, how to quit? I was unaware of withdrawal until I tried quitting cold turkey. Heart racing and palpation so hard it vibrated my body. Night sweats and tremors causing insomnia. Eventually this and dehydration effected my heart rhythm and I was in the ER being monitored for a heart attack.

After my time in the ER, I've been given a 5 day dose of librium to prevent seizures. I started drinking again (yesterday/day after being released) to combat symptoms until I can commit to 5 days in a row (This all happened across the country, currently traveling until Wednesday when I get home).

My questions for all, I do not have someone who can watch me and my doctor was not very helpful when it came to what to expect or do. He just said take this, drink lots of pedialyte, don't drink, it will suck and this should prevent seizures. Any successful people who failed cold turkey have experience trying with medication?

My problem started the last 8 months where I cant even say how it happened, I never had a problem before. I drink either a 6 pack of 8% and up beers or just less than half a fifth a night. I've never had a problem before but I just started craving it and hiding my habit and cant explain it.",5.4351968085106375,6.554848740425534,6.155997340425532,77.08718750000001,67.97872340425532,8.598404255319151,32.559840425531924,8.841846274778883,2.836792553191489,974,42,171,16,16,319,133,235,0.097,0.87,0.033,-0.9004,1,0,5,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,0,5,11,7,2,0,13,0,19,15,5,4,5,39,31,20,0,5,9,0,1,0,0,2,5,2,1,0,13,11,5,2,3,6,0,2,7,6,3,1,9,7,19,1,25,18,5,31,0,1,1,0,8,6,1,4,23,122,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473259374367834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12502180433913634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870256654958317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220689389259789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12569098253703626,0.0,0.11289277728948564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21262019179013505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124825282316852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.430622348269646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07258482986462893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749872125519117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05741577483264905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19436015703666412,0.0,0.09844463118635312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906794900859499,0.07366052406458917,0.0,0.11023397759410612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0895793625298291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09342908076226293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070798469203093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771740496718458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16951610863489114,0.0,0.0,0.20625864778970265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07618758559873584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3154649710464281,0.0,0.0,0.1231079217646319,0.2337744242055905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10453562582743234,0.08739317831157367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311395757195012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333534433300521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11422332737348252,0.0826276124818177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408085142575025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492234324438184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067515747832404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,jpott09,2018/04/07,"Need withdrawal advise So I've drank daily for about a year now. My wife says I go through a fifth of vodka every 3-4 days. So according to the national whatever on drinking I figure this averages out to 5-6 ""drinks"" per day. Now... Currently it's Saturday morning.
Wednesday I got off work late, had maybe 2 or 3 drinks.
Thursday we were going to visit family and see a movie. I decided not to drink since I didn't want to start drinking and then have to stop for dinner and a movie, since I usually get a headache a few hours after doing this.
Thursday night after the movie I began to get cold sweats, and extremely shaky hands/body. I went to bed immediately when I got home, and slept very poorly, with vivid dreams when I did sleep.
Friday I had a temperature of 101.5ish, was very tired, and continued to experience cold sweats. Shaking had stopped though. Slept on and off.  Went to bed at 7pm, and slept pretty well through the night. 
Saturday, today, woke up, still feeling hot and a bit sweaty. Took temperature and it was around 100. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol. Now I'm just irritable and uncomfortably warm. Also sore, presumably from laying around so much the last few days.
At first I thought I might have some sort of infection, but I have no other symptoms that would indicate this. Alcohol withdrawal seems to explain it better than anything else.
I have to go back to work tomorrow about 3am. I still feel pretty miserable, but I suppose better than the last 36ish hours.
So questions are:
Is this likely to continue?
If so, would I be better off resuming drinking and trying to taper off?
If I resume, will this rid me of these symptoms?
And last, if I successfully taper off, am I still going to experience some withdrawals regardless?
I'm on vacation starting next Thursday (5 days from now) and I work a job that I cannot call into. I would prefer to fight through this then rather than now, but if it's likely that I'll be feeling alright tomorrow, I don't want to put myself back at the start of things unnecessarily.

Tldr: I suspect I've been having withdrawals for last 2 days. Flu like symptoms. I need to return to work and want to know if resuming drinking and then tapering off is a better solution than trying to continue this (unplanned) detox through my work week.",4.59747261663286,6.3927646045977005,5.32292427315754,79.68759127789048,70.77011494252874,8.611899932386748,29.345841784989858,9.168548406835145,2.5980385395537526,1813,72,333,38,34,587,218,435,0.08,0.813,0.107,0.9392,2,0,9,0,1,0,66.0,1,0,0,11,26,15,1,3,16,1,28,26,6,0,0,64,64,38,0,16,12,1,5,3,0,5,11,1,3,0,17,23,10,2,13,9,1,11,5,4,1,1,22,10,32,11,62,35,6,85,0,1,2,0,9,18,0,13,59,214,49,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07458178202811264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05580916444614609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05742929578444592,0.12425162193941955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10732480168224467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2468860471093729,0.07619004708644855,0.07751835492154438,0.0,0.0,0.07126100098044526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22503632831975634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4785573510102773,0.0,0.0,0.0582986328396941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05879911131541477,0.0,0.0,0.13653144036789205,0.06578959249782641,0.0,0.10586020946786584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593613457727029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07292234127260926,0.0,0.15864773593550707,0.0,0.11163112976713456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07000271055632888,0.0,0.13745356986288385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0692534816031631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038353471427521255,0.2275450210128809,0.07872351733571929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228417295243544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0701110820034197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403367609836882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051301958093744465,0.10349332744033267,0.0,0.0,0.0742199654177538,0.13098197793539776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14199827347705835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015587121376478,0.07817814799546415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055497946272691036,0.0,0.0,0.05561172754615885,0.06353206229791848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11545814281051245,0.0,0.0698380572577953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14818818940658215,0.0,0.1671975401548008,0.1166912130189463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21760829191019448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04636381862596267,0.0,0.06856601910960858,0.05540360465530657,0.0,0.08021064605527968,0.06615053920240335,0.0,0.15507331048733278,0.09476247684765604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686124515101819,0.11516425229572845,0.12348770549288918,0.0,0.055979449276742935,0.0,0.06274748520486803,0.12938771525051135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2540312289391392,0.0,0.0,0.14872544863222653,0.0,0.0,0.044940963317131016
alcoholism,fbtra,2018/04/07,"Just failed miserably I've come in and out of this subreddit looking to fix my issues. And I've gotten a lot of advice, which I shortly correct then collapse.

I bought a computer again and binge drank for like a week.

I took my girlfriend or ex at this point to the airport last Friday. She's gone for a month. Then my roommate asked me to move, he is moving out of the country and wants to rent the whole house out. Okay that's life. Then my car died. And I felt hopeless and lost and I just escaped. Then lost my job.

Long story I pushed everyone away. I had a rope. I started pulling it while on the phone. I was really close to doing it. But something clicked and all the talk I do about wanting to love and spend time with my girlfriend. I can't do it if im dead. And it would be extremely selfish to hurt her or my mom and my family. 

I felt really lost. Like collapsed and I felt suffocated.

But people have gone through far worse and held up.

Also I can't grow old with someone if I don't make it there myself.

I kept fighting wanting the help. I kept deciding to not move to moms because it's 45 minutes from city work. 

I only binge drink when I game. And I stupidly bought a computer. 

Sorry for my rant. I returned the computer. I  am moving to my mom's. Get my shit in order. I head there tomorrow. 

Oh when I tried to pull the rope stunt. Police were called. Went into the hospital. Somehow didn't get 5150ed. 

Laying here currently, I can't sleep what so ever. Anxiety attacks come and go. The hot flashes and sweats. Seeing things out of the corner of my eye.

I fucked myself up physically this bang. Like the worse. I'm not proud just wanted to update people who constantly gave me advice to focus on me. That's what I'm doing.",0.5317231638418072,2.944310420903957,2.3113333333333337,92.5028757062147,88.85875706214689,5.180564971751412,20.296045197740114,6.742157984588678,0.4221428248587573,1355,44,283,18,45,445,195,354,0.187,0.7659999999999999,0.046,-0.9936,3,0,2,0,2,1,45.0,0,0,0,6,15,19,5,1,18,1,17,10,5,1,3,55,53,31,2,7,11,4,4,3,2,1,1,0,1,0,16,26,2,3,4,2,4,16,7,13,0,0,22,8,45,6,39,29,3,56,0,7,4,2,19,18,2,6,24,180,61,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18371200986317865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517200569507873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07190997196731884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787759109583948,0.10693891121321952,0.0883163758527742,0.0,0.0,0.05730171020748575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09598481583984653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16194586964299926,0.0,0.10158092973900687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09755747033752143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208450740144283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08502865268194383,0.0,0.08982131464139957,0.0,0.0,0.08861511672864744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707650867333229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690176235623381,0.0982225537300908,0.0,0.053422536547574256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09647142656181727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06300641943620132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10846372511229783,0.10062926497103394,0.0,0.10153645418999327,0.09811189082442548,0.09328079295113874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07662279029447233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663951915851903,0.1377713948596457,0.0,0.0,0.08318730720248173,0.07893657715324165,0.0,0.3078372936546199,0.07991569330791316,0.08483894048058746,0.0,0.06274592996265564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33027604469186256,0.0750301423917569,0.3996297692820205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863750196485432,0.0,0.0,0.07149146372461078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13033594411726682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886066678234124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12043799798426462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749060685874809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09648995680394018,0.0,0.0,0.09406818557518742,0.0,0.07964614887885763,0.07236602313506411,0.0,0.10522563957717204,0.06653389593247618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755538802170844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06244962225083338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054812330675511306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10443779166732786,0.06382003314299466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22177524886714664,0.0,0.0754013703949886,0.0,0.0,0.08713921955479409,0.0,0.10494797765177794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06843333770735031,0.0,0.19158867209438435,0.0667751158944106,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,kopp_fister,2018/04/07,"Myths? Hey guys! New to reddit and a casual drinker. I figured now that I have a group of people with shared interests in alcohol to drop a few questions. Past experiences welcome!

1. Does cheaper alcohol get you more hungover?

2. If alcohol is a sedative, why does it seem to be a big substance at clubs?

3. Is it true that different alcohols can give you a different type of intoxication? Like the ""tequila makes me crazy"" type of thing. I understand the amount of alcohol administered and the rate it is administraed matter, but is there anyway that a shot of 80 proof whiskey could affect me differently than a shot of 80 proof vodka? 

Thank you all for taking the time to read or reply to this, if you have any fun or interesting facts about booze drop them!

alcoholism,94rebel,2018/04/08,"23/m what do I do? I am 23 year old male and I feel like I have a drinking problem. Nearly a year ago my partner had suddenly passed away and I started developing depression and anxiety. Every night when I go to sleep I have awful vivid nightmares and always wake up tired. 

Before him passing away I drank most weekends when I went parties, but never to the state I get to now. On top of that I’m taking anti-depressants which isn’t a great mix when drinking alcohol. I only drink once a week but I get to the point where I am so drunk I forget most of the night, make stupid mistakes, sometimes vomit and have a 3-4 day hangover whilst laying in bed depressed. I really want to try and get over this obstacle, but when I seem to drink it makes me feel at ease, hence why I am drinking a lot.

I can admit I’ve developed a problem of binge drinking and not knowing my limits, especially with the emotional state I’m in. 

Is there any advice or help that you can give me? Ideally I’d just like to be able to cut down and just have a few without becoming a complete mess.",2.6545662100456617,4.239672013698629,4.295639269406394,85.93514840182651,75.43835616438356,7.24109589041096,26.321917808219176,7.984000788550335,1.5756136986301374,837,31,172,13,18,281,137,219,0.168,0.684,0.147,-0.7063,0,0,7,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,3,10,12,2,0,13,1,15,13,2,2,1,35,34,17,0,5,8,0,2,2,1,0,3,0,1,2,6,9,9,1,5,8,0,4,4,8,0,0,3,3,24,4,23,30,4,37,0,2,1,0,7,13,0,5,20,109,30,0,0.10583426930162763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10342002308174797,0.09381569406148832,0.1131046476268777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806259026550013,0.0,0.0,0.07197093233684186,0.0,0.08096292633461136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19886955971996906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688563546740302,0.09005716811342401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096521778152027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825434824890173,0.0,0.2734647032070537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6220637543307862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11904930806112353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08916993648122734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10702597304577907,0.0756080231357697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16588211268516892,0.10152587483723276,0.06014805419580814,0.0,0.0,0.1166826555328369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07093847982223027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05816374660291944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1034105561706844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997651109095835,0.0,0.0,0.14129039315081193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08162591296116033,0.0,0.0,0.198636584659112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11105526239170277,0.11271004274934175,0.0,0.08049173087871271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004759314901154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025382049827652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06780014295597044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09634754391503182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591070154520063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10467279851456854,0.0,0.07491004053768667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07957419927749708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12164092371226755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185452171191252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062423794105465724,0.0,0.08489386700905177,0.0,0.0,0.09810942795078058,0.09549896657717087,0.0,0.0,0.10202045890206174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13630759903485706
alcoholism,stowawaymygreys,2018/04/08,"unsure whether I should be concerned about relationship with alcohol, unsure what to do about it sooooo here's where I'm at right now. I keep taking those quizzes that are meant to tell you if you have a problem and getting mixed results. some tell me I'm fine while others tell me I drink more than 99% of women and should be concerned. I guess I'm trying to figure out where I stand. I drink every day, but not too much at a time, between 2-4 beers, I'd say 3 most nights. I don't really binge drink or even get properly drunk very often. if I go out with friends they always seem to get drunk before I feel anything at all.

recently my partner has significantly cut down on drinking and I feel extremely angry about it for no reason. I hate that I feel angry, like a piece of shit for resenting him for making a positive decision. I think it's because I no longer share this part of my life with anyone. I might be a little bit envious. now I'm drinking daily on my own while he drinks herbal tea. I feel as though everything is better with alcohol and get pretty frustrated when there isn't any available. 

I hope this kind of post is okay. I'm just not sure how concerned I should be. it might be worth mentioning that I'm fairly young (23), outwardly appear decently successful, and have a history of depression and intense anxiety. I might be overthinking, I can't tell.",4.2273161764705875,5.56468180514706,5.114735294117646,82.61555882352944,71.0220588235294,8.675294117647061,27.57058823529412,9.120678840339163,2.2032582352941184,1089,38,214,22,20,355,164,272,0.205,0.675,0.12,-0.9759,0,0,9,0,0,0,29.0,0,2,1,2,16,18,6,0,6,1,22,14,1,4,2,49,47,17,0,7,8,0,4,1,2,6,3,1,0,2,12,12,12,1,10,9,1,2,7,8,0,0,1,5,29,10,30,34,9,27,0,1,0,0,16,13,1,13,11,137,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2098084152092615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167777757364457,0.0,0.0,0.0667528150767938,0.0,0.07509286144017102,0.0,0.0,0.06863642167465336,0.0,0.08077810161854775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059838006707207965,0.0,0.08352774230128747,0.0,0.0,0.08681538720436399,0.1071663387441006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330569493697835,0.0,0.08454588619089985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5769621902975223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06483438460536471,0.0,0.08270483773202167,0.0,0.08822073636280049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985325118119014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583890987320784,0.0,0.2051401889269425,0.0,0.05578713250747274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10813535803907943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09691362014809084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09749597640595813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724996649706096,0.0,0.10221952859639123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693339850593492,0.04795648402012212,0.09838306412010428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655231992965002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31239978112469124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07215959603059148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211740610207468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10629874790358937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09401106012435444,0.0998649801282673,0.0,0.09392677643748826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288442094563916,0.10092580981045364,0.0969221002474746,0.10538812931746062,0.0,0.0838289187180686,0.0,0.07806153083371634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0893620462211398,0.0,0.0,0.10076080908416077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09251553783792478,0.0,0.07380482142977038,0.0,0.3431880030707175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289757601601023,0.09644263931084672,0.0,0.0572384419020442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06664484458556111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099306762950043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,thelackof,2018/04/08,"Can an alcoholic come to drink moderately? I am 28 and began drinking when I was 17.  
I quit when I was 27 for over 5 months, and by that time I was feeling great and had no desire to drink.  
  
I went to a bon fire for a bithday party and everyone was drinking. They offered beers and I denied but then wondered, since I had no desire to drink, if I could maybe have a beer or two and be okay.  
So I drank 3 small cups of wine.  
  
A week later, I thought ""I'm fine and no longer need to drink a lot""  
so I went and bought one beer.  
About a week later, I bought another beer.  
Then, it became more frequent.  
Then, two beers (talls)  
  
Until I became an alcoholic again, drinking every single day.  
  
That lasted for 6 months.......  
Now, today is day 16 of being sober.  
and I get cravings, but then the cravings go away.  
  
and I do not want to drink for the rest of my life.  
  
but would just like to drink once a week or once every two weeks (at least until I can ween off permanently).  
  
  
I know many answers will probably say ""uuuh.... read what you just wrote you f---ing idiot, why would you think that you can drink once a week if it didn't work before you filthy piece of s---!!""  
  
but I am asking seriously.. has this ever been possible for anyone?  
  
thank you for any serious and considerate and kind answers.",1.7216282051282086,3.607962957692312,3.2034615384615392,91.39070512820514,79.03846153846155,6.025641025641026,20.06410256410256,6.996647511020387,0.2607564102564104,979,24,214,11,24,321,148,260,0.07,0.8079999999999999,0.122,0.9372,0,0,18,0,0,0,56.0,0,6,1,2,10,9,1,0,12,1,23,20,0,0,1,42,43,30,0,9,11,0,2,1,0,3,3,1,0,0,7,13,19,0,8,17,2,4,5,3,0,4,16,3,27,6,25,21,6,37,0,0,0,0,11,6,0,6,28,141,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1610814709734525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05124981108819772,0.07902527292241966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052695959571879336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0704547634628277,0.0,0.07080655367322633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412884623127799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06491904134602315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060171677270748625,0.0,0.0,0.09720653436397507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7382760618101222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06817066259515288,0.12699411417990314,0.07201311959129977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0381060847902822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03937435416397109,0.0,0.04283085288419804,0.0,0.0,0.08308860062197637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07847955961202434,0.0414178464665451,0.0614313671863325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05323151738538247,0.03681883293847568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407141113866371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640682994950912,0.07571283437820125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1203089631582718,0.0,0.0,0.05588113131214167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240779223406956,0.051068304620756434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08496110020008728,0.0,0.0,0.0812546737006267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015843206835152,0.07538396321864313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05993213475538173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062341522869385026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938464870551922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048289931818122016,0.0,0.0598302554083813,0.04394510300558612,0.0,0.07143585115996333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22085776779046634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044451385461294034,0.0,0.30226054502098737,0.0,0.0,0.13972556656389942,0.06800389875862044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08172857553279828,0.05486557563787662,0.0,0.0,0.10707223393078062,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,arbogastar,2018/04/09,"1 year of drinking, can I quit cold turkey? No previous history of alcoholism/excessive drinking.

I've drunk 6-8 beers almost every day for 1 year now.
When I go 24 hours without drinking my fingers shake visibly but that's the only problem I get.

For the last couple of months I've never gone more than one day without alcohol.
What's going to happen after two days, three days and so on?
If I quit right now, will I get physically sick and feel like crap after a couple of days even though it's only been 1 year of drinking? 

Should I quit cold turkey or taper down?",4.204473684210527,5.229678526315791,5.597324561403512,80.31335526315792,70.75438596491226,8.156140350877193,27.407894736842106,8.472884824447931,1.9641789473684208,448,15,85,7,8,151,77,114,0.154,0.816,0.029,-0.9146,0,0,7,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,3,6,4,1,1,3,0,4,10,2,0,1,12,11,8,0,3,5,0,2,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,3,2,7,0,1,6,0,4,4,3,0,3,2,4,7,1,15,7,1,24,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,3,18,49,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326110849407765,0.12425503676925186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745994362851744,0.0,0.4001287021852469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4862314154485433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819581814715072,0.0,0.10454850679421293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274203005902979,0.08864765673766269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296604952257266,0.0,0.1410428110840476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10972957469866622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12220053297753795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114732877398884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06062255767491901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990449245099564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957034136454758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08408444796187263,0.18874725282377428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11873433881040298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959448562083539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596947552868724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12191468126583332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12121480319781265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392305537397444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23972355212115865
alcoholism,tired_of_drinking,2018/04/09,"Prostate pain when alcohol not present 30/M been a heavy drinker the past 5 years or so, by heavy I mean 6-10 Beers a night mixed with 2-3 shots (2.5oz) of vodka or a couple of glasses of whiskey (probably 2.5-3oz each time haven't measured the cup I use). Anyway I've been trying to cut back on my drinking the past few months and I keep having an issue where I get a very sharp pain in the lower abdomen. I know it's the prostate because I can alleviate the pain by massaging my perineum. Has anyone experienced this side effect when cutting off alcohol? When I feel the pain chugging a beer or taking a shot will make it go away. I don't even know how to approach my doctor about this issue and I don't want to have a record of alcoholism in my medical file for many reasons.

alcoholism,bingeblack,2018/04/09,"Scared and confused I am confused and scared. I have lived my ABF for so long, i feel like I am now an Alcoholic myself. Although I don't get shitfaced everyday, I feel like I have an unhealthy relationship with it or i am using it as coping mechanism. My BF is clean for six months. Attends AA/NA meetings. I have taken the alcoholic screening test with just four questions and the answer is yes. I challenged myself to go 30 days without alcohol and i could easily do it. Last week I just drank three large scotches everyday for seven days. It's kind of alarming. I don't know if I qualify as a problem drinker.

alcoholism,tessa-renee,2018/04/09,"I would really appreciate words of wisdom from alcoholics or loved ones of alcoholics... I am a 24 year old female and my boyfriend of one year is an alcoholic. He is also a fan of cocaine when he drinks. We’ve been battling this together for a year now, with many ups and downs. This man is my soulmate, and I’ve known that the entire time we’ve been together, in fact we tell each other all of the time. He’s been trying to be sober recently, but has gone on binges for days, avoiding me, his family, and his child. The alcohol has become more toxic the more we try to keep him sober. The binges get longer, sometimes lasting for two to three days at a time. I’ve thought he was hurt, in jail, in the hospital, or worse. My life has wreaked havoc over this man I love with my whole heart. Today, after a 14 hour binge (from midnight to approximately 2 pm I’m assuming), he called me and basically let me have it. He said that I was disgusting, that he could never love me, that I’m not his soulmate, that he could never love a whore. That God sees me, sees what I do. Says that he wonders how many people I have let inside me, that I remind him of an awful ex of his (who will remain nameless). He then proceeded to tell me that he never loved me, that he loves the mother of his son. That he could never love a whore. Now, I am in no way a whore. I don’t drink, or do drugs. I’ve stopped smoking and drinking completely since being with him. Yes, I have always been in relationships, but never anything resembling this “whore” he made me out to be. Furthermore, he told me he never wants to talk to me again, he needs to go back to his soulmate (which he knew killed me because he tells ME every day that I’m his soulmate). Finally, I know he was wasted on alcohol and definitely cocaine. But I just need unbiased advice, to know what my next step should be? This is my soulmate, the person God put on this earth for me. I have been in relationships, but nothing has ever compared to the way this man and I are connected. He exceeds my wildest dreams, and makes me feel so blessed, and I know he feels the same way about me. We are saving to move in together and start our lives together. We talk about getting married and starting a family every day... So what happened today? After a year, are we just broken up over a drunken phone call? What do I do? What does it all mean? Please, I’m desperate, I need advice...",3.685900621118016,4.7954835113871646,4.743552795031056,85.63296894409939,72.06418219461699,8.004472049689442,26.01532091097309,8.418075326091056,1.5714076190476196,1868,59,391,30,35,612,223,483,0.091,0.72,0.189,0.9961,0,2,11,0,0,0,79.0,6,0,0,0,14,19,3,1,23,2,42,22,1,3,10,71,80,25,1,9,10,3,2,0,0,3,7,2,0,5,29,22,8,3,11,4,0,5,9,9,0,4,14,6,56,10,51,54,7,63,1,1,2,11,67,17,0,5,38,252,85,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302946435767627,0.0,0.35623976166033683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0533144768068523,0.05547322205691343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0548621877521253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051263674226923406,0.0,0.04064027122333351,0.07362970805194335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13615122253518655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06990026239325353,0.0,0.0,0.1596872229196388,0.0,0.0,0.17198170552766773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058341726912443326,0.0,0.0,0.19592814993012947,0.07731386120112077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060305137390077285,0.11234154417467487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256975530154114,0.0,0.0674188159890145,0.0,0.0,0.07303167404837496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06966268911321014,0.0,0.03788903275086259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05895440423430728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07900205109162475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06565467549281531,0.0,0.07136960845704844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05925769419455265,0.07375840444923412,0.0,0.1099171766775694,0.0543434213076796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363453528358975,0.04708966947368394,0.0,0.0,0.05886917726121475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4211941104833955,0.06308299341755805,0.044501492234859816,0.13518203292256226,0.0,0.07262113436839139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085766792008337,0.0,0.14830071351827806,0.3085114154585572,0.0,0.07090230904081322,0.0,0.0,0.06396986558364591,0.0,0.06995698414809426,0.0,0.09035209602472044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04621928472898346,0.05821203669368232,0.0,0.07318158301462467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06701988115769163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04270930907605256,0.0,0.06582673217819622,0.14315323637494845,0.0,0.0,0.06341665530507036,0.05301717018606333,0.0,0.0,0.1062517307998657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05514856330606095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593648197050613,0.0,0.0943760863838106,0.0,0.0,0.05573753909239623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10717062973790392,0.1748126436634977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052927045669384366,0.11662416236635202,0.0,0.1263871775564936,0.06370425202747232,0.0,0.09052656358848456,0.0,0.06512507249326567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03932258841816248,0.15875416740059511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443258256454997,0.0,0.0,0.0722987394954725,0.0,0.0,0.06794051668825163,0.047359124380267736,0.0,0.0,0.17172835108548118
alcoholism,Throwaway362473,2018/04/10,I feel helpess. I don't know if this is the right place to start but I'm 28 years old and have been drinking for about 8 years. One of my friends who's 2 years older than me died of jaundice recently and that made me think about my drinking. I recently looked at my eyes and they looked vieny and maybe a tiny tint of yellow color which is a sign of jaundice. I've been freaking out all day and have an appointment with the doc in 2 weeks. I'm just lost in my head right now and I'm trying not to panic. ,2.4508486238532114,3.335369440366975,3.25586009174312,95.9872763761468,74.77981651376146,6.55091743119266,22.799311926605505,6.6274283507984215,0.2455770642201829,395,10,96,3,8,125,73,109,0.106,0.8240000000000001,0.071,-0.5923,0,0,2,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,1,4,4,0,1,5,0,7,4,2,1,1,18,18,8,1,1,4,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,2,0,3,2,0,0,2,3,0,1,4,6,10,1,15,14,1,18,0,1,5,0,3,7,0,1,11,54,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11764720542543627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18932540718362426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574085469572981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09223812811791504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14093891265196018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872177707377113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002544514812914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30637734987417337,0.0,0.1991353430472947,0.0,0.0,0.1726122639074061,0.0,0.0,0.18326758458607031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19142137612284085,0.0,0.12361398055712355,0.0,0.0,0.21403310632152567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905923365099602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602397619813138,0.0,0.0,0.3115750654292574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911934775828424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688875785478815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12385267596081495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14632805773710236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3524216811701779
alcoholism,Shin3rBock,2018/04/10,"I'm worried about becoming a lifetime alcoholic Alcoholism runs in my family and I think it's finally caught up to me. I've always had an extremely addictive personality (masturbation, video games,etc.) And recently I've added alcohol to that list. At this point it's not so bad IMO but I'm worried it will progress.

 I'm 21 now and throughout hs and my first 2 years of college I smoked ALOT of weed. 6 months ago I quit smoking because I began having panic attacks every time I got high but after I quit my anxiety only worsened. I needed weed to sleep but I happened to turn 21 around that time so I replaced weed with alcohol. 

Now I need at least 2 beers around 4-5pm just to feel normal (I'm fine most of the day but the evening is when my anxiety starts kicking in) and I usually drink at least 4 more before bed. I recently admitted to myself that I have a problem with substance abuse and realized that anxiety was the cause. The problem now is that I'd rather be drunk than anxious so I can't find a good enough reason to quit but I'm worried that it'll only get worse and I'll start to drink 24/7

At least when I'm mildly drunk I can do homework or play video games but when I'm anxious I'm absolutely useless. 

TL;DR 
I suffer from anxiety which leads to addictive behavior. My anxiety seems to be more destructive than the alcohol I use to relieve it. I can't find a good reason to stop drinking",2.420491653625458,4.595169278169017,4.259405320813773,83.25940792905583,78.04929577464789,7.869379238393322,27.772039645279087,8.735056554316923,2.3713723526343253,1121,49,219,26,27,379,153,284,0.27,0.677,0.053,-0.9967,0,0,10,0,1,0,21.0,0,0,0,6,15,13,2,1,11,0,14,14,1,5,0,41,37,20,0,6,10,0,1,0,0,2,7,0,2,1,13,11,11,1,9,10,0,3,3,8,0,1,5,1,25,5,31,28,8,36,0,2,0,0,3,11,0,4,22,128,38,3,0.0,0.10003104845628648,0.0,0.18407368427081836,0.0,0.0,0.07483858786907474,0.4511287900442858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07024922605426177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3229284362944099,0.1907547819005167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503141446672372,0.0,0.09604680528260064,0.0,0.0,0.07049221445867078,0.05146532857142131,0.09324192490466028,0.07184033925794096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672879627238733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054447809505347305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.248116124942478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08723466477472269,0.09415734832555686,0.055762601230482836,0.0,0.07113257747958802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795893540056839,0.0,0.0426883410509658,0.0,0.0,0.09248459687598172,0.15432773671381544,0.07181274398551031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04410911980235128,0.0,0.0,0.14162510862237265,0.06752321429399677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07465766574188093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920074345421082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06738805730178442,0.0,0.0,0.12520167342801114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827195909638675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12841961111863232,0.0,0.0990557638720806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07371755908784154,0.0,0.0,0.07980989391886141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16156863094263052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2693924478263717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17360805444764565,0.16672105270738088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07685829330995257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08448700852408428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11951436712457182,0.0,0.0,0.07058394732133677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054096795567556685,0.0,0.0,0.0984590022799028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09183128476336512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07291698909174757,0.092983352189697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25721621628434344,0.08603734447189047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05436759984372555

alcoholism,UnreliableDan,2018/04/10,"Drink is ruining our relationship I’m sorry, this is going to be a bit of an outpouring. I come here because I have run out of ideas and I need help. I need advice and guidance as to what to do and how to stop alcohol destroying our relationship and her life. 

Me and my partner have been together for over three years and there’s always been a third person in our relationship. Ive always been aware that she’s not a good drinker, she gets too drunk too early at most public events we go too which started off as something to laugh off and has descended over the years into a source of deep embarrassment and concern. She drinks privately and publicly and constantly to excess. There’s no ‘off switch’ with it and it feels like it’s the only thing that matters to her. 

She confided in me very early on that she went to rehab for alcoholism. It was some time ago and she says it was a far worse period of her life with a ruinous relationship and no prospects. Ive given her everything I can in terms of stability and comfort and I just don’t feel that she’s ever really in control. 

I don’t really drink too much myself. I enjoy the odd drink here and there and very occasional drink to get drunk, but generally speaking I don’t react well to alcohol and it leads to me choosing other options. She is the opposite, it feels as though every decision in her life leads to her next drink. At least once a weekend she will drink at home until she passes out and three or four times a year this explodes into three or four day sessions where she’s calling in sick from work and spending all day on the sofa. She doesn’t even shower, she just drinks and sleeps. 

I’m aware there’s probably an element of depression to this. I think she drinks because she’s depressed and vice versa. I’ve tried everything to make it stop. I’ve been angry, I’ve been dismissive, I’ve been sympathetic, supportive, bargaining, we’ve nearly broken up a few times because of it and after a two week period of improvement it’s always ended up back at the same spot where wine and alcohol dominates. 

Tonight has been the third day of one of those explosions. We’ve had a talk about how this is the last chance but I don’t feel any of it has got through the clouds of fumes around her. I know she cares, I know she loves me more than anything but I don’t know if she can stop - even if she truly tried. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I’m better to stay, to help her beat this and risk it never getting better, waking up one day when I’m 45 and miserable. Alternatively, I don’t know if I should just go. It would break my heart, I’ve never loved anyone like this before but it’s killing me.

alcoholism,ticatty8686,2018/04/10,"I made it through my first 12 hours alcohol free! Feel free to post love and any tips for the anxiety! If you are going though a withdrawal right now, come here for support! The last day was tough. I've made it through the worst, I dunno about anybody else, but I find if i can make it through the first night, I will be fine. I'm 26 and sick of what I keep doing to myself and my mental state. (Not to mention others in my life). My fiancee has been able to stay with me, and is such an incredible help. I find the panic attacks and chest tightening to be the worst. I get pretty shaky if i get cold, and pour with sweat most of the time. All my symptoms are getting better now though. What do you redditors find to be the worst syptoms? How long did it take to go away for you? I realize these answers will be different for everyone and I want to hear them! I will keep posting my own updates. One trick I have learned is to go on a walk when panicked, I walked almost 20km yesterday and it felt great. No anxiety (or at least a lot less the whole time) I am so ready to never drink again. I hope we can all get through this together

alcoholism,REDDITOR_3333,2018/04/11,"Has anyone else experienced anxiety attacks as a result of heavy drinking? I am 24, and weigh 150lbs. I can drink about 8-15 drinks per night, with a drink meaning 1 shot of vodka or 1 beer. I drink this over the coarse of about 5 hours, from about 5pm to 10pm. The next day im usually not hung over and im fine in the morning until about 12-1pm. Then i start to get anxiety attacks. I'm in school, and while sitting in my desk at about this time I start feeling panicky, fear and dread, and then my palms will get soaked with sweat. Its really awful and i'm wondering if this is a common thing with alcoholism, because i hear a lot about DTs with alcoholics but i don't think I've experienced that, only anxiety attacks.

i only drink because im bored. It's 5:30 and i'm sober, but nothing sounds fun to do while sober that can entertain me until i go to sleep tonight. All fun activities, like video games or whatever feel like work unless I'm drunk. I cut back to 6 drinks last night, but damn I don't want to do anything, unless I'm intoxicated.

alcoholism,Raven_in_the_storm,2018/04/11,"My sister [28 y.o.] apparently can't drink without blacking out. Is this a warning sign? She takes antidepressants due to some work stress and still drinks. Last time we were at a party together she blacked out. Next morning I yelled at her for the first time, but she didn't take it seriously. 

Everytime we are at a larger social setting together she drinks until she blacks out or cries or doesn't understand conversation. I end up getting a cab for her, walking her home, cleaning the house etc.

One of our mutual friends who attended a wedding with her some two years ago told me that she got drunk at that wedding too. One of male guests whom she didn't know previously asked her how much would he have to pay to have sex with her. My sister was apparently too drunk to understand and respond.

She lives with her boyfriend, I know that he used to be or still is a heavy drinker. The apartment they live in looked trashed last time I visited. 

Is it premature to call my sister alcoholic?",4.186914893617022,6.326462531914897,4.370159574468087,84.65875,72.61702127659575,8.104255319148937,28.77127659574468,8.841846274778883,2.282844680851064,788,32,153,16,16,245,118,188,0.08199999999999999,0.8759999999999999,0.041,-0.7723,2,0,5,0,0,0,21.0,3,0,1,2,5,3,0,1,9,0,14,7,0,2,0,25,26,8,0,1,5,3,0,0,2,1,1,1,2,1,8,10,6,0,4,5,1,3,5,2,0,4,6,5,27,1,24,18,4,28,0,0,4,1,38,10,0,5,14,101,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408307051073895,0.1495951408447695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13086160934231414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14293436263551199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537605232295801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4113788287928241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12397997878152485,0.0,0.15611375393431415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11906619338024516,0.0,0.0,0.10814754396462836,0.0,0.07313332838637718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1119541134983915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404105005327218,0.0,0.0,0.1615171450020512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15385776000694676,0.2282033798422593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24720830776335065,0.0,0.11754723125012935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10290078136981698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14886941392708594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897069892962354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14269111531348538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22357505982652706,0.0,0.1603456432483016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21049380018046465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2448689039340348,0.0,0.0,0.13375607638580808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13673928966757173,0.2914464633115966,0.0,0.12089704197426294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349349053175,0.0,0.10190648825686707,0.0,0.0,0.09943717187732314,0.0,0.0,0.09014198312654564
alcoholism,duplex78,2018/04/11,"Cannot stop turning to alcohol when stressed? I have been battling with alcoholism since I was 15 &amp; I am 39 now. I have done rally good recently like not drinking at all over Xmas &amp; New Year when that was never possible before. I have managed to not drink for months &amp; months at a time. 

But, recently I have had a relationship breakdown &amp; I had a drink. It's like since I can remember I have used alcohol as a coping mechanism when something bad has happened. It like there's a switch in me that says drink it will make you cope. 

I am strong enough to go without alcohol I have proved that over Xmas. My gf said if I had a drink over Xmas then it would be over, harsh but it worked so how can I try to stop this ingrained mental cycle of feeling emotions &amp; then drinking to try to numb them?   

I work full time &amp; go to the gym 5 nights a week which as also helped but its just this association I have with stress / emotions &amp; alcohol.",3.7628945400149534,4.9649922041884835,4.434379207180252,87.5696989528796,71.98429319371728,7.970231862378459,27.25542258788332,8.418075326091056,1.6651956619296926,745,26,159,12,14,238,107,191,0.079,0.8370000000000001,0.084,-0.4086,0,0,12,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,1,3,9,10,1,2,8,0,23,12,0,3,3,21,31,14,0,2,8,0,1,3,1,2,6,2,0,0,12,2,11,2,3,7,0,2,5,5,0,0,8,3,19,5,21,20,3,29,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,1,22,104,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4072315199882501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060945850980368185,0.0,0.5780215547751473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06363294091366717,0.0,0.0,0.06484988588205805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07799023843630838,0.0,0.4479461693588701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145407087147865,0.0,0.07874626030493076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03853453469519222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866248524651215,0.06392210996678815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06739307126875305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051082578072234285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11169842846195507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05087138572090783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680268965752847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166167005819792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058778565342884725,0.07360498842969238,0.0,0.07151879254587085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859163695619783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15049819299141373,0.08182201471349422,0.0863321241316568,0.0,0.07249404393291248,0.060605988224671926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260849331114736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0586708951191418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12743149534578302,0.1745987193294124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887840909252402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348443395996147,0.08289560431952905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582177186670805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06113180886045413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346461426703141,0.0,0.1109649253984034,0.0,0.0,0.0541380561136736,0.0,0.0,0.04907733846979679
alcoholism,xperiaGIRL,2018/04/11,"I drank 1500 ML of beer every night for 4 years. Stopped one week ago cold turkey. Is my health at risk? hi all, online searches are failing me. 

While living in Japan I drank two to three 500ml cans of beer per day, never missed a day, for 4 years.

Moved to Korea in December, which removed me from that business and social routine, so I switched to one pint per day, trying my best to skip days here and there.

One week ago I decided to stop for good.

Have felt some involuntary facial muscle movements but all else seems to be ok.

One week into quitting, at middle age, do I have to worry about any heart issues / stroke risk etc... some online withdrawal information is downright frightening.

I've just found out that my brother did something horrible, possibly on multiple occasions, supposedly while blackout drunk.

alcoholism,C2H5OHThrowAway,2018/04/11,"Alcohol Rash How's it going guys/gals just have a quick question.  
  
I'm currently 22 and in college, always have had pretty good skin as it's almost never dry or red.  
Anyway I'm used to binging during the weekends, something I've been done since 2.5 years ago. Last weekend I got blacked Thur night, Friday night, Sat morning/night.  
However out of nowhere Sunday morning I woke up with dry red skin on my elbows. My upper skin seems way drier than usual, also have some faint red dots across my hands/torso.  

Is this actually caused by alcohol? If so, does anyone have some tips to get my skin back to normal.  
It just seems odd to me that this came out of nowhere as I've never experienced something like this.",4.61717391304348,5.958062746376811,5.097797101449277,83.09321739130434,70.08695652173913,7.259130434782609,26.84347826086957,7.554174236665415,1.47736,561,18,105,6,10,179,98,138,0.053,0.902,0.045,-0.0026,2,0,4,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,0,8,2,0,0,2,0,8,9,6,3,2,21,19,8,0,2,4,0,4,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,7,5,2,0,3,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,7,9,7,2,17,12,2,24,0,0,4,0,1,7,0,8,15,56,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.15493902310008753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407422108611818,0.3393589596053807,0.15898768953807005,0.0,0.0,0.12697028327742824,0.1321114102722042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11101739950380396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12208622551084833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18159340303595264,0.0,0.16310305793127905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13894285448591726,0.16247935680350106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08295206011882764,0.0,0.09023405104233284,0.1331708111318094,0.1269848447810905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12942075044078608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756820672406617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24491022677264504,0.0,0.0,0.4469916099194643,0.1555633055791287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1615286771197384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17786149811770305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2890809789832995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13133822415028884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24446160168695746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13712843262177532,0.17486543951572375,0.0,0.0,0.12602619284408645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224426220612733
alcoholism,ilovejameson,2018/04/12,"Pretty sure I'm doomed I live in a large city and im a bartender in the heart of downtown. Everyone i know drinks, lots. I feel like im missing out if i stay in on even a weeknight while not working. When i go out i have anywhere from 5 to 20 drinks. Ive only drank two nights this week and prior to that hadnt drank in 6 days because i was sick and on antibiotics. When i drink i even buy pedialyte to drink before i go out and another one for the next day.

I feel like it's a mental issue of not being able to stay at home all night for even a single night alone. I feel the constant need to be around people mostly, i have a full bar at home and never touch it because i do not drink alone. Does anyone have any tips to convince yourself to stay home and not go to the bars?",3.0851909628832743,3.2877754319526638,4.366315223238299,91.1225658956428,72.7869822485207,7.092200107584723,24.23937600860677,6.574015621080383,0.5553976331360948,604,15,142,4,11,200,97,169,0.087,0.833,0.08,-0.29600000000000004,0,2,5,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,6,6,0,0,10,0,9,11,1,0,3,25,21,10,0,2,5,0,4,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,4,10,9,0,4,7,1,3,6,2,0,2,4,4,15,4,25,15,5,32,1,2,0,0,0,13,0,3,15,87,19,1,0.10205762014743153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2114018310098388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06940268140517072,0.10701631329240924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0713610609649471,0.0,0.0,0.09085291940319054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12442675595458323,0.0,0.08684351784655693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102880307455806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13163744395766885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08931131114518291,0.0,0.0,0.4998880700135074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20222428673711704,0.0,0.0,0.0975204296340987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15481019770475302,0.1458199684508036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17400509234569372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12093877126298873,0.0,0.0,0.3071163428327671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22047948586954316,0.10652164003177267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05608819899568127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09972039614903858,0.0,0.09011874837246037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676573903431263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285007690017353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567443217191115,0.0787131283104091,0.0,0.10853943684525036,0.28732248880671873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915688468386913,0.07761941901461789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07075390355744902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382929006667953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3263395316361424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618809918663147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969546533183099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08186446686152092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07429916296771964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,RedditSetitGoit,2018/04/12,"Finally admitted to myself and family that I have a problem. I came to this sub today because I just openly admitted to my family and closest friends that I am an alcoholic. It’s one of the hardest things I’ve had to do. I cried the whole time. I need to make changes for myself and for my friends and family. My SO is leaving me because of it. Unfortunately I let it get to this point. I can only blame myself. But going forward I plan to care much more about myself and to realize that it was a coping mechanism that I WILL change. I’m dumping out all alcohol in the house and going back to the gym. It feels very lonely for some reason. But I know my loved ones are there for me. It’s nice to know that there are others I can talk to as well. As hard as this will be, I am looking forward to my life ahead. Maybe I can even save my relationship. I hope. I am happy to be an ear for anyone on here who needs it too. Good luck to us all. Lots of love.

alcoholism,purespringwater,2018/04/13,"Am I heading down a ""unhealthy future"" with alcohol influence? I love a beer, always had from the day that I could legally enjoy it. Socially with friends and what not, go too the pub, enjoy our time. 25 yo Moved overseas found a job, that was essentially encouraging alcoholism (backpacker bar). Had a blast, but left as it was having a negative outlook from my POV. I was full time, where as clienteal came and gone. Anyways, went back to my home city, and my best mates ended up on a rough drug passage that I didn't want too be involved in (smack) while I was away. I moved interstate, and didn't drink like i used too (6 days a week). But now, I being interstate, when I have no commitments, I will get demolished on my own. Part of me loves it, part of me is terrified about it. mon-fri i may have 4 or under beers for the week, but come Fri night-Sunday ill have easily 24 solo...This part makes me nervous. Anyone else have a similar tale? Is this how it starts?

alcoholism,SwampWight,2018/04/13,"Looking for some perspective  Sorry,  this is kind of a long post....
My wife's friend's husband has really gone downhill. 
  He's been drinking heavily for several years,  but they kept it under wraps until they couldn't anymore. (Started with ""we're really into tequila now"" to having a seizure on a plane and diverting the flight  (""work stress"")
  Then having a seizure and blacking out while driving, hitting a tree at low speed  (""seizure medication was making him depressed so he couldn't take it"") 
   Finally having a seizure in front of his coworkers which was the ""breaking point""

Fast forward another year,  he's on medical leave,  constantly at home drinking,  posting dark FB stuff regarding PTSD , but not getting any help.
   He was baker acted once when he sent a frightening text to his B-I-L  ""you might need to come take me out of I'm a threat to my family "" but was able to check out before treatment

The thing is,  I feel like no ones doing anything...i think he's beyond helping himself,  but his wife just tries to stay away from home as much as she can.  Her daughter is constantly coming over to our house (which is ok, our kids are friends) but she is scared of her dad and they basically just lock themselves in their room when they are there. 

I just want to grab the wife by the shoulders and say ""fucking do something""  

I just don't understand why it's going on so long.  She was enabling him to the point of buying alcohol for him so he wouldn't drive and go get it. 

I'm really looking for perspective from those who may have or are going through something like this.  I have no experience,  so I would appreciate some insight...",6.684966059306897,6.8002164051447,6.590777063236871,78.58358610217934,65.0128617363344,9.869310468024297,34.64112182922472,9.586721724236666,3.152397499106824,1286,54,242,23,18,407,185,311,0.098,0.846,0.056,-0.9227,0,0,6,0,0,0,50.0,2,1,5,2,13,12,2,2,14,1,30,7,1,1,0,39,55,22,0,6,11,6,2,2,2,4,3,1,3,1,12,12,3,1,4,3,2,12,7,6,0,1,9,6,28,6,41,39,3,51,0,2,3,1,41,20,1,5,19,157,40,1,0.10798416877460856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11540223633731422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07343293770166316,0.11323081627329848,0.0,0.0,0.1070912792126872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145468118521307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09188657421735248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860375996551545,0.0,0.2333850487331732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09300660633481783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21156675079341614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10562923759900487,0.10179786397578906,0.0,0.05460004029368007,0.07714391174883749,0.0,0.11829137866811328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16685660185790047,0.09982962399841168,0.11283454260505416,0.0,0.184109674832268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14475902424206696,0.0,0.21663385154377224,0.0,0.0,0.12459923253387332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244889472716314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11433964304920564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10551122074444738,0.0,0.0,0.1911251826038116,0.1813590105256237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208027116786374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2175653790593685,0.0,0.11455413847316913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938078886704109,0.08006889288393794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11499961552293808,0.0731728674139283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20415988611979927,0.0,0.20683796820964306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12622771467994276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075322708290528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08587334517674212,0.10811099093393554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219913742436792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16626297750371422,0.0,0.12087943614906367,0.07643175045013442,0.11509675616289845,0.0,0.0,0.12369550049089155,0.0,0.123616038260898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16238131224577612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07173988350877589,0.06919189514113816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07331416233095878,0.0,0.0,0.11241532796061816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369186051660451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743891645606446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861376095315803,0.0,0.0,0.07670885528032315,0.0,0.0,0.13907652858161046
alcoholism,throwaway991992993,2018/04/13,"Wanting to help my girlfriend Hello all. I am starting to get worried about my girlfriend.
Throwaway because she knows my main account.

Anyway, her brother killed him self last year and she has taken it pretty rough. She is on medication but not talking to someone about coping with it. 

Lately, she’s been blacking our every night in order to fall asleep. I’d be fine with a glass of wine or two to fall asleep or whatever, but she drinks to forget every night.

Her friends and I have started to notice and be worried for her. We think is becoming a habit and we’d like to stop it now while it’s fresh and new. I want nothing but for her to be okay, I just know there is a better way to go about it. 

What advice would you guys have with talking to her and getting her help? Thank you.

alcoholism,Princejpt,2018/04/14,"Anyone ever experience stomach bloating? First off I want to say that I’m not an alcoholic, just to set the proper context. I drink Maybe 2-3 times a month.

The other day I was drinking and I noticed my stomach got very bloated, which never happens.
I drank on an empty stomach(something I do often without a problem, I’m young, turned 24 a few days ago).

It’s as if you had a large meal and had a lot of gas and needed to burp. But I couldn’t burp no matter what happened. Eventually I started feeling sick and threw up and it was pure liquid and my stomach bloating went away.

So what happened? If it’s just liquid which tasted like what I was drinking, was the liquid taking forever to digest?

I just don’t understand why it seemed like my stomach wasn’t moving the fluids along.

The only thing out of the ordinary was that I was a little sleep deprived, I did drank the night before(it was my birthday celebration), and I drank a beer that was left out in the open over night.

Could those factors have caused the bloating?",3.485794556628619,5.420964164179104,4.460977465613112,84.13859525899913,74.02487562189054,6.321451565700908,27.246414983904014,7.048011613610866,1.4158244659057655,811,31,151,8,17,263,118,201,0.055,0.88,0.065,-0.4448,0,0,6,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,0,1,6,4,0,0,18,0,17,19,5,1,3,34,36,12,0,7,8,0,1,2,0,0,5,1,0,0,15,11,11,0,3,4,0,3,7,2,0,1,18,3,18,2,17,16,2,27,0,1,0,0,2,11,0,5,14,107,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12458898323316785,0.15020507163271174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982757400266491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205123348178546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14438343710488946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11221763794549357,0.0,0.0,0.181286082987346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4130561066226484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12713540789606925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748474642806485,0.0,0.0,0.07106623947467976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955165124161415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11241057391731854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3728633688925985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15270784962175574,0.0,0.0,0.13733113822552653,0.14086789778061876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11949047698078193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14120123987652972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11218556870655684,0.14938227327654338,0.0,0.1042159508593083,0.1084007276505852,0.0,0.0,0.26379307175799005,0.0,0.0,0.16001696339794333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10689451279104573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13448724798718034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11177090126668966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12795132683790933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406513776935832,0.0,0.0,0.10820215984730608,0.0,0.0,0.09948192440412787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10567601379230857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09337509118853927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08195576195040857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15287790327736728,0.0,0.1463173758572971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11596836583421424,0.0828999573574461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13029114154358978,0.126824400380919,0.0,0.0,0.13548506324814172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,Adam657,2018/04/15,"Do you think of alcohol more as a stimulant, or depressant, in regards to how you are affected? Hi guys, I'm sorry I know this is supposed to be a sub for support etc, but it is something I'm curious about.

I myself certainly have a bit of a problem with alcohol, in that I'll binge drink (obscene amounts sometimes, about once a week). I've managed to cut back the frequency of the binges, the amounts, and the behaviour whilst drunk. I've started running, which is helping some, and am contemplating stopping all together, but am not 'there' yet. I'm also a medical student, 14 months away from graduating (I've never been intoxicated/hungover at placement) and losing several days a month to alcohol and its after effects is not conducive to studying medicine and I'm aware it's a slippery slope!

Anyway I've read some papers suggesting that those who abuse alcohol tend to get more of a stimulating effect from alcohol, and that this increases your susceptibility to alcohol abuse.

It was previously thought that alcohol is only a depressant, and the stimulatory effects were an illusion caused by disinhibition of our inhibitory centres, though it's now thought it's far more complex.

A couple of years ago I went through a period of depression, and was prescribed fluoxetine (prozac). It helped, but one of the unusual side effects was that it made my drinking increase a significant amount. I even started to 'crave' alcohol, something that never happened before.

It also made me much more boisterous and energetic when drunk, and practically eliminated next day hangover 'fatigue, anxiety etc'. I'd even wake up and feel like drinking some more! Some of my behaviour during that period was some of the worst in my life, and I lost loads of friends through drunken escapades.

I notice though that alcohol in general does stimulate me. Whenever I see people drowsy after drinking, I was always curious as to how. Even when younger I'd be the one who wanted to carry on, as others got tired.

Studies suggest it does tend to be a 'magnifier'. Adolescents and males are more prone to being 'energetic' drunks. And drinking in the evening tends to stimulate more than drinking at lunchtime (there's a dip in alertness at around 2pm, so alcohol magnifies that and lunchtime drinking is more likely to cause drowsiness).

So I just wanted to ask. What was your drunk behaviour like? And congratulations to all of you who are sober now. I hope to be able to say I will be at some point.",7.184249538177344,8.362662109375005,7.529024014778327,68.59830357142859,64.06696428571429,11.179310344827588,39.55541871921182,11.067627440970053,4.881188331280788,1987,108,325,56,29,649,232,448,0.13,0.763,0.107,-0.9038,0,0,19,0,2,0,57.0,1,5,0,6,25,16,1,0,25,0,28,27,1,15,5,63,55,33,0,4,7,0,1,3,1,1,15,1,0,2,28,18,21,1,10,12,0,4,4,9,0,2,15,3,23,7,59,33,26,45,0,6,1,0,19,17,0,8,27,231,51,5,0.06196546099477849,0.14683787722329228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05492864238989765,0.662222329033803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910751354003984,0.051560227497239285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047403408054080345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055162397725985385,0.057929341307752076,0.0,0.0582185903828364,0.047647614605344966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052728043334700506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765023449260679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12731119522688958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06856360398881778,0.0,0.07992519213389236,0.0,0.16011228226776975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845278498880688,0.0,0.0,0.4249179289425095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382157376780948,0.16371041030748018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031331598932740234,0.044268137715954295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047874361452593835,0.0,0.03237439583968544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049559439810114486,0.0,0.0,0.061355548580730286,0.05479585251360504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306828465788234,0.0,0.0,0.0615456844308009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034054596825925786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04376803763700545,0.09081958273714393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06932350070208687,0.06764262056267442,0.0,0.0,0.11726643491085208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242368285510917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892047956210086,0.0,0.045551743668484905,0.0,0.0955831671373419,0.0,0.06590097075077495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07054808804686546,0.0,0.0659911936255674,0.08397880009759437,0.04712752535714226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042959048474615714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05857738964709042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059292577553700626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061982229728552385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049277421694538144,0.0,0.0,0.0493784497175584,0.0,0.0,0.07000333315686562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09540807846459698,0.06128542537657085,0.06936526039664165,0.08771894445316328,0.0,0.0,0.05180590002130697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031767081293956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03970496534980197,0.12176150162308015,0.09838730884138844,0.0,0.07122018192594466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07309766872891013,0.0,0.049704955111022915,0.0,0.0,0.057442603147548066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03990372526319527
alcoholism,Pibb1013,2018/04/15,"Fiancee's alcoholism is damagong our relationship and I don't know what to do. Hello all. Some background: My fiancee is very much a high functioning alcoholic. I tried to deny it for a while now, but its only becoming more and more obvious. She HAS to drink to deal with her stress, and nearly every time she drinks, we fight. At first I was ready to just chalk it up to me being way less tolerant of her liquored up antics but eventually she just got mad and uoset over the tiniest things when drunk and no matter how I responded, a fight ensued.

Tonight was one of those nights and I finally broke it to her that it's becoming a problem and a big strain on our relationship. But she just kinda brushed it off by saying that she ""knows she needs to quit"" and that she ""has shit to deal with"". And I have heard this the other times I hinted to her that it was becoming a nuisance. 

I know this isnt gonna be an easy road, but I need to know what I can do to help her and get her on the oath to recovery instead of this. I love her very much and DID NOT play the ""if you don't clean up I'm leaving you"" card, before anyone asks. I don't want to do that as I fear it will just make things worse. I don't want to patronize or belittle her, but something needs to be done. Any and all help is appreciated.",2.4380601554579218,3.943615159851305,3.786071307874284,89.69643714092602,75.84014869888476,7.418790131801286,23.37968908415005,8.150884317080207,1.0792884758364312,1014,30,227,17,22,333,147,269,0.188,0.715,0.097,-0.9757,0,0,5,0,2,0,28.0,3,2,0,2,8,11,4,3,11,0,24,8,1,2,3,45,41,23,0,7,12,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,1,0,22,15,6,0,4,5,0,0,7,9,0,2,7,3,36,2,33,29,8,23,0,1,0,1,36,13,1,4,9,166,58,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539860210604097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08080839788540461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308861979431291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11108990331746536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3937148219950127,0.10111548144579277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2450167910091825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12160423106837435,0.0,0.2328161001387992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10011930473356802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337166593431718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13017233264807088,0.0,0.10107664102150923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620837113387086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503911580359388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15929833661265794,0.12555029963473047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2612231924964839,0.0,0.0,0.12582369245709865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107248612280075,0.0,0.07931987217894823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747072791037167,0.2643325661583558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11151379901962608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08052220664824028,0.09037548360343144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11370415335626258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639021168882358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2551576551936145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09449829547859287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12197717118538096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09148105237404876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361192338635778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15789059330247768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13858132521422234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067769294950977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960942029915816,0.1401778920406966,0.09432163307868026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12109780658686255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

alcoholism,deadlegs12,2018/04/15,"When is it normal, when is it alcohol abuse, when is alcoholism I have a lot of alcoholism in my family, enough that my dad and some of his cousins wont drink at all.  I have never seen my dad drunk.

I am a college student and frequently drink.  Last semester I was blacking out almost twice a week.  It was always when partying and with friends, and I never did anything dumb, always got myself home, and got water and went to bed.  I realized that was too much and don't think I have blacked out this semester but still drink a lot.  I have never missed class or work due to my drinking.  I have never shown up to class or a work shift drunk, but I have hungover.  

The other weekend I was watching the masters and drinking with friends.  I ended up drinking a lot, like 12-15 full-flavored beers and didn't realize how much I had until I went back to my dorm and was with my 'girlfriend' (lack of a better word, and for simplicity) and she said: ""You're too drunk for us to do anything sexual"".  

I felt like I had drank too much so wanted to ease back and when I went out with friends again that tuesday for karaoke night I said I would have 2 beers, but ended up being talked into a 3rd.  I realized then that I wasn't really having fun or being fun when I wasn't drinking.  And not just drinking but like having multiple drinks and really feeling it a little and probably being at least buzzed.  

I went to a party last night and had like 10 beers and was grey-out on the walk back and fairly hungover this morning.  I don't really know where I am on the alcholol abuse spectrum.  Compared to my peers I feel very normal, but they are also college students who really like to drink.  

I went to a day drink with some friends today but I have work tonight so I couldn't drink much.  I ended up having 4 drinks over the course of 5 or so hours, and my friends made a comment about how I wasn't my usual fun self when only drinking that much.  

My spring break was a few weeks ago and that was a week long bender.  I stayed with 7 other guys in a condo and we all probably had close to 20 drinks a day for 6 consecutive days.  Some of them had more than 20 drinks some days.

alcoholism,maddie1560,2018/04/15,Frustrated and giving up I’ve been in therapy for 6 months now. I’ve been sober for that time but therapy isn’t helping. I try and be as open as I can be which is hard for me but I don’t feel any different or like I’m even working toward something. I’d still go back to alcohol in a heartbeat if nobody was looking. I’m thinking of telling him Tuesday is my last session.

alcoholism,Bren96,2018/04/15,"Trying to help my dad - please advise me My dad has gotten to the point where he was drinking 2-3 fifths of vodka a day. He gets BAD panic attacks where he needs to either be on the phone with me or have me come over during random times of the day or night. He says he’s gotten down to one fifth a day now. He also gets heart palpitations and says certain areas of his body will go numb. He needs it as soon as he wakes up and he can’t even function. He can’t drive, or go anywhere alone and he’s constantly saying his head feels like it’s filling up with pressure. He also has high blood pressure. He’s not himself at all right now, but he knows and admits that he’s an alcoholic but doesn’t know what to do. He doesn’t have insurance right now either. Am I able to just take him to a hospital to get help? I know that there’s rehab centers that will accept you without insurance, but if I took him to the hospital and we dealt with the bill later is there stuff they could do to help, or would they just send us out? Thanks.


Edit: I was also thinking of the hospital because he’s going to be going crazy being alone tonight, and I have work tomorrow and it’s hard for me to stay up with him all night when his sleep schedule is sporadic and he’s constantly needing to talk to me and have me up to relieve his anxiety.",4.367212276214836,4.447536130434784,5.235242966751919,86.44530690537088,69.94202898550725,8.088320545609548,26.74254049445865,7.724431198458867,1.307765814151748,1036,29,225,11,17,339,144,276,0.079,0.8240000000000001,0.097,0.8479,0,2,3,0,0,0,21.0,2,1,2,1,15,11,1,3,10,0,24,10,6,0,3,46,46,23,0,6,14,2,2,1,0,3,3,3,0,0,8,16,2,0,7,2,1,9,6,6,0,1,5,5,26,5,36,34,4,44,0,0,0,0,44,17,0,6,18,142,34,3,0.1120098422615579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197044570093784,0.0,0.2320168323640113,0.0,0.2687226911655794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568722274567149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274273658383736,0.0,0.0,0.09352353963416396,0.06828016020487708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12441768394118065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09648656107909304,0.0,0.24208569451854356,0.0,0.08943074472203698,0.0,0.0,0.2167112457469581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10972700282401547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07398144442377727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05663554176663596,0.08001985369228169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17556155863773695,0.0,0.2546310985002849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003388176911816,0.0,0.1149544130006332,0.0,0.0,0.1327322023863097,0.2252335086053414,0.11834454811641455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18467303998953494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05472235109332492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2491616362961621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21022729841533053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07590076795393391,0.0,0.0,0.13141941602521764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229531708788438,0.10588550571773032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19131158655998007,0.0,0.2672241669368002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11209073443006627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11938758846708525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822447126951167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421746158382695,0.09002926835242482,0.0,0.10312361375753126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177138416200429,0.0,0.0,0.06531383978200507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244470561291754,0.07604733037644952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13473404883253254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10797349085959952,0.0,0.08154449919719696,0.0,0.0,0.07956857822323701,0.0,0.0,0.0
alcoholism,dekudinner,2018/04/16,"Boyfriend and I wanting to make a change- need advice. Some background, my boyfriend is older than me by 8 years, meaning he’s been able to drink a lot longer than I have, so he’s dealt with this a lot longer than me. We only drink on the weekends together, however when we drink, it’s usually a whole three day binge with hard liquor. It used to be fun, but now it’s causing problems. We are always stressed out, he’s missed work a couple times due to being so hungover, it’s caused a lot of our friendships to fade, we never feel good etc. We’ve been talking about quitting, but this weekend was a serious wake up call. We drank at a friends house, and my boyfriend passed out drunk. He woke up a couple hours later, drank some water, and swore he was good to drive. Nope. We somehow ended up lost, downtown, and at a dang airport. I was honestly scared, but we miraculously made it home.

I don’t need to be lectured on drunk driving. This is why we want to quit. It’s gotten to the point where we’re putting ourselves and others in danger and ruining our quality of life and relationship. 

I’m not so much worried about myself because quitting things has never been hard for me, and I’ve only been heavily drinking for about a year. I’m more worried about my boyfriend because this has been going on for a long time. He has really bad depression and drinking is his way of not feeling anything anymore. I’ve always been able to quit things cold turkey, but i don’t think it will be that easy for him. Does anyone have any advice on this? Any advice for me to support him and help him through this? How do we go about attending AA meetings? Any advice or resources would be appreciated. This has to happen now before it’s too late.

alcoholism,TheCommonCop,2018/04/16,"Don't want my dad to go to his son's wedding So I'll keep this as short as possible:

My dad is an alcoholic and has been for the last 25 years or so. It's almost killed him twice but he has miraculously recovered and survived serious illnesses related to his alcoholism. He's not a violent or angry drunk. In fact he was a pretty functional alcoholic until he retired. However within the last 5 years or so it's gotten very bad. He falls constantly, pisses himself, can't remember hardly anything, doesn't make sense when he talks, and sometimes gets extremely angry if you cut him off and don't let him drink anymore. Whenever we have a large family gathering (my family is a family of drinkers) myself or one of his other kids always has to end up babysitting him, making sure he doesn't fall or do anything else harmful. It's annoying, embarrassing, and ruins the fun of spending time with family.

My brother is getting married soon and my dad plans on going to the wedding. I imagine my brother wants him there but at the same time I just know how miserable it is gonna be to go with him being there. I just don't want to be so embarrassed and burdened with his constant falling, pissing himself, or other alcohol related things he may do. I can't ignore it either because he doesn't have anyone else,almost the entire family has given up on him. It almost makes me not want to go to my own brothers wedding.

Anyone have any advice on how to handle this?",5.706771929824562,6.3244439754386015,6.939385964912282,73.51153508771931,67.14035087719299,10.263157894736842,33.026315789473685,10.25414643259724,3.5512105263157894,1163,49,205,28,18,395,155,285,0.173,0.733,0.094,-0.9683,1,0,6,0,0,0,27.0,1,1,0,2,12,17,6,3,11,0,28,9,2,5,2,45,46,26,1,5,14,7,1,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,11,11,6,2,3,2,1,7,10,15,0,2,4,1,28,2,29,36,3,29,0,2,0,0,37,10,2,10,12,142,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830288617649173,0.0,0.4300332941487966,0.3022021281270972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370532638958847,0.0,0.0,0.06840987033944274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09976586467490682,0.14068047023708768,0.0,0.16556663420513235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08399485874236103,0.06132341048840478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21742070278960526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854742601144086,0.0,0.0,0.08403645113687054,0.0,0.08909968328991548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4741726869016595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051162689525256,0.0,0.2286879135841728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011575963991426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08941583794358457,0.11129642536473107,0.0,0.05528585269590968,0.1640010675067443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10286794094205733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20144919264943487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06816758976045563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340876629929385,0.0,0.10234400353253127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139575582590905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09949367532067824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09481212051649447,0.0,0.0,0.08085660259994752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06683262691928138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11731862946741342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830036193762567,0.2373404663351826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12956321216755962
alcoholism,itsniamhalice,2018/04/16,"am i an alcoholic? i’m 17, female, ive been drinking since i was like 13 but i always drank the normal amount but these past few months i’ve been drinking more and more, haven’t been fully sober in over 2 weeks now, i wake up, have a shot of vodka to help me get through the first bit of the day and then i just carry on drinking throughout the day, it’s worse at night bc i get bored i guess, and then i cant get to sleep without being really drunk so i drink more. i didn’t think i was dependent until yesterday when i tried to cut down, i was shaking and i felt so sick, i couldn’t get to sleep at all. i’ve had friends tell me that they’re worried abt me and they think i have a problem but idk, i always make excuses by just saying that it’s just me having fun and i don’t drink as much as they think (even though i drink way more than they see). one of my friends told me today that i need help but i don’t think it’s that big of a deal compared to other people on here. my family’s got a big history of alcoholism so i know that increases my chances of becoming dependent and stuff. i feel like the reason i drink so much is to cope with anxiety and depression, drinking just makes me way more confident and i feel like i can do anything. am i an alcoholic or do i just like drinking??

alcoholism,absolutely_honest,2018/04/16,I think I'm in trouble. Last night I blacked out. I didn't think I drank as much as I did. But at a bar with buddies. There later. Then I remember waking in a room strapped down. I'm scared. Freaked out. And drunk. I thought someone had kidnapped me and they intended on hurting or killing me. Then I wake up. In a hospital.

alcoholism,Amartinezis24,2018/04/17,"Dont know what to do anymore... So not sure if this is the exact place to post this but I do feel its something that would help me if I just get it off my chest. I am 18 and for as long as I can remember my dad has been an alcoholic. Not that he drinks every single day but he drinks once a month for around a week straight. Have never gotten used to it because of what he does when he is drunk. He has been in jail because he hit my mother once and I never forget the stuff he has done. I kind of just wish he would disappear?( Is that so wrong?) He has really said some horrible things to me all my life and it has really shaped me to be who I am. Although I want to be normal I do actually feel lonely and sad most of the time. I want to be more out there but I just dont think its possible for me to do at this stage of my life. I am also very anxious and have to hesr everything at all times because I feel that my parents are going to get into an argument. Also I believe I have developed anger problems and I try to please people as much as I can. The past 2 years or so is when he began saying stuff rhat really hurt. He makes me feel like its my fault saying that I dont appreciate him enough and has told me multiple times that he is going to kill himself, or even kill me. The way he looks at me when he tells me he is going to kick my a** really does scare me and carries with me even if I dont think it does. I can go on for very long but I just felt the need to post this. I would love some advice on how you have dealt with this if you have. Anything would really help.

alcoholism,morningstaraway2,2018/04/17,"A question for those of you more familiar with alcoholism than myself Good morning/afternoon/evening r/alcoholism. In the last couple days I've been struggling with a question about alcoholism that was raised after a discussion with a friend.

My question is this: At what point does the behavior of an alcoholic cease to be a symptom of the disease and become the behavior of someone simply making bad decisions?

For example, drinking heavily is a symptom of alcoholism. When an alcoholic kicks his/her dog, hits his/her spouse, insults his/her friends, threatens violence or self harm and so on...can those also be considered ""symptoms"" of alcoholism? Are we able to say ""Well, Bob kicked his dog last night, but I forgave him. His actions aren't his own...he's an alcoholic you know""

Again, I'm not very familiar with alcoholism so this is new territory for me. I'm very open to discussion, and I'm interested to see what some of the responses are.

alcoholism,badhouseelf,2018/04/17,"35 weeks pregnant, and my husbands drinking has gotten worse Using a throwaway because of sensitive information.

I want to preface this by saying my husband is never violent or anything like that when he drinks. But he has made stupid choices, like driving drunk. 

Up until about a month ago, his drinking was getting so much better. He could say no. He could stop. Now it seems like every night, he has 1 beer, which turns into 3+. We had agreed a few weeks ago, that with my due date approaching quickly, it would be best for him to be sober until baby is here. Or at least sober enough that he can drive me to the hospital (ie-1 beer, but not more)

He won't stop. Every night he says he will. Then the next day he gets off work and buys a beer. And another. And another. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm already dealing with the physical and emotional shitstorm that is pregnancy. I'm so overwhelmed i straight forgot to pay electric for 2 months and came home to no lights yesterday. And now I have the added fear that when labor starts, he'll be too drunk to drive me to the hospital. Also that if I get a ride and he goes he'll make an ass of himself in L&amp;D. But I can't bear the thought of having this baby without him there supporting me.

I don't know what to do. I told him last night that I can't continue to try to take care of him, and that he needs to make a plan for his own sobriety (he talked about AA last night, but he's rejected that in the past due to Christian emphasis on all the meetings in our area, which would be pretty unhelpful for him as he's very much an atheist). And that frankly, for the next 5 weeks I need him to be my support person, not the other way around. I know sobering up will be tough for him, and I want to support him in any way I can. I just can't do it all right now. I need to see him trying. I need some of the weight off of my shoulders.

Any advice, or good thoughts would be appreciated.

alcoholism,heyhelppleas,2018/04/17,"I'm afraid Hi, I don't know if this is the right place for this but, I think I might have a problem in the future. 
 
Some backstory: I'm 21 years old, Native American, and I come from a family of people who not only have a medically documented history of mental health problems (i.e. bi-polar or depression) have also been prone to using and abusing things like alcohol and hard drugs. My father died of a drug overdose due to addiction. I feel as though I am genetically predisposed to addiction and other mental problems. 
 
In the past I have had a couple drinks and have been drunk once. I was young so I didn't care at all for the feeling. But now that I am old enough to drink legally and want to casually have a beer or something, I'm afraid that once I start I won't be want or be able to stop. I'm afraid I'll use it as an emotional crutch.
 
Any advice or comments would be more than helpful, thank you.",3.3926785714285685,4.732412538043482,4.927018633540374,83.14717391304347,73.07608695652173,8.300621118012423,25.642857142857146,8.841846274778883,1.803572670807453,713,23,147,14,14,240,117,184,0.162,0.727,0.111,-0.9287,0,0,7,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,0,4,11,0,3,11,0,21,11,0,2,1,31,37,18,1,7,8,1,3,1,0,3,7,0,0,0,8,7,5,1,4,5,0,1,4,7,0,0,5,3,14,4,18,26,4,16,0,1,0,0,6,5,0,7,11,94,22,1,0.12083032802033393,0.14316418038264084,0.0,0.2634457855368861,0.0,0.11807399810380635,0.0,0.12913087380449972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662796966306593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08216876650232724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12319457233595248,0.0,0.0,0.10408462854109407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13369645972493008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407098446949956,0.0,0.12540280383654334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23673544174723296,0.2802496388266614,0.0,0.0,0.13591785570534584,0.0,0.12485002882765182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11390807963376402,0.0,0.12219088878443288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10824024041107806,0.0,0.0,0.12843698840474613,0.0,0.0,0.08099002187802795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06640518829390411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05903159489511778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12172384348525575,0.2435371020960907,0.12818188337117156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535822068167731,0.2573607117327049,0.0,0.0918969092825751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153462203320086,0.08376853549216133,0.0,0.12624197535688333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3468549162696507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031884399236694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302108974577332,0.0,0.0,0.08552432808307762,0.0,0.0,0.10101956464893597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11124433197457674,0.0,0.0,0.08027430089867224,0.07742319528062303,0.11871518379089395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087172161121931,0.0,0.0,0.14253771614448538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858343982341718,0.0,0.0,0.07781076966717733
alcoholism,nontradcheckingin,2018/04/17,"Not drinking is hard Been working at a liquor store for some time now, I may have not been worst alcoholic, but after downing a pint a night for 2-3 weeks straight I decided to quit. I found the best way for me personally to not drink is to workout extremely hard. I do Brazilian jiu jitsu 2-3 tines a week for 2 hours, and by the time I get home it’s about 10, and it would take so much effort to stay awake that I don’t even want to drink. I also got put on trazodone (non toxic with alcohol) which is an ssri to help me sleep. I think by making myself exhausted with this combination has really been working for me, I have also lost 8 pounds in a about 3 weeks. I would totally recommend this strategy.

alcoholism,bforsyth927,2018/04/18,"18 years I'm 18 years old, grew up in a rough household with an alcoholic father who I drank with and still drink with quite a bit. Drank since I was 16, struggle to go without 4 - 6 pints of beer (imperial UK pints) every evening. I'm in university, I went a few years early (another thing I think has contributed) I'll be graduating with a degree when I'm 19. I'll be financially secure, etc, but there are emotional problems that have sort of fucked me over ever since I found out my dad was cheating on my mom when I was 12. Haven't really recovered.

Does this qualify, haha

Edit::

Should say its had noticeable health consequences on me, put on about 15 lbs of weight, indigestion, etc. Also been smoking since 15 and the beer just makes me want to smoke more. Don't see myself escaping the cycle anytime soon. Lack of a girlfriend used to be my justification for getting drunk every night with my single mum, but starting to care less about that",4.819694816053513,6.043618603260871,5.706086956521741,79.36232441471574,69.48913043478261,9.13979933110368,28.28428093645485,9.466822959209583,2.429946989966555,749,26,145,16,13,246,126,184,0.126,0.8029999999999999,0.071,-0.9111,0,0,5,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,1,11,7,2,1,8,1,14,10,0,3,1,23,31,7,0,4,4,4,2,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,6,8,8,1,3,4,0,4,3,4,0,0,9,4,14,3,25,18,8,24,0,0,1,1,7,8,1,1,12,87,20,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15405188877638315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11527623717437932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1511532329720814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15737382964655866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469699382975206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261461267468969,0.0,0.0,0.14121155099084384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621486928179898,0.0,0.0,0.3215294096017223,0.09520933081877644,0.130391400928436,0.2429042028815592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15805239608313013,0.0,0.13326381377774765,0.07531212114780934,0.0,0.0819234359462925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15322409017735691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962208555860791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16882605569663356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352744634675578,0.0,0.0,0.16411506735266618,0.15126056522838324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13793152483841284,0.0,0.14490997902355496,0.0,0.1533206493193509,0.0,0.0,0.09234580807087887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463340260890575,0.0,0.0,0.1148684227386003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3577256635112664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202969970973796,0.0,0.11511791110016395,0.0,0.0,0.15069626946880146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576646784228024,0.0923651262992314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12449881432271186,0.0,0.0,0.08502306128267202,0.0,0.0,0.1755351565566987,0.0,0.13362795428573188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13895489458172533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784824964288688
alcoholism,TinyTim86753099,2018/04/18,"Am I past the point where withdrawal would set in? Hi all, I created a new account to ask this question. Some quick background, I've gotten into a habit of drinking every night after work. Never in the morning and never during the day but from about 8pm-11pm I'll generally have 6-12 drinks, usually shots while I'm doing stuff around the house. I've gotten very tired of this routine and have decided to cut way back on my drinking during the week. Monday 4/16: 9 drinks between 7pm-10pm. Tuesday: 1 beer at 10:00pm. Wednesday: Nothing yet, maybe 1 beer later tonight. I had a little trouble getting to sleep last night (tossing and turning) but other than that, I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms that I'm aware of. I'm just wondering if I'm ""out of the woods"" so to speak or if there could still be bad stuff to come. I've been drinking like this about 5 days a week for the last couple years. Any insight is greatly appreciated.

alcoholism,Beversalus,2018/04/18,"Need some advice on quitting Went through a bit of a rough patch two years ago (dating sucks). Decided to start drinking to help me sleep. Spent about a year and a half doing that, to the point that I’d knock out 3-5 beers at the bar and a six pack to go to sleep. I managed to not drink for three days last summer, but fell back in because of peer pressure.

For the most part, had it under control until the last few months. I could drink and wake up fine the next day and go to work. Now I am on a very mild anti anxiety medication, but I constantly worry I’m going to die while I’m not drinking. My main issue when I don’t drink is I can’t sleep well, sometimes at all.

I don’t feel a compulsion to drink per say, but I drink when I’m bored. I’m on vacation right now, but when I get back I plan to seriously cut back, and that scares the fuck out of me for some reason. I’m worried about the withdrawal. Some days when I am really hungover I get dizzy, get pains all over (usually dull), and I sweat. I also get the shakes, and on severe hangovers I can have panic attacks.

I guess I came here to ask, am I going to be okay when I stop? Should I go to rehab? My job will likely fire me if I need to miss more time, I just started. I didn’t have severe withdrawal at all last time, but being the idiot I am I googled what could happen and scared the shit out of myself.

TLDR: I drink between 8-12 beers a night, will be looking at quitting, been doing that for approximately two years. How concerned should I be with withdrawal?",2.121408653846153,3.5139291312500016,3.6281250000000007,90.97206730769231,76.4375,6.5480769230769225,21.99519230769231,7.1686216300943375,0.507221153846154,1182,31,266,13,26,391,171,320,0.221,0.725,0.054000000000000006,-0.9958,1,0,10,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,0,5,17,20,6,5,18,1,26,21,6,3,3,42,55,23,1,7,9,0,3,1,0,4,3,1,0,0,6,13,11,2,3,11,1,9,6,16,1,5,6,5,33,4,43,39,12,60,0,2,1,1,3,17,3,6,35,174,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07554551996478218,0.06852981828412368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06182402839378561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059141220293326524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07227353636304984,0.08795021793171909,0.0,0.17833768841755268,0.0,0.04712688621413221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440147207259854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08842097076280768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08354363072239596,0.08670868597530756,0.1234499895112872,0.0,0.0,0.14957384676596375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802346001068278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6058675856868636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03908978427266991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714709814338975,0.1615631748699454,0.0,0.21968260563529865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851646469269552,0.0,0.06836414759399975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05181863418697488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08069057447664157,0.07671731436033223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18905160979707625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03776930232159464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492014071070278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788074593799131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06170735516135676,0.0,0.0,0.11464737875466112,0.0,0.0,0.08221906374894425,0.07254931697433277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226229192151754,0.09070552627241432,0.0,0.0837181796791661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308205142917776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16445540571443856,0.0,0.0,0.04952616428297146,0.07948659082645312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06602151594405095,0.0,0.06147926850742477,0.15479971408011126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17467446824810956,0.07935664046745637,0.0,0.0,0.2320946789503988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07646063841719952,0.0,0.10943950299700132,0.0,0.0,0.06463383692072824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09015907069868766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510394388960231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514500888440388,0.06378807203564821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06951013055728146,0.07166627435511673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056281917375762186,0.15702220885062815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493535024078425

alcoholism,KaiBlueAn,2018/04/19,"Been some days off the booze. Feeling better but I'm not sure I can quit cold turkey. I've been drinking for five years now, during my college years. I've been working downtown some clubs at night and I was drinking more at the time, like maybe four times a week. Now I have been on a fitness lifestyle, eating right, doing calisthenics and taking care of my body, though I still drink on weekends.. To the point I'm social, like 8-9 drinks. I've never been to the point of needing alcohol in the morning or having the chills, shaking etc. So I guess I'm not an alcoholic yet. I enjoy drinking now and then but getting wasted seems to have a tiredness effect on me for the next 2-3 days.. You guys think I'll be Allright? 

I'm thinking about cutting out completely or just having it in check, like drinking on weekends. Other than that swim used other kind of drugs that helped abstain from alcohol, like getting high. Not the heavy stuff but right now he's clean. It's hard to completely quit alcohol though, point being I enjoy it somehow.

alcoholism,corrinator,2018/04/19,"How do I help my Alcoholic dad? My father has drank a substantial amount my whole life (23 years). Before my mother died 6 years ago he was sober for 6 months thanks to a hospital program and AA, but mostly because he lost his license and job. After my mom died he went back to drinking, and it’s just been getting worse and worse. The last two years he’s been in the hospital half a dozen times to detox for a week. This past summer he was sober for 3 months, (longest time since the 6 months) until his Dr said it would be ok if he drank beer.... it’s been downhill since then. Anyways anyone have any advice?

alcoholism,SHPLUMBO,2018/04/19,"How do I know if I’m doing enough for my dad without hindering my own life too much? Is that selfish? I’m scared of losing my dad and I want to do everything I can to make sure he knows that I’m there and that I love him. Don’t want a doubt in his mind about me. I just don’t know how to do that for him, and I also don’t know how to tell if I’m accomplishing it.

He’s been drinking with my mom for years while they’ve been trying to quit. It got a lot worse when I moved out. He’s been in and out of detox “rehab” as well as at least one clinic/hospital that I know of. He made some friends at one place and realized he has the ability to socialize and connect, something he never really felt before. That gave us all (him included) a lot of hope on the matter as he also was trying to get into a VA program that takes care of him for a month.

While waiting for the system to get back to us on whether he’d get in or not, he got himself hurt while drunk and went back into treatment but the insurance ran out and he was sent back home, where it got even worse, and he ended up at a local hospital. Basically he’s a step a way from serosis and that scares the daylights out of me; I don’t want my dad to die a painful death even if it is his own choice in the end. 

It has been his choice, like many I’m sure, he finds excuses for his habits but it’s his choice to continue just as it is his choice to stop. But I want to do all that I can to influence him to choose life. He has no interests and no family but my mother and I, and he practically raised me. I can’t turn a blind eye and just hope the situation fixes itself. I feel like he needs me and I want to be what he needs, but I don’t know what that is. Is there any advice you can give me on how to help someone find the will to live?

I’m really scared of living a reality where I’ve lost him and I live my life blaming myself for not doing more.",2.876085034915583,2.9492774128878345,4.599692389286663,89.72523115000445,73.20047732696898,8.212180677097145,23.633076991072226,8.167268648758528,0.9168084681340054,1472,34,362,21,27,502,179,419,0.136,0.77,0.094,-0.9783,0,0,2,0,0,0,32.0,2,1,0,4,22,20,0,4,19,0,32,11,1,7,5,80,74,40,2,12,16,5,2,2,1,1,7,0,1,0,20,23,2,2,12,2,0,5,12,9,1,2,16,4,47,11,57,55,11,42,0,3,2,1,47,21,0,10,16,242,67,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08513261501677885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13933959844311547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05924455915261088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20096961114453227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413266787265428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08882460378459278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090416762305747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08534439227413848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15432484905923854,0.09001820561436198,0.0,0.11508382169221752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829780104284796,0.0,0.08212894326010978,0.0,0.04405046860655015,0.062238515656772936,0.08364882225544258,0.0,0.15925212725215654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730866371528899,0.0,0.1365497474916801,0.0835734025115026,0.0,0.0,0.20903336777036235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05839467167598503,0.0,0.0873884215580841,0.17305955216059096,0.0,0.0,0.0932637172777185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2872731043716256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.184606209089878,0.08512482210713761,0.0,0.23078555801939254,0.0,0.0,0.09746494897783242,0.09510172589523416,0.1481325463098132,0.07862916380637654,0.08243501106872435,0.0581532487000587,0.08832596375461803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796632283092434,0.1020338422910126,0.06953831958671294,0.09259472835463582,0.0640431935423961,0.12919669045568055,0.06719228265906234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180694769282652,0.0,0.09270177810434273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09102181394388448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266279951903324,0.0,0.0,0.11162255231350593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2616668295413105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979264833750828,0.0,0.0888078262686778,0.07381645799991708,0.06706920023836194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283618615895103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16421905945596574,0.0,0.06550336647096698,0.0,0.07614668357056982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11829746603865555,0.09476149756529978,0.0,0.0,0.20958916620895607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25692804319269075,0.06915176784256016,0.0,0.0,0.0783313052482495,0.0807610742133383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08398053097202554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1775653608616494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05610239684110024
alcoholism,Quitalcoholbro,2018/04/20,"Drinking 4 tall boys a night for the last three years :/ With the exception of maybe 10 days not drinking. :( plus smoking half a pack/1 pack of cigs. This is a vent more thananythimg cuz I feel like I can’t stop. I called a hotline earlier and redirected me someplace that wasn’t open...
But tonight I’ve realized that I’ve gotten fat in the face and look bloated in the stomach...
Sometimes my heart beats too hard or I think it skips beats... but I try to rub it off as me being too aware of my heart. 
Sometimes it just hurts to breathe out. Sometimes my heart pangs and my elbow does too. Before that, my eyelid used to twitch. 
This is so damn stupid but I have no one to talk about this to.
I’m afraid I’ll get judged everywhere for talking about this. I’m always paranoid. Or irritable. It’s SO stupid!
I wish I wasn’t addicted. It’s probably my fault. Or definitely is?
But man whatever I just wanted to talk and I guess this is where I’m gonna be for awhile.

alcoholism,alantesmith,2018/04/20,"Does alcohol from the night before show up on employment drug test? Hi everyone, I have a urine drug test tomorrow for the job I'm beginning in a month or so. I read online that if they want to be thorough they can technically check for alcohol up to 80 hours before the drug test. I drank a few beers throughout the day today but stopped drinking at around 7pm when I remembered about the test, and plan to stay sober until the test tmr (2pmish). Have any of you ever had any problems?
