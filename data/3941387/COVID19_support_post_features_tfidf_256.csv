COVID19_support,thatreddittherapist,2020/02/15,"Welcome to COVID19 Support! Hi everyone,

I'm a counselor (I mostly work in person, but sometimes online) who made a post in the r/China_Flu sub earlier in the week about a group therapy startup.

It had come to my attention that a lot of news about the epidemic had been causing spikes in anxiety and problems with people's mental health, which really exacerbates the problem.

And with more and more cities going into in lockdown and more people forcing quarantines it seems that mental health is CRITICAL at this point in time.  So hence comes this sub.  It's all about promoting support and encouraging people to rely on each other in this grim timeline.

I know there have been a few others involved in the mental health sector who are interested in general support of people too and want to lend a hand to those who need the support.

Post your concerns here for the time being, and I might cross post some posts concerning anxiety and worries from the main subs r/China_Flu, r/COVID19, r/Coronavirus.

This is seperate from mental health subs like r/depression, r/SuicideWatch and r/anxiety but some information from there will be cross posted here and those subs are always open for additional help.

We are still very interested in getting group therapy sessions going but this is a first step in that process.

Thanks everyone for supporting it and for supporting each other.",9.341416510318947,9.23838105284553,8.578617886178861,67.26222326454038,59.609756097560975,11.959474671669795,39.65478424015009,11.362043627235082,4.775401876172608,1113,51,175,27,13,350,134,246,0.09,0.72,0.19,0.9807,0,2,0,0,0,1,27.0,1,1,0,3,10,15,0,0,15,0,15,5,1,2,1,42,33,15,0,4,3,0,1,1,0,2,4,0,0,1,21,21,0,0,4,0,0,7,0,3,0,1,5,1,6,12,33,24,12,34,0,1,0,0,14,16,0,6,7,124,27,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06769097981405335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867010655380388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357041817423921,0.0,0.14015425860349148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07006794314829798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15546972316253202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06919755955403947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425028104345284,0.0,0.09246788472035443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3458914373706081,0.0,0.0,0.054528207621522086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04470866670328202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03974424241443288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06916215134751827,0.0,0.07697677321964408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32793278378511304,0.08630110460159271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06032111970995197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2255955975587464,0.07103300754234633,0.0,0.0,0.07690347953514062,0.0,0.3895613324834664,0.0,0.0,0.15568483170581987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05211586548142358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405936653263623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08045873134061045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496742726853183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5539004306167734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07489754774684043,0.18606510111182256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487344857995636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06712352207482004,0.04798323299337606,0.0,0.06525528059896228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059224873911754385,0.0826164153082718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Varakari,2020/02/21,"Constructive Action, Not Pink Glasses There is a disconcerting tendency going around where people react to COVID-19 by downplaying it. *It's probably going to be fine. The previous few epidemics were contained too. The Chinese have been posting improving numbers. Don't worry!*

It's a bit like these deranged Hollywood movie parents, stopping to tell a child that everything is okay when they themselves have no damn clue what will happen next. It sure looks like helping, but how exactly is not obvious.

Can we say with any confidence that the worst is behind us? I don't think so. Then, how do pink glasses improve health, physical or mental? It's unclear!

So should we not pay attention, search for the best course of action, and follow it? If we don't know enough, research and analyze. If there are potential future problems, prepare now. And for every bit of information on viral spread, we should start thinking about hygiene and safety protocols, so we can start training early.

I am not willing to throw my hands in the air and just wait for whatever happens! Which I also doubt is good for mental health anyway. It creates helplessness when we need agency and responsible action.

Therefore, I want to invite anyone to gather and discuss information and constructive action here. For example:

&amp;#x200B;

* What are effective hygiene measures to slow down viral spread?
* What supply shocks could happen, and how can we prepare – or dampen their effect?
* Which parts of the population are most at risk, and what can we do to shield them?
* Which regions of the world are most at risk for the next outbreak?
* What are good methods to organize when assembling in person has become dangerous?

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, the health organizations keep repeating to wash hands and keep a distance, especially from coughing people. Is this all we can do? What about, for example, setting up protocols to disinfect doorknobs and other places of frequent touching? What are effective ways to get less cautious people to pay attention?

*Also, does anyone know the relative effectiveness of different types of disinfectants?

COVID19_support,ToxicSamurai,2020/02/26,"One way I dealt with pandemic panic from SARS-CoV-2 One way that I've learned to deal with pandemic panic is by preparing a prepper stash of food/water. I allowed myself just $40 to spend on food and water that would last until I could get to a sustainable situation. For me, knowing that I have the supplies that I need to survive until help comes or I learn to help myself is very helpful. Even the process of choosing what items to buy to get the most out of my small budget and compiling it into a shopping list was very therapeutic. I suggest getting your supplies before (if this does strike your area) they run out in the shopping spree for supplies that comes with the virus. And even if this virus does just pass over, you'll still be ready for the next grocery-rush level situation. If people make fun of you for be afraid, then just tell them it's better to be safe than sorry and that while they're begging for food, you'll be bunkered down, waiting it out safely. Make sure when you're budgeting to take into account sales tax, as that will make a difference.",9.449292929292929,6.9790385119617255,8.541307814992027,75.18693248272197,61.00956937799042,11.202764486975012,37.57628920786816,9.150863307647796,3.229382349813928,855,30,164,10,9,267,125,209,0.045,0.833,0.122,0.945,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,5,2,2,7,8,0,3,10,0,13,3,0,4,1,37,25,14,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,13,14,3,3,4,2,9,4,0,3,0,2,1,0,18,5,36,15,2,26,0,0,0,0,13,12,0,5,8,109,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10883787214426444,0.0,0.0,0.11312172162658515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22035794301568176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021218640653715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13186460565562058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13363367099348436,0.0,0.0,0.22386133828965854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16896030630824285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4639902885424102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20047550405660267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2571964017548153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702933319891537,0.10425977824956384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25613306636946154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09484005689254583,0.0,0.0,0.1360285907676664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17334369587417642,0.0,0.0,0.3001382976423031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08867333452221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875415220567347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14317935703362045,0.0,0.0,0.10214522754114833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205491014259907,0.0,0.09616876377945396,0.0,0.11179474917724568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2110703078130596,0.0,0.20305032809360696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908601572584915,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,InquiringMind886,2020/02/27,"I’m not ready to die For the first time in my life I’m scared that this virus will kill me. I always get my flu shot and don’t worry much about getting a random ailment that will pass. 

It’s different this time around. I became chronically ill about 5 years ago and have fibromyalgia along with unknown illnesses and ailments. I’ll be having my 7th weeklong visit to the Mayo Clinic in April. It is highly possible that I have mixed connective tissue disease, lupus, or systemic sclerosis. I’ve had a dry, reflexive barking cough that can only be shortly remedied by inhaling nebulized lidocaine, and I’m out until I see pulmonology at Mayo. 

I won my disability case (at age 40) last October. While that was a high point, this is a low point. I am weak and I am tired. I have barely enough lung strength to talk (I used to sing professionally until my voice gave out due to muscle weakness) and am often hoarse (still working on an answer for this too, I have several voice related problems now). My grief is huge on the daily. 

I guess my point is, is that I’m a very sick individual who cannot handle a respiratory illness like this. It crosses my mind every day that this virus could kill me in probably 3 days. I’m not ready to die, my husband needs me, and I still have life yet to live. If I knew my husband and I could literally hole up in our house until this passes, I’d feel so much better. But he teaches and needs to work. 

Anyone else a sick person who is genuinely afraid that their body won’t be able to fight it appropriately?",5.031633663366335,5.823860570957098,6.012889438943898,78.9369579207921,68.70297029702971,9.096303630363037,29.011386138613855,9.255337874911486,2.3669908910891087,1215,42,237,23,20,403,182,303,0.162,0.765,0.073,-0.9807,1,0,0,0,1,2,34.0,1,0,1,6,10,14,3,2,11,0,28,16,2,1,0,32,44,17,5,6,5,2,1,1,0,3,14,2,0,1,21,14,0,0,3,1,0,4,5,10,0,1,5,5,29,4,31,31,3,44,0,2,1,0,12,20,0,5,20,146,50,4,0.12085311715730634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071289965001222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055947481624157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450330949132442,0.12382830028830122,0.0,0.1075848966187502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688476110124352,0.0,0.13424056877673785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19298276028492944,0.0,0.0,0.15588052527506324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25085291072556,0.12626578515459894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10095727185164607,0.0,0.0,0.12487357609806465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10182396355723317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06110696726460665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279759971616126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12628153137245945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13313333364967636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553759071465119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13944827114942282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674121365111711,0.0,0.0,0.09851142053388193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17072426139897945,0.05904272851631873,0.0,0.106715516581648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220271969778278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776818932970055,0.17922211009571098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191424144816047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105524280379725,0.0,0.0,0.34273577667979604,0.13624373108033624,0.0,0.0,0.13030010071217604,0.11564011154955935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12099505327121282,0.0,0.09630428746854801,0.0,0.0,0.13652962291560328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930269109483209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097137157736328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14094084897889778,0.13890287996059847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043782905534646,0.0,0.0997164784170985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17596501728839506,0.12273220682315365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782544512421635
COVID19_support,ThreeEyedPea,2020/02/27,USA Press conference only stressed me out further. I'm more scared now than ever. It's become clear as day now that our government has absolutely no plans in tackling this virus. I think it's only a matter of time before it starts to kick off in the states. I hope we can somehow turn this around because I'm really scared for the coming weeks.,4.487058823529414,5.888938294117647,4.984588235294119,83.54864705882355,70.47058823529412,7.792941176470588,25.364705882352943,8.238735603445708,1.5143611764705889,276,8,53,4,5,88,55,68,0.157,0.7509999999999999,0.092,-0.6887,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,2,0,0,1,5,4,0,3,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,10,9,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,0,1,5,1,10,9,1,15,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,2,7,32,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21468429742406536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14700942390370375,0.2663432264866226,0.20521013234570445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20773872990523293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555288060988796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21814380759001686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23952715194041535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3668274073542251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15449382431756087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4828881900657152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17069490030377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2762489541318693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15452614356452585,0.0,0.0,0.14062283876430548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26231376820347085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934446979536918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Iforgotmyquestion,2020/02/28,"Something happened to my brain recently To preface, I have anxiety and depression issues. Before the virus, I was wishing I could just disappear from life. Embarrassing to admit but that's what depression does sometimes.



When I first heard about cv19, I was worried. Next, terrified. Depressed, couldn't stop checking certain subs all day. Felt hopeless and truly like the end was here. I was watching one of my worst fears playing out, in real time. I was in a very very dark place in my head. 



I prepped and worried, cried and was pissed off and nearly paralyzed from it all, since mid January at least. And then I realized I was not helping anyone, including myself, with the fear I was pouring out everywhere. It was making me sick, emotionally and even physically. My family started being afraid, too. 



So I unsubbed from all the subs but one scientific one and here. I turned off the news. I started getting my garden ready, took my dog for some walks. And it was like a light went on in my brain. 



We are all only here for such a small amount of time in the grand scheme of things and life is beautiful. Being aware and prepared (and washing the hands a lot) is good, but so is the business of living. 



And you know what? Call me an idealist but I believe in us. We can be shitty and downright awful sometimes, but we can also be helpful, kind and sometimes even brilliant. Determined af, too.



Wishing you all wellness, peace and happiness.",3.726525496974936,6.312909876404498,4.236722846441952,82.97802290406223,75.70411985018727,7.1039469893402485,28.995822529530397,8.139509932561175,2.270854335926246,1135,50,200,20,26,358,158,267,0.207,0.586,0.207,-0.2313,0,0,1,0,0,1,44.0,4,2,0,1,15,19,1,4,13,1,23,9,5,1,6,49,37,26,0,4,7,0,2,2,0,0,4,1,1,0,7,22,0,1,4,2,1,4,2,10,1,4,14,5,31,9,27,17,10,32,0,4,1,0,11,16,1,2,14,151,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08653306454004811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277802604551797,0.0,0.0,0.07566082037747783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207615071704396,0.12191218620854052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24158950074102184,0.11049140151488374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08639445040532374,0.0,0.11886026142377867,0.06978453562457393,0.0,0.2795954809124304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469263739719297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171826253730332,0.09583924650987168,0.0,0.0,0.14293934934904476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020078890299711,0.24352582024073025,0.0,0.0,0.10389564798242552,0.0,0.0,0.09204078247561236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05653366903426076,0.0,0.0,0.09075886181446367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956870548502076,0.1151883179880844,0.0,0.0,0.111051555745449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450576849479243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11293995021622752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126808945382142,0.0594677137941235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15285954779217134,0.10572890703950497,0.0,0.09554872560822916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09199368545289548,0.0,0.0,0.07222898413949433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11507932651190472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2199715037519852,0.08229626690603595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305323954660165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231632067562594,0.0,0.0,0.10684131600263977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950991313565608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330300212893048,0.321058342403026,0.0,0.15317888242012734,0.0,0.0,0.09046586136555462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07188789420696233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12619269378480855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12022191084573687,0.0,0.11769809697100997,0.0,0.0,0.13015964628216245,0.0,0.0,0.17856414399876985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729104961243533,0.10030893335865942,0.0,0.0,0.2488653210963629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21977883495631464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,_axon,2020/02/28,"Going to a rave in Southern California?  Hi all, I bought tickets to a rave a long time ago. It’s for Beyond Wonderland on March 20-21. Reading about the virus and seeing people freak out in the coronavirus sub is making me paranoid.. None of my friends seem to be as concerned about this as I am so they’re all still planning on going. Should I still go? I feel like if I asked the coronavirus subreddit, they’d tell me to stay home.

COVID19_support,camelboy787,2020/02/29,"anxiety + feeling of “losing control” while prepping i’ve posted this in comments before on r/coronavirus but thought it might be useful to some who are anxious and feel like they are “losing control” when prepping.

so the problem lies with the fact that a lot of people who prep just have bad anxiety and are prepping to quell their anxieties - and it works! for a little bit. every thing you prep then won’t be enough, there will be always something you need to buy until it’s no longer financially feasible (but some do go into debt) i think inherently the stigma around prepping is that a lot (but certainly not all) the people who do it have unchecked anxiety, which the prepping soothes (while secretly exacerbating) but doesn’t cure. 

for example, if i have OCD and am afraid of leaving the stove on, i might take a picture of it before i leave. this might make me feel better the first time i do it, but eventually it will not be enough, perhaps i will no longer believe my pictures or every time
i pass the stove i must take another “just in case something changed” and the fact that i have to take a picture to feel better in the first place is not solving any problems to why i feel like that originally. it’s sort of the same idea with prepping and anxiety. it starts with rice and beans but (if you have the means) could end in a bunker in an extreme case. 

BASICALLY; prepping can be great. and super helpful: but we must not let ourselves get carried away with it if it’s driven by anxiety alone without logic. and always remember that other preppers who are swayed by anxieties will always want other people to follow suit, as it makes them feel less “wrong” if other people are doing it too. this is why there are multiple threads about prepping/anxiety related thing in the corona subs every single day, they generally want reassurance. also selfish prepping re: buying every mask on the shelf, ends up doing a disservice to the community at large leaving more people will less protection and will probably end up spreading the disease more due to selfishness.

tl;dr: if you want to prep, prep basic supplies: rice, beans, soap, toiletries, and medicines (for basics! but obviously base this upon your individual needs; re: your age/health/location) but if you feel like you are losing control and wanting to buy everything because the sky is falling and you don’t have any other way to feel in control other than buying things, reconsider that it is just anxiety making you feel this way, and having everything in the world won’t make you feel better, you just want to feel in control of a situation that’s uncontrollable. just try your best to stay positive, wash your hands, and be vigilant :)

I try to help them by reffering them to this sub.  
But If you get the feeling you feel overwhelmed by everything, we are here for you and try to help.  
But sometimes the only thing we can do is advise you to stay away from the internet (covid news) for a while. It's not like we push you away, but to ease your mind a bit. There is alot of misinformation/drama on the internet that doesnt help.

COVID19_support,MollySPrentiss,2020/02/29,"How do i possibly cope with this? I can't stop thinking about the coronavirus and i kept trying to not read the news or anything but I'm starting to see more people wear masks on the subway.
I'm too poor to save up food and I have unstable housing. I also depend on public transit.
I keep trying to comfort myself with the fact that I'm 23, I have a normal heart rate, no diabetes and my blood oxygen saturation is 97-99% and all this other weird health stuff to remind myself that I'm not gonna die from the virus but I don't see how it's worth going through this. My whole life has been constantly imploding already without the worry of this virus.

COVID19_support,EdHuRus,2020/02/29,"I'm less stressed out than I was a few weeks ago but I still have some anxiety that I need to cope with. So tonight I officially completed my emergency stash of groceries including medication, toilet paper and an emergency stock of groceries so I don't have to go out for food if we need to hunker down. I am about 95 percent ready for whatever is going to happen I feel. 

However there has been one burning thing that I have been wanting to talk about. I know you can't give me any medical advice or anything like this but does being overweight but not suffering from health problems still lead to severe disease and possibly death?

I'm in my mid-20s and I am overweight and I'm not the most athletic person out there. I've been trying to lose weight and eat a more balance diet since last year but it can be hard at times. My question is for those who have been following covid-19, given how nearly 40 percent of the population of the U.S. is overweight or obese does that mean there will be a higher death rate for us all? I don't have any diabetes, no heart problems that I am aware of, I don't smoke, every year when I go in for a yearly physical I'm told to lose weight but they check my vitals. I don't have any high blood pressure, no high cholesterol (though I do tend to eat not so good choice of foods),  and I'm just told to lose a few pounds and I'll be okay. 

Do I at least have somewhat of a chance with this?

TLDR: I'm in my mid 20s, overweight but not obese and not diabetic or suffering from any known compilations and I have low cholesterol and normal heart rate.

Love you guys and thank you for letting me join. :)",4.224520148462354,5.249501945121953,4.8296659597030756,85.83643690349949,70.70731707317074,8.143372216330857,27.98038176033934,8.456263369488248,1.7968869034994697,1290,45,268,20,23,413,173,328,0.19699999999999998,0.705,0.098,-0.9886,1,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,2,3,1,4,14,16,0,2,10,1,34,22,3,2,1,50,58,27,2,7,16,0,4,1,0,1,11,0,0,2,10,17,13,0,5,0,1,5,12,10,0,1,8,4,31,6,40,44,11,30,0,6,0,1,15,14,0,8,12,175,41,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806336391671384,0.08895649288899121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2729727385032266,0.0,0.07676943663643686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08258160942178948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10521775386576053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17563840970557926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205371451642178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455136317922644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050741271518730216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24269343699111465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962673234297834,0.17109802391428947,0.0841709693274071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09936481557799627,0.08874144075640243,0.0,0.08989618592005624,0.0,0.0,0.10667008263096456,0.0,0.2378365425835967,0.0,0.21205598680346505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05515114462286595,0.08180073338217718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261729558838067,0.0,0.04902719367302722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336806549129968,0.0,0.0,0.09057210686282703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10931336134960216,0.0,0.20218930082373404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14882030900252974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832420566554066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06800149438138688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08762398793872968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131324374442706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920477013098651,0.0,0.0,0.11241783822863503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336983288193743,0.0,0.08301267779715052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16028337417627786,0.0,0.11495352278668655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065958950169595,0.0,0.09239115796268586,0.0,0.0,0.06666978427600577,0.0,0.09859588442402976,0.0,0.05851638697066205,0.0,0.0,0.19178235046728198,0.0,0.06813280351066035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071177817631155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05919054217951195,0.0,0.08049677351382242,0.2444047751612545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938712827138364
COVID19_support,chiosax,2020/03/01,"My country is a third world one and I'm scared. Please give me hope, because I've lost it all.

I'm so scared. In Mexico the healthcare system is shit. And the culture is shit. No one wants to wear face mask, no one is washing their hands properly and is driving me insane. I live with my family and I have a 6 year old niece who lives with us as well and the damn kid is coughing whithuot covering. I have another niece (who thank God doesn't live with us) who had fever yesterday. And no one tested her for covid19, and her damn parents don't listen to me when I told them to take safety messurements like use facemask and wash their hands with frecuency. They call me crazy.

And also our damn president is talking like this is not big deal while others in the goverment said there will me 12 million infected. Also the fact that I'm poor and I have no money to go buy groceries for a week, If the virus doesn't kill me I can die from starvation as well. The fact that the governor of the state I live in, just said that the state is not prepared for a pandemic like this is so scary. My state is one of the poorest in Mexico.

And while I'm typing this I can hear a damn kid in the street coughing while going on the bycicle. Also facemask already sold out in the entire city bc chinese people buyed them all. My mother is diabetic, she will likely die.

I don't wanna die, I don't want my family to die, I hate this.",3.188840125391849,4.460280310344828,4.280564263322887,87.85131661442009,73.48275862068967,7.755485893416928,24.905956112852664,8.296473431620573,1.3782758620689652,1110,34,237,18,22,362,149,290,0.231,0.685,0.085,-0.9932,1,0,0,0,0,2,28.0,3,0,5,1,10,19,8,2,19,0,25,13,6,1,4,29,46,23,5,5,4,2,2,4,0,2,7,4,0,2,12,16,0,0,0,0,5,3,11,11,2,7,6,6,33,8,26,38,2,26,0,1,0,0,28,11,6,2,12,155,45,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145914812119036,0.24231580959310325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591028679755614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061570395218306234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313519482780896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041294954365583,0.0,0.0,0.4193000162424255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19043298147797333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689112985491316,0.11480448583082108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971939613148888,0.0,0.0,0.11383754398447693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10031861236424523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174468023736088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973795476742464,0.0,0.3567494409897998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11025653373240674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059854925329813,0.0,0.3422106997314036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11215170354229646,0.0,0.0,0.07002265343733886,0.0,0.0,0.1108707903092124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921536649742864,0.0,0.20224293054895515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20735593243218026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07594156748373265,0.08118225875629705,0.0,0.09298984707035944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965125442412422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2429879663753064,0.08723402650150099,0.0,0.0,0.11914818661559437,0.0,0.08101838773068347,0.0,0.18162737044165192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504251896115819

COVID19_support,TheNomNomNom,2020/03/01,"Ideas for self-care: I am making myself a weekly ""advent calendar"" (well, not quite...) to cheer me up in case I need to self-isolate! ☺️ I have suffered from anxiety for a very long time, I live alone in a foreign country, planning to work from home and maybe even bug in for a while if things get really bad. So to keep morale up during those weeks or months, I bought several little gifts for myself ☺️ The idea is that I will unlock a new ""level"" every week or so, with a fun mission: make something cool, finish a project, or read a book. I am also writing notes to cheer up my future self. 

The gifts include, in no particular order: 
- one of my favorite books, ""The Martian"" (because of its incredibly stoic and deadpan hero, who finds himself all alone on a distant planet)
- a beginner felting set (how to felt cute yellow chicks yay!!🤗)
- a kawaii drawing book (even more cute animals! 🙃)
- a spiritual book by the famous recluse Thomas Merton (learn from the pros)😇
- a beginner sewing kit (how to sew a fun little monster!!) 
- something cool that lets you make UFOs (because why not)
- the book ""How To Survive a Sharknado"" (for obvious reasons)
- a beginner soap stones set
- and very fun and helpful book about how to restart civilization (for the happless time traveller) called ""How To Invent Anything“
- I‘ll also add sudokus and puzzles to the mix! 
I thought that maybe someone will like my idea and get inpired by it ☺️ Good luck to you all 🤗",4.576163636363635,5.9302795163636395,5.219772727272726,82.12965909090909,70.2,7.6818181818181825,30.84090909090909,8.07648339933343,2.2109454545454543,1117,47,209,15,20,360,167,275,0.07200000000000001,0.785,0.14300000000000002,0.9693,0,2,2,0,0,0,65.0,0,2,0,5,13,16,0,0,24,2,7,0,0,9,3,39,18,20,0,2,6,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,8,8,0,1,9,8,1,1,3,2,1,1,4,5,17,14,35,11,3,29,1,1,1,0,9,11,0,6,15,121,25,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285049734656231,0.0,0.1764368294281455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439024169213549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907793815321895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09210794632773647,0.13449331272108211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126433731775209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14572328932136472,0.0,0.0929446702583699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118383165884312,0.0,0.10082539610421254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11526947963028368,0.0,0.0,0.09252651518911673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07394144120642385,0.0,0.11065437392323964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3735947125992024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805253947053386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11280398497006207,0.0,0.05389406129353009,0.22112809127997865,0.09740966815299637,0.09762480457822804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22090722815826508,0.0,0.22165135671215572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805193045428171,0.0,0.0,0.08179675659793065,0.0,0.10654236982279153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07475191687870103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11733298169183792,0.11034428877861577,0.0,0.07067025254458582,0.11342161318042968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34524604669042996,0.12462391306598185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09346906374527973,0.16985088481030675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07328800959240435,0.0,0.0,0.08757734004157597,0.12865046965997634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820419257318276,0.0,0.0,0.2654627597870513,0.0,0.09918592630803036,0.0,0.09954162029036433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031022333797397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Like what if he doesn't come back because he gets sick. Stuff like that. As for pre-existing health conditions, he's obese, drinks a lot, and has a bad right knee. We joke about things on phone calls to help bring levity to the issue, but he seems really worried  - although he'll reassure me everything will be fine. 

What I'm doing to cope is playing peaceful, but engaging video games and a few other things. I only check the reddit front page once every day and I'm just subscribed to this sub. Any advice on how I should handle this situation?

COVID19_support,MaggieLulu,2020/03/01,"Anxiety is high, just need to vent Just wanted to write this out because I keep falling down rabbit holes of panic prep and virus gloom and doom and that's not constructive or helpful. I haven't articulated these thoughts yet, so I'm grateful that this sub exists.

Anxiety is currently at about 11 because we're planning to travel next week for a family vacation in Florida. Also planning a day at Disney World during that time. This morning, just got a directive from work that we are to limit travel for in-person meetings and conferences indefinitely, and need to notify management of ANY upcoming air travel. That's fine, I assume I will probably have to work remotely for some time after we return, which is no big deal or disruption to my regular routine. But it makes the situation seem so much more grave, especially with the messaging coming over the weekend. 

I know what you're thinking! u/MaggieLulu, listen to yourself. You're going on vacation in less than a week! Enjoy the beach and family time and soak up that Vitamin D! I'm thinking that too! Believe me, I'm trying very hard to focus on vacation and the good parts of getting out of dodge for a while. We do this trip every year with the fam and it is usually a welcome respite from dreary, snowy midwestern weather and the grind of our jobs and routines, but I keep thinking about how this seems like the exact wrong time in this virus outbreak timeline to do that travel. It seems like the timeline is rapidly accelerating as more cases emerge in the US, so what will things look like when we leave for the airport next Saturday? What will they look like when we come back? 

Don't get me wrong, it will be good to be with my family for sure, but I am so anxious about what-ifs. What if we get stuck in Florida? (I know, that sounds great, but what about our pets, what about our jobs, etc.) What if we get sick? What if my elderly in-laws get sick and I can't help them? I know rationally there is nothing we can do about the spread of this virus beyond hand-washing, being vigilant about cleanliness and personal immunity, but I think about these things and everything just snowballs! I just want to enjoy my time in 75 degree sunshine, dammit!

In reality, I feel we've done all we can to prepare our home for quarantine/illness/supply shortages without going overboard, so we will be fine when we return from vacation. And most importantly, I know that I can't really do anything more besides live my life and enjoy what I can. After all, coronavirus fears aside, there is no way to know what the next weeks, months or years can bring in general. Expect the best, prepare for the worst, right? It's pushing down that nagging interior monologue and just enjoying the present that is causing the most problems for me right now.

Anyway, this is all over the place, I just needed a place to get some thoughts out in a safe space. Thanks for reading!",6.255911330049263,7.055711096188753,6.440095410941148,76.93004718693284,65.98729582577133,9.78171635986518,32.25828364013482,9.819183407551806,3.0864253150116667,2318,91,421,48,35,742,267,551,0.115,0.755,0.13,0.9467,3,1,0,0,0,0,70.0,16,0,2,6,34,29,1,2,26,0,34,5,0,3,5,98,77,40,1,10,20,0,2,4,0,5,5,2,2,1,40,36,0,4,16,7,0,12,8,10,0,0,5,7,43,19,72,63,16,76,1,3,3,0,27,32,0,15,35,287,83,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06365374202922923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05412873191930788,0.0,0.12178306971092252,0.08992202408857894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06550160023110432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06120522773828725,0.0,0.09704326086964413,0.0,0.0,0.08967863200483712,0.08353220622136978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176810908621257,0.0,0.13713164247298404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05133352033569059,0.0820610762205233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08145543032653638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887717650890985,0.0,0.0,0.06706395804995435,0.0,0.07153670722069758,0.0,0.22511107936972224,0.0895688244802989,0.040246666364446425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495170790818724,0.0,0.09047368973338396,0.1335244789378893,0.06366104211688556,0.08775604227842937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07130333343785489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670446616112927,0.08409866658851994,0.07984234351688213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15797560477177608,0.14149905261837667,0.0,0.0,0.21872231921055396,0.0,0.0,0.08428179615398436,0.0,0.0,0.056221759125174416,0.1555484163076253,0.0,0.07028566436905767,0.0,0.13368297073685076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05313165722127915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06353361579301182,0.0,0.058512999406122486,0.17706063955653084,0.0,0.0,0.2539571365566068,0.0,0.0,0.07637552810013729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09339000256007414,0.0,0.0861958618825614,0.0,0.0,0.13900216934022086,0.16632397763602966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581909584726098,0.07616363888145647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961860247747489,0.0,0.05099191636115345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13595091272647286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21738652840783854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0894704331035067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501928930246013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07328228083871514,0.0,0.0,0.10576150277809074,0.2040103343433966,0.0,0.12638235290626434,0.2320684358877109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054041180468954716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574546551770473,0.0,0.08766491882546201,0.0656759125438545,0.09389681936331283,0.06318044318051437,0.19154388666606428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672872770841734,0.0,0.11589521882101328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17405378471697613,0.0,0.10251579696356683
COVID19_support,rivke,2020/03/01,"I'm not worried for myself Deleted and reposted because of a technical issue. Sorry if that's not ok. 

I had a near death experience a decade ago that really changed my perspective on fear of death. I'm pretty sanguine about the fact that I will die at some point and kind of whatever. But...

I have a husband. Kids. Parents and in laws over 65. Family and friends who live all over Asia.

I'm not afraid to die but I am terrified of losing any of these people. I'm not worried for my children's health because the virus seems to spare little ones but what if, God forbid, my husband and I get sick? What if they lose their parents, their grandparents? How do I brace my preschoolers for the possibility of 0anything from ""everybody is fine"" to ""every safe adult in your life is gone suddenly and traumatically""? 

What if the virus doesn't touch us but the economy collapses and people start starving? What if we go to war over resource scarcity? These possibilities scare me even more than the virus. Every time we eat dinner together or do some normal family thing I find myself wondering if we are unknowingly going through the last few normal days our family will ever have. 

A few years ago there was a video circulating that shows a goPro style view of a year in the life of a little girl in a war- torn country. It starts with a normal kid birthday and progresses until her next birthday, dirty and hungry and alone in a refugee camp. It keeps playing over and over in my head but with my own children's faces. 

I know I'm thinking catastrophically and I recognize the feeling of paranoia from previous bouts of anxiety disorder but I don't know how to sort out what is a probable threat from what is wildly unlikely. A month ago, everyone was telling me it was seriously unlikely that anyone in my family would ever even need to worry about exposure and now I'm watching news come in about positive community spread cases within an hour's travel of my health compromised parents or other immediate family in Tokyo.

COVID19_support,badskinsxd,2020/03/01,"An American living in Shanghai's story So, I rarely use reddit, but after having seen so many people freaking out and also spreading false/insensitive information that people actually believe, I decided to find a platform where I could show my perspective. 

Some background - I'm an ethnically Chinese, American citizen that goes to an international high school in Shanghai. I moved there from Boston when I was six.

Recently, we were just about to go on our Chinese new year break. I left school not thinking anything would change, however as you all know, I was very wrong. This was around the time that the virus started to spread to the Eastern parts of China, and in compliance with the Shanghai Education Committee's rules, our school and all other schools in Shanghai, international or local had to cancel school until the 17th of February, my end of season basketball tournament along with it. This of course brought uncertainty to my entire community, and these sneaking suspicions of the virus getting even more out of hand soon became true, as the government then ordered that all the schools would be cancelled until some time in March. This ""time"" in March has still not been announced. This caused my whole family to freak out, as different countries started to close their borders to people who have been in China in the last 14 days. Fearing that we would be somehow trapped, my mom told us to pack our bags and booked a last minute flight to Taiwan, and then left our dog in a pet shop to live in until we would hopefully return.

I know that I'm extremely lucky to be able to first of all live in Shanghai and not Hubei, and second, be able to leave the mainland so easily, especially after hearing some extremely depressing stories of families trapped in Hubei. I wasn't the only person to have this idea to leave mainland ASAP, however, many of my friends decided to stay behind, either because it was an extremely inconvenient time to leave, or because their parents didn't think that the virus was that serious. Now, many countries are not allowing them in, so they are basically stuck in Shanghai, but they are still allowed to go outside, however their activities are limited heavily. After a week in Taiwan, we were supposed to go to Singapore, because my mom's work had an office there, however, the day before we were supposed to leave, Singapore announced that effective the next day, they would not let people who were in China mainland in the last 14 days in. Panicking, we again, booked a last minute flight to Singapore and left as early as possible. 

Now, you might be thinking I'm studying of if I'm studying at all (tbh you probably aren't thinking this), and the answer to that is, my school is doing e-learning - posting the assignments online and having us take pictures of our work and send it into the teachers. This certainly is NOT as good as real school, and I know every single one of my friends and classmates can say the same. Education is being greatly affected, especially for the Juniors and Seniors of all schools. Their SATs and ACTs were cancelled, and all AP tests were postponed. While I am not a Junior or Senior, I can completely understand why all of them are panicking; I have a sister who is a Senior right now. 

My family plans to fly back to Shanghai on the 13th of March, however, the situation is still extremely unstable, and we aren't certain that it's the best option, despite my whole family's homesickness and how we all miss my dog. Now, there are a whole lot of insensitive comments coming around, and at this point, I feel like some people are downplaying the effect of the virus. Children are dying. 20-30 y/o adults are dying. People - its not just the ones who are old that are dying, and despite having a lower chance of dying from the virus if you're younger, you do not want to contract it and give it to your family. There are numerous cases where this virus has sadly wiped out entire families in China, and they just aren't being reported to the mainstream media. I urge people to not spread false and insensitive information, because it just causes more panic, however, do not downplay the potential damage that this virus can cause. Wash your hands, protect yourself in public especially if you are in a risky country, and do not be insensitive, as real people are really suffering from this event. 

P.S. my relatives are doing fine. My grandparents were in America long before the virus and are still there. My uncle and his family went to visit them before the virus, and are also still there. 

TLDR: Im an American living in China and school got cancelled as the virus spread. My family, along with many others left mainland ASAP, but not everyone did and now they are stuck in Shanghai. School is now online learning. People are saying this is no big deal, but it's not only old people that are dying. Stay safe.

COVID19_support,LicianDragon,2020/03/02,"I keep worrying I'm not prepared enough. In the span of a week or so I've gone from thinking ""it's no different from the regular flu"" to panicking every time I leave the apartment. It doesn't help that within the last couple hours, I've had the slightest bit of irritation in my throat and I can't tell if I actually need to cough or if I'm making myself paranoid. Started taking Zicam just in case. 

The closet is packed full of food, toiletries, and pet supplies. The only thing I don't have is water but I just don't have the space for 60+ gallons of it. Is boiling tap water going to be ok? Beyond that, we could easily stay inside for 6+wks which is hopefully overkill. I keep thinking about when my husband and I will self-quarantine, if my ferrets can catch it, and how bad it's going to get. There are no confirmed cases in our state, or in neighboring states. Any advice for putting my mind at ease?",3.0981967213114743,4.779327781420768,4.385486338797815,85.35036065573772,74.46448087431693,7.0657923497267765,25.86120218579235,7.793537801064563,1.4566979234972677,716,25,142,10,15,236,120,183,0.124,0.8059999999999999,0.07,-0.6088,1,1,0,0,0,0,23.0,2,0,0,0,8,3,0,0,9,1,16,7,1,2,0,25,31,14,0,6,10,1,0,0,1,1,2,0,3,0,9,5,4,2,2,0,0,5,7,1,0,0,2,0,15,2,22,26,3,26,0,0,0,0,6,12,0,7,6,93,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.17491642196294827,0.0,0.0,0.1751552967119979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189216007169353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496613678146398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19568817437085764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14311185859878067,0.19833022891183769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18727197356105116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18520710905870374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15102091661509034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21674272260503213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364766383655164,0.0,0.2037371480953656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12014356708989835,0.0,0.0,0.17802987257914907,0.1765193694965511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186408504352912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14610789549278608,0.0,0.18979366084626104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964685366258106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1809854821571876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329072567929037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13632324365059426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18018986579233215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18699072714977166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686992311648335,0.19105040142800855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13476928422315798,0.0,0.1566672767165566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11908184035483987,0.22970481155124556,0.0,0.0,0.10451869804369918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14377883529619528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820311223910204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,moonfire098,2020/03/02,"Immune System Boosting Tea I want to preface this by saying that you can boost your immune system by consuming various foods that have essential antioxidants and minerals that play a key role in fighting infections. HOWEVER, increasing immunity does not mean finding a CURE for infections. It just gives your body some additional power to fight infections, but the rest is up to your body. So please dont think that by drinking this tea you will be completely safe from catching anything. **You should continue to exercise all caution such as washing hands extensively, not touching your face, and keeping appropriate distance from others, especially those already sick. And obviously if you're not feeling well, trust your instincts and please go see your doctor!**

Reason I'm sharing this is because in the past I've had a bad immune system and would easily get very sick. I get the flu almost every year even when I take the vaccinations. What I have noticed is that while I still may get sick, the length of the time I stay sick and severity of my bouts have reduced significantly when I regularly drink this tea (2-3 times a day). 

I now try and drink it at least once daily and hope that this recipe may be useful for those who want to give their immune system a little boost. If you start to feel a little sniffle or a slight tickle in your throat, you should definitely start drinking this tea.

I usually make enough for the whole day in the morning and just warm as needed throughout the day or next day:

Serving size, 3:

Take 3 and a half tea cup/glass fulls of water and put in your tea pot (whatever size cup/glass you use to drink tea)

Put the teapot on your stove and turn on the heat

Put the following into the water :
2-3 cloves of Garlic
Half an inch of Ginger nugget sliced
4 cloves
1/3 teaspoon of turmeric 
2 cardamom pods opened 
Honey/maple syrup to taste

Let boil on low for 10-15 mins.

I keep the mixture , without straining in a jug in the fridge and strain out just the water when I want to drink.

Usually I heat it quickly in the microwave or on the stove. It should definitely be consumed warm and not cold from the fridge.

I also add fresh lemon or lime juice at point of drinking, it helps reduce the flavor of the garlic and adds vitamin C to the drink.

You may not have all the ingredients above and not all are required but I would say it is a must to have the ginger, garlic and if possible turmeric at the very least. 

It should also be noted that the garlic can be very strong especially if you dont add lemon juice or any sweeteners. I usually brush my teeth twice and sometimes even have to gargle with mouth wash after drinking this tea. It's worth it for me, but if you have someplace to be, just be cautious of that.

Anyways, I hope this will be useful for some.

COVID19_support,prampsler,2020/03/02,"Anyone else get frustrated with friends and family in denial? I've been gradually preparing for a very challenging springtime for several weeks: quietly planting extra vegetables, stocking up on food, cleaning supplies, etc. It wasn't until the last 7-10 days that I let friends and family know it because I was waiting to see how the situation developed. This week I cancelled a long-planned 12-day trip to Arizona for spring training, a family event, and then a trip to the Midwest to visit family. Despite my imploring them to start preparing, the friends and a significant other associated with these trips have minimized the risk of travel and exposure and tried to ""guilt"" me into going. I'm having none of it, but I'm really quite frustrated and even angry with them because I suspect before long they'll want to mooch off my supplies and potentially infect me.

Anyone else experiencing this? What are your plans for sharing supplies with close friends and SO's who have behaved this way? For me: I live alone but I've nevertheless just assumed that they will  expect me to provide for them, so I've overstocked accordingly.

COVID19_support,ryansschultz,2020/03/02,"Having problems dealing with worry and fear. Hi, I am a university science librarian and, back in 2005/2006, an avid H5N1 bird flu prepper, so I have been on top of the Wuhan coronavirus situation since late January when there were only about 1,000 cases in mainland China. I've been busily compiling good, credible, authoritative sources of info about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 to share with family, friends and coworkers, and blogging about it here if you are interested:  [https://ryanschultz.com/category/wuhan-coronavirus/](https://ryanschultz.com/category/wuhan-coronavirus/) (I usually blog about social VR, virtual worlds, and the metaverse, so this is a tangent that has surprised a lot of my readers! I started blogging every day about the coronavirus, got stressed out, realized that I didn't need to blog about it every day, and have cut back to 2-4 posts per week at the moment.)

I am an older person, a significantly overweight person, and a person with several underlying health issues (notably hypertension, asthma, and type II diabetes), which means that I run a significantly higher risk of a severe reaction if I should become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and get COVID-19. As of Feb. 29th, the World Health Organization is now recommending that people that fall into these categories limit their exposure to crowded areas and to people who are already sick: ""If you are 60+, or have an underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, a respiratory condition or diabetes, you have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick."" [https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1233678276096331776](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1233678276096331776) (scroll down to the 5th tweet in the series)

I firmly believe that we will have a full-blown pandemic, and that there will be significant societal disruption as a result, with quarantines, and the implementation of social distancing policies.

So I am stressing out, not continuously, but every so often my anxiety absolutely gets the better of me. I went through my adjustment reaction to a potential pandemic earlier than most people, and I have prepped to the best of my ability, stocking up on food and medications to last me quite a while if I need to self-isolate in my home. But I am still extremely worried that a) I will get this, and b) if I get this, I will die.

I figured this would be the best place to talk about it.",16.57063056644104,12.726771301745641,14.266499821873884,43.794918952618474,49.19950124688279,16.943427146419662,50.58799429996438,14.452119694410145,7.1147590309939455,2016,88,282,55,14,635,224,401,0.099,0.8170000000000001,0.084,-0.0953,0,2,0,0,0,0,109.0,1,4,1,7,21,17,1,6,28,0,31,12,0,1,0,54,41,34,1,10,11,0,0,1,1,7,11,0,1,4,19,26,2,2,5,4,0,3,2,8,0,0,6,0,31,9,52,26,4,42,0,0,0,0,22,22,0,12,17,207,50,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874362983575303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07538441742424852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15154554561061212,0.0,0.0,0.10883197944892507,0.0,0.11102317333822123,0.2068276556702817,0.08715245713569969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710297199857096,0.10159255204808128,0.0,0.0,0.10227111575178753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24907784405963085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09289669800743128,0.11088723036542933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915746787947833,0.0,0.07613336246930534,0.0,0.20593666742715375,0.0,0.0,0.08265241696158653,0.07881309912771148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094912347426323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09884573555411147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285232395240153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032494311629372,0.11115975245264988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04814268014613502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377694801229903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734120794778564,0.0,0.09927077310854653,0.0,0.10453756878213487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14613539953643007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494568828556758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732666679715828,0.2581294160500081,0.20591098890080456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437606801755563,0.0,0.0,0.09429145709035268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10481162622755602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280087514039517,0.3339734865749797,0.0,0.08151502249783206,0.11076542071427413,0.0,0.20090247092183905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06974858766618293,0.0,0.07869582814768689,0.0,0.22575922726066916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920438693669432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06690360024987038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10853017336298562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904450835830477,0.0,0.0,0.09134949049802503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20014852040868306,0.0,0.07000146255688362,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Slyfoxx_,2020/03/02,"Advice pls I will try to make it a long story short. But this is still pretty long.

I went out of town on Feb. 10th and my babysitter watched my kids at my house over night. That night, she had her daughter come to my house to visit her bc she was leaving the next day. Her daughter was visiting from Italy. 

Fast forward to Feb 21, my younger son woke up with a very high fever and cough. He wouldn't eat, threw up twice. That lasted 2-3 days and he is currently fully recovered but still has the wet cough. 

My older son (toddler) had symptoms show on Feb. 26th. Same symptoms as the little one besides the throwing up. He is pretty much better now too besides the cough. 

On Feb. 27th- I woke up with symptoms. It started with a tickle in my thrpat and weird feelimg in my chest the night before. Now I am coughing a lot, my throat feels like it is being torn apart, congestion, headaches, sore body, chest tight ect... NO FEVER. Yellow, thick mucus I will cough up here and there.

They seen the pedi who prescribed antibiotics and steroids and also an antibiotic for me. He did not even test them for the flu or ask about anything really. Just said it was a viral infection and bronchitis caused by the infection.

Anyways.... I am freaking out because I am afraid my babysitters daughter who came from italy could have exposed us to the virus. 
I haven't heard back from the babysitter today when asked a question, i planned on asking how her daughter was doing. I have been trying to think of ways to ask without seeming xenophobic or something, but decided I was just going to ask already. But now no response lol

Even if her daughter was just fine, idk that I would be relieved bc what if she had it and was one of the ones who didn't show symptoms. Or that she could be lying. Any excuse really, i am sure i would make. 

So, i look at my situation and options. My kids seem to be out of the woods for the most part. I am nervous as shit about myself because I am not feeling any better yet, i smoke and ngl, have been drinking the past few days so im able to sleep. Even more nervous for my fiance bc he has been smoking for like 20 years more than me. But luckily he has not been sick yet. 

I live in FL. Idk how i would even go about requesting to be tested, ect... I have us all quarantined, which i would regardless.

COVID19_support,Wordie,2020/03/03,"Lots of questions about self-quarantine (in Seattle) I posted this in the other COVID-19 subreddit, but perhaps this is a better place. I am anxious, but find that information gathering helps with that, and so does Vivaldi. I also anticipate that when I've finished collecting all my supplies and confident that I've covered everything, I'll feel much better.

I've got risk factors and so plan to self-quarantine in Seattle. Just doing that is hard enough, but my situation is further complicated because I don't live in a single family house, but instead a multifamily building. So I have questions:

1. Is it necessary to maintain an *absolute* separation between one’s living space and the outside world? I’ve ordered a CSA foodbox, and planned to disinfect the entire thing (box and food) before bringing it inside. But maybe even that is too risky.
2. What about garbage, recycling and composting? I certainly am not willing to let it build up inside! But I since live in a multi-unit building and other people will also be using the receptacles. So how to I protect myself?
3. What about using the laundry room, which is in the basement and used by all tenants? Luckily, it's a fairly small building and there are no more than a dozen tenants all together, but still...
4. I have a generous balcony and in the warmer months, grow veggies and herbs in containers hung from the railing. But my balcony is contiguous with other people's balconies. So, is this a risk?
5. I already anticipate a couple of times that I will need to leave my home. Will I be completely undermining my efforts?

The advice for those who are doing self-quarantine is essentially to turn one’s home into a sort of hermetically sealed environment, and to not break that seal until the danger is over. Theoretically I'm game, but have so many questions and can't find any advice about how to do this while living in a multi-family building. I'd very much appreciate any info or links people could provide regarding these questions.",5.798953033268102,7.784722068493153,6.660503913894327,70.52813356164386,68.04109589041096,9.378669275929552,34.405577299412926,9.784248007369934,3.8062426614481417,1605,78,255,38,28,531,201,365,0.065,0.828,0.107,0.9649,0,3,0,0,0,0,57.0,0,0,0,5,21,6,1,2,23,0,30,1,0,5,4,54,39,37,0,2,13,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,5,0,26,17,1,2,10,1,0,2,5,3,0,3,1,2,18,3,36,30,9,30,0,0,0,0,9,18,0,7,7,190,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884217884738993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10639101086374617,0.15419834301291122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13112443204854615,0.0,0.0,0.10891604069764584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05877073974613117,0.0,0.08203794669148883,0.0,0.0,0.17053390672963986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10108422029776054,0.0,0.0,0.0769756691781475,0.10667601020782183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436918222982809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09961746913169732,0.0,0.06367800255925762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08664723680318798,0.0,0.18177384039584973,0.0,0.04874787457382617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17623428241462047,0.0,0.11657955025788545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710801357437315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636456802779631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06462169917115017,0.0,0.19341450604612564,0.0,0.0,0.11124438236466493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10208444074763623,0.0,0.09858592236107233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34052775650781464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819644718460329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09774477182479263,0.09685696586805123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07695367128929168,0.0,0.14174512393939773,0.07148691331685925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306600414107852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005160009242144,0.0,0.10072809915485982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923342847107369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4320057825754163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30173047488989924,0.0,0.0,0.07975148206128764,0.1083690612161746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699327969866343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0640506275163226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05621754061693828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10486657109146567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24980227512016245,0.0,0.07954848031929494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Manaequinn,2020/03/03,"Glad to have found this Subreddit Not sure if I'll get the opportunity to post this, but in any case, I wanted to say that I'm glad I've found this subreddit. I've only recently started updating myself on everything going on with the virus and since that point, it's started to freak me out. I've had about two mini panic attacks over it and for the past 2-3 weeks, I haven't had much of an appetite at all. I've been going about my daily routines as normal for the most part, but if I even hear someone talk about the virus or see an ad or video about it, my body just freezes up and I am just overcome by a sense of dread for hours on end sometimes. The only thing that seems to help keep things off my mind is sleeping (taking naps) or speaking with friends who have all ensured me that things are going to be fine and I just need to stop worrying about it.

I just have so many other things going on as well (outside of worrying about the virus) and I'm supposed to be turning 25 in 2 days which for the first time in my life, I'm not excited about. I've been worrying myself to death about the virus but I just found this sub last night and it's nice to know that I'm not going crazy and that I'm not alone and that there are others feeling the same as me. I know the chances for my age group to catch the virus (or at least get critically ill from it) are slim, but I just can't help but worry about it anyway seeing as there are still so many things we don't know about the virus. Plus, I am still living with my parents due to financial issues and they are in their 50s so naturally, I have to worry about them as well. I like to think things will be fine as I've never been a sickly person and my immune system has been pretty good to me all this time as I rarely get sick from anything at all (nor do I have any underlying medical conditions that I know of.)

It's just been such a huge relief to read what everyone is saying here and trying to put things into a perspective that is more positive than I've been able to do for weeks. I just really hope that things turn out okay for everyone and that this whole ordeal will blow over as soon as possible. I've never been so anxious about something in my entire life.",9.24365970722342,5.2856928920086395,8.892206623470123,77.12392068634513,62.84449244060475,12.189536837053033,35.009479241660664,9.444778638647367,2.8235741300695936,1751,43,386,22,18,567,210,463,0.09,0.745,0.165,0.9885,1,1,1,0,0,0,32.0,1,0,3,2,35,20,1,2,19,1,35,9,2,0,7,69,70,38,1,6,23,1,2,1,1,2,7,4,0,1,38,20,0,2,10,3,0,7,10,4,2,2,12,8,34,16,78,53,11,54,0,0,2,0,16,22,0,9,24,270,72,1,0.07741429567367157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801778633879064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10528875141481987,0.0,0.0,0.08745611900805171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370536921395734,0.0,0.0,0.08806993721938815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859898306897412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049925816384627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06856608818656262,0.0,0.0,0.051131412180849004,0.0,0.0,0.14794535406590312,0.06957497724889512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039142993931933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584856035291377,0.0,0.25464233833382555,0.05981009280301529,0.0,0.1213373229968101,0.0,0.2199816412224572,0.06493143831469488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08725153752386193,0.0,0.10377834113348887,0.0,0.0,0.07688986308624393,0.07623748731621313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08080041181786851,0.0,0.06880938296678685,0.0,0.0,0.17017948937405927,0.06310298332244785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10936001289405524,0.03782071451904034,0.0,0.06835824137549648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15697189031787295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798675849425432,0.0,0.0,0.07816637029539635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056908414723171936,0.057401719329048764,0.1194133545269626,0.0,0.0,0.07264807230153147,0.07584957314890525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177541205631858,0.0,0.09082899613125436,0.08595941398138449,0.08383213824654476,0.0739007048306605,0.0,0.06759517697366715,0.0,0.0,0.07318153192330555,0.08727298666039995,0.07414149596754553,0.07875816964179554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782274912397913,0.0,0.0,0.07743524508151277,0.0,0.04959358011488607,0.0,0.07643727764753283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12312591020402887,0.0,0.0,0.12337834157853525,0.07047506730370201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403790535851922,0.0,0.07747020335217693,0.0,0.06559288150541714,0.059597306929884276,0.07656471789967602,0.0,0.10958847385403578,0.0,0.12364631305023305,0.0647218175658868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07296205751187841,0.0,0.05820591601863201,0.06222267846109545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4114449454260396,0.04960395481543278,0.0,0.0,0.0902817967131852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05255922515459464,0.16840904723668984,0.07562251813606373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04566095732357083,0.0,0.12419415686217655,0.0,0.13920949778757633,0.0,0.0,0.08643029649577418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3930898751797491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,anthonylars,2020/03/03,"Live in Santa Clara CA, would moving to a more remote area lessen chance of getting COVID-19? My logic that likely 2nd to Washington State, it appears that Santa Clara CO, CA will be a cluster / hotbed for COVID-19. I am lucky enough to be flexible (financially, no family ties, etc) to move to a more remote area, and in fact had already considered moving prior to these events. Some areas I'm considering are Montana, Idaho, Rural Indiana, Rural Minnesota, Rural Indiana.

Would moving to a more remote area really lessen the chance of getting COVID? Is the idea that a remote area has possibly less expansive hospital resources a factor here? Is the the idea that eventually the chance of getting COVID while likely less so than Santa Clara CO. CA, would also be present in a real way in these rural areas so moving is not really going to accomplish the goal of NOT getting it or MUCH less likely?

I would also note that I do have a somewhat at risk family member.",8.813333333333333,8.17411236723164,9.013333333333332,65.46994350282488,60.920903954802256,11.708474576271186,34.355932203389834,10.980518767755715,3.959989830508473,767,26,120,17,9,254,95,177,0.023,0.893,0.084,0.8658,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,2,5,5,0,1,14,0,17,0,0,0,1,17,24,7,0,4,3,0,0,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,0,3,0,0,7,3,1,0,0,1,0,4,4,19,15,11,24,0,0,0,0,0,11,0,5,7,85,13,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13788548086233288,0.19984501041859504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12910679691824706,0.13935232834356887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2355835628187973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.261124963901503,0.0,0.07101198959785565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821067818765718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18313284038736755,0.0,0.1103331782258952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6640106136194142,0.09185265942864937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14086240075450074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14222050535377093,0.1600923956957544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099179529145855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3550437056515844,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Usual_Yellow,2020/03/03,All of the constant updates about the coronavirus is giving me anxiety about traveling... On Monday I'll be going to Iceland and will be there for about a week. I'm a relatively healthy person and don't get sick very often so I think I'll be fine. I also haven't heard anything on the news about Iceland so I assume it's not very widespread there. This will be my first time on a plane and my first time traveling outside of the US so I'm excited. I've been planning this trip for like a year so I'm 100% not canceling it since there doesn't really seem like I need to. I'm mostly just nervous about being in the airport and being on a plane for like 6 hours. Is there anything else I can do besides washing my hands and disinfecting things to make sure I don't get sick? I'm probably just overthinking and over stressing about it (which I tend to do lol) but the constant news updates are really not helping all that much.,4.21486497545008,5.14098240957447,5.176595744680854,83.70653846153849,70.64893617021276,8.337806873977089,29.355155482815057,8.617729084823388,2.1181288052373155,735,28,149,12,13,241,99,188,0.043,0.857,0.10099999999999999,0.7177,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,3,18,8,0,2,11,1,19,4,1,1,3,24,34,12,0,1,6,0,1,3,0,2,3,1,0,1,8,6,0,0,3,2,0,4,7,2,0,2,2,2,12,6,21,24,4,22,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,4,15,99,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364372417863612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305166483378512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2807959872656357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3687389140021732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14252327092692954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902425924605772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782740022463388,0.16366524165096946,0.09696194039770424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11435669440003607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168017082247106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25005517596479826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11388390582726447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541842777997972,0.12650560422632168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489706023755198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18394709182412286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21859504877252686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15531749007444332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14113085819483115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19543387532983586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16079847919232648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133461071275059,0.10932038881918754,0.0,0.0,0.19896883538224686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052235550077836,0.0,0.0,0.28154323920724555,0.0,0.0,0.13685353887368118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10986763803153153
COVID19_support,planet__express,2020/03/03,"Offering 5 surgical face masks (for free), in case someone really needs them! I think (and hope!) my country has managed to contain the coronavirus for now, as we were one of the first few to have an outbreak in late January. Of course, face masks and hand sanitiser were in really short supply a few weeks ago, but things seem to be better now and we're finally seeing shelves restocked for masks. 

For anyone who is in desperate need of surgical face masks, I'm happy to offer 5 pieces that I will mail out to any international address (I will cover the shipping). If there is more than one person responding, priority will go to people who are pregnant or have compromised immunity, or those who are from the worst-hit areas.

I'm doing this because I was very angry with the selfish people in my country who were unnecessarily hoarding face masks/sanitiser when supplies were low, and how bad the atmosphere of panic was. I don't want this to happen to someone else who genuinely needs the masks.

COVID19_support,StoopidQuestionAsker,2020/03/04,"Scared that I need to go to the doctor's office tomorrow and potentially be exposed to the virus I live in the US in a state that has confirmed cases. I also have asthma and a respiratory related autoimmune disorder. I called the doctor today about refilling a prescription, but he said I needed to come in for an office visit in order to do so. 

I'm so worried about going. I feel like the chances of an infected person having been there at the doctor's office is so high. I don't want to go in but the prescription is for my asthma which has been acting up lately, so it's probably pretty important to get it filled. I just can't shake the feeling that if I go, in two weeks I'll be the most recent confirmed case. It's also terribly annoying that i keep getting told I'm overreacting, even though I'm one of the people that needs to be careful, that would have a higher risk of dying from this.

My partner and I are from the US and are supposed to visit London and Dublin over ten days beginning this Sunday. I'm mildly worried about catching the virus itself with cases erupting as quickly as they are (especially with close-contact in a large city), but the talk of borders possibly closing and quarantines potentially being put in place is what really makes me uneasy. On one hand, a lot can happen in ten days and I don't want to risk being locked out of the US; on the other hand, I'd hate to cancel and lose money on a trip that has been planned for a long time and that my partner especially is invested in if I'm overreacting.   

I honestly have no idea what to do; should we cancel? Continue as planned? Wait and see how the next couple of days develop?

COVID19_support,fixationed,2020/03/04,"A state of emergency has been declared in my county and I'm not freaking out I just moved to Los Angeles (Burbank specifically) in the middle of all this virus panic. I already get health anxiety so this is like a nightmare for me in a way. Actually I'm proud of myself for handling it well and mostly staying calm. There have been a few bad days but if I can feel anxiety or depression coming, I just go out and do something. I'm not going to stay inside to avoid the virus until I have to because that would be bad for my mental health.

Los Angeles officially declared a state of emergency and I didn't panic when I found out. I know that all it means is my city is taking things seriously and helping people stay informed. When new cases come up, it's just because we are able to test more people, which is a good thing. I have a decent supply of food and cold/flu medicine in case I need to stay inside at some point. I have an appointment to start therapy tomorrow. I'm also getting a puppy on Monday which helps to keep me positive. Whenever I get too scared I just look at her pictures, and I'm so excited to meet her.

If anyone else is in LA or any other area that has cases or a state of emergency, try to be calm. I recently saw someone say that like many things, it will likely turn out worse than we hope, but better than we fear. Things are going to sound scary for the next few weeks and we have to push through it.",3.7138308702791454,4.8258849413793135,5.0543349753694615,83.4217816091954,72.0,8.144499178981937,26.568144499178988,8.563005593585519,1.7856075533661748,1123,37,228,19,21,375,159,290,0.161,0.708,0.131,-0.8975,0,1,1,0,0,0,25.0,4,0,0,2,13,21,0,5,13,0,23,3,0,0,2,45,48,21,0,5,13,0,1,3,0,2,2,2,0,0,18,18,1,2,5,0,0,7,3,10,1,0,5,5,26,11,39,39,7,42,2,1,2,0,11,16,0,8,14,155,44,1,0.10446589269770748,0.0,0.10194364188677398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11528071030090276,0.08354133664786917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07104038932254299,0.0,0.15983224395604778,0.0,0.0,0.07304498112722589,0.10703765227685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744493137186653,0.12736287714232433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09239159276039872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17997623303356194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737185854234523,0.0,0.08997632030516338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726784857836603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11755317253189244,0.05282109419683092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12632057211581987,0.11454145930535077,0.0,0.0,0.16373735179150872,0.0,0.17811112271264729,0.0876210344441285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22208471778457772,0.0,0.0,0.14004257165752693,0.0,0.0,0.103758202755835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285408534755313,0.0,0.0,0.0574117226075447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15311027518811665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08772503945868748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591201862526414,0.0,0.11379398237366135,0.0,0.0,0.10527704919910276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11103071143771946,0.0,0.07746013575283009,0.0,0.10089381013562636,0.11110066202372523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24513643329355075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448469930280347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987540349599012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314746617978657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307547082712874,0.10458858281273348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851361187813235,0.0804229479404414,0.0,0.0,0.07394149653443625,0.44538696794579774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854535036791868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11946585259265327,0.0,0.27760998886481386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07092548382045005,0.1136288931188618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292016313638295,0.08379623783659139,0.0,0.093927383384595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645966942985942,0.07420957289956467,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,notyourhotteacher,2020/03/04,"Anxiety has turned to depression as those close to me has dismissed me when venting about my concerns. I am a teacher in a county that has a case of COVID-19. I’ve been following the virus for about a month and a half. I’ve been telling my girlfriend and best friend about it for some time now and they keep dismissing it and telling me that I just need to relax and “it’s just not going to be that bad”

I reached my breaking point yesterday morning..
I have a school trip scheduled for today, a trip where 8 other schools in our county will be attending. Roughly 400-500 extra students on top of the 1,000 ish already at the host school. Our district has canceled all “large group gatherings”. Yet after talking with the superintendent directly, he said that he wants me to take them and that it’s not going to be that big of a risk. 
So I could go on forever.. but basically I live alone and 5 hours away from any friend and family.. I’m out here completely alone, in a long distance relationship. Those close to me are literally telling me to “shut the fuck up” and I’m being pressured by my administration to take all my students to this event. 
This just seems like a GIGANTIC MESS. After being anxious for weeks, it quickly turned to depression and loneliness. It’s like no one cares... I’m the only one concerned. 
I feel alone... I’ve lost all hope in my community / country.",3.862710184552288,5.779939898496245,4.563048530416953,83.88302802460697,72.94736842105263,7.843882433356117,29.384142173615857,8.575989854853784,2.2382541353383454,1087,46,212,20,22,348,151,266,0.147,0.767,0.086,-0.9520000000000001,0,4,0,0,0,0,33.0,2,0,2,3,13,16,1,2,16,0,16,1,0,0,3,31,37,14,0,4,6,0,2,2,3,1,0,1,0,0,17,14,0,1,2,1,0,7,3,8,0,3,4,3,23,8,37,26,6,40,0,3,0,1,17,17,1,3,17,142,40,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3748247523512094,0.13312383493289645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203600617187431,0.0,0.0922855229024067,0.1362833279396806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334064947380115,0.0,0.10072527130958704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265990970441007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122995526483988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12648360935750008,0.0,0.0,0.09631731284746001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20780567331532465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11372403799681174,0.0,0.060996732293545124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864047612454796,0.11152520798965816,0.0,0.0,0.20567912565616492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11981787603969694,0.11880127546314012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10722602158147827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787243472893826,0.0,0.10652300527878372,0.10675826918015144,0.0,0.0,0.13168746436951942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09628978755842343,0.0,0.0,0.08944939963437018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16349093446786636,0.09174843116171136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11403916418145475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12951695321288534,0.0,0.0,0.1147516072434647,0.0,0.0,0.3662674911329332,0.0,0.10982166620082046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18140516708879856,0.09696192547965758,0.316321189289552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07034329814769068,0.0,0.11434797128455006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624326996542567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07115370875758911,0.0,0.09676620229558708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,CreativeDesignation,2020/03/04,"Pleasent things to occupy yourself with :) Taking your mind of things, at least for a while, is really important if you feel stressed out by the current situation. Even if you feel more comfortable, beeing informed all the time, sooner or later you need to relax and do something to recharge your batteries :)

In this post I would like to compile a list of activities, that are pleasent and help you do just that :) Please post below whatever helps you to calm dow, so we can share those things with each other.

You can suggest really everything, that is calming to you, but prefereably things that everyone (or at least most people) can do, no matter were there are.

I hope this will provide some inspiration to people, who are looking for a way to calm down :)

&amp;#x200B;

Some things that I can recommend to calm down:

\-reminding yourself, that you are not alone and seek out other people, who can help you cope with stress or anxiety

\-taking a hot bath or shower, maybe with a showergel that smells really good to you

\-making your favourite food or baking a cake or cookies

\-cuddling with your pet, or watching videos of cute animals

\-watching your favourite TV series or movie

\-listening to music or singing

\-watching a documentary about something that brings you joy

\-painting a picture, even if you think, you suck at painting, putting some some colorfull swirls on a peace of paper can still be really calming :)

\-go outside to enjoy nature, or (if you are afraid to do that right now, like I am) at least look out the window and look at the clouds or stars for a while",13.626631578947375,9.13554550526316,11.382543859649124,64.21697368421053,55.35087719298247,14.908771929824562,46.04385964912281,12.161744961471696,5.373217543859648,1259,50,217,25,10,383,156,285,0.040999999999999995,0.7070000000000001,0.252,0.9966,3,1,2,0,0,0,59.0,1,19,0,0,8,20,1,3,14,0,22,3,0,1,1,50,37,23,0,8,18,0,3,2,0,2,0,1,5,0,21,14,2,0,6,5,0,3,2,4,0,0,1,11,24,16,40,33,11,27,0,0,6,1,29,14,1,21,9,163,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12350366912022605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12920380281914826,0.1448978523524689,0.0,0.0,0.09122343666177923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15752270626323472,0.0,0.0,0.11394537896345346,0.10717128900806908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12058947860847208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14419364233734994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677706755507296,0.1000185155136976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397857469059771,0.0,0.0,0.11843892825329773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11651587643964667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3004117085253068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07959813098431066,0.0,0.11979938731419168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12040522315474708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841995348077879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24801204376087585,0.0,0.0,0.13089712137505022,0.0,0.0,0.2284108455660212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11987591900938595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3055700838204262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018360721704009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13403834222102354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18360394663834848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523060786124184,0.0,0.2731934963816717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17931742975054354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3961112071174226,0.07640850184471125,0.0,0.0,0.06953373835181646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465251894900913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470946919775099,0.0,0.1448978523524689,0.0
COVID19_support,germanbini,2020/03/04,"Yesterday I was majorly stressed. Today I bought lots of supplies and I feel somewhat calmer. I live in Iowa so (as far as we know) the brunt of the virus has not reached near here. The past several days I've been literally worrying myself sick - nausea, upset stomach, stress eating, crying.

Even though I only wore a light jacket, I wore my winter gloves in every store while shopping! :/ 

I'm hoping this isn't the ""end of the world as we know it,"" and hoping the economy doesn't go into a depression, but even if we're (only) quarantined to our home for a month, at least we'll have food. If nothing bad happens, then we have plenty for a while. :)

I know not everyone has extra money to spend on food - but if you can afford it, give yourself some piece of mind and get some cleaning supplies, health items, and non-perishable food. Basic stuff like bleach, hand sanitizer, anti-bacterial soap, canned goods, rice and dry beans.",4.305942857142857,6.157997165714287,4.8610000000000015,82.47550000000003,71.62857142857143,7.742857142857144,25.642857142857146,8.418075326091056,1.7426,724,23,134,12,14,231,124,175,0.08,0.792,0.128,0.914,2,1,0,0,0,0,38.0,5,1,0,0,5,9,0,3,10,0,11,8,2,0,0,27,25,18,0,5,7,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,4,9,4,0,4,1,5,1,4,5,0,0,5,3,15,4,17,19,9,19,0,1,0,0,7,8,0,9,11,84,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606477059900075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526923095608042,0.08964780817832448,0.0,0.11972624887940315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14223853560733454,0.0,0.0,0.1231186581693985,0.0,0.0,0.1836252008685042,0.0,0.11711912231278356,0.13282683872404613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07028595355359586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5042622838242258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07262525245515287,0.13334787286158395,0.0790006990497054,0.11659220716460525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292314710681428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14775759946399206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13943503288499035,0.27612999429832863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22918330621412514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791164182973893,0.0,0.12274544422122012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11817850750581173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14035711937592435,0.0,0.11095380492592644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333806574702983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2114416864239053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13269760397832953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570379805200077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3184633621341093,0.0,0.15912939032557258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13657335627951325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13176207800732148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411680300046392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Drogan1989,2020/03/05,"Vulnerable family members. I'm a 30+ yo ex smoking father of two. I have a mild case of GERD but is always mild even when i forget medication, worst case scenario is im sick with acid once in a blue moon. One of my kids was born with a condition that affects physical and mental development. He's had a few seizures in his life which were often sparked by heat provoked by mild chest infections. On top of that, kidney function is not fully 100%.

My father has COPD and is currently in hospital for the next couple of weeks due to abcesses being found on his spine.

My mother who regularly visits him has a heart issue (something to do with an extra valve and body current, i don't know for sure), a condition called M.E and pretty much only has one working kidney. She's a large woman too that despite constantly dieting the past 10-15 years has barely lost any weight possibly due to retention issues.

I was already a highly depressed and anxious individual to begin with long before this. But this has well and truly consumed any joy and hope in my life. Even worse, i almost fell prey to my emotions and attempted suicide not too long ago. All my hobbies and interests have came to a halt, i can't sleep due to the sheer overwhelming fear and it gradually gets worse as more news pops up in the UK where i live. And as much as i try to tempoarily step away from the news, the feeling of it looming pushes further and further into my head.

People are prancing around saying 20% will need treatment and only those with underlying issues will have problems. Most of my family have such problems and i fear this virus is going to take everything away from me. If i lose even one person i care about this, that would be my final breaking point.

COVID19_support,Binkyt11,2020/03/05,"Extremely anxious Wreck here trying my best to stay calm and levelheaded in this crisis Hi there! I'm a New Yorker who isn't in extreme close proximity to NYC, but still close enough where it could affect my home. I've been trying my best to stay calm, but today my anxiety is starting to really peak.

My grandmother just returned home from Florida (where if I'm not mistaken there was a case in Tampa, but if not— absolutely feel free to prove me wrong), and my sister said something to my parents about one of the students at her school coughing a lot and not being able to be sent home because she didn't have anyone to get her. I'm trying my best to stay calm on the outside, but on the inside I feel extremely overwhelmed mentally and emotionally. I'm worried about my family, my friends. Hell, I don't think I'm in the best shape either and I'm terrified of dying (I probably have some undiagnosed form of thanatophobia). And of course that fear sets off my anxiety and that anxiety sets off my fear and it just becomes an horrid cycle of fear and causes me to feel symptoms that for all I know aren't there.

It clouds my judgement and I'm worried it might actually get in the way of knowing god forbid I do get sick. This has happened before and ever since then, I've been terrified of saying anything about it if it is just nothing again. It cost my family money that would have gone to more worthwhile things like rent and bills, and I'm scared of what if something goes wrong. What if I get sick and don't do anything about it? Or if I'm not and my body is fooling me again.

COVID19_support,UncleBigHead,2020/03/05,"Regarding information to spread fear Like many people here, I've had my fair share of scares and anxiety forming from the virus, but in the last few days that fear has slowed down a lot, this because one main thing, I started to pay less attention to the news that are focusing in creating fear to people, like you or me.

One of the best advices I can give you is to stop reading everything on r/worldnews, r/Coronavirus, and so on, where I've been reading everything regarding the coronavirus is in r/COVID19, why? Because that sub is focused on learning from the virus, that has helped me to relax a lot.

I'll give you an example that may have been giving you some anxiety, the discovery of the L and S type of the COVID, the first article that went public was about the discovery in China, and how the L variation (the aggresive one) appeared on 70% of the confirmed cases and started to slow down more and more, which was shocking, but learning that the deadlier one is slowing done can be good, later on the day an article appears on my newsfeed, same thing, I read it but noticed that the last part where the L type wasn't appearing that frequent anymore was cutted, so now one of the important sections of the original article is missing, and the aim of the message can change and fear is easier to spread among people that read the article.

It is important to be informed in times like these, reading studies about the virus can give people that aren't experienced on the area an easy to read and understand summary of things, I encourage you to read this [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fdemjd/we_are_researchers_at_mriglobal_developing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) that MRI Global did yesterday, a lot of that information come from experts on the field and a research organization being active for 70+ years, their opinion and insights on the manner should be taken more seriously than a journalist that cuts important points in order to scare you.",14.65978991596639,9.688700336134458,12.671323529411767,57.20345588235297,54.042016806722685,16.381792717086835,49.918067226890756,13.5591,6.437435294117645,1608,72,267,40,12,504,176,357,0.10400000000000001,0.7440000000000001,0.152,0.9634,1,0,0,0,0,0,56.0,0,6,1,2,9,19,2,6,35,0,31,1,0,2,0,39,45,18,0,1,4,0,0,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,23,12,0,1,8,8,1,5,2,11,0,6,11,1,15,8,47,28,15,48,0,1,0,0,19,24,0,10,21,194,38,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07957569537802553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882329654785957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245925299750506,0.0,0.08075996916552619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09928198901109962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08545924266995784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614565223249955,0.07014759241945275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10503550594234648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333455683683925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14637402981987396,0.0,0.0,0.3665404879473423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06926713825728369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31247303368513746,0.0,0.06830240313354458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05458303617329456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327580450298986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11935261671048975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2076950833425773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256060247089479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271237169945416,0.0,0.0,0.27590661721229537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08818434722347253,0.0,0.225822435748372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07698080660296654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5701874815198316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16305791393039487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152778425096779,0.0,0.0,0.06808189976473186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16230203307033042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04748442229816693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08477495540791412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07548950115929239,0.07348090289299469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05244038656776377
COVID19_support,Linxx_0,2020/03/05,"Lost my motivation because of the virus Hello! I’m from Estonia where we have 3 reported cases and the people who felt symptoms or came home from visiting the risk area, went to the doctor themselves and followed every step they had to before even going to the doctor which is good I guess. I am 20 years old and I just had motivation again to get my life together, get a job and maybe even move to the other city and I was so happy mentally and in every way. (I still am but right now I am becoming more worried and that kills my vibe). And then I read the news that the virus started spreading and now it is in my country.. I started thinking that people say it’s just like a regular flu.. but why are people making such a big deal out of this then? I read the news about it just to keep myself updated and not have any false rumors of just false news ruin my mood. I don’t wanna die, I don’t want to catch the virus and just thinking about it makes me feel like “why should i try anymore? the virus just ruined everything and to get back on track takes time”. I have panic attacks and anxiety aswell which I didn’t have for months before I started reading about the virus. People say it’s going to get worse, many people say that it’s getting better now, since the numbers in China are decreasing.

COVID19_support,throwaway-72904,2020/03/05,"Am I going crazy? I could need some opinions on my situation. Hey I'm in my mid 20s living in germany, who has been fighting with anxiety about other things for a little while before this virus. My town and pretty much all places around us have at least 1 confirmed case, germany as a whole has almost 300, it's been exploding over the last couple of days. I'm scared for my grandparents and I might be going crazy, because nobody here seems to be taking it seriously enough.

My brothers workplace have a few people still working there, who had direct contact with the virus, but don't show any illness so far. I've seen people go to shops and other public places while coughing heavily. Schools only close once there has been a confirmed case. Everyone is still going to work as usual, because they don't want to stand out and be the first. People living in the same house as me go about their day pretty much as usual, touching food without washing their hands properly, touching doorknobs and directly afterwards going through their face, rubbing their eyes.

They get annoyed, when I mention these things and tell them to be more careful. They agree with me, but don't actually change their habits. Yesterday my brother touched and ate some food without washing his hands first and when I pointed it out, it took him a little while to even remember that he touched it at all. He just cares so little about it that it just doesn't cross his mind and in my opinion it's putting us all at risk.

So please, can anyone tell me am I just going crazy and I need to calm down? And if not, how can I convince the people around me to be more careful?
I feel like I'm alone, my family starts to think I'm a bit paranoid. They know my real reddit account, which is why I'm using a throwaway. I would really appreciate any input from you guys, because maybe I am indeed loosing my marbles and it's all not as bad as I think.

COVID19_support,GabicheYouTube,2020/03/05,"Should I lock myself up? Corona arrived in my town and is started to infect people around us Hi everyone,

In my town in Belgium, multiple cases of the corona virus are getting detected each day since this week (there is even one person I personally know who is yet to be confirmed with the virus). I'm worried that I can be infected and pass it on my family while going to the gym as I touch a lot of material that plenty of other people touch every day, we all take showers there, touch the lockers, are in close contact with others, etc. 

Even though I try to disinfect my hands before and after the gym, I still manage to put unconsciously my hands to my eyes, mouth, nose,...   

I don't want to stop living in fear locked at home because of this virus, I want to continue to go out and do my activities.

However, I'm worried because I still live with my family and I have very young siblings and my dad works with my grandparents who have a very weak immune system. A regular small cold is almost deadly to them. So I feel like I should lock myself up in my room for weeks/months until this passes to keep everyone safe. 

Am I panicking too much or can I still go out to the gym and don't let fear rule this just because a couple of cases in my town are confirmed with the virus? Certain articles say this is not any worse than a regular flu...

Opinions and advice is appreciated!

Thank you, and keep safe everyone.",5.552585696148963,5.8670048129496415,6.49268303004655,77.63964240372411,67.41726618705036,9.562759204401186,29.30258146424037,9.478462496947786,2.4950391028353787,1110,36,213,21,17,370,152,278,0.08,0.835,0.085,0.364,3,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,1,1,1,13,8,0,2,12,0,22,10,5,0,2,39,37,15,1,4,3,1,6,1,0,2,5,1,3,2,12,20,0,5,2,3,0,6,3,3,0,1,0,10,32,5,41,32,5,41,0,0,1,0,12,20,0,4,15,149,44,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11294185506980295,0.0,0.0,0.11573505209005358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07859726160379044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10288926204612957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211366522667482,0.0,0.0983486884452096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12788527889369425,0.0,0.1490769867981551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12890044522268426,0.15267685960169006,0.0,0.09737976982161099,0.33132028465520796,0.0,0.0,0.2179140204935844,0.26011561991574755,0.05843990155990553,0.08256921761044808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06038493311478003,0.0,0.19705757020603054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11593453860716872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20546274891335495,0.0,0.0,0.0635188548928396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818672400266975,0.0,0.056465758272386174,0.0,0.20411565368449053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826060536931937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225356006052753,0.0,0.08496340775914205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07831890133276988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16025499173234714,0.201837166320733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11618819464436335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191256657972613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956076301103113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180697208888572,0.0,0.2769031301795485,0.09662870075564006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690055768978848,0.0,0.0,0.1064090436589075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11355517131306432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07847013310838327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390265600880893,0.0,0.0,0.19072853533580425,0.13634224585685656,0.0,0.09271000468132364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08414243701370078,0.2347509099548907,0.11778424313584812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am honestly ready for this to go full scale panademic to see how bad it gets.  I really don’t think it can be stopped and this slow crawling spread is just awful to wait through.  I’m not thinking it’s going to die off in the summer, and the us governments handling of this is FUBAR.  Seriously.   Not cancelling events or closing schools in outbreak areas??   Finding out that UPS/USPS/AMAZON people have it.  Seriously.  They could mail it all over the World.    And my elderly parents are insisting on going to opening day at the ballpark this year.

COVID19_support,CandyappleWinter,2020/03/06,I feel it's out of my control now I'm worried for months and months and it's not getting any better as I guessed. Nobody around me seems to care or are worried. I have the most selfish friends who think the world revolves around them and I'm alone in my fear. Every day the news gets worse and worse and soon I will be closer to the virus as it reaches my vicinity. Even my job is nonchalant about it as I work in a casino with lots of people traveling all over to visit. It's only a matter of time before I get the virus. Now it's beyond my control and it's time to start living every day like it's my last.

COVID19_support,VeganMacN0Ch33z,2020/03/06,"Feeling extreme levels of anxiety b/c of this coronavirus I don't know how much more I can take. I'm 40 years old. I have 3 kids (boys age 8, 5, &amp;3) who I'm trying to protect. The government just locked down our city. All schools, public transportation, resturants, tourist sites, etc...immediately shut down for 30 days b/c there were a dozen people tested positive for the virus. This coronavirus is terrifying the hell out of me as it keeps creeping closer and closer to us every day and here we are barricading ourselves at home while the government is totally ineffective and incompetent. My anxiety is through the roof. I'm trying to relax but my heart palpitations are driving me crazy. I've been running on a treadmill as much as I can just burn off all my stress but I can't even sit still without getting jittery and all the while I'm trying to keep a straight face and act calm in front of my kids. The thought that that there is no vaccine, no cure for this virus keeps racing through my mind. If we all come out of this, and I'm sure that some of us will. Things need to change in a post-coronavirus world.

COVID19_support,FlangeMandible,2020/03/06,"Slight personal concerns So I’ve been reading numerous posts and news updates about the virus, and I’m not super concerned, however one big thing for me is that I’m on a immunosuppressant drug called Azathioprine (10mg a day) for an autoimmune disease I have called Crohn’s Disease. I’m not sure if I’m at a larger risk, and if I am what courses of action I can take, since I already wear face masks (the news says are useless) and wash my hands 8 times a day. 

I’m fairly young at 26 and I understand that makes me slightly less susceptible to the virus. Living in Tokyo, a very densely populated area, this on the news constantly and it gets exhausting to turn on the TV or read the news, but it’s basically unavoidable at this point.

COVID19_support,EagleEyes0001,2020/03/06,"Impact on the family I maybe over doing it but, I'd rather be ready for nothing, then not for something. Only thing is my worries are effecting my family. I woke up today ready to limit our contact with people.  

My wife and 14yr old son and 13 yr old daughter were not to fond of this decision. 

I tried to reason with them that not enough tests are being done(until today) to know if your area is infected. Which in my understanding the CDC say to expect more cases. 

At the end of it I changed my mind, I saw my kids starting to worry and decided to just let them go to school. I worry cause my daughter is in flagline and they are having a show followed by family night at the school🤦‍♂️tonight. 

Is it to much for my type of thinking. I mean the anxiety and panic attacks that I'm having as well are not helping, the other day I started coughing and damn near fainted from fear. I just want to be able to protect my family especially if we get it and I know it could have been prevented. 

My fear is rooted around my Dad who is HIV positive for 18yrs now, who has copd and is diabetic. He lives with us,(They are not as educated in the HIV virus as I am. They do have basic understanding of it and know living with him does not mean we will get it.) and I fear this might be one he might not come back from,(he is 58yrsold) being he had 2 other occasions in which they were very close calls. 

For those of you interested I live in northeastern Ohio. We dont even have a case yet.

COVID19_support,rursable,2020/03/07,"Looking for real people with real symptoms, under home quarantine. First of all English is not my original language, so please bear with me.

Last night I developed fever, call doctor this morning and of course I'm not eligible for testing. He told me if my condition worsened (he said there's other flu going around as well), I should get going to the Swedish Hospital here in Seattle.

Fever with chills, no shortness of breath, no coughing, no runny nose. Have not been in China for the past month, although I explained I meet a lot of people from all over the world due to being in property management. I feel generally fine, except for the chills that made my fingertips so cold

I'm tired of reading the subreddits in here about COVID 19 it's just putting me in such a downward spiral of hopelessness and frankly I'm afraid to completely lose it. I'm looking if there is anyone around that's self quarantine-ing at home right now or perhaps even those who are in the hospital undergoing treatment from this horrible thing of virus. So we can share, so we can support each other, and go through this away from the media hype that doesn't seem to have any good news to write lately.",5.540409192825114,7.0459332959641285,5.508405269058295,80.39426709641258,68.05829596412556,8.624327354260089,31.42628923766816,9.017664075816787,2.705932959641256,947,39,170,17,16,296,143,223,0.122,0.823,0.055,-0.9405,0,2,0,0,0,1,23.0,2,0,0,2,16,8,0,1,9,0,11,9,2,2,2,33,28,12,0,3,8,0,1,0,0,1,7,1,2,1,13,11,0,0,3,1,0,4,7,3,1,1,4,6,13,5,38,22,4,29,0,2,2,0,13,16,0,5,9,115,26,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888085866743647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10167104268549973,0.0,0.0,0.2588837924167457,0.0,0.0,0.13661343676841176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14847547176668502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15245510458448075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14882889003934835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603909009047903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0735214882652507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236820097534968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07596847415708456,0.0,0.2479122217656404,0.12195939810840987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2917075351677916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185250483371636,0.16402395720993554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24420832461730804,0.16267177919377326,0.0,0.12361872199923883,0.0,0.13758638422370426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606143837297456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13645339455888594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13880618872560652,0.20161200104041824,0.0,0.0,0.1596117884276967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14617288464029424,0.0,0.0,0.1454450436897408,0.3310070281798366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12417566891328015,0.13831411336541136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13237188352970747,0.1516898515256647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16500465937316106,0.0,0.15113219178876766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966010826213883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16712245618099414,0.0,0.13894137264729034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307371821864024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Gonner_Maleggies,2020/03/07,"My state just declared a state of emergency and I'm freaking out I can't take this anymore. I'm young and healthy but I'm so so so scared. I was at the supermarket yesterday and a lot of the shelves containing hand soap, bleach, toilet paper, disinfecting wipes, and sanitizer were almost completely empty. I'm afraid I'm just a week or two away from my community being quarantined. I have enough food and other stuff to get through it (or at least I hope) but I just want this to go away.

What I'm worried about most of all is my father. He's 62 and he's going to get surgery to have teeth pulled on Monday. He is already not doing so well health wise and the thought of him getting this virus makes me nauseous. I don't want to catch the virus and give it to him. I keep having panic attacks about it. I already wash my hands and make sure not to touch my face and all that but I'm just so scared.

If you read this far, thank you. I'm looking for reassurance and advice. Should I keep stocking up on stuff in case of a quarantine? Should I just lock myself up at home?

its nice knowing that we can't accidentally infect each other (im scared enough of infecting my roommates) but she's far away and i just can't fucking lose her y'all. she's 25 while i just turned 21 a couple months ago but my paranoia has gone fucking haywire. i haven't left my house in a week and only just started to leave my room again after my roommates realized i was right.

thank the gods that one of her roommates has been keeping an eye on this too and has been prepping for their house but fuck i finally found the love of my life last year and i can't lose her i just can't",1.7697993746743137,3.7422029158415846,2.868196977592497,93.43503647733196,79.24752475247523,5.440750390828557,22.512767066180306,6.339386263674448,0.2987386138613859,767,24,168,6,19,245,127,202,0.10300000000000001,0.759,0.138,0.8115,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,3,1,1,3,7,15,5,1,8,1,15,10,2,0,1,29,30,13,0,2,10,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,6,10,0,1,4,0,1,2,6,8,0,2,6,1,32,7,22,23,3,32,1,2,1,5,19,13,5,1,15,108,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413120370023735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24193417164616596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109087625179262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14246204371345195,0.0,0.083034624444783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13303561142205836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14104192323421386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14117032337469673,0.0,0.4761179495249174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29712588673753804,0.0,0.0,0.13907464894899926,0.13438401885294768,0.0,0.11444101842836757,0.0,0.0,0.07075893301131406,0.1049503623768136,0.0,0.13633016487887634,0.1398898220333656,0.0,0.09094160353811057,0.0,0.0,0.2273813954925309,0.11394179202426677,0.0,0.2880819272277728,0.0,0.0,0.11620403685226945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276890991487272,0.0,0.0,0.09546824773485403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744918702415051,0.09792197590183564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13823185651030556,0.0,0.1099538167979443,0.0,0.0,0.12890357907536368,0.0,0.0,0.11721131811247842,0.0,0.0,0.13216245314714364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911315871116002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11853787989032855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14004560168502425,0.0,0.0,0.15487324304984432,0.0,0.14180254079698507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10327738152382687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291230218443657
COVID19_support,Eiks,2020/03/07,"""You're fine! You won't have a hard time unless you're elderly, immunocompromised, or have an underlying health condition."" :) I've heard and read this multiple times since the outbreak of the coronavirus. 

I'm upset at the dismissal of those who may be more susceptible to the virus, as if they're ""less than"", and we're kind of in this ""survival of the fittest"" mentality.

And maybe I only care because it personally affects me too. Last year I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and decided to go with an infusion therapy DMT. It's a heavy hitter, an immunosuppressant that is supposed to stop new lesions by 70 to 90 percent.  

I've been thankful that I haven't gotten any side effects or sick since being on it. Only the sniffles back in January, because I was near a friend who was also sick. I have a pretty tough immune system, and haven't gotten the flu since I was a kid. However when I do get something, it's usually extreme (like the MS).

This past week I've had trouble peeling my eyes away from social media and news articles, feeling my anxiety rise and rise at the numbers and panic.

I felt pretty okay though, as there were no cases confirmed near me until yesterday (I'm in the USA). Now there is one confirmed in my county.

People are my job are kind of joking about it. Saying the, ""It's not a big deal"" bit.

I tried to also be lighthearted about it,  saying how I was carrying Lysol wipes with me all night, and I even carry some in my bag, along with mini Lysol spray.

My coworker said, ""You'll be fine."" 

I try and keep my health stuff private at work because I faced discrimination and fear of losing my job when I was first diagnosed. Plus I'm trying not to make people uncomfortable, or receive pity.

But at that moment I was mentally exhausted of the dismissal of those may be at higher risk, due to no fault of of their own. 

I didn't ask for MS. I don't want it. And now I have to worry about every time someone coughs without covering their mouth. 

I told her, ""I'm immunocomprised, so a bit worried.""

Her eyes widened a little, ""Oh. Well, you have an excuse then!""

It just feels very lonely and isolating in my feelings.

Because I'm still ablebodied, in my twenties, and don't show symptoms, people are going to brush off my anxiety as overreacting.

I just want to not think about this stupid virus and not let the fear control me.",4.587643540669858,5.912669925438597,5.610055821371613,79.45296650717705,70.14035087719299,8.685167464114832,29.16905901116427,9.095868883498916,2.4441719298245617,1850,70,350,36,33,611,244,456,0.13,0.789,0.081,-0.9666,3,2,1,0,0,0,74.0,0,3,2,6,22,24,1,5,25,1,36,15,4,5,1,54,61,34,0,3,13,0,5,1,1,4,11,4,0,2,21,21,0,3,7,3,0,5,13,13,1,2,17,12,42,11,58,34,8,50,0,3,2,0,22,21,0,7,24,233,63,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.147551886641215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06273626861185135,0.0,0.1411489813792398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862455660174385,0.0,0.08667620185132688,0.0709380669320476,0.0,0.2249501093047517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2014361853013696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09405967876336037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10347134064401496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095110406946592,0.0,0.1872728856544326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060933270952048126,0.0,0.07772845099471275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20762407071425987,0.1399400419467886,0.0,0.0885788510733004,0.0,0.0,0.07847168694646772,0.0,0.0,0.07127564905782661,0.0,0.0481992032126323,0.0,0.10486079204442313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08264197074016479,0.0,0.0,0.19612457986768428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18309684383251912,0.08200009734776799,0.0,0.19213786852352285,0.0,0.07519978456823141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943365444557505,0.0,0.045070921124527416,0.09246331155315693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10320926185918314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06158063935796707,0.0,0.09268211168117473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18594180860217102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910003498436915,0.0,0.08657466095472308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06251408167585291,0.14032750960639714,0.0,0.10824085616866992,0.0,0.0,0.08806742233261743,0.19187310096867985,0.08055312884807783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18771212003678375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09227953167226063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08775521861199335,0.14672906786035622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289417916687477,0.0,0.0,0.09404191242734343,0.07816699462863935,0.0710220722699139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07367461579844159,0.07712894829312585,0.0,0.0,0.10560940667491428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958878180037529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493560983546397,0.10550113660227678,0.0,0.0,0.05911300099381943,0.09063964296457927,0.0,0.16138313846207464,0.0,0.0,0.08815319155971613,0.0,0.18790438425877104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016053711265411,0.07611967885783785,0.10882826684646636,0.0,0.07400104835730079,0.0,0.08294793441052273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893010977860759,0.0,0.06716242299582534,0.18737798039386533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05940891599725635

COVID19_support,iheartmusiclol,2020/03/07,"For those with health anxiety I have severe health anxiety with OCD. Yay!

I did counselling a while back and thought I’d share some tips.

1. Everyone is worried, but some have better self-soothing coping mechanisms. We need to up our game with the self-soothing. 

2. One really important breakthrough in therapy for me was to understand that people can get through illness (even serious) and keep living a fulfilled life. I was in panic-catastrophising-doom mode and my brain wasn’t working properly - I was convinced my life was over...without being ill!

We don’t know enough about the virus yet to know what’s going to happen. We don’t know how it is going to personally affect us and we can’t control that anymore than what we’re already doing. Yes, it could kill us, that is a possibility. But there’s lots of things in life that can kill us and we don’t obsess over them. By continuing to search online, you are trying to control what’s going to happen to you, but you can’t (because you’ve already done all you can). 

3. Stop looking online. You’ve likely prepped in every way possible. You know you will self isolate if you get sick. You know every precaution possible now. Looking at coronavirus subreddits is just carrying on the cycle of your fear and taking you out of whatever you’re doing in the moment. It could even be your mind’s version of escapism - I know it is for me. It’s a way to make my mind obsess and worry over something out of control. But the best coping mechanism is self-soothing. 

4. Identify what makes you feel better and do it as soon as you feel anxious (if you can). Baths, reading, listening to music, reaching out to friends. Take this time as a time to look after yourself and prioritise yourself. Treat yourself as if you’re already unwell (which we are as mental illness is very real) and you need to wind down a bit and do things to make yourself feel better. Learn to believe you deserve to self soothe and you deserve to switch off from scary things. For me, I have a maladaptive belief that if I keep thinking about something constantly, I am keeping myself prepared. Actually what I’m doing is keeping my body in a constant state of anxiety that will make it harder for me to fight a potential infection. Self soothing is a preventative measure! 

And finally...

Here’s an exercise I did in therapy. It makes you challenge your beliefs and rationalise them. 

Belief “if I get seriously ill, people won’t believe me or they’ll be angry”

Evidence for (valid childhood traumas that triggered the health anxiety in the first place):

Other kids thought I was faking it to skip school
People would get annoyed at me cancelling 
Some people got frustrated 
Lost out on jobs and opportunities 
Saw my sister not be believed with her long term health condition and it took her years to be diagnosed

Evidence against:

Took time off work and boss was fine
Kids who got angry with me had their own issues and got angry with a lot of people for other things
I am not responsible for other people’s reactions, nor can I control them 
People’s frustration is often with the health anxiety itself

New belief

“If I get seriously ill, it won’t necessarily make people angry. I can help myself more than I think. I can develop a support network”

I’ll try and do it with coronavirus:

“This is going to cause a global pandemic with serious implications. Im not going to have fun for months, could drag out years. I’m going to lose my job if I have to self isolate. I won’t be able to pay rent. I could die or someone I love could die”

Evidence for:

Bad job 
Higher mortality rate than flu
Countries going into lockdown
Scary stories emerging 
Hospitals won’t be able to cope 
Always get badly ill with respiratory infections

Evidence against:

There will be other jobs. Maybe work from home online jobs will pop up as the economy adapts 
Lower mortality rate than SARS
Most people have mild symptoms 
Landlords will have to accept late payments 
Sensationalist headlines from news outlets that don’t have the full picture yet who generate clicks out of fear 
If I self isolate, I can do that hobby I’ve always wanted to do - play more guitar, write a book, watch every Netflix series. It’s a chance to reevaluate what’s important in my life 
One year of no holidays is nothing compared to all the holidays I’ll go on in the rest of my life 

It is scary, there are no doubts about that. But after coronavirus, there will be something else to be scared about. Before coronavirus, there was world war three in January!

Once I stopped worrying I had cancer, I started worrying I had a brain tumour. You need to tackle the anxiety itself.

Belief “I am going to get ill and die”

Reality “anxiety about potential events I have no control over is ruling and ruining my life right now”

The best thing you can do for yourself right now is treat your anxiety because that’s the biggest threat to you, as it’s stopping you going about your daily life with a healthy mind.

Sending lots of love everyone, I’m scared with you. Definitely not trying to invalidate anyone’s fears - trying to encourage you to cope with something beyond your control",5.0576323987538965,6.9468415379023885,5.739095327102808,76.78557757009347,69.75804776739356,8.625096573208722,30.908535825545172,9.174902378510234,2.9228448847352024,4103,174,701,84,75,1332,383,963,0.22,0.672,0.10800000000000001,-0.9990000000000001,8,1,4,0,1,0,102.0,10,28,5,19,25,49,8,8,33,2,95,32,3,17,2,140,162,46,8,18,20,1,3,1,1,12,27,1,4,8,49,47,0,14,21,10,2,13,19,27,0,4,23,10,92,22,131,112,20,88,5,3,6,2,67,39,0,19,34,483,141,15,0.07766092722865334,0.0,0.037892931125865885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12855114653716562,0.0,0.06462011274140808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23764158705045735,0.04386737123214999,0.03850938584858336,0.027151163012386417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029858229657941424,0.06484363033682808,0.047341380415921286,0.0,0.03304186453700806,0.13124590604874564,0.08150035182801778,0.10302716862815113,0.0423928092649418,0.043131891374110894,0.0,0.0866952787978638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03988958247539498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839238727843251,0.26131000058884,0.15501482766229255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039412103193703786,0.12089967207628499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03973704592646663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03243786973350755,0.0,0.0,0.04012224895080917,0.0,0.051294309996876855,0.0,0.09814902101769983,0.07420834405289971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310852012328179,0.058901547384871265,0.0,0.0,0.042536874871428224,0.0,0.03302917251379473,0.0,0.0,0.03000031986529908,0.0,0.14201120199142087,0.0,0.22068247320406995,0.0,0.09316880694820737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06867530146914731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20637483513844754,0.0,0.0,0.026027241249639326,0.0,0.0389501210476507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041943564044483586,0.04052891554218992,0.19266621749195836,0.13805720084978013,0.08592030955486712,0.0,0.12804124378848122,0.0,0.04380245429290559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19198973362825492,0.01897060311948169,0.0,0.034288010778522456,0.0343637383752494,0.09782342920161603,0.04344135633650758,0.042388038019405085,0.09903681472314337,0.07009201890889644,0.0,0.15551781591632732,0.0,0.0390104198696356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03913197430072935,0.0,0.11762309678876208,0.0,0.03099410559272345,0.0,0.0,0.08637689025301595,0.0,0.03750270372665086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037258877101341424,0.0,0.0,0.04135317646002031,0.052625054170729615,0.0,0.0,0.045559182560644174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422813883295732,0.03390526306722734,0.04056956983408373,0.0,0.0,0.1313265400223547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038840971689247966,0.04419756866346214,0.02487578930218464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06632200752117272,0.0,0.0,0.07775213621417633,0.03929850223721172,0.0,0.0,0.3240691372734708,0.04386737123214999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032900925810801764,0.1195743519004736,0.0,0.0,0.02748440200551981,0.0,0.0,0.0973920188839223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044064349947725436,0.0,0.040359719614258514,0.058391352254302566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08881203850288523,0.0,0.12898617306107305,0.04976198635731937,0.0,0.0616541014097996,0.06792706679949134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628414766712847,0.10545334358221356,0.0,0.0,0.04042388205236437,0.1401247999774605,0.0,0.0,0.032039199136948734,0.02290321350235116,0.06164362921549053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03743118125588545,0.0,0.08480711993945826,0.1577368827036287,0.0,0.027584047251189632,0.0,0.0,0.07501663638260474

COVID19_support,ActualCity,2020/03/08,"Can't help feeling guilty for something I can't control I have a family member who works for a local homeless shelter and we were talking today about what will happen if it reaches the shelter. I'm lucky enough to be young and in good health but I grew up volunteering in this shelter and I know there is going to be a lot of deaths if they have to quarantine and those who rely on them for food might face starvation. 

These people have been nothing but kind and supportive and it's breaking my heart to think that they're going to be extra vulnerable in this situation. I wish I could just take the virus so they don't have to. I don't have the means to donate to them at the moment and I don't think there is anything I can do to help them and it's stuck in my head constantly that they're going to be a vulnerable and probably ignored population in an outbreak. I've tried talking about this with friends and family but it turns into a sort of ""well you'll be fine so don't worry about it"" but it's not something I can just turn off.

If anyone has suggestions on if I can help or how to cope with this feeling I'd really appreciate it, it's becoming a little overwhelming.",4.048733219428847,5.070382850622412,5.313097388332928,82.22015621186237,71.11618257261411,8.492164998779595,27.45447888699048,8.841846274778883,1.9908245545521108,941,32,191,17,17,314,126,241,0.1,0.779,0.121,0.7257,0,1,2,0,0,0,10.0,1,1,5,2,11,9,0,1,11,0,29,5,3,2,0,41,46,22,1,6,12,0,2,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,19,14,1,2,6,0,1,4,7,2,1,0,3,2,20,7,32,34,3,22,0,1,0,0,16,13,0,9,4,141,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09597868590205667,0.0,0.11295717133625124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15159810223826395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833440140255202,0.15395405872755727,0.10959471200237862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418311520569876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25880192923876466,0.0,0.13881033660862882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16598104793750698,0.0,0.10605038450836113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23403211608371696,0.11513113719173446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12138274124628375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14087320669602416,0.14590598178652991,0.0,0.16265935768713913,0.2760169512801237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429400861646665,0.0754371019912783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13757531320652255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11669755888193277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495215239054249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14561617936399812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13170920379143888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516207570429086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14799458760303624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879352964331921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542912998452561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21134617986275409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.155766381026907,0.0,0.0,0.10320598890838213,0.2206563697425536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17590738401418468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13011090748382528,0.0,0.0,0.09319373664013578,0.29860920418497183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12341747082897048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784765725678304,0.0,0.0,0.09993035317632587,0.13939898921893806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,irunfortacos77,2020/03/08,"Corona panic surrounding new job and trip Hey guys!  I've been lurking here for a while and realized I could use the support myself right now.  I wasn't super concerned about corona until it hit NYC, where I live, and it's been downhill since then.  I have asthma and I've already been having some breathing difficulties this week, which of course stresses me out. If I were to get the virus on top of my breathing the way it is now I'd be very concerned about myself.  I've been staying home and taking it easy because I'm between jobs, but I'm set to start my new job in Midtown (super crowded) tomorrow.  Not that I'd want to risk my health anyway, but I feel especially pressured to stay healthy right now because my family and I have booked a dream trip in 3 weeks and have thousands of dollars (that unfortunately won't be refundable, even given the current issues) invested.  Not to mention I just really need this trip, I've had a really rough last few months and the only thing that got me through most days was thinking about it, and I really can't handle the thought of not being able to go, or being sick and miserable while there.

It's gotten to the point where I'm having panic attacks about the thought of going out into public, let alone the thought of having to sit at a desk at work surrounded by people whose behaviors/health I have no idea about.  I went downstairs to get mail today and had a panic attack when a few people got into the elevator with me, to the point where I had to get out and then had an immediate breakdown. I tried to go to my workout class this yesterday and had to leave because I had a panic attack about the potential spread there.  My mom suggested I go see a doctor due to my difficulty breathing this week, but I'm terrified about putting myself in such a germ-laden environment.  Overall it's just really not good, and while I do know I need to speak to someone regarding the mental health issues I have going on, I haven't had much luck with that helping in the past.  It's at the point where I'm basically non-functional, I can't leave my apartment without having a full-on breakdown and I've been yelling at my dad on the phone for what seems like ever now because I am just freaking out so much and have so much anger and anxiety and everything. 

I guess I'm just looking for any reassurance, commiseration, or advice.  My big concern is my new job starting tomorrow.  They had originally offered for me to start after my trip and I told them I'd like to start earlier, which I now deeply regret.  I really don't think I'm going to be able to keep it under control having to sit in the office when I'm panicking like this and I really don't want to give a bad impression or start off unable to do my work to the best of my ability.  I feel like I have no control over the situation, I feel like by going in I'll be exposing myself to the great possibility of getting sick and will risk my health and my trip.  It stresses me out that so many places are asking people to work from home but as I'll just be starting I don't have that option at all.  I'm doing everything right, washing hands, using sanitizer, avoiding touching my face, but in an office in Manhattan who knows where everyone else has been, and I can't avoid touching everything and interacting with everyone, and I do have to walk through the city to get to work.  I know employers are being a bit more understanding with things due to this virus thing, would it be terrible if I told them that due to my difficulty breathing right now I'm concerned about my risk and would prefer to start in a few weeks?   I've just about had it, I have been nonstop panicking for days now and I've reached a breaking point today.  I've had to take my emergency panic attack medication (it essentially knocks me out) multiple times, and I can't continue living like this for much longer, let alone start a new job when I'm like this.  I need to stay healthy until my breathing issues clear up and until I've gone on my trip and I feel that by going into the office every day I'm majorly risking that.  Any advice or support is so appreciated!

TLDR; live in NYC and am starting new job in Midtown on Monday. Have been having panic attacks at the thought of even leaving my apt let alone going into an office every day and exposing myself to germs there. Have been having breathing difficulties this week and am nervous about what would happen if I was to get the virus on top of them, and I also have thousands invested in a trip in 3 weeks and I really cannot miss it.  Debating on whether it's okay to ask to push my start date back a few weeks so I can get through these breathing issues and my trip but can't decide if this is too drastic or not.  Also just don't know how to cope with this panic, I struggle with anxiety but have never experienced it to this extent before, I am full-on non functional right now",7.996956521739129,6.321254127310063,8.320392822069456,73.12253370234801,63.16837782340863,11.303240782073033,35.44496027140434,10.125756701596842,3.3656992054280863,3896,139,751,69,46,1292,337,974,0.174,0.746,0.079,-0.9985,8,5,0,0,1,0,74.0,0,0,4,11,53,48,6,19,44,1,89,18,9,6,4,130,172,73,0,15,30,2,8,7,0,5,9,2,2,1,47,52,0,5,20,3,4,22,22,30,0,2,35,13,84,18,127,118,16,157,0,3,2,0,26,61,0,15,73,514,131,15,0.08126441823870326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07941064898382832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12624814384359986,0.044838653147090436,0.06498712590546535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055262591077959874,0.0,0.06216705752211391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597126116309276,0.2311250186471295,0.0,0.03124366073619284,0.03392619740614986,0.09907607017850678,0.0,0.03457501725695738,0.0,0.042640996662668525,0.0,0.04435984870843452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09114495510844424,0.03244151270885485,0.0,0.0,0.10481765385275922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041588787767777136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033942996908022376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053674381823681706,0.036754159386326736,0.06846877727172647,0.0776516341372171,0.1095528287295142,0.0,0.03830443058371884,0.0,0.0821794631681046,0.05805531662712815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14860056562592638,0.03897811743429421,0.2078299873093873,0.034080369227207793,0.06499457891137701,0.0447971539983844,0.044760959260727054,0.040232275214975716,0.035930928334311316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727605529844514,0.0,0.0,0.027234913282492317,0.0,0.08151483738907947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04586881832625569,0.0,0.1696378789650314,0.2419271873894205,0.03611577440251654,0.0,0.0,0.08932159803170503,0.03312067354098105,0.0,0.12907092788863814,0.0,0.12464756022279022,0.0,0.13895591474489266,0.0,0.10763695520690207,0.0,0.03412082217689205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04119468256962338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040932675962543255,0.040947709994729097,0.0,0.0,0.04758795223808148,0.03243224166517958,0.0,0.11947739561850065,0.0903848046394408,0.0313380645690805,0.19621420381395424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030902625992733426,0.0,0.3337119989212465,0.0,0.0,0.03878804123471608,0.08450777319332951,0.0,0.04245201040485218,0.0,0.15364228443370298,0.04580671068046381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040846592856411984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1822102352632382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734984228865375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03237860999827448,0.03699003714320803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0336113832651911,0.045672305472977334,0.0,0.0,0.034427538930324256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875968674750969,0.1299255859013357,0.0,0.0,0.0930881165286256,0.042477607169977734,0.0,0.0,0.09221789879035508,0.0,0.0,0.061100729033870614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098270279815117,0.05207095789396962,0.0,0.1290297415158549,0.023692967893064038,0.0,0.07702916649127277,0.0776516341372171,0.0,0.027586602823784227,0.0,0.0,0.042299562665063364,0.0,0.07018636554932113,0.0,0.03352582787264837,0.04793185936566249,0.03225195632528398,0.2281489508093026,0.0,0.0,0.03766646493032263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039167999627291235,0.0,0.11832292866465195,0.0,0.0,0.08659186669006617,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Verietas,2020/03/08,"Advice needed Please help

Hi, my husband and I live with our two cats in a major world capital. We have our own apartment, but it's in a really old building, so I'm worried about the plumbing as I have read that the virus can be transmitted through faulty plumbing or water supply. Also if stuff goes really bad, living in a city with 20 million people who would do alot to get food really scares me as we live in the centre of town.

The alternative option is that we move to our childhood homes back in a touristy beach town. It's way less crowded there, we have a garden with food set up and its alot better of a place if stuff goes completely downhill.

We planned moving at the end of March, but I'm really concerned about lockdowns and the situation going out of hand by then. So far my county has 33 official cases, but I'm highly dubious about that.
We have to wait till the end of March because my husband is doing a diploma required for us to move to Germany, so he doesn't want to stop now when he's close to graduating.

I need some serious advice please, because everyday I wake up worried and it really harms me mentally and physically.

I tried to Google it, but only found numbers for the UK. 

In the US, do we all have one number to call, or does each state have their own hotline? And where do I find these numbers?

COVID19_support,keraunic,2020/03/08,"Baby's first crisis event My whole life I've lived super off the grid. A tiny country in latin america where nothing ever happened and worldwide events never really affected me. Whenever something scary seemed like it would happen, I was always able to reassure myself ""well, it won't be too bad here"".

Well, 6 months ago I moved to the United States. I live in Washington (hah) now, right at the epicenter of the outbreak.

I'm not particularly worried about the illness itself; I'm young, healthy, and so is everyone I care about who lives here. But I read about all these events being cancelled, and I went to the store today and half the shelves were empty, and it kinda hit me that shit's getting real in a way I've never seen before.

I'm only 18, so I haven't really experienced any scary world events that I can remember. Even the whole Ebola thing I don't remember being anywhere near this level. I feel so out of my depth. I'm glad my parents aren't here so they don't get sick, but I also miss the feeling of nothing being able to hurt me.

I don't know what to think, what to believe, and I flip-flop between panicking and thinking that everything will be alright. It just feels like I can't even make plans for anything, because I don't know how things will change. What will things be like in two weeks? In a month? In the summer? What would it take for things to go back to normal?

I have all these questions that don't really have easy answers, so I guess in a way I'm just looking to vent. I hope you're all taking care of yourselves out there.",3.94369914721096,5.246879083601288,4.7085586467216585,85.38824828743186,71.66881028938907,7.466573465678737,26.0619320564798,7.893859768569023,1.4317511813225217,1229,39,245,16,23,396,177,311,0.08199999999999999,0.78,0.138,0.9198,1,0,1,0,1,0,39.0,0,0,1,3,25,16,1,0,14,2,26,4,1,3,6,42,56,16,0,4,5,1,3,3,0,6,3,0,0,0,22,9,0,0,12,1,1,3,12,4,2,3,4,6,26,12,31,39,5,40,0,2,2,0,5,17,1,5,20,161,48,1,0.19987696787410472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08858943606712537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07992076949768102,0.08315682454065529,0.0,0.0,0.06796159611383586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08224085696950073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684652531313185,0.0834444596541759,0.060921572212555675,0.0,0.08504028901328123,0.11259644836017405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20378788984925567,0.0,0.10572166463532864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13201685219626635,0.09040008030724787,0.0,0.09549550417149423,0.08981826529197838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15159570088209362,0.0713960728932835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500762338325855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10442746609659896,0.0,0.056797343504692975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009350722096814,0.0,0.17675054258724746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09926146430833112,0.0,0.0,0.1069862140315032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10984715430931316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07058950673683775,0.14647468549149786,0.0,0.2647425368229612,0.0,0.08392315635677057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06670971406302834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15953988881960504,0.10621879242105528,0.0,0.0,0.15415743964872253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09791849530902837,0.1917873413868374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07600772043468966,0.0,0.0,0.11096985948990153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195397400601192,0.0,0.0999655287101244,0.113751874038931,0.1920694556436333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2264216409151088,0.08534691922764365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09098024234933487,0.0,0.0,0.10258541760678007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07693752748730957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15028260484575656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2655787520354989,0.12807309033549422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09472999727211777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09762537717682518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15865303359141308,0.08016462361788049,0.0,0.17971339837766412,0.09264397585047332,0.0,0.2231554966134056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149238156752988,0.0,0.141986863227397,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,feelinnumb,2020/03/09,"Two different realities being portrayed about COVID19, not sure which one to believe While many on Reddit and some scientific professionals are sounding the alarm, the other side of the coin is saying that this will all blow over soon and we'll look back and be astonished that any alarm was raised at all.

It's hard to determine which reality is the truth and what isn't, and it's somewhat messing with my head. My intuition wants to sound the alarm, but the rational side of me is still wanting to believe it won't affect me. Is this just me, or is this our human condition? Any way to balance these two?",9.903275862068966,7.558430362068968,9.12351724137931,70.97320689655173,60.03448275862069,12.728275862068967,39.5793103448276,11.20814326018867,4.203091724137931,486,19,92,10,5,154,79,116,0.07,0.9,0.03,-0.4001,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,2,0,0,0,5,6,0,3,6,0,13,1,1,1,4,19,16,8,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,3,0,3,0,1,13,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,4,0,3,1,5,7,2,12,10,4,10,0,0,1,0,4,5,0,3,4,70,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2992590752079497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16919128900115932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4958022020484228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.229886965606668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19710575942981895,0.0,0.2258166619426911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18477175048826125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22307825906822548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14909960923509494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749785495918057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17571811232950535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2073778781006672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4298792518325836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25956155198242997,0.17465143119937795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,23andme_irl,2020/03/09,"my story &amp;#x200B;

I live and work in Seattle.

On Feb 17th, I came down suddenly with a bad cough, then next day I felt out of it and sick. The day after that I had chills, muscle aches, next day I had a fever and even worse chills. I remember thinking I have not felt this sick since I was a kid. I was cold and dizzy and constantly coughing. It was during this time that the second wave of confirmed cases / deaths in happened in Seattle .

I tried to go back to work the next week, but everyone was talking about coronavirus by this time. I was still coughing and felt kinda dizzy. I decided I'd stay home until my cough went away. A few days later (March 3rd) they told everyone to work from home until the end of March as King County had issued recommendations for everyone to stay home.

I called an urgent care place and told them my symptoms. They said they can't test me because I don't qualify (having symptoms AND knowing someone who tested positive OR had traveled to china recently.) They prescribed me cough suppressant and told me to rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I had a lot of anxiety. Was I going to be okay? Should I avoid all people? Why can't I get tested just to know? What if I get quarantined?

&amp;#x200B;

Their decision not to test me boils down to this:

* There aren't enough tests right now.
* I'm not dying, I'm not particularly at risk (I am in my early 30s).
* There is no cure or treatment. There is no special course of treatment for corona vs the flu.
* A lot more people have it than they can test, so the healthcare system is in a reactive, underprepared mode of action where they are trying to treat the very ill.

&amp;#x200B;

It was pretty demoralizing to feel like I might have the virus that is shutting down businesses and events all over my city and not qualify for testing.

I am convinced I probably have it. This is week 3 for me and the cough is fading and I'm starting to feel less wiped out. Once I get better I will hopefully have some immunity.

 I am trying to avoid social gatherings until my symptoms are completely gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been stressful but I will be okay. I guess the strangest part will not be knowing I had it or not.",3.3600460034502566,5.422494825059104,4.155646284582456,85.63108108108109,74.74468085106382,7.126164462334675,25.38042297616765,8.00916892397051,1.506408140054949,1713,59,333,27,37,548,213,423,0.09,0.8059999999999999,0.10400000000000001,0.9011,0,3,0,0,0,0,70.0,0,0,8,5,11,14,0,4,18,2,44,16,0,0,2,57,73,25,2,3,15,0,5,1,0,5,15,1,3,1,18,17,1,3,12,1,0,7,13,5,0,1,24,7,48,9,49,41,11,60,0,0,0,0,18,20,0,11,31,228,66,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3552165925409813,0.3983638271947383,0.0,0.0,0.05015963558941455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06160365674132377,0.050418041305856,0.05474686326344736,0.03996987933695737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0579899087903888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06695265278133966,0.0749927656197715,0.06685133912162222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874720491225189,0.07085613134237029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691447377486564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06804963244011744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058074127999329414,0.06774966995900593,0.0,0.043307300362499496,0.0,0.0,0.18796020721391749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06630669183561634,0.046842067842908064,0.18886779829440234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10277032587362464,0.0,0.07452804923095609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223096909008586,0.0,0.057981906928675934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19731131091955748,0.06512420161073942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06843635946594702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10810401005244837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03203340126431902,0.0,0.05789808583870235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114877935433521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06955769553813082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20919816613668596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06982819084637594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710041721169887,0.0,0.09091372562480722,0.0,0.06850500753354664,0.0,0.061983318058590225,0.0,0.0,0.06670662051370893,0.07069380964906936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474087064650495,0.0,0.07427619920146787,0.05599504312541213,0.0623705498068073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05423884621331534,0.0,0.0,0.06683871199627336,0.05555588042336308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04640964087475597,0.13977435000273702,0.05236299751552422,0.0,0.0751083642831234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20445197527609327,0.0,0.05270138473670346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04201357401907242,0.0,0.0,0.0764669059734761,0.0,0.0,0.18796020721391749,0.0,0.13354988959855915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05410078507663933,0.0,0.0,0.10519000796367894,0.0,0.0,0.060782550442390684,0.059165269581279725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14320369710871486,0.0,0.06681978668884513,0.0,0.0,0.3983638271947383,0.0
COVID19_support,SodiumOverloadium,2020/03/09,"Any fellow immunosuppressor users out there? I need knowledge... or something. Hello, I've been taking an immunosupressor for Chron's for about a year now. (M21)

When I first started taking it last year, I was initially worried about getting sick all the time, but in the past year I got ill only once or twice, and it wasn't even horribly prolonged or anything. I am also somewhat ignorant of how these drugs work, but I assume it's only impairing part of my immune system.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been feeling hopeful about covid, but last night I was reading r/Coronavirus articles for a while, and my anxiety just spiraled out of control. I kept reading numbers about how people with compromised immune systems are at risk and death percentages of those people, etc. I also read numbers about how fast it is expected to spread. Basically, some engineer chick on twitter, as you may have seen, did some kind of Order of Magnitude estimation, and said the US will run out of hospital beds by april or may(?) This is paraphrasing, but given the horrible system we have it's not surprising.

&amp;#x200B;

I essentially convinced myself that catching this will be inevitable.  I was literally sitting there thinking about how since i have a suppressed immune system, I would suddenly go into a severe state within hours and suddenly die as some people \*supposedly have\*  (Again, something I read in reports on r/Coronavirus that said some people seemed fine and then instantly passed away...)

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am calling my RN from my GI doctor to discuss my medication and risks. I trust medical science and the opinions of experts. I will take whatever precautions necessary. I understand that statistics is just a bastardization of probability theory and can be grossly misunderstood at times! I do research at school and im a stats geek! But as you can tell, I have debilitating anxiety at times. I know that no one can have answers right now, but what do you think? If you take an immune suppressor drug, what do you think, how have you been mentally dealing with this?

I've got my prep, my plan, and feel ready enough that I've been paying less attention to all this in the past week. Great, right? So I had this dream/nightmare that I woke up from a few hours ago, still haven't shaken it. 

Basically it involved my workplace and work, a deceased former coworker who was sort of a role model for me, and who died from alcoholism last year, me coughing up white junk, a symbolic portrayal of the River Styx, standing at the shore with with my silent former coworker as the grim reaper.  On the other side was an island with construction vehicles, ready to build because soon the island would be crowded with people. 

I've long told myself I'm fine with death, sorta ok with dying, but just afraid of a life where part of me is dead/damaged and my existence is less than living. Now... I'm not sure, of any of it. 

Anyone else going though this stuff?",7.417450110864742,6.9914558536585405,6.9318403547671865,78.55811529933483,63.63414634146342,9.991130820399112,30.34368070953437,9.339509955726095,2.4502682926829267,850,24,159,13,11,265,136,205,0.048,0.8809999999999999,0.071,-0.1452,0,0,2,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,2,7,6,0,1,12,1,10,3,0,0,3,27,20,11,4,1,4,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,13,14,1,0,3,0,1,2,3,2,0,0,7,2,12,4,30,11,7,28,0,1,1,0,6,11,0,2,13,99,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14921298265881014,0.17989188263020134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446909374967765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2353982818036884,0.17247235227828486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102611438808705,0.18590550837507627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450000238476675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34939663621288874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14061679046963968,0.0,0.0,0.1739282486870198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14182394874294765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511190382312439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09566491680803443,0.0,0.13462760977189225,0.1855826706904065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657695806165884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372101239070237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11889533687331345,0.0,0.0,0.1486370734846307,0.14896534940685388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1822832688816359,0.16068851792343392,0.11669772774614832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1591247597850189,0.18976499498003432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078354923060468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437515458281943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12958743688217012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13442728886190322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19269576181384326,0.0,0.0,0.15864753811338314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078580508900085,0.16538181210843866,0.0,0.09815365186671128,0.0,0.0,0.160845013136089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13361125999326678,0.13502290030022746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12254509017631172,0.0,0.0,0.1195756757299782,0.0,0.0,0.10839797975444143
COVID19_support,yelbesed,2020/03/09,I cannot see clearly if an airplane can or cannot be safe I have  an air ticket valid in ten days. I decided not to fly now. But then I read that in China there are not so many cases and anyway most cases if under 65 are not life dangerous and that you should be afraid of going to a hospital but an air travel is not dangerous. Then I read that on the street there is no danger but if we are closer than 2 metres and in the same space longer than 15 minutes - then there is danger of infection (even if the other person has no symptoms). So practically that excludes airplane travel. (or they should somehow let people sit further away from each other). I do not undesrtand why air routes are not closed - and yes buyers reimbursed - or why is it not everywhere expected that people arriving from abroad should self-quarantine?,5.065414772727274,6.162212393750004,5.717727272727274,79.97636363636367,68.8125,8.818181818181818,27.04545454545455,9.095868883498916,2.1565625,653,20,121,12,11,212,95,160,0.127,0.843,0.031,-0.9424,0,1,0,0,0,0,15.0,1,1,1,0,9,6,4,1,7,1,20,3,0,0,1,34,22,19,0,8,17,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,8,7,0,1,1,5,1,3,11,5,0,1,0,1,9,1,14,16,3,23,0,0,1,0,4,14,0,9,5,97,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2253788170930277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15470526803050375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15844105112424606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13633154640848089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2452975366242976,0.16943709018450498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24320461960797235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326105790258131,0.20945736551842345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4798976246298062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19115640749886295,0.0,0.2502512206015764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2493312181858892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4329158097614702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Illusion13,2020/03/09,"I've had zero social life since the first case of coronavirus here in Vancouver in Jan 27, at ""voluntary"" social distancing at the demand of my parents. I don't know how much longer I can take. This is going to be as much about my unhealthy relationship with my parents/living situation as the actual outbreak itself. I am going to try to not make this political so please don't make it political (think that's not what this subreddit is about anyways).

We are from China, but I've been a Canadian citizen for over 20 years and I actually haven't visited China for over 2 years. I am just over 30 but I am sure many of you would understand that I am still living at home since I am not married. I've actually lived on my own for 3 and a half years when I worked away, but have since moved back in when I transferred back to Vancouver, and never really enjoyed living under my parent's roof. Its very much ""their"" house even though I have joint ownership of it. 

My mom worked in public health in the past and still has friends in that sector. She has WeChat groups with people who are still actively working, so she claims she gets accurate information. Unfortunately from what I can see, the misinformation is just as rampant. She claims that she has never seen an outbreak that warranted a city lock down since shes been born, and that's why it needs to be taken seriously.

I had plans to go out on Jan 27. The evening of Jan 26 was when local misinformation started circulating, and a local city councillor posted rumours of a person who called her saying they were discharged from hospital here, went back to Shanghai, and got diagnosed with coronavirus. Parents panicked, they told me to cancel my plans, don't go to restaurant, public place, etc. I said I am still going to work, how can I even hide from this, and I never thought there's no cases here anyways, but the risk is low so why the heck are you demanding this of me. Nevertheless, the shouting match ended in me canceling my plans and agreeing to stay home. It angered me further when the rumours were false the next day, but Vancouver did announce its real first presumptive case. The beginning of social distancing that day also meant that I watched the Superbowl at home a few days later, instead of going out, having fun. A few days later they furthered the demand to avoid more public places like the gym. 

We had more fights over the next month, I said I'll stay home and appease them, but if there are no local cases for 2 weeks I am ending the madness. Unfortunately, every week here would be one case that trickles in and ruins my count. I'd have more fights about them listening to misinformation, panicking for no reason, not following local guidelines, not trusting local health officials. They'd say I am naïve, don't know how to protect myself, protect my family, etc.

The thing that doesn't make sense is that I go to work full time. I am a pharmacist myself and have peers who are by no means stupid. I see the panic buying that has ransacked our shelves of hand sanitizers, rubbing alcohol, and gloves. We haven't had masks since Jan 20 ish, for some reason that's not been in good supply since the flu season of 2018. I see that if there is an outbreak, there's almost NO way that I can avoid it being in the position that I am in, all I have is my own immune system and the hope that I am one of the 80% mild symptoms. Avoiding restaurants and social outings seems to be a negligible effort to me, and it has killed me emotionally. Meanwhile I am hearing about my friends going out, there are still events going on around to attend, like the 10 year Olympics anniversary, there was a WWE televised event, Wetsuwet protests (HA), none of which I can attend but I see tons of people going, and I am sitting at home after work doing pretty much nothing, and yet somehow that's supposed to protect me when I go to work with NO protective equipment and would be called an idiot for wanting to put on protective equipment. We've also had countless fights about stop trying to hunt for masks, I've read countless sources that they don't work, and finally I found a report on one of the coronavirus subs that say they do.

They claim that nobody is putting chains on me to force me to stay home. I wonder if anyone would even understand the moral chains and guild tripping Asian parents can put on you... 

Its embarrassing when friends joke about it being ""house arrest"". Its embarrassing when people at work ask me what I've been doing my days off and I say ""nothing"". Its embarrassing when I seem to be the nut swimming in misinformation and panic. But I also do know the seriousness of this outbreak, entire provinces and countries even wont be quarantined if it wasn't serious. I am still going to work, healthy, its better than being stuck in a tiny cabin afloat on one of the cruise ships, being refused entry and help from multiple governments around the world.

But it just makes my blood boil wondering wtf I've been doing the last 6 weeks. It makes my blood boil thinking about the last 5 or 6 weeks of my life that I'll never get back way BEFORE the situation here got serious. I have way more scattered thoughts that I don't even know to post in this one message that might still come to mind later. Are my friends who are still going out and having fun the idiots?

Meanwhile, perhaps its right to do my part to protect the parents (as much as I hate them), and prevent the drama that's sure to ensue if I did catch it, protect the idiots I work with, protect the patients I interact with, etc...

COVID19_support,pteiavn,2020/03/09,"How to use math to figure out how likely it is that someone at your workplace is infected [Cross-posted to [China_Flu](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ffhhm2/how_to_use_math_to_figure_out_how_likely_it_is/).  I think it is appropriate here because it will help people panic less and be less anxious if they can make decision such as whether to go to work based on an informed judgement rather than vague fear.]

Do you ever wonder how likely it is that someone at your workplace is infected?  I'm going to show you how to use math to approximate how likely this is.  I'll use two cases to demonstrate the method.  When applying it to your own workplace, don't just change the numbers, you have to understand the math so you can adapt it to your particular situation.

Case 1: Andy works in a city with a population of 1,000,000.  On April 1st, there are 20 symptomatic cases of the virus.  He works in a job where he interacts with 100 new people every day.  What are the odds that he'll interact with someone who has the virus on April 1st?  On April 5th?  On April nth?  When will the probability first surpass 5%?

Answer:

First we'll figure out how many actual cases there are.  Assuming Andy's city is not doing anything to contain the virus or slow the spread, [the number of infected people will double every four days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).  Let's take our [average incubation period to be 5 days](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#growth-the-doubling-time-of-covid-19-cases).  (Andy can play with these numbers to be more or less careful and see how it affects the answer).  This means that on average, the number of symptomatic cases will be equal to the number of infected people *5 days ago*.  So there were 300 infected people 5 days ago, which means there are 2^(5/4)20 infected people on April 1st, which is about 48.

So far so good.

Now, on April 1st, what are the chances that a given person Andy interacts with will have the virus?  We divide the number of infected people by the population: 49/1,000,000.  The chances that they don't have the virus is 1-48/1,000,000.  The chances that *none* of the 100 people Andy interacts with have the virus is (1-48/1,000,000)^100.  Thus the chances that any of them have the virus is 1-(1-48/1,000,000)^100 = 0.5%.

What about on April 5th?  Now 4 days have passed, so the number of infected people has doubled.  It is now about 96.  We run the same calculation again, to find that the probability that any of the 100 people Andy interacts with has the virus is 1-(1-96/1,000,000)^100 = 1.0%.

On April nth, (n-1) days have passed from April 1st so the probability is 1-(1-2^[(n-1)/4] 48/1,000,000)^100.

To find when it first surpasses 5%, look at desmos: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hpxghaqepg  You can see that this happens on the 14th day, or April 15th.

Case 2: Brenda works in a city with a population of 80,000.  On day 0, there are 10 symptomatic cases.  At her job, she works with the same 50 people every day.  If someone displays symptoms, they are put on mandatory sick leave.  What are the odds that at least one of her coworkers comes to work with the virus on day n, given that none of them have yet been put on sick leave?  How is the probability affected if one of them is put on sick leave?

Answer:

We'll make some simplifying assumptions.  Let's say Brenda works every single day, including weekends.  Also let's say that the incubation period is always exactly 5 days.  Again, you can alter these assumptions to see how much the solution depends on them.

As above, the number of actual cases in Brenda's city can be approximated as 2^(5/4)10=24.

On day n, there are about 2^(n/4)24 actual cases in Brenda's city.  Her coworkers are asymptomatic, which means that if they contracted the virus they contracted it with the last 5 days.  How many people contracted it in the last 5 days?  Well, 5 days ago, 2^((n-5)/4)24 people were infected.  So we can subtract to find how many people contracted the virus in the last n days: 2^(n/4)24 - 2^[(n-5)/4] 24 = 2^(n/4)24 - 2^(n/4)2^(-5/4)*24 = (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24.  The probability that a given coworker didn't contract it in the last 5 days is 1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000.  Thus the probability that none of her coworkers contracted it in the last 5 days is (1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000)^50.  So the probability that at least one of them has the virus on day n is 1 - (1 - (1-2^(-5/4))2^(n/4)24/80,000)^50.

We calculate some values:

Day 0: 0.87%
Day 1: 1.0%
Day 2: 1.2%
Day 3: 1.5%
Day 4: 1.7%
Day 7: 2.9%
Day 14: 9.4%
Day 21: 28%

Now, if one of Brenda's coworkers is put on sick leave on day n, all her other coworkers could have been infected in the last 5 days at work.  Brenda can estimate how likely this was, based on how careful she thinks her coworkers were being.  Say she estimates that each coworker had a 1% chance of catching the virus from the infected coworker each day.  Then there are 5(days)50(workers)=250 opportunities for the virus to be caught, so the probability that it is caught is 1-(1-0.01)^250 = 92%.  So she can be reasonably confident that someone at work is infected.  Suppose people are way more careful and Brenda estimates the probability that a worker catches the virus on a given day as 0.1%.  Then the probability that someone has the virus on day n is 1-(1-0.001)^250 = 22.1%.

___________________________________________________
The above has been a [Back-of-the-envelope calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation).  The point is not to be completely accurate, but just to get the answer to within an order of magnitude, i.e. probably less than ten times too big or too small.  There were many assumptions made, and they can be modified to get different answers.  I hope this technique is helpful to people.

Some things I didn't account for:

If you're not in South Korea, you probably don't know the number of symptomatic cases.  Rather, you just know the number of confirmed cases.  You'll have to do some approximation for how many confirmed cases you think there are.

If the people you interact with in your job are largely from a certain community, then a symptomatic case in that community contributes way more to the probability of an infected person at your workplace than a symptomatic case elsewhere in the city.

COVID19_support,RapturedKitten,2020/03/09,"Trying to not be afraid, but failing quite miserably I have been reading this sub for about a week. This whole thing sucks, but I'm so glad I'm not alone. I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety mainly because my family may not be able to weather this very well. My mom has a lot of pre-existing conditions including being on immunosuppressants. I have been spending time working on letting go of the things I can't control. I am trying to move beyond worrying about every sniffle and scratchy throat. I'm reminding myself that it is still cold and flu season and with temps increasing and snow melting, seasonal allergies.

I'm just frustrated.  People aren't taking this seriously; they don't even take the flu seriously. I am in charge of cleaning my church campus and last week was absolute hell for me. I feel like I'm not doing enough. At church today, I was hyperaware of people coughing into their hands, touching their faces, not thoroughly washing their hands, using hand sanitizer then wiping it off on their pants.

People are treating this like it's some kind of joke. For my mom, this isn't a joke. I will say the same thing about the flu. For my dad, it isn't a joke because he developed pneumonia after getting the flu. For my friend who attends this church, it isn't a joke because she survived sepsis last year. There are many vulnerable people who attend my church. As for me, well, viral respiratory infections kick my ass.

Even though it may not help, I am planning on putting hand washing reminders by every sink. I wish people understood that loving thy neighbor includes getting needed vaccines, washing your hands, staying home when you're sick. There is nothing holy about going to church sick.

To try to stay sane, I pray and read my Bible. I have been meditating on Psalm 91. In my prayers, I obviously pray for a miracle and protection. I also pray for those who are sick, those who lost loved ones, the frontline healthcare workers, public health officials, the scientists, and the Trump Administration. I'm also praying for all of you.",5.524241107792561,7.39563479002625,5.7316933659154685,77.36929133858268,68.55380577427822,8.614752466286541,31.248167254955202,9.130062681391069,2.8668589193592187,1649,69,283,32,29,523,210,381,0.161,0.6659999999999999,0.17300000000000001,0.6682,0,1,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,2,5,8,18,23,3,2,15,0,33,23,8,2,2,34,54,17,0,2,9,3,7,2,2,3,13,1,3,0,24,11,0,2,2,6,1,7,12,9,2,1,8,9,36,14,42,39,9,33,11,3,0,3,24,11,3,5,15,189,60,6,0.10273265413743786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10640004713896628,0.0,0.16431053279484684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0785901992235002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878746172964815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11522340715002595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591285543999296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10615029389344907,0.0,0.13570789832608202,0.0,0.17311338386766464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968472033486984,0.0,0.05194471670276687,0.0733922286427405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937099374721747,0.0,0.10734714330575763,0.0,0.11677066964249914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092000073526113,0.0,0.0,0.06885953255691557,0.0,0.10304922840847272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698025035739492,0.0,0.16748164933341392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10505109920579923,0.0,0.10037997116950502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11214482764520606,0.17467925758634414,0.1854404626192943,0.0,0.0,0.10415478676769988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2406384857896079,0.0,0.10918855314597063,0.0,0.07617496132217623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09857475235987563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961430518551437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35610943565706776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10327469235759516,0.0,0.10926882328751747,0.2055209101052974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169712995690045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2189986805918612,0.08204243029933715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15448434134959238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047530315971691,0.0,0.1009343110878577,0.0,0.05990423678166006,0.0,0.0973785439083372,0.0,0.0,0.20924618583238244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08872802849535599,0.0,0.08476519869729933,0.0,0.0,0.16481187682176282,0.0,0.1847379875306591,0.0,0.0,0.11469733954986268,0.11813748224697188,0.0,0.0,0.07479059575206029,0.10432999703827052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06615646104213793

I hate seeing them so scared. I went through my hand washing demo again and talked about the keeping hands off each other and faces [I do this weekly during cold season]..but inside I am kind of freaking out. Usually my 3am cant sleep worries are about gun violence but this one is taking the cake.

We live in a tourist town.. I feel lucky that our room is cleaned pretty well every day and I have a decent amount of hand sanitizer and wipes but know that parents probably wont be able to donate more when we run out.

COVID19_support,Papi_83,2020/03/10,"There's one coronavirus case in my city. And the worst part that I've been feeling sick today. It's probably unlikely, some asshole smoked a cigarette near me in my school bus yesterday morning. It was strong and I was forced to breath in it for like 15 minutes. I hope that's what making me feel sick. Still feel weird about it though.

I don't travel a lot these days. I only get on a school bus.

But my siblings did to some public indoor pool party. 

All of the stores are running out of food because some people might have been overreacting, thinking it's doomsday.

There is five ish coronavirus cases in my state.

I probably will be fine but this is a little concerning. Let this sickness I have go away 😔🙏🏿. I hope everybody will be fine and that guy who has the sickness will recover.

COVID19_support,jollyhohnson,2020/03/10,"How do I support my friends who are in denial? How do I protect my mental health? I’m severely stressed out. My close friend is flying to NYC in may and she’s a risk factor because of asthma. She says it’s just another flu. She told me to buy up on plane tickets now because they’re so cheap. She says that it will all plateau in 2 months. 

My coworker told me today that it’s just the flu. She told me it’s the government distracting us to get more laws passed. I feel like I’m going insane. My other close friend is taking this seriously and is starting to feel the effects of misinformation on her community at work. But we don’t know what to do, as two single people besides advocate for healthy habits and getting the facts.

I complied my information from various public sources and stand behind my document, however, I am a firm believer in the power of crowd sourcing select information, so if anyone has any ideas to improve this, tag them right on down.

Please send this as far and as wide as needed to whomever you feel could benefit from a little foresight.

\*Final Note\* PLEASE CHECK YOUR SOURCES. There is a lot of false information circulating so please don't hastily act on any information you receive. You don't know who is posting to the internet so verify any the information you find important, with sources you trust.

Be safe and good luck to everyone.

COVID-19 Security Assessment (Small Business, personal contact with clients)

10 Mar 20

**Virus Facts**

**\*Not comprehensive; the following is collected from public sources, and is subject to frequent change\***

COVID-19 is the disease that is contracted when a person is infected by the coronavirus “SARS-CoV-2”

Experts predict 40% to 70% of the world’s population will be infected by end of 2020

Considered by some experts to be easier to contract than the Flu; the virus is believed to enter the body through the mouth, nose, eyes and other mucus membranes in the body. People are typically infected after touching a contaminated surface then unknowingly introducing the virus into their own body.

Present number of infected persons is 114,952 in 112 countries and is currently trending as increasing with an unknown exponential growth rate. The number of infected persons is widely considered as being under-reported, due to a lack of tests for the virus, poor virus test performance or restrictive testing policies within the regions.

Experts have calculated that approximately 5 % of infected people have required hospital intervention to survive. The likelihood of hospitalization increases with increased age, and when any other health issues are present in the person.

Multiple reports indicate that the virus may be spread without any recognisable symptoms by the carrier. It may be aerosolized which means it is spread into the air by any cough, sneeze or toilet flush containing the virus and air currents within the area may carry the virus to another contamination area but it is unknown exactly how far it may travel. Medical reports indicate a previous COVID-19 infection in China, is believed to have originated from a fellow bus passenger approximately 5 meters away.

Severe Infection by COVID-19 reported to last up to 1 month, some causing death.

Coronaviruses may survive for 4 to 5 days on paper at room temperature, 9 days on other inanimate objects.

Coronaviruses are inactivated within one minute of sodium hypochlorite solution (Commonly sold as commercial bleach, only specific brands use Sodium Hypochlorite within the solution) and hand sanitizer containing 60%- 70% ethanol but the virus remains on the contaminated surface. Common Soap and detergents surround microscopic particles on contact, including coronavirus, so it can be removed from the surface with water and common hygienic cleaning practices.

Voluntary Quarantine of 14 days has been recommended for anyone that has been in contact with an infected person during the window of infection. Reports from China indicate the quarantine period directed by the Chinese government has increased to 28 days, due to numerous accounts of transmission after the 14-day period. Local guidance may increase the recommended quarantine period in the future.

Statistically, everyone should expect to be in quarantine at some point during the course of this virus. There is expected to be at least one other wave of infections, in fall 2020. There is also a very high likelihood of local school, public gathering place, etc. closures in the near future due to containment measures.

Additionally, a UV light sanitizer box can be used to decontaminate cell phones and paperwork if used within the manufacturers’ instructions. Specifically, commercially available, certified UV sterilizers, or UV lights specifically designed for biological decontamination, installed within the manufacturers directions and operated within a container that is sealed from light seepage while in use, because UV sterilizers destroy any living cells, including human tissue.

**COVID-19 Contingencies and Recommendations**

Virus in area

\-Order office sanitizing supplies

\-Heightened sanitizing and microbe consciousness

\-Monitor known community infections

\-Monitor information of possible client infections

\-Ensure staff knowledge of sanitizing procedures and microbe safety

\-Ensure staff knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms

\-Procure office supplies for contingency planning

\-Sanitize parcels/client paperwork before use and ensure frequent hand washing during work

\-Notify clients of new policies, possible changes to business procedures and what to expect if a client is sick/quarantined or if the staff are sick/quarantined

\-Expect reduced productivity from employees, due to decontamination procedures, a greater frequency of psychological distractions and increased anxiety in the workplace

Area in quarantine

\-No travel in the area

\-Work remotely, use of cloud network and home teleconferencing

\-forward office phone to employee

\-Ensure ability for clients to sign documents remotely, (licence online identification verification)

\-Business operations are halted except for business functions that can work remotely or from a home business

\-Expect employees that can work during the quarantine to have extremely reduced productivity

Office Supply Problems

\- Due to the interruption of regular business operations in China, there is a significant and ongoing disruption in the fabrication and export of goods from that country. Because a large percent of goods worldwide depends on Chinese exports; the cost of office supplies is expected to increase and the availability of many goods is expected to be interrupted during the global course of the virus.

\-Stock office supplies in the event of an extended interruption. (Business has been halted for two months in some large cities in China)

Employer Infected

\-Predetermine if office closed or remain open

\-Establish procedures for work flow if employer is unable to work for extended period

\-Quarantine of staff is likely for a minimum of 14 days

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business

Employer household Infected

\-Home quarantine of infected family member is very resource intense and will likely result in household infection to various degrees. Quarantine likely for a minimum of 14 days after the last family member tests negative for the virus.

\-Expect to not work for the duration of the illness’ course through the household.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from employees who are able to work.

\-Detailed decontamination of office is required prior to return of business.

Employee/employee family member sick

\-Global procedure for people in close contact with any person infected with COVID-19, including colleagues, family members and their households, has been to voluntary quarantine for 14 days.

\-Expect employees will not return to work for a minimum of 14 days after a sequence of tests indicating the infected person is no longer infected and no other family members have symptoms of infection.

\-Detailed decontamination of home and office is required prior to return to business.

\-Expect greatly reduced productivity from the employees that are able to work.

**Priority items to consider:**

\-UV light sterilizer

\-Office decontamination supplies

\-Set office infection control policy

\-Is Document Drop Box outside the office practical in order to reduce contact with clients

\-Pre-establish Skype/Facetime accounts for staff and client meetings

\-Obtain video conference equipment for staff and familiarize everyone with the functions. Practice operating remotely during regular business operation

\-Determine if a secure office cloud network is appropriate and functional for remote business operations and verify it is working properly

\-Determine the requirements and employ a secure document transport/transfer system, such as a courier, encryption software, or USB security keys to allow for remote inter-business and client mail. Verify that the documents transfer system is functional during regular business operation.

\-Determine the applicability for remote identification verification, in the event that personal signatures are required for business operations during a quarantine. Employ a remote identification verification system that is appropriate to your business operations and will satisfy any local legal requirements.

\- Send and post a newsletter within the office, updating clients and employees of any changes to your business practices.",13.309747117250831,14.582973945770073,12.214565875099895,39.901764328119675,51.046276211135215,15.897891692354527,53.04913993226016,14.441279079484012,9.029588430947213,7529,482,773,298,76,2427,554,1383,0.069,0.865,0.067,-0.9585,18,13,0,0,0,0,236.0,0,8,3,25,15,22,1,1,95,0,89,41,8,15,2,159,105,72,1,23,21,0,4,3,1,12,32,0,8,10,32,55,1,22,19,3,6,21,10,3,0,3,6,11,17,19,215,74,22,173,0,0,2,0,50,86,0,30,61,543,49,46,0.09546723197547656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03817255545971384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32460495727100663,0.05005285833379208,0.03651608557796738,0.0,0.0,0.10012936248143813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04484730351503261,0.0,0.0,0.05819593851743934,0.0,0.04061779145862407,0.1613383178093748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15906385976682227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04903557244908099,0.15148750939025113,0.0,0.050047788193095,0.0,0.0535373092020002,0.03811140824652556,0.0,0.0,0.2770581006771021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0422778156772908,0.0,0.05323559963786993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13683454696637284,0.0,0.0,0.22499502485103728,0.0,0.0241355504780845,0.0,0.0,0.052289843113850674,0.04362766024542615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16014676953777482,0.0,0.10525296028189847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05073860167045173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05043318604842019,0.2394035439842791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05388544229444935,0.0,0.04982149350842658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02623314700495764,0.07781853590173002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0699607009606005,0.04784162329057996,0.0421496574375578,0.0,0.040084215411314524,0.0,0.0,0.04058141334251389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048394394524285615,0.0,0.051995901399682486,0.0,0.048086596276548765,0.0,0.05063782328220521,0.0,0.0,0.07620103375230468,0.0,0.0,0.03539387142445592,0.0,0.04610142376794578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469106709796596,0.036303565917790666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927743730941012,0.3751123707818509,0.049871469124911284,0.15719152865604255,0.045123695976601284,0.1076249598371618,0.09143121865216126,0.0,0.0,0.04567462393461457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04713118716155098,0.0,0.0,0.04076424724148178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04830896775572442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053925399232535386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033786099079694334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488405116591764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03789515919761803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04662880685434306,0.0,0.0,0.2885856276735766,0.0,0.07877046451711832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0460135024341209,0.0,0.3822570503806567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So now I can’t bring this up with anyone because they’re all pissed at me. My mom is getting her hip replaced on Monday and I’m worried that will be canceled as it’s an “elective procedure” even though the first surgeon messed it up and caused immense pain that won’t go away. And to top it off there are now cases in the counties surrounding mine. 

My real concern is the anxiety, I’ve been on a number of things over the years that haven’t worked and this epidemic is making my anxiety far worse. I just don’t know what to do. I constantly fear for the lives of my grandmother and great aunt and the millions of others who are at risk. This needs to end or I’m going to go crazy.",3.691918699186989,4.865304273170737,4.590731707317072,86.49113821138212,72.12195121951221,7.613008130081301,27.8130081300813,8.021203637495839,1.651188617886178,796,29,165,11,15,258,124,205,0.166,0.8009999999999999,0.034,-0.9756,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,3,9,7,1,2,14,0,15,5,2,3,2,24,34,13,0,1,3,3,0,0,0,2,3,1,2,0,18,11,0,1,2,0,0,7,4,6,0,2,6,1,13,1,32,25,2,36,0,0,0,0,7,19,1,1,9,114,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17848278876959947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2504960689461012,0.18496096049585292,0.0,0.11447928262612556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15382362396651042,0.0,0.0,0.09980433004053532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16818914106757146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769269468709826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450104311999301,0.0,0.0,0.108137832043616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842344628501829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13926313113691646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08553877479752386,0.0,0.372191367405305,0.0,0.1309446447124807,0.18050574410051054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455249753707017,0.0,0.0,0.1799563150545355,0.0,0.0,0.17335955375738238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14457085594496988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2185734240747008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19175099224527184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12139890566418525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17421335446439867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547716339190211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.186353194229795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15573854715074292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18496096049585292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11588434070262707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10877062285681488,0.0,0.16085751403548335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11919266279468838,0.16626916835344038,0.16684824058914272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10543257041067576

Health anxiety is a MAJOR issue for me and here I am convincing myself I probably have some undiagnosed medical condition which would leave me more susceptible and if something happens to me I have no idea what that would mean for my toddler. I literally feel myself losing it more and more today. It really sucks because I was finally having a few good days after atleast a month of really bad ones. I can’t look at the other Reddit subs without literally feeling like I am going to have a full blown panic attack.

COVID19_support,UniversalOtherness,2020/03/10,"Should I go to the doctor? Why is there so little information?? Four days ago I flew from San Diego to LAX then to Reno, Nevada. Two of my 12 friends that I spent time in a cabin with in Reno were sick, and 2 days later I was hit with a sickness as well.

* My initial symptoms came on really quick (headache, fever, and chills all within an hour or 2).
* My body temperature is fluctuating all over the place (hot, cold, hot, cold, etc...).
* I have a nasty cough.
* I have a classic runny nose.
* My friend who was sick before me lives in San Diego and hasn't traveled outside of the US recently.
* I already had a cold in mid February and can't recall ever getting sick twice in one year.
* I don't have any trouble breathing.
* I am in my mid 20's and live healthily.

Should I get checked out by a doctor for possible covid-19? I have the symptoms, but because I don't know anyone with confirmed covid-19, so according to the CDC, the answer is no. But this seems like a terrible way to prevent spreading, since you don't always know who you're in contact with. Shouldn't everyone who is sick get tested??

The  place I work at has many old, academic giants, which makes me extra  cautious since covid-19 has a much higher mortality rate for elderly  peeps.",1.9667806267806256,4.407701292181073,3.0599382716049384,89.7708760683761,81.34567901234567,5.8783792339347904,24.16096866096867,7.1686216300943375,1.0337263057929729,966,36,194,13,26,309,150,243,0.09699999999999999,0.852,0.05,-0.9183,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,1,1,0,1,6,6,0,0,16,0,23,14,3,1,3,27,35,12,1,3,3,0,2,1,2,3,11,0,0,0,6,11,0,1,5,1,2,4,7,2,1,4,7,6,22,4,28,24,5,35,0,0,0,0,9,18,0,2,13,120,28,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263977549950912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15267372103792326,0.0,0.11511907904223055,0.0,0.0,0.09408339481553712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967382057477757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433745907992661,0.0,0.1177264741260995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15367672390814152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15823663735456905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17844984317068166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2832161332381599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15429788814931766,0.0,0.1251463610809982,0.0,0.13220026803117355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21377921191106292,0.0,0.2168479939588761,0.0,0.0786280369942316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13624782367599042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206813522942478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06759128906907604,0.13866400471838589,0.2443328589542519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923503379130576,0.14026615505708145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10170387204293298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14517605592547098,0.0,0.09375018881389033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28909460651228264,0.0,0.0,0.15596991607112526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863116554363555,0.0,0.1366048789619406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12594951488526188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22889068213064706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28759923530240794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067355544333192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13514878152005425,0.0,0.16641916621154776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098165497250938,0.0,0.0,0.12439412535931807,0.0,0.12484021931110105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10072114423283796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08909348010342254

COVID19_support,covquiza,2020/03/10,"Waffling between feeling prepared and scared Sometimes, I'm feeling pretty well prepared. I've stocked up food and medication that'll likely last about a month if needed maybe more. I have some medication, but there's no way to really know what will be needed. I don't really know how to estimate how long things last well in the unknown. 

Other times, I feel like I need to do so much more but floundering with what (buy more stuff? download info? learn more?). I'm scared. My loved ones include many in high risk categories. Few in Massachusetts are isolating, because we just can't based on the societal &amp; governmental response at this point. I'm sick and generally stressed, which doesn't help. I take news breaks, though I get worried if I break too long what is happening that I'm missing given how close cases are right now. I'm the only one I know taking it seriously; some family are appreciative, some are preparing to a lesser degree, and some don't think it's anything. I'm trying not to go crazy with prep but also feel like they are ultimately relying on me. Also, based on various risk factors, I think there's a good chance that some of my loved ones will die if they contract this. They'd need hospital grade care, so who knows how things will be then. 

The unknown is scary. Hope you're all doing well today.",4.924258373205745,6.565694173913047,5.367584772207199,80.29654878302478,69.71146245059288,8.646473892240483,28.33555231953401,9.134995656068208,2.3593841897233205,1058,38,197,21,19,338,153,253,0.14400000000000002,0.669,0.187,0.8862,0,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,1,0,3,0,18,18,0,5,7,0,21,6,0,4,1,45,52,20,1,8,8,0,4,3,0,4,3,0,0,1,16,8,1,0,12,0,1,1,6,7,3,3,1,4,16,11,18,44,13,25,0,1,0,2,9,12,0,9,12,122,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17246171661543203,0.0,0.1168327387270778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873412667339156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06573159260555676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993891052894264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111909537649662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165163885004558,0.0,0.21808644544648287,0.15406620041531835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038732431804725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05633623205211335,0.0,0.06128173828644085,0.0904418974976966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09535287941700248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07227554428862723,0.11392731945173792,0.0,0.10709858423518394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370401200660873,0.17579014719457026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15803949248325375,0.0,0.0,0.19085064537122653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946398686030331,0.0,0.0,0.1093217398430538,0.10832878144720247,0.0,0.0,0.21725286243408887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606812492984885,0.0,0.07926676421681403,0.3198155192921063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2192032799554207,0.08200885717556049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193331274835037,0.0,0.0,0.10970091670120034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381561106826502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208542591838492,0.0,0.0,0.21591139493360445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066456950277568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12351782102487167,0.0,0.12343847293651253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16214806346358973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14327366891141885,0.13818501217098214,0.1059415014942603,0.0,0.0628759905538229,0.0,0.10220933836853674,0.0,0.0,0.07320885194244049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855896867966681,0.0,0.0,0.2908538172662138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950564201607514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,parezcounapina,2020/03/10,"So anxious I feel like throwing up Hi everyone. I’m so glad this sub exists. I have generalised anxiety disorder and all this talk of illness and death has been really hard. I’m not concerned for myself (I’m 23 and in good health), but I’m very concerned about my grandparents.

My grandad is 80 years old and just this month got the fantastic news that he is finally cancer-free. I’m so worried that he will beat cancer only to contract corona. He’s very proud and stiff-upper-lipped about anything health related and I’m terrified that his pride will kill him. My grandma, 81, is in a nursing home. Understandably, no visitors are allowed until further notice, but what about the doctors and nurses? I’m terrified the virus will get into a nursing home and infect vulnerable elderly people.

COVID19_support,Prodigaltime,2020/03/10,"Please remember that Redditors will be using the virus to Karma farm. Reddit is anonymous site. PSA for those that get swept up in the anxiety of everything that is happening. I've been a redditor for about 9 years now and this is a recurring theme. It happened with the swine flu, Ebola, and WW3 drama. Redditors no that statements that are very dark or serious draw in more karma so they tend to use this just like news outlet to draw attention to thier post. Most of these people are very uneducated on the topics and this can lead to some sense of dred.

With this said, yes the virus is serious and you need to be prepared. Make sure you are taking care of yourself but for the love of God please dont do something extreme or lose sleep because a redditor talked out thier ass. Do your own research and be prepared!

COVID19_support,JackFroSTALKER,2020/03/11,"Terrified less for myself, more for my parents I live in Houston, Texas with my parents and I am frankly terrified of getting this virus while out at work. If it were just me that would be one thing, but I'm worried that my father who is in his 50s with diabetes and my mom in her late 40s who is generally confined to the home and immunosuppressed due to being a kidney transplant patient would invariably get it too and die if I were to catch it. I'm doing the general advice of handwashing and avoiding touching my face but I sometimes feel like it will just happen anyway. It doesn't help that my dad is being glib about it and refuses to take it as seriously as my mom and I are. 

I don't know much about the mechanics of the virus, would there still be a chance they could pull through even with their existing conditions? I don't want false hope but, I dunno, I just need to talk about it I guess and learn more.",6.405217391304348,5.854949956521742,6.5925217391304365,80.56986956521742,65.73913043478261,10.18608695652174,32.53043478260869,9.642632912329526,2.7355560869565214,728,26,150,13,10,234,111,184,0.13699999999999998,0.833,0.031,-0.9576,2,1,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,2,1,11,4,0,1,6,0,20,3,2,0,0,37,32,16,1,9,8,6,2,1,0,4,1,0,1,0,15,12,0,3,3,0,0,2,3,2,0,1,2,2,23,2,24,21,4,11,0,0,0,0,15,5,0,5,5,115,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1683771103577441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375736940939347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17882821010424912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11380762438486315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08712396080413595,0.1230966700268425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18004734455137816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898163803873899,0.0,0.15237114827344075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549423302871298,0.0,0.17283869287669076,0.17114044545009288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469581700671678,0.0,0.19437061403518865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08418084868702748,0.0,0.15215087411542594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4036094397023383,0.0,0.0,0.12666600062297026,0.12776399152324855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167601708388344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382654664969354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17041674157247286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13760516825178432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295539619323569,0.13849441891950665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144735931565848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10163155795021364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544207277336822,0.17498685428721833,0.0,0.3672073828971104,0.0,0.0,0.0

As we know stress is poison got your immune system, so what should you do?

I’d recommend you to try meditating! I’ve been doing it for 2 weeks and it really helped me to get my mind off things. just take 10 minutes out of your day to make yourself comfy and sit down , straight back, hands on you knees and just focus on taking deep breaths. 

Just don’t think about anything else. always concentrate on your breathing. at first it was very hard to concentrate for 10 minutes without drifting off, but I assure you it helps!",4.263735632183908,6.283764931034487,4.421810344827588,84.88214080459773,72.10344827586206,7.316091954022987,27.94540229885057,8.07648339933343,1.8327816091954023,605,23,114,9,12,188,100,145,0.07,0.826,0.10400000000000001,0.7302,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,1,7,0,1,9,6,1,3,2,0,9,6,4,1,2,26,19,9,0,2,5,0,4,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,8,11,0,0,4,0,0,2,2,4,0,1,5,4,11,2,26,13,2,27,0,0,0,0,10,16,0,0,8,73,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14082200702210115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911940724837657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13927086082995574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301358245345121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10914639552865064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14137907612986514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1711465933759212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14395624415837072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884213980343002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13535742799670591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516066262946015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268772488645933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930103862247722,0.13795394197841304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268256715662713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11296963146582542,0.17158373431015178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17088508886010553,0.0,0.13508649150422825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16582017303053825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12871534958089711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10842007007356456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5815947225792459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25449622627836355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243615028186707,0.10844275094793704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22980695731474116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964148728433734,0.0,0.0,0.13575486140072734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16314221210834068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Does anyone know what the recommended washing schedule is for washing your hands?,6.301779661016947,7.606194050847463,5.962500000000002,78.5857838983051,66.11864406779661,7.933898305084746,33.39406779661017,8.07648339933343,2.5545898305084744,255,11,44,3,4,79,46,59,0.046,0.924,0.031,-0.2168,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,7,5,2,2,0,13,11,4,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,1,0,5,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,4,8,2,6,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,5,1,31,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.463891562336694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5805794238657479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733095935392172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3327414095991963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36460840000036654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22142514534798965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3535685361546513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,everythingzalright,2020/03/11,"I feel like grieving 🥺 WELCOME TO VENT! Suddenly it hit me that this could be a lot worse than I thought and we won’t know how far it can go. I’m not per say scared of dying but just depressed about it. I just turned 25 years old and life was/is getting pretty good, then this hit. 

Ok I’m just gonna vent...

I’m pretty healthy and I’m shape, no illnesses or anything like that but again you never know! But I’m scared me or my family won’t survive this and it will be chaos. I’m depressed that life won’t be the same for a while and I regret not being happier or taking bigger risks in life. I’m depressed I’ve never been in love or experienced it and that fucking sucks. My career was taking off and now it’s uncertain, my life is pretty good from so much shit I went through but it seems like death is near. I’m taking it day by day for now but it really makes me anxious and just depressed. 

I know since I’m healthy I’m going to be ok but you never know. Things happen. They just declared a global emergency and it never happened in my lifetime (kinda). I just pray we get a miracle or least something to help. 

Anyone here welcome to vent.",0.2166661897267126,2.4748620788381785,2.1439805408499057,94.49294605809128,87.96265560165978,4.817913864644441,19.51366432966089,6.311591054244273,0.030755215338388982,895,27,196,9,29,296,124,241,0.23399999999999999,0.5589999999999999,0.207,-0.9067,0,0,1,0,1,0,24.0,2,2,1,1,13,23,3,4,5,2,15,8,1,2,4,49,50,24,3,2,19,0,1,3,0,5,5,1,0,0,18,11,0,0,7,0,0,3,10,13,0,0,4,3,19,10,17,33,4,26,1,6,0,2,10,9,3,9,17,119,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12307074817878105,0.0,0.07617310661664355,0.0,0.08964801481123802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697941218424872,0.0,0.0,0.14051406912595335,0.0,0.3753180976330697,0.0,0.11306211335873895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269856668289216,0.0,0.05508313887924717,0.07782647744751685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10071291181087344,0.11383289732498506,0.0,0.12382577904400938,0.18274674852603867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926698704712209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301992263614725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394814373139535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30778906634247993,0.15966716858608318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926165586772742,0.09832224915904048,0.0,0.07271803401311422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800831463491345,0.0,0.3360837652267257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11431379257774765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33249223632190084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06978950219642632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663314849134887,0.2181351037821964,0.0,0.0,0.0991745272874278,0.0,0.0,0.11182494171285493,0.09011596917020004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08386703224992223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457270816757201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07237463462004659,0.0,0.0,0.08648587977427555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849501028959974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10098810767858696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110187671310209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015353557890293

Okay well its day 4 of me sleeping 13+ hours followed by a 2-3 hour nap. I seriously thought ""I need to get out and see some friends"" bc I can literally feel my mental health deteriorating but I'm afraid to go to social gatherings right now and I've been really congested since yesterday and have been anxious since. 

The WHO confirmed the coronavirus as a pandemic. This is such an odd feeling I cant even describe. It feels good to know I'm not crazy and everything I've been warning friends and family of is coming true.

COVID19_support,kingaegon-i,2020/03/11,"Stress is bad for the immune system but I can't help it I couldn't sleep last night. I was so worried. I'd just gotten a new job, in a very nice part of the city. Normally I'd be so hyped but it's very close to the city centre, where it's packed, especially during rush hour. I couldn't stop thinking about how I *might* catch coronavirus on the train. So I pretty much spent my night browsing r/coronavirus for news and updates, and as you can guess that didn't exactly ease my fears. 

A lack of sleep would weaken the immune system and that was all I could think about on the ride home. I kept thinking about how I could've caught the corona and it'd be a matter of time until I started showing symptoms. 

(It didn't help there was a really nasty Asian guy a meter away from me at the Starbucks I went to after work, he was sniffing and dry coughing like there was no tomorrow, if he does indeed have the corona there probably won't be one for him, I was so scared and I wished there was some way I could've gotten him removed so he could stop infecting other people). 

TL;DR--coronavirus gave me super anxiety and hypochondria",2.676184210526316,4.581659337719302,3.605999999999998,89.51400000000002,76.23684210526315,6.489824561403509,21.48771929824561,7.365786028017652,0.6484045614035097,891,23,183,11,20,285,131,228,0.175,0.71,0.115,-0.9365,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,2,16,7,0,3,15,0,24,7,2,2,2,35,37,19,0,9,4,0,0,1,0,3,5,0,1,1,8,8,0,3,3,1,1,6,7,4,0,1,16,0,21,3,20,10,5,30,0,0,0,0,10,8,0,4,14,117,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187586744634552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251190503009498,0.0,0.11119267752629347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4253065697774848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165393164886133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14985501205939009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14670347075040535,0.13186076678658246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17852415900449756,0.0,0.13358191781565748,0.0,0.1311471464959756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215220974219125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085525833740614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506089015024784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14127396435893014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789640851615997,0.0,0.0,0.12861790804063722,0.0,0.24994494745770515,0.13047983913946765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09024048542338137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1442118058021616,0.0,0.09232438146700647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13548333733673368,0.14358144943552276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531310180265704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333279485453661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2665354398672655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09425950500698847,0.0,0.0,0.22267474935507314,0.15254755489958338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13841622576677565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25599284648416665,0.0,0.0,0.07765339884795744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21976094301506727,0.0,0.10570537382475202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12345135643741785,0.0,0.0,0.15314070457577697,0.0,0.0,0.0969504708519908,0.13524216828515498,0.0,0.09460124471561486,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,rhinocerousfeet,2020/03/11,"Montgomery County, PA? Just wondering if anyone else is in the same situation I am: 12 cases in PA, 8 of which are in my county. I’m terrified. I work at an elementary school that is refusing to close, even though almost every school in our area has and a high schooler in the township (the high school is less than 500 feet from the elementary school) is dating someone who is one of the 8 corona virus cases in the county. I just feel like community spread is inevitable. I just came down with a fever which is somewhat normal for me (I get random fevers maybe once every two months) but I just can’t help but be paranoid I’m sick, even though I come into contact with the same select people everyday, none of who are sick or interacted with the infected in anyway. 

Anyways, I just want to know if there’s anyone else out there who is sharing my pain in Montgomery County and is scared shitless like me. I feel so alone in my fears, my friends, family, and boyfriend aren’t taking it seriously and neither is the township or my college (hasn’t even addressed the virus yet, meanwhile other colleges are shutting down).

COVID19_support,Scaryb0u,2020/03/11,"Have mild, very odd symptoms that aren't typical of COVID-19, but it's making me anxious anyways. I'm at a loss right now on if I should go and get tested for coronavirus or not. Monday morning I woke up with some really peculiar symptoms - #1 symptom was joint pain and body aches very similar to a flu, some nausea, my inner ears felt weird (sort of like they do during a cold), I had some mild shortness of breath and a dry cough. I still have these symptoms today, but because they are so mild and I don't have a fever, I'm hesitant on going and getting checked as I heard fever is one of the staple symptoms of COVID-19.

Where I live, there are about 30 known cases right now, and I take public trandportation to get everywhere I need to go as I do not have my own vehicle, and I keep having this paranoid fear that what I have is some really mild form of COVID-19 and I might be spreading it to everyone at work or on the busses I take. In some ways, right now the fear I am experiencing is less from catching the virus myself, but more that I may already have it and could be spreading it to others.",9.297792792792798,5.962913554054055,8.859729729729732,75.47671171171173,62.1081081081081,12.02882882882883,38.18018018018018,9.725611199111238,3.396563963963964,867,30,180,12,9,279,128,222,0.153,0.8220000000000001,0.025,-0.9807,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,2,2,9,7,0,2,9,0,25,13,3,1,0,33,41,18,0,4,8,0,1,1,0,3,10,2,0,0,11,10,0,1,2,0,1,4,4,6,0,1,5,5,22,1,24,30,9,24,0,1,0,0,4,13,0,11,7,126,33,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13644040701460494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13967861384678285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537012372014236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13733676376099882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987169080133902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11814383153164118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27825995631437195,0.0,0.0,0.11871430487438647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937912324066593,0.0,0.21080329929708586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10989739015938216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06040452101731258,0.0,0.10917685930534016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08253101848263747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13116307092649818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09167789148710624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08378202766333293,0.0,0.13156224859532473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15841458790342405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3167650289232736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987394925021306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6425492949111173,0.18592459302741912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11719677209736848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2040327832970404,0.0,0.09814010321861223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001178343384716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The cases were travel based as one couple flew in from New York and one from Egypt. 

The stores have almost completely ran out masks, hand sanitizer and paper. Some members of my household have asthma and I myself am a smoker. 

It's crazy how quick the supplies have ran out. All public gatherings have been cancelled, if it gets any worse the country should really consider shutting down. But then how can we properly supply the country?

COVID19_support,NikolaDotMathers,2020/03/12,"How this is being treated is very discouraging As someone from a country that doesn't quite have the strong healthcare system that Italy, Germany, South Korea, and other nations have, this is very discouraging.

Seeing France and the U. K. refuse to test people that aren't in need of hospitalization, then seeing the system that my own country boasts, leaves me very anxious at the prospect of what's to come.

To top it all off, people that went and came back from coronavirus-stricken countries are being less than genuine. For instance, the director of the clinic for skin diseases, even after having had symptoms arise, didn't go for a test, nor did she notify the people with whom she interacted that she'd recently returned from Italy. She went so far as to threaten people that were suspicious, until someone called her in. Now, there are ca. 200 people in isolation because of her.Additionally, in my hometown, there are rumors that a few teachers also came back from Italy while not reporting their departure or subsequent return to the authorities, and going against regulations to quarantine for 2 weeks.

My father had kidney issues a few years back and now has an aching lower back - aged 50 -, and my mother has had IBS for 15 or so years.

If that wasn't enough, my girlfriend currently lives ca. 250 miles away from me, with her parents, grandparent and two younger sisters; while my brother and his sister-in-law live in Germany, with her parents, sister, brother-in-law (my sister-in-law's brother-in-law, yes), and their two children.

It is very nerve-wracking seeing how this is all playing out, and even more so knowing that I've been following this whole thing from jump street.",12.191764705882356,9.094720823529414,10.435392156862747,65.66426470588237,56.450980392156865,12.81437908496732,43.147058823529406,10.504223727775694,4.548403921568627,1356,54,224,20,12,417,172,306,0.079,0.89,0.031,-0.9289,5,2,0,0,0,0,55.0,0,0,2,3,16,5,0,0,13,1,26,4,2,2,2,30,39,26,0,2,4,7,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,20,17,0,3,1,1,1,9,6,2,0,2,12,4,19,3,39,24,9,45,0,2,3,0,24,15,0,3,19,161,39,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897017371449549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12568590390563708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045272535806558,0.34219133521546485,0.0,0.06781970314823522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11360327106163773,0.25449099106463524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958358901113234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495562611724555,0.0,0.14696507987805976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12645697857754062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161207804606737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06114255694964349,0.0,0.0,0.11780243872145668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964795020434876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249379301801578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470698852862314,0.0,0.0,0.3856492680397897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11833284238213895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985038488080896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26596626787627625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18853113299081334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11563601142751985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739125381674499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2173589373815352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3671864158560611,0.0,0.0,0.08924163936192987,0.0,0.0,0.2062680496402704,0.0,0.12421166252419087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432884850688005
COVID19_support,Yserali,2020/03/12,"What has me worried Hello all, this is my first post here and hopefully my last as I hope to get the reassurance I need to keep my anxiety down. I'm worried about COVID-19 because of who it might effect around me, my mother is a smoker and is just a few months away from being 60. I don't think I am ready to lose my mother. The same goes for my grandparents. I know it's a part of life, but it's happening too fast.  


I believe the fear mongering is getting to me, I don't know how justified it is.

I've been watching and internally worried since the news broke in January - I just knew it was going to get this way, if it hasn't already. So, After shopping trips I would grab a little extra to keep stored. My husband got really tired of me talking about it, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something is coming and something is happening and we need to be two steps ahead of the game (My parents sort of raised me to always be prepared, we live by the Ocean and always need to be prepped for storms etc, job losses, power outages etc)

My husband finally snapped yesterday. I've noticed him lately not really saying any snark comments to my fears, he would just say ""Sure"" or if I asked if I should grab something else he would say, ""Sure"" instead of outright  ""no, we can grab it next week"". I grabbed one last batch of goods yesterday after work, I told him that this would be the last go and I'd feel comfortable enough to hunker in for a few weeks and eat through what we have. I left the bags in a small mud room we have waiting to go through things and make sure the bags,that were all over the store, would not go onto our kitchen counter. He moves everything into the kitchen, onto the counter where we prep food, and just leaves it there. I was like, guy, they were in the mud room for a reason, and he just lost it. Full on yelling that I was going crazy and being too careful. I have a compromised immune system and am highly allergic to the flu shot - so this time of year I normally turn into a germaphobe. I said I'm sorry but It's not like I'm going to stop taking precautions and I'm not going to stop washing my hands or making sure we have enough food to not have to run to the store every night.

&amp;#x200B;

 I know he hasn't been sleeping and I am sure he's pretty anxious about the situation regardless if he wants to admit it to me or not, but I feel super alone in this. No one around me is taking it seriously and we have literally positive cases less then 20 minutes away from us in all directions. My family lives a good 2 hours away and have already been self quarantining, which makes me relieved a bit, but we were supposed to take a trip this weekend to do a visit, and now I'm not sure when we'll be able to do this. Mum asked us to keep our distance until things start to simmer down (They are in their late 70's with some medical issues) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to stay calm and prepared, trying to continue to look to the positive, but I feel like now I can't talk to my husband about my fears or what we need or what we should do. I feel like if he was on the same page, or even just a little bit understanding this would be a lot easier for me. This just sucks.",4.597366302472687,5.2354765744680885,5.167630822311676,85.16310810810813,69.60283687943263,8.15403488594978,28.00920069005176,8.186683628785799,1.686329844738355,2204,72,455,29,37,708,261,564,0.1,0.7809999999999999,0.12,0.9511,3,2,3,0,1,0,68.0,16,0,3,6,20,26,2,3,28,0,49,13,2,4,8,110,98,39,0,20,29,6,11,4,0,9,6,5,5,2,27,34,5,5,11,3,4,15,13,9,0,3,16,18,56,17,67,65,17,74,0,3,2,0,50,28,1,14,32,303,83,2,0.05910976479153381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12243977950337925,0.1304581906097443,0.0,0.09836811898217307,0.192136216367484,0.21547450232364024,0.04019666701844647,0.0,0.0,0.13355441857761324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052620222662343986,0.1105193016967387,0.0,0.11107113959223484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290651077149915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06026634466428245,0.0,0.0,0.05091782843164076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0604840461506967,0.049378623683973034,0.0,0.0,0.12215237613154199,0.1318460254064592,0.03904144216733926,0.0,0.049802526220118166,0.0,0.05312404517499445,0.0,0.05572342561110997,0.13302983776658509,0.1793260387698565,0.08445605555552242,0.0,0.06475185806664817,0.0,0.0,0.14295152443113054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030882412438004287,0.0,0.23515409061264986,0.09915693252668634,0.04727547868356687,0.0,0.0,0.05852796036760055,0.0522705697921573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06245271185354069,0.0592919136015401,0.0,0.058211211564268076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616952372433405,0.05865732076926496,0.10507894975270372,0.0,0.0,0.032485180875530144,0.09636469516062618,0.13335677864996082,0.06258870613796583,0.06422293239883907,0.0,0.0,0.11551218131038478,0.1184870260270152,0.10439001050403414,0.0,0.04963731525021308,0.0,0.06452529081772783,0.05025300824056984,0.0,0.0,0.11836868097958407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059546869364818074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282432541606267,0.0,0.13148742484743667,0.0,0.0,0.06286390544145715,0.0554705100515733,0.0579150193043071,0.0,0.06729685899204439,0.0,0.0,0.08010861279095992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06563439863195407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060135881137022784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11360168675246325,0.060774682923120826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05622692231668538,0.14101937236339546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06166437603825885,0.0,0.0,0.04889620825901195,0.06644185222774447,0.059152453156747664,0.0,0.0,0.13651675433504187,0.0,0.06616854229640094,0.04183819575573736,0.0630031444633131,0.0,0.09883682025156597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3342615226841306,0.0,0.13332956046671987,0.0950203798026792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853980242653676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06893475839616002,0.06793797923019687,0.0,0.05648191335163101,0.0,0.0802633004531735,0.06429445029694034,0.057741651216578475,0.061535349765805165,0.14220353810167502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034864470755243994,0.04691857995844007,0.09482857573943924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043032612762137545,0.060028835402065585,0.0,0.25193928579541325,0.0,0.21547450232364024,0.038064750535983474
COVID19_support,VergilAries,2020/03/12,"Question about being quarantined Ok so this might be a stupid question, but I haven't found an answer yet so I figured I'd ask.

I'm from Europe, but I'm living in another European country which I don't have a citizenship in yet, I do have proof of employment and residence.   
I'm traveling to Germany in 2 weeks, and just started wondering what would happen if I get quarantined, would they send me home to the country I'm residing in now, or to where I'm originally from?  
Sorry if this all sounds very vague, I don't wanna name the countries out of fear of being recognized. Any help on this subject is greatly appreciated.",6.5103512880562056,6.502924180327869,7.6497658079625355,71.25975409836069,65.39344262295081,11.233723653395783,36.28103044496487,10.914260884657429,4.1070079625292735,498,23,91,13,7,170,79,122,0.085,0.8290000000000001,0.086,0.2617,1,2,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,0,8,4,1,1,5,1,13,0,0,1,2,23,24,9,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,5,3,0,0,6,1,0,2,3,2,0,0,1,1,8,2,16,17,1,15,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,6,62,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145554116992114,0.22443895062342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000979255527784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2408538071183074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23468313064112156,0.0,0.0,0.1118267410314687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359791702418056,0.0,0.0,0.18927431538740966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434660835427592,0.0,0.21469894817608745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189000692454668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22706195605295584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4795461779004829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23959956038614394,0.15149817364148513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1766049031450186,0.0,0.0,0.17168947864557715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23211657549776316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3040948665615053,0.0,0.0,0.0

Things went wrong yesterday, too much of the info and seeing what happens in the US made me start to break down. I got paranoid about going to class and sent a message to my professors that I might not be coming next week. Then it started to get me in a bad space, started to worry I would die and everything is lost, didn't believe my parents or brother reassurance.

I've managed to get calm now but I didn't sleep, now the panic is slowly starting to come back and I'm not sure what to do. I haven't bought groceries yet but tomorrow for sure, I do have hand sanitizer.

COVID19_support,626-Flawed-Product,2020/03/12,"We have our first possible case in my smallish town. Schools are closed today for disinfecting because we have our first possible case.  My awareness is treading into fear.  I am immune compromised and most around me are at a higher risk due to age and/or preexisting conditions like asthma. One of my best friends has bailed on me after a fight over his belief this is all no big deal and everyone is over reacting. I have not been panicking but being aware and trying to get those around me to give it the attention it deserves. 

My biggest fear is that I live in one place and spend 60% of my time in another where my dog lives with my mother. Since this began I have wondered where I would quarantine if necessary... I still have no answer and can't even begin to decide. I thought I would have more time to work things out. I am starting feel like I have less control over it... I have gone from aware to afraid and I do not like it.",4.168791208791209,5.765724120879121,4.586593406593405,85.33340659340661,71.52747252747254,8.057142857142857,26.736263736263727,8.634040054169528,1.8391494505494521,738,25,146,13,14,233,115,182,0.077,0.835,0.08800000000000001,0.2624,0,1,0,0,1,0,18.0,4,0,0,5,6,10,1,4,3,0,23,2,0,2,1,31,32,8,0,3,4,1,1,3,1,2,2,0,0,0,9,14,0,1,7,0,1,1,5,5,0,4,4,1,27,5,24,25,5,32,1,0,0,0,10,19,0,3,15,111,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15885925518104965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2697313458739475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09235200301439167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15898819746210405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699183093103279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15618817196718104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006324762468433,0.0,0.0,0.14476318927450607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3409555810170672,0.07660213022728783,0.10823046910298448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25772888012627443,0.0,0.0,0.11704726842739226,0.0,0.07915164787679911,0.1453310456218785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2220433600900237,0.0,0.2675516807457231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20531843890945264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15828355669788774,0.0,0.0,0.3415833086814763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533244432328168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12532102103089635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723132931750708,0.0,0.12098679767404055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10064878834285043,0.0,0.0,0.12027278691967598,0.17667984112311408,0.0,0.14360274490461866,0.0,0.0,0.10285745175595916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642935247929411,0.1102926210640128,0.0,0.0,0.21524019726592186,0.0,0.0,0.0

Is there anything known statistically about otherwise healthy (young) smoking adults that get infected?

COVID19_support,zfreakazoidz,2020/03/12,"Need help/info regarding my wife and my dad. So I live in Ohio near Lake Erie in the suburbs. So my wife and I take care of my parents. They aren't homebound or anything that really requires us per say, but my wife (not from America) believes in taking care of your parents as they age.   


My wife is 35 and had PTB about 7 years ago. She was treated with a harsh regime of drugs in the Philippines and cured. But the doctors in America looked and told he it trashed her immune system. She works at a local Amazon plant (thankfully shes wearing a mask, washing hands...etc). So I am nervous about if she would be ok if she got COVID-19.  


My bigger concern is my dad. He is 66. He's had alot of health issues. Every winter he always gets sick and cough, I don't think they ever pinpointed what it was. I do know his immune system is comrpomised. And on top of that he was diagnosed with Leukemia. Can't recall if it was Chronic or Accelerated. He's on meds now and they are split on the line on if this new med is doing much.  


So my obvious questions are should I worry about my wife? And what about my dad? He mostly stays at home, but he does have doctor appointments this week and almost every other week. He also has a pending surgery (on a cancel list).   


Seeing there are three cases now a few cities over from us, it's made me nervous. I know for the elderly its only 11% death rate. But I remember them saying immune system issues and what not are of concern.",2.2572228542535697,4.269688068259388,3.5835191505498685,88.69886866388573,77.87372013651877,6.115484768044496,22.79724434331943,7.093109894594671,0.7803852610289472,1136,35,230,13,27,371,167,293,0.08800000000000001,0.84,0.07200000000000001,-0.8246,2,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,2,1,5,3,13,7,0,2,12,1,27,13,1,1,2,40,42,27,1,7,12,10,0,0,0,2,12,2,1,0,13,13,0,1,5,0,0,0,5,2,0,1,9,4,35,5,30,30,4,31,0,0,2,0,38,17,0,10,10,152,48,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758038489792228,0.0,0.12152684493074425,0.0,0.0,0.09705341320136528,0.10098318251167274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987085864741248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13673378893108934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24747397207615746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123180212510782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24843897910743026,0.10620499474144378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14074177534423393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13535108106999588,0.0,0.10977917758600296,0.2045059983607082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06340680952113995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970645437084043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290024839541814,0.0,0.0,0.08134661305545701,0.0,0.1217363144613093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533414877547583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13339512773942006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10716516278037948,0.0,0.10191379315101284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11483597313190508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696123837564555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08921527828491142,0.08998863153867212,0.0,0.11721249668086085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092301522422852,0.0,0.0,0.2695170152555491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13595358712175135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774781765785233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374798641928919,0.0,0.0,0.1930243953617408,0.0,0.0,0.09671006591735158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12935609833712566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1824987401490913,0.0,0.0,0.11173412993241487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07776408206797339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159669092712834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2919678853375147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946990848316052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835322324910179,0.1232493394016923,0.0,0.08621231872882648,0.0,0.0,0.07815336290679968
COVID19_support,modelovirus1337,2020/03/12,"Overwhelmed at home... Hi all, I’m a college student that had this week off for spring break; now back home until the Fall as it was announced today that classes are online for the semester and we should move out ASAP.

My mother has suffered from undiagnosed anxiety for as long as I can remember, but this virus has been her absolute worst nightmare and pushed her over the edge. I understand she wants to “protect her family” (definitely a cultural component to this as well) but my siblings, father, and I have been barred from leaving the house entirely “until further notice” among other measures. My grandmother lives with us which is really worrying her but has been contained to a room away from the rest of us and we all intend to be VERY careful around her.

Thinking about the virus is all my mom does. She has no friends she really speaks to (besides doctors who validate her fears) or any hobbies- all she does is watch/read up on the latest COVID-19 news and worry about the family, resulting in everyday arguments, fits of tears, and extreme amounts of screaming. She’s refusing to get help (especially now since she’s scared of going into any doctors office) and will guilt us as “stressing her out” and making the problems at home worse when we don’t comply or even try to have a discussion with her. Bringing up the word ""therapy"" is enough to tear down the house. She's an extreme skeptic of mental health professionals as well and will often attack what I say as ""what the therapists tell you to do"" or claim they cannot possibly understand her.

Not sure what to do here and how much more of this I can take. Was actually really looking forward to going back to school for the sake of my own independence and sanity (recovering from depression/anxiety myself). Although I do live in a state with a considerable amount of confirmed cases, am I being unreasonable or is complete isolation the only way to protect my grandmother? Anyone in a similar spot that can offer advice? I’d like to support my mother as best I can but don’t want to sacrifice my entire livelihood.

COVID19_support,lunaboro,2020/03/12,"Ford shortages? I’m growing worried ... I’m in LA. Over the past few days, the grocery stores are empty and many are not being restocked. It’s really starting to cause me anxiety -

Like what will i eat? I am vegan and have so many food allergies and intolerances, I am so so worried. 

For example, we have bulk rice but I just wanted a new bulk rice - it’s literally sold out everywhere! Pasta too... and these are just staples I eat daily. Beans I can’t find... it’s bad. 

We do have about 2-2.5 weeks of food always on stock but.... it’s like the stores aren’t being replenished. 

What will happen? I am just so worried ...",-0.08071887034659753,2.239937487804877,2.284330338040224,90.21543003851092,96.88617886178862,5.51630295250321,19.481814291827128,7.0608816371341465,0.7316276422764232,473,16,97,9,19,160,76,123,0.13,0.8170000000000001,0.053,-0.8064,1,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,2,0,0,0,9,3,0,0,4,0,16,5,0,1,0,16,22,10,0,1,6,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,5,0,1,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,0,10,2,8,17,1,10,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,7,61,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444200314517437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327767935557826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14491957279871956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17829912426017655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193510310230337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35520076780142024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1586353177248528,0.0,0.419751111804019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15348300671993098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16959023950563254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3519354514211784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16763021362721087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16568748622606372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119021991759442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285024069684244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10237316754899492,0.0,0.13922341946272046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5287912213721792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,unknown-and-alone,2020/03/12,"Anxiety through the roof, no one around me seems to think this is a big deal. I have been feeling more and more anxious the past couple days as I watch the number of confirmed cases rise. I live in Wisconsin, and we are now just starting to get some confirmed cases, but I don't think they are testing anyone here that hasn't been traveling.

I have also been sick the past few days with a really bad cough. It started last friday, got really bad saturday and sunday, then I went to the doctor on monday. They didn't mention anything about traveling, didn't give me a mask to wear, nothing. This felt like a couple years ago when I got bronchitis. I haven't had a fever at all, so I don't think I have covid, but I don't really know. I tried calling my old doctor to just call in the same inhaler prescription I got the last time, but they wouldn't do it without seeing me. That doc stopped taking my insurance, so I had to find a new one, and the new one gave me the inhaler, plus steroids and antibiotics. I haven't taken the steroids or antibiotics because I am afraid of the side affects of the steroids, and I don't think this is bacterial. And besides that, I have been feeling much better since using the inhaler.

I'm so scared, because if this cough isn't covid, what would happen to me if I did get it. I have been a smoker for 20 years and I am overweight. I know I need to get healthy, but this is where I am right now. 

I work from home, so I can stay home for that. I am stocked up to last a month. But, my son goes to public school. I am very, very tempted to just keep him home. There has just been a confirmed case the next county over from me, but I live in the biggest city in the state. I am almost sure it has to already be here, we just don't know it yet. 

What makes it worse, is that I have tried talking to my family about it, and none of them seem to think it's a big deal at all. My mom is in her late 60's and has asthma (lives in a different state,) and my dad is 70 and honestly pretty damn healthy, lives in the county next to mine with the confirmed case. My mom is taking more precautions and at least hand washing and stuff, but my dad just thinks ""oh it's another flu, the news is just fear mongering and blowing things out of proportion."" His sister also just died in California, not covid that I know of, and he is supposed to travel there for the funeral at the end of the month. I have been trying to talk him and my aunt out of going, but so far they are just waiting to see. 

I just want to stay home with my son until we run out of food, and then start worrying about going out. But, I am afraid my family and his school will think I'm nuts for pulling him from school and not leaving the house. Maybe I am, but if we don't just start staying home, it is just going to keep spreading. 

I feel like this is all I have been thinking about lately, and it doesn't help that I just keep sitting online and reading about it. Sorry for the mega rant, but God, it feels so much better to get this all out there to people who can be sympathetic. Thank you.",5.117672955974847,4.638600893081762,5.5305031446540855,86.87786163522013,68.37106918238993,8.70188679245283,28.201257861635213,7.984000788550335,1.4906748427672951,2392,67,534,26,36,767,256,636,0.115,0.8140000000000001,0.071,-0.9834,1,0,1,0,0,0,75.0,4,1,5,3,37,14,1,4,35,0,65,13,2,3,5,108,118,51,2,7,31,8,6,2,0,3,10,0,5,0,32,36,2,5,20,4,0,10,19,7,0,3,20,12,73,7,73,93,14,80,0,0,3,0,37,28,1,8,38,368,105,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05545623839989117,0.0,0.06264545057038662,0.0,0.06903722904573842,0.10005945275479312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0656002925842624,0.04785872331149925,0.0706757233280562,0.0,0.04374385861745029,0.0,0.051482081530084815,0.0556922389832173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447105328056834,0.07627277883913275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106596157267134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12776282948551682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13844433078720744,0.0,0.08069288291657158,0.12899455895812878,0.0,0.0,0.06492807398082646,0.06536256020352893,0.0,0.12806694516179706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055410163786417915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11795321946892068,0.0703981201707942,0.12653017036396885,0.044693338336479316,0.06006803142811903,0.0,0.057179297489481064,0.0,0.07564858203584719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074142273490738,0.060013872679350835,0.10666397129416684,0.0,0.15010639201126014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05532217306136517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04193308260523102,0.0,0.3137671464503596,0.0,0.0,0.07218658647013683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16682033120474374,0.0,0.0,0.13752678078481353,0.15298583018742246,0.14114226833024182,0.06624269156467077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061127943607262085,0.0,0.22096878797936498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04175971730833386,0.0,0.06285057809885418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14654054606416184,0.09987062229370436,0.0,0.0919785469474786,0.046387926652463086,0.0,0.12084292439644932,0.13306791450616226,0.0,0.0,0.06002862755538301,0.0,0.06564687463400548,0.0,0.12717813938558753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194424318755615,0.04337167514045323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364666841567931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625775762667603,0.0,0.12023385625166312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05342645025754753,0.0,0.0,0.06263412090682892,0.1899441425353935,0.0997054709605416,0.11390572586062307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05175081324167002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07003152180462723,0.1771229902698674,0.20004397552593114,0.0,0.05230350172701364,0.0,0.0,0.07161697270157864,0.0,0.0,0.05896266892063313,0.0,0.09407564074985253,0.10056775575056363,0.0,0.0575974379791988,0.0,0.0,0.0415625136603946,0.3206906893446909,0.0,0.0,0.03647961605450069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12742371708791986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054032312014604164,0.0,0.10323817043296783,0.0368998901768985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05799434604352506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060306230712645,0.0,0.0455448957219303,0.06353337325363438,0.06375464345577725,0.04444128829776607,0.0,0.0,0.08057401038721139
COVID19_support,ThrowRAidk7,2020/03/12,"I’m losing my mind because of my health anxiety This is such a difficult time for me, honestly. I tried tricking myself into not freaking out about covid-19 by saying it was no big deal but now my health anxiety has taken me by the throat. I’ve always had a bad cough but recently it’s gotten worse and Ive had a persistent headache for the past few days so now I’m flipping out. I don’t have a fever, shortness of breath when just relaxing, runny/congested nose, etc. I only have a cough but I’m convinced I have the virus. I can’t get tested because I’ve heard the cost to get tested can be in the thousands and I don’t have that kind of money (I am insured but there’s still a possibility of getting billed a large amount of money). Am I right to be concerned and should I just get tested?",1.7021341463414643,3.792306347560977,3.4453048780487805,88.61783536585371,80.03658536585365,6.295121951219512,23.664634146341466,7.413659706084162,1.0484951219512195,627,22,130,9,16,209,99,164,0.113,0.8059999999999999,0.081,-0.5972,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,2,10,9,1,0,12,0,19,8,3,0,0,15,29,9,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,1,5,2,0,0,4,6,0,0,0,1,4,0,5,5,0,1,6,3,16,4,16,20,3,15,0,1,0,0,3,7,0,0,8,87,20,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15793706994119922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2904081590287538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15848336601843147,0.2314127472907085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12241170445563135,0.1956857068038172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21168824972512512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3966714243307202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4035181665720408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976578368911695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2123487639681284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916539239990434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14435900750990968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18119505886696272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2139821804360656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874144103863657,0.0,0.0,0.16209664601529067,0.0,0.1509444774484161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15158245799656225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11067969857354976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12886848532380374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19343253804555832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Throwaway64429,2020/03/12,"I wish I could just relax, and focus completely on school. At this point it seems like all I can think about isy grades and coronavirus. These things are making me lose a lot of sleep.

It has gotten to the point where these two things is all I want to talk about. And that's bad for my social life; I can't go in being a panicky, doom and gloom person, no matter how serious I feel this is.

I have robbed myself of vital mental energy and I find myself too disturbed to even stay in my classes, and I procrastinate on sleep and study by browsing coronavirus subreddits.

Everytime I hear someone cough, I involuntarily snap my head around to see who it was.

When I walk the halls, my eyes dart around madly, and I feel very scared and angry on days I have to spend many hours on campus. I also feel bad about myself every time I touch my face.

My obsession with Coronavirus is running my life and it needs to stop, I have to deal with my feelings like the grown up. I have already done all I can to protect myself, and prepare for a possible community spread.

In other words, there is literally nothing else for me to do, but live my life, instead of acting like the world is ending.

I think I will chat with a counselor tomorrow, and try meditation, starting tonight. 

Anything to silence the alarm bells in my brain.",6.187058823529411,6.324045352941179,6.403137254901964,79.43411764705884,66.05882352941177,9.309803921568628,29.549019607843128,9.029198982220553,2.231596078431372,1035,32,201,16,15,332,152,255,0.11800000000000001,0.812,0.071,-0.8667,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,1,14,16,1,4,9,0,20,10,6,2,3,40,36,16,0,4,2,0,5,3,0,1,4,1,0,1,13,17,0,2,8,2,1,5,2,11,0,1,3,8,37,5,35,30,4,32,1,3,2,0,7,17,0,2,12,142,50,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13751989876828866,0.09965757609226428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025506199808156,0.221874231425983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20810291591862629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911574830478748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13066039724185344,0.0,0.0,0.0994979382850032,0.0,0.0,0.08036878973413321,0.12847646794912124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12752825658179498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041029819377272,0.0,0.1103752311610609,0.0,0.0,0.08230951463494336,0.0,0.10499667873952763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25204395454602063,0.08902766592178146,0.0,0.0,0.1138992875450682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07082371225569407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12789479866097278,0.0,0.14045439776512691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272437451542648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26406574347908146,0.1826472918955439,0.0,0.11004064681442156,0.0,0.0,0.1394165144383176,0.0,0.1059464120074796,0.0,0.0,0.0831839889319677,0.12634386135958228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255863978517782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240323033665132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11957505969925875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10881229309073352,0.0,0.0,0.2356100141159401,0.1404889258163284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247651171057475,0.12612083660827406,0.0993050160229788,0.11344823732064505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2494175132122145,0.1270331306082019,0.10558906961385224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08820579862537342,0.13282701543204642,0.0,0.1041868621053806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10016383755067007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16558233145036402,0.15970133703293854,0.0,0.0,0.07266620019753882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846079567832417,0.0,0.121734419171449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282352683621686,0.07350337248220264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433054220702443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,asyoulikerosalind,2020/03/12,"I don't know what to do anymore I hope this is the right sub for this, I don't know where else to post it. My father (in his early 50's, definitely not in shape) has a secretary who went camping over the weekend. She returned on Monday and has been suffering from diarrhea since, and now her husband has it too. She had Monday off and called in sick on Tuesday but came into work today. I asked him why he didn't tell her to stay home and he said she 'insisted' on coming in, which I don't believe in the slightest because he's a compulsive liar and she wouldn't lose benefits/her job if she called in sick for the next week, he'd just have more work to do. Anyway, he kept saying how her symptoms didn't match up to COVID-19, but I told him that diarrhea has been reported as a precursor to the illness in some people (especially in their middle-age, which she is). He then said it was because she drank too much over the weekend, which I tried to point out wasn't likely considering she's had it for 3 days and now her husband has it too. He started screaming at me how it wasn't the coronavirus and how insane I was acting. I don't know how to get through to him (he thinks the media is hyping it up to crash the economy in lieu of the election) or what I can say to him anymore. I've been able to manage my anxiety really well because I've been staying informed, social distancing, etc., but when someone else in my household is being so careless I can feel myself starting to spiral. I'm so afraid of either of my parents getting it because I know it would take quite a toll, and I hate that my Dad isn't taking anything I say seriously. My mom finally is starting to be more careful, but that doesn't matter if my Dad brings the virus into our house. Today I also called my grandfather (in his late 70s), who works out at a local gym for around four hours every day, and told him that he should consider doing his stretches/exercises at home. He laughed at me and told me to stop fear-mongering. I just don't know what to do anymore- I want to protect the people I love but feel so hopeless.",4.95971176364619,5.09082402810305,5.848255269320845,82.38478067014954,68.67213114754098,8.723797513961449,30.474599171320484,8.502166056373571,2.1472616465501706,1648,60,338,23,26,544,209,427,0.11599999999999999,0.8220000000000001,0.062,-0.9764,3,0,0,0,0,1,46.0,1,0,1,5,20,15,2,1,17,0,42,6,0,4,0,51,75,29,0,7,12,7,2,1,0,3,4,6,2,0,23,17,1,3,9,3,0,5,13,9,1,1,21,8,53,6,55,48,6,65,0,3,0,1,57,33,0,5,25,235,76,6,0.09060267762882544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245492856592586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06931080039561742,0.0,0.269560531626201,0.0,0.0,0.07455828384007991,0.0806555919727871,0.08470127312050063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22092220535552745,0.0,0.0,0.1020781916138844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775463915370129,0.10362532637865143,0.09237546819451622,0.0,0.0,0.07804618426789177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11686246339616813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513738225544377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104593529235543,0.0,0.0,0.07633666356372938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195320137618924,0.0916228722299966,0.0,0.0,0.09925080471848302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467231914689292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08945138662817897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1817637459050059,0.08998890214661925,0.08922538694480027,0.10454332543531222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08990917732410783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24896431080041276,0.0,0.10220376674017474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04426389177142442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10136122099926102,0.0,0.0,0.08177245392472247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061127610112979,0.0,0.0,0.06660339293488672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09635697552322328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060355140280454,0.0,0.0,0.12562497745363882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564881573269738,0.0,0.08677232027509056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963671001622868,0.0,0.0,0.058042395303178014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737419165039687,0.1723677884588472,0.21615265732693292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494747119680116,0.0,0.0,0.09235801997834917,0.07676735473810191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19238712466531552,0.1931407985649592,0.0,0.07574789541704781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417087320202099,0.13624387586904432,0.0,0.07919073372226147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05805453744877205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17176148899819588,0.2597242235003801,0.0,0.06151327079401611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05343980669991458,0.0,0.07267600292457642,0.0,0.08146268813247133,0.08398958987130592,0.08175482421499859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19787948515940246,0.0,0.0,0.06436154266970265,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Rohade,2020/03/12,"As many I'm worried and as many I may think that my situation is the worst I opened this because I need support but also to share practical tips if you chose to isolate, my situation is a bit particular as I live in a place where we can't find common medicines and the hospitals are already a mess, no water, random power and lack of staff and even hygiene protocols. 

I'm afraid because my mom needs medicines for blood pressure ttht cant live without and we must go every day to find them on a daily route, we can't stock as dont find that many and they are expensive as well

But I want to isolate us, I'm 40, very overweight with diabetes and blood pressure, my mom had lung problems in the past and is 70, my grandma is 91, we live together.

Now this, how can I isolate us as much as we can?, I purchased antibacterial gel, washable gloves and made homemade masks more for mind relief as I know they are not useful. I plan to buy canned food and got some vitamins, echinaccea and hidroxycloroquin as I read it was used to treat the coronovirus. My plan is to avoid as much going out as we live in a very crowded place and if someone gets fever start taking as many pills as possible, hospitals are not an option here. 

What I'm afraid is to be on the 20% that need assisted breathing, if that happens if first world countries like italy are letting people die as they have not enough intensive care rooms, here it will be chaos as we dont even have water on hospitals, thats why I cannot sleep, what happens if we need assisted breathing, we just die? what will happen also in the rest on the world if most people need it that its available, on Italy they let the elder die the people like me with diabetes die according to ani nterview to a doctor I read few days ago, also a ama on reddit the doctor said that in such cases they will do tought decisions, that means letting the weakest die.

resume: Hospitals are not an option here, and me and two more relatives that live together are in high health risk, I need to find daily pills but want to isolate, don't know how to do that and thats' why I'm very stressed. I feel trapped and useless.",9.138745771532657,6.306119316159254,8.667287275565965,75.17427465521729,61.927400468384064,11.830809263596153,38.242128545407226,9.861636050157227,3.4884281550871705,1696,62,342,25,18,543,199,427,0.201,0.747,0.052000000000000005,-0.9973,1,2,0,0,0,0,37.0,11,1,6,4,15,19,0,7,20,0,39,19,6,5,1,78,72,45,5,17,15,2,1,2,0,5,10,1,1,0,20,29,4,1,10,2,3,2,13,11,1,2,5,2,40,8,47,57,12,31,0,1,0,0,23,21,0,12,10,224,60,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06118375029557116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07616738359666496,0.165590366801892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04693725923671882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08415021987592979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535403888652711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07037242768060219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902683163247084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35816917809764875,0.0,0.0,0.14129367984524846,0.0,0.0,0.16178630679570782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131807398653524,0.0,0.0911766287061972,0.0,0.058153928104647035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034899546794812636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25233906666698497,0.05870999334909771,0.08346155612141894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03606109426417562,0.0,0.07845347338727397,0.0,0.055203119141501215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18310751612761292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336705267647259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07292542749777052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758652629287267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.211738709071678,0.0,0.06744122835702139,0.0,0.3047380136332644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531019118139532,0.0,0.27990949497348633,0.0,0.07518508416389348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969244362474145,0.16167523144851306,0.0,0.0,0.10147807733376744,0.3070731881128608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588921406707299,0.1435532855235632,0.0,0.1442263910269038,0.0,0.0,0.07781182214048582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604463721633164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13808115771570387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0656556332804906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516701624790255,0.06907174734243518,0.0,0.05848203235259935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0488540564639961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906435388087654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832523479910974,0.0,0.0,0.05189587933308268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04422644689109191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06742436756423123,0.0,0.16604969584154605,0.11922552201811144,0.0,0.17085088953909428,0.08142181048189477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06205897779265712,0.0,0.12456305915539315,0.0,0.0,0.06653464907920653,0.0,0.0,0.07009509041264714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,ricctp6,2020/03/12,"(Venting) We Have Done Everything Right. Our Roommate, However... I'm on edge because we have a roommate,
 who we love, of course, but who is a walking minefield. He and my fiance go back a long, long way and he's a cool dude but he's also just super oblivious. He also has ""I know everything"" syndrome while being one of the simplest minds I know.

Two weeks ago, I watched as he literally sneezed into my fiance's dinner. He has this absent-minded habit of fiddling with anything that's not his. And I literally just heard him open every cabinet in the kitchen even though he owns no food or cooking implements here. My fiance and I are just sitting here like...wtf. I'm 100% positive he hasn't washed his hands except when he takes a shower, and he spends hours at the gym and parties. 

We have had many serious conversations with him about quarantining and how it's important to keep my fiance safe. It is hard for our roommate to remember conversations (legitimate health issue) so we even began writing him reminders every time he comes over. He just thinks he knows better and doesn't follow them. 

Thankfully, he is not around much bc he hangs out w his girlfriend all the time. But she is constantly around sick people and kids and if neither of them have it by this point, I'd be shocked. 

Every time he visits, my fiance and I lock ourselves in our space and wait until he's gone again. Then, we disinfect with soap/water/disinfecting wipes on anything we think he's touched. That, of course, is a crap shoot in a big house or in a shared kitchen. (We don't share a bathroom with him thank god.)

I'm doing everything I can to protect the man dearest to me but I feel like I'm fighting a massive ignorance monster who puts my fiance at risk every day. It's infuriating. I just am hoping we make it to a day where we can stop living in fear

Also, does anyone know if the disease can be spread through the air conditioner? Someone told me that today and I think he's full of shit since they dont really ""recycle"" air and the virus is droplet-motivated. But I definitely want the answer. 

Thanks for letting me vent (pun intended?)!

On the nice side: my fiance and I already worked from home and are having a creative revolution with all the excuses to stay in. I'm also becoming so much better at meditating since my daily 10 minutes has quickly become a daily 20. 

Stay healthy and physically/mentally well everyone. You are stronger than you think you are.",4.151485479025259,5.9880198985200845,5.105911316345832,80.62586819850898,72.00211416490487,8.023344831423168,28.937854678980752,8.6894789155246,2.31512177589852,1944,78,362,36,38,635,254,473,0.098,0.7440000000000001,0.158,0.9867,2,0,0,1,2,0,68.0,13,3,3,4,26,23,3,2,24,1,33,12,3,3,2,80,64,39,0,4,17,0,4,1,1,0,3,1,4,2,13,38,5,6,11,2,1,8,8,8,1,2,6,7,50,15,44,54,7,60,0,0,1,1,63,27,2,5,22,227,63,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07886119179132023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817395332980186,0.284577819264632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06220567646957305,0.0,0.1464195344835495,0.15839358984550814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06840780165508151,0.0,0.05423161049182885,0.1965074310531403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1573628040987949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766345829071982,0.0,0.09613844674192616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474880192903215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07785296982761503,0.09104102913126323,0.10426511048922443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11751972653768313,0.0,0.2998239274659949,0.08500888598016103,0.23986523992050385,0.0,0.0,0.10010919991551946,0.04498285639438968,0.0635558780769086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757558588182344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05056027443235118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07969424298231381,0.0,0.0,0.09456454016520152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08923811577557568,0.08836129590412227,0.08761159020635413,0.10265247706366888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285527130937164,0.0,0.07907526434906723,0.0,0.0,0.19556908562221054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909716870088454,0.0,0.08692660417859792,0.0,0.07855681556996155,0.1574606281639302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029345647840043,0.0,0.05938414091588106,0.09019550232160882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17965649822202362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307975088250179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060284288603857414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061676415318656565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08409970752242182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943336205064001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0569925973539708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007788357315098,0.07597474444819458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09132023694959587,0.1471838309327574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537888323982607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189647510371344,0.0,0.07437786261860428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06688983387737331,0.0,0.0,0.2457182131834883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280180795507399,0.08740664901325594,0.0,0.15562681933472156,0.0,0.08432744145258142,0.08500888598016103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690487190152181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247325459284589,0.0706154586018982,0.07136153065946263,0.0,0.07998929334075615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476682985137114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,qdolobp,2020/03/12,"How quickly can it spread pre symptoms? How quick is coronavirus to spread?

So something happened that I’ll get into in a second, and it made me wonder how fast does it spread pre symptoms? My buddy was eating back in his hometown and the waitress was a coworker with someone who got quarantined 2 days ago. My friends waitress was moved locations after that and was working today. He said she was coughing but was also very old. Is it possible that the first outbreak lady got the current waitress sick before she showed symptoms? Is it possible that the current waitress got my buddy sick if it’s been 2 days? And lastly, tomorrow is my last day around him before break. Assuming he was around it today, would he be contagious as of tomorrow morning?",5.952589928057556,7.578169762589929,6.045388489208634,76.47757913669068,67.20143884892087,8.437697841726619,34.763309352517986,8.841846274778883,3.2651951079136694,603,29,97,10,10,191,85,139,0.09,0.8959999999999999,0.013999999999999999,-0.9171,3,1,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,2,10,1,0,0,6,0,15,7,0,4,0,17,23,12,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,1,6,1,0,0,12,8,1,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,13,1,9,1,10,8,0,26,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,3,19,68,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12405047051500045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11191186557047388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2491567639364272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760704713498496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23816130530136398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707537613937458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12246451415116374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14319598479648282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903491145450926,0.0,0.0,0.10811913066491012,0.0,0.07311411427292941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33577410032813315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375057876605094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2281434246108183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13241685752079788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487365961713885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14684598020271794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315527998905798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331172437299048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11857271898121235,0.10773447612681283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4363611272978989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652980141918231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546711413212805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15176153457614186,0.10187971465214224,0.0,0.0,0.09941104702913788,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,peanutismint,2020/03/13,"What's the gameplan for surviving this virus? What should I expect/how should I prepare? Seeing lots of talk about how countries/governments are planning to handle this Coronavirus outbreak and how to *avoid* contracting it but not much on best practices for weathering the storm if/when people DO contract it, so any advice would be appreciated.

A bit about my situation: I'm 35, reasonably healthy, just moved to the USA and only just got basic health insurance via my part-time job (which I started about 2 months ago after finally getting a work permit but is currently unable to offer me hours due to it being in the events industry and lots of events cancelling).

If (or is it more like when) I contract the virus, should I be expected to self-quarantine in my home and just endure the symptoms as if it was a bad flu for however long it takes for my body to fight it? Should I just administer the same self-care as I would for any flu-like illness? And at what point should I seek medical assistance if symptoms worsen? Are there any specific preparations I can make now in case of quarantine?

Also, should I be worried about the potential costs going to a doctor/hospital without fully understanding the US healthcare/insurance system or will COVID-19 tests/treatments be financially covered by the US government? As I mentioned, I just signed up for health insruance through my part-time job but I don't know how it works in the US/whether I have to go to a specific healthcare provider etc.... 

Feels like there's lots of people saying ""wash your hands a lot"" but not many people saying ""here's how to survive it if you get it"" or ""here's how bad it's going to get before it gets better""..... If I knew it was just going to be a case of feeling awful for a week and hardly being able to eat/drink anything without vomiting then I'd at least feel a little more prepared for the worst.....",7.3204189944134095,7.264643360335196,7.245189944134079,75.00001955307265,63.72067039106146,10.511955307262571,34.939106145251394,10.125756701596842,3.474025251396648,1505,61,271,30,20,481,191,358,0.10400000000000001,0.8370000000000001,0.06,-0.9613,4,3,1,0,1,0,56.0,2,2,0,7,23,9,1,1,21,1,26,11,2,8,0,58,46,30,0,14,22,0,5,2,0,9,9,2,1,0,19,6,0,1,7,0,1,5,5,5,0,0,4,8,25,4,47,26,13,31,0,0,1,0,10,10,0,12,17,190,44,5,0.09318418813591996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105851017315596,0.08260216037031015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07451936158577531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901053300631811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668264702846837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15560980957470888,0.0,0.0,0.07929288076390976,0.0,0.0977910564411036,0.08241384187349439,0.1017329989512928,0.1035066261475258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09537796510925302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912850287822686,0.0,0.0953506879211173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039250018992503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14135017617929166,0.0665708026233824,0.0,0.10207872329576836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19473956906194573,0.0,0.2118348861924064,0.0,0.07452790778988409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08347472932992234,0.0,0.0,0.1981008689987956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347133847461987,0.0,0.09176765478859628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18494185633758664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05121159282244949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105017481611677,0.09339503687678716,0.0,0.08246507416489672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168874578202283,0.0,0.0,0.06220116916780601,0.09447414093316084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093873266073138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437872994107936,0.09904004490170354,0.0685011001900071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07087077411770303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018187900367157,0.0,0.1938065492098582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08808917757983795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09580886520834388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820761309026134,0.0,0.0,0.07425573334681966,0.0,0.19442286188410746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047429317292074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06595624797898834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937081021232231,0.07006291256291064,0.07489792066934116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700802616639263,0.3362673145831368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07474673493905429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1796524641550373,0.0,0.1356783975625481,0.09463306632015958,0.0,0.13239074733357556,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,AdjectiveFood,2020/03/13,"Just as I thought my health was finally under control. I recently got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. I've been going in and out of the hospital for most of 2019 since I kept rejecting the treatments. It's been steadily getting better since November, but my medication suppresses my immune system making me at a higher risk of complication. I am only 25, never smoked, and my company allows me to work from home now; I am probably going to be fine.

Yet, I am still anxious and frustrated. I thought I could finally go back to my normal live, but then 2020 happened. The notion of being hospitalized again terrifies me. All the bullshit I went through last year might be for nothing and I have no control over it. I am taking every precautions I can, but I realize that nothing is ever certain.",6.242094594594598,7.507251993243242,7.403621621621621,68.34272972972975,66.22972972972973,10.784864864864865,37.097297297297295,10.793553405168565,4.613343783783783,637,33,101,18,10,216,103,148,0.156,0.784,0.06,-0.95,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,4,7,6,1,1,6,0,15,4,0,4,4,27,27,9,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,3,6,0,4,3,0,0,4,2,3,0,0,8,0,21,3,18,14,2,23,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,2,13,82,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17295799174009166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11772347632189968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13540338889764714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434264971434657,0.12223688144210905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15539199243469615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384865700847705,0.12899228659528233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33542435965571826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07998776966353073,0.0,0.2610286162962893,0.0,0.12244704351596546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13538470497115004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627367951562069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535705132359937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479590212840627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13518898713195596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219459386015477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15423086782805828,0.0,0.16241356291518522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807918199542765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15000425350420638,0.2938047289788812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643848619588405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16506632964657575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15116652998036564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532897098951265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12226484683859633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511119469008432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2430865872027376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14192406036523966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145770184073768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859056523787434
COVID19_support,christiankitten,2020/03/13,"girlfriend just lost her job to COVID-19 My gf and I just moved to Tampa this year. I secured a full time job ahead of the move, and she started a part time job just a month ago. Anyway, her employer (Sea world parks) just shut down with no guidance or assistance to part timers due to the virus. She's freaking out a bit.

We share income, and it's going to be a hard. It doesn't look like the state of Florida has issued anything regarding this scenario, as opposed to California and Washington State, so it's just up to us to power through.

Things could be worse for us, but it's really hitting home how many people in the area just lost those income all at once. Please be kind to each-other, and consider how hopeless some people must feel right now coming home from jobs that are ending.",6.106858974358971,6.049332891025642,5.920000000000003,83.49166666666667,66.24358974358975,8.984615384615385,29.51282051282051,8.515128840125781,1.9539666666666664,625,19,126,8,9,195,108,156,0.106,0.8240000000000001,0.069,-0.4414,8,0,0,0,0,1,19.0,3,0,0,4,11,8,0,0,9,0,8,0,0,2,2,25,16,11,0,2,8,0,2,1,2,1,0,0,2,0,9,9,0,2,1,0,0,4,2,4,0,0,2,3,10,4,22,8,6,26,0,3,1,0,10,10,0,2,11,82,19,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11474174387534095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106519013613913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14131617934698984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11150206437660164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10334820252397504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464641318485705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06544932012750013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07356437212533111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595381972939307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2596799970087723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13510290062884742,0.5138013586226932,0.0,0.0,0.13479300874863173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632383934737315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869794119247324,0.0,0.2826005488563367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13123298026587565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10331866796718787,0.2751508535507536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785056953101574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2803442405357164,0.0,0.1794763505063172,0.0,0.0,0.14208748059122986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0829232967425114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105420102138084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09161909178471936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859949292421845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509563173691387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31140346217397696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13191156092333936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335583813124814

COVID19_support,vidagee,2020/03/13,"My dad had a kidney transplant in January, and I’m his primary caretaker. I’m nervous I’m going to give him COVID-19 My dad had a kidney transplant in late January. He has diabetes, high blood pressure, and COPD. He lives alone and has been on leave from work since his transplant.

I live and work about three hours away from my dad. I live in a busy metro area and confirmed COVID-19 cases are now being declared in county I live in. Since the transplant, I go to my dad’s four days a week (Saturday through Tuesday) and work in the office in the metro area three days a week. I am his only caretaker and the only person who he spends time around - with the exception of a homecare nurse who takes his vitals twice a week. 

As of yesterday, my workplace is allowing me to work remotely entirely (meaning three days from my apartment), with the exception of going to job sites. I work in the civil and environmental engineering industry.

I’m terrified of my dad catching COVID-19 and losing him. We were so excited and hopeful when he got the kidney transplant. It was great to see him excited and mobile and not exhausted and sleeping all the time.

I’m taking all the precautions to wash my hands and avoid people as much as possible (other than my significant other who lives with me). I plan to fill multiple pill boxes when I visit this weekend. I don’t know what else I can do. I don’t want to not spend time with my dad",4.764563636363637,6.1654735563636365,5.5201363636363645,79.97620454545455,69.8,8.99090909090909,30.47727272727273,9.3871,2.773272727272728,1128,46,211,24,20,367,138,275,0.06,0.862,0.078,0.7101,1,2,0,0,0,0,32.0,1,0,0,7,6,10,0,3,17,0,15,10,6,1,2,32,32,20,0,2,4,6,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,8,20,0,1,2,1,2,6,4,5,0,5,6,2,31,5,38,25,3,41,0,1,1,0,24,17,0,1,18,137,39,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11879698821989952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021093634291369,0.0,0.0,0.1077665846445384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22192047918084104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581905161692814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11003289593101892,0.1955638776338872,0.0,0.0917379058838766,0.12645968836794627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12118927532307568,0.0,0.11392526282589832,0.1129586584117554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11382433180949852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06303738320086001,0.0,0.12938918811011013,0.12145317177029825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5064211524401131,0.0,0.0,0.12832253163707033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12494442854250346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08431938677105652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744725324708442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07952013099673662,0.10015362225122576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12930960654377827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09140288086865364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18976585224521025,0.0,0.11478513452642028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724837062853651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20065149694844625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676543871346884,0.0,0.27602179391503473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41752319483996303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I never thought this would‘ve crossed my mind but when thinking about it, she was in two airports only a few days ago and I‘m kind of reluctant on meeting her. 

In case you don’t know, we currently have about 85 cases in vienna and our government is handling the situation pretty well, this week they started to shut down schools, universities and pretty much everything but supermarkets, pharmacies, banks &amp; posts. And it was adviced to us that we keep our social life at a minimum. 

I don‘t know whether if I am overreacting but everything sort of starts to get into my head and i cant help but get paranoid over this. 

I‘m really sorry that this post is way too long, I guess I just want to know your opinions on whether I should meet up with her or should I cancel our park date. I mean, we will be outdoors, do you think it will be less risky?  

As mentioned, she came here a few days ago and she was gone for many months and I did miss her and need the social interaction but I also am kind of scared at the same time, ugh i just feel like i‘m slowly starting to loose my mind lmao.",3.5236363636363635,5.2988224535315975,4.137000675904023,87.18045201081448,73.53531598513011,7.716187901318013,25.981919567421432,8.438071523408619,1.6336007434944235,1076,37,221,19,22,341,157,269,0.106,0.805,0.08900000000000001,-0.1844,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,8,3,1,0,12,9,0,2,10,1,20,2,1,0,1,55,46,24,0,6,12,0,1,1,1,5,1,0,0,0,10,20,0,1,10,0,1,4,4,4,1,1,8,1,38,5,33,31,5,43,0,1,0,0,31,17,0,5,19,149,48,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764921859290366,0.1953042719684421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809666476528434,0.0,0.11936068849645715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519923991331197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14209100009104367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526469490301947,0.1980133488944044,0.0,0.10385110998962307,0.0,0.05570131404059129,0.0786998916398059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1702220718124381,0.0,0.17266559489145894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135607376454832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305819030183938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383939486259188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435970524826805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09791721747797932,0.0,0.2294339405255021,0.1816267784225128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07781081376002537,0.05381968227386901,0.0,0.19455046677013532,0.09749007290121477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168717157079903,0.0,0.11999892172822706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2224648194672219,0.0,0.0879304102698817,0.0,0.0809818861980717,0.0816838691587363,0.08496387339089696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08378331075631848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21100985568497346,0.22414910561559984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705727207576448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2205831433405626,0.11149001910612166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12382691889355167,0.0,0.22459296242393828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12331755430532088,0.23392009849786666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411749683549705,0.0,0.08745647483786938,0.06423645978147098,0.0,0.10442087664258798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761245393139963,0.0,0.13251155249656987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649765147678027,0.08744162000782328,0.08836546516365222,0.0,0.09904904013196754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825606015455856,0.0,0.0,0.0

So, many of you have already noticed the Covid-19 has become a national Pandemic. Naturally this means it has caught the attention of reddit and redditors. I'd just like to remind everyone during this time to take all information from reddit with a grain of salt! 

Many of you here are looking for support. Some of the reasons for your anxiety may be from the things you read on reddit. Reddit (and many people) fall into this mind set where they read an article or maybe took a class and think they have a complete understanding of the situation. 

If you do not have a degree in Epidemiology you have no business telling anyone what will or should happen. This is how misinformation spreads so rapidly on here. What you SHOULD be doing is preparing and taking measure to protect yourself and loved ones. 

Please guys! Be safe and don't let a anonymous site drive your opinion!

""Its not near as bad as the annual flu season!""

""Everyone prepping are a$$holes!!""

""Maybe you should talk to your doctor about upping your anxiety meds? You're going pretty over board...""

I just want someone to put their hand on my shoulder and say, ""I hear you. I know its stressful. Is there anything in particular you want to talk about?"" Is that too freaking much!?! No. Instead they immediately shut me down.

I have family coming in from out of state next week. We just had our first confirmed case in my city, and there's several near where my family lives. Not to mention their travel plans.

I have a sinking feeling about all of this...I feel sick to my stomach over it all.

I wonder if any of you know any other beautiful, inspiring and uplifting initiatives? Please share them

I'll go first:

* In the Netherlands hashtag ""#coronahulp"" is getting a lot of attention on social media. People offer to do groceries for elderly and others who are at high risks or to drive them (so they don't need to visit the crowded super markets or use public transport, and be able to keep social distance), or to babysit children whose schools are closed.

* I also came across a story of an anonymous donation of face mask to a police station somewhere in Asia, but I can't find the details

COVID19_support,Joshnee,2020/03/13,"REALLY worried about the possibility of my mother getting it, just need your guys opinions. My mother is currently 57 (turning 58 in July) and I am just really stressed about the possibility of her getting it. My dad isn't really in my life and my mother is all I really have. She quit smoking 7 years ago and smoked when she was like 20 all the way to 50 (around 30 yearsish). How fucked is she if she gets it? She has gotten medical tests recently and she is all healthy, but I am just scared that if she gets it she won't be able to fight if off due to respiratory problems from smoking, despite being 7 years clean.  


I'm just really stressed and maybe it's even ridicules to get reddit users thoughts on something with so little detail explained, but fuck I just cannot stop thinking about this and it is stressing me out so much. She's all I have and the worrying is killing me... I mean, i know the mortality rate is higher in older people, but 57/58 isn't that bad right? It's just the smoking that worries me so much. I just need to hear other peoples thoughts. I literally want to protect her so much.

COVID19_support,ScarbucksCoffee,2020/03/13,"I think I just had an anxiety attack. Help... I don't have the virus yet, thank goodness – I'm going to uni in a pretty rural area that hasn't been touched yet.

I've been trying to talk my mom out of making me fly back home for spring break (California, set with coronavirus infections and shutdown schools) and she finally relented yesterday, but came up with a new solution: to drive 12 hours to where I'm studying, pick me up, and drive me home.

The problem here is that I have an absolutely horrible relationship with my father. He is abrasive, hurtful, and emotionally damaging by nature. Just being around him makes me feel like I am in a minefield. I believe he is a good person at heart as the values he stands for are positive and virtuous, but he is the type of person who is willing to throw everything away to teach his kids the virtues he wants to teach – even if it means destroying them emotionally. He knows about how I feel about him and he even took that into account, and decided that destroying his relationship with his child was worth teaching me these values.

I despise him with every ounce of my being. I hate him more than I knew I could hate something. My mother knows about this – she's even taken me to therapy about it before – but she still decided to sign me up for 12 hours crammed in a small car with my dad.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to potentially jeopardize my health and disrupt my life by entering a coronavirus-inhabited area, just for someone who I want out of my life permanently. I don't want to end up trapped at home with my dad if things get worse and restrictions get stricter. I know something should be done about my family situation in the long term – I just want to know some way I can get out of going home for the short term.",7.888914807302233,6.577374591954026,7.923414469235972,74.71597363083166,63.13793103448275,11.866396213657875,35.70047329276538,10.966923227221727,3.6712743069641647,1410,53,280,32,17,458,180,348,0.153,0.747,0.1,-0.9689,0,1,2,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,1,0,20,13,6,0,15,0,27,5,1,4,0,58,57,16,0,10,9,5,3,1,0,2,4,0,4,4,12,22,0,1,12,0,2,9,5,9,0,0,9,3,46,4,55,42,4,48,0,2,0,0,33,21,0,3,15,185,58,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0743754564331633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654923089363617,0.0,0.11060538774182027,0.09134436552913862,0.07475861398364055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272975405844049,0.10953721569827103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119740218632723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07762478750888457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09949305472224466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2187259533704164,0.08611086835366874,0.0,0.0,0.19264495406514132,0.0,0.0819147111666625,0.0,0.0873779132665065,0.0,0.09165334894813387,0.0,0.09831790865099124,0.06945624973449196,0.0,0.10650322691646036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15238527562685944,0.0,0.11050833231721892,0.1630923590541605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919754979332441,0.0,0.10334367986850272,0.0,0.11520992068049585,0.06516663927941074,0.0,0.3900910532708589,0.0,0.19149047021724316,0.0,0.1040794107965418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26715654913313425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1373431957770786,0.04749832833002457,0.0,0.0,0.08603944311704392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979443747848288,0.0,0.0,0.10590453051157526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386659782531505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09389874025896376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697830382239339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891091291875198,0.0,0.09302944028041513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087625926165672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983950352229121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092829128899728,0.0,0.0,0.08237687366504448,0.14969428727824674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07764254653491923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814429866550422,0.0,0.08951002957603818,0.11118316423310637,0.0,0.06459075190705489,0.06229667953800765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10801851553577714,0.0660081483100433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28672371349916503,0.07717122438044187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990787129003437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,iah_c,2020/03/13,"quarantine makes me depressed I'm not in gov quarantine or anything of that sort, I can wilfully leave my house if I want. but I don't. I stay home, I only leave to walk my dog on a field, a meadow, with no people on it. I miss people, I can't touch my boyfriend, I can't take a train and visit him, hug him, kiss him. spending my days with my parents is not the most fun thing ever, but at least I'm not completely isolated from any human contact.

I miss my friends, all schools are closed and they were only closed yesterday... but just the thought that I won't be able to see them for weeks. it's only the beginning and I'm already struggling. ever since January Ive been experiencing this inthebackofthehead anxiety, hidden but showing symptoms. started suffering from migraines, thought it was school stress but I figured out it's the fear of that virus. it's all I hear about, it's everywhere, when I was passing people on the street I heard them talking about it, when I turned on the TV it was there, when I tuned in the radio the updates of increasing numbers were broadcasted every 30 minutes.

I'm tired of it, I get angry when someone talks about it, I hate it. and even tho I do, I still look up new info before bed, just like I've been doing since January, a daily update. it's like I'm the only one allowed to know, like no one else is allowed to talk about it in my world. it's crazy what it does to you, and my country is not even largely affected yet.

I've struggled with depression most of my life, ive got better, was happy for a brief moment, then this came and took it away. I'm not gon list all the things I struggle with mentally, but when you top them off with fear of a global pandemic it really amounts to something a young adult should not have to deal with.

every day I wake up and I can't shake off the feeling that I'm in some movie, some book. it doesn't feel real, it's like I'm making up a fun story to write about, imagining the world. i can't believe this is happening.",3.000615853658537,4.39113077804878,4.228826219512197,87.56445884146343,74.14634146341464,7.3689024390243905,26.227134146341466,7.972316293177498,1.4526890243902435,1569,55,331,23,32,515,206,410,0.166,0.73,0.105,-0.9803,3,3,1,0,0,0,52.0,0,2,4,2,20,24,1,7,20,0,28,7,1,5,5,60,60,22,0,3,16,1,3,4,1,2,4,2,2,2,29,17,0,0,8,4,1,8,15,13,0,2,14,8,45,11,45,43,10,53,0,5,2,2,22,23,0,7,25,214,74,4,0.09547921593673178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10536368902729208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492914095880242,0.0,0.07304133885349348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07857125935949467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897058663561524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124578038561588,0.10757238036011786,0.0,0.08444360745985645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920278707826787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010814134156172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12315239096147007,0.0984348791524676,0.1644722175584829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08355450528931589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07976063328974622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612624328055913,0.17273283420609373,0.16089071482302614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21488132546187025,0.0965543208141148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07376700538628335,0.0,0.049883949567631335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07636345117697288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08443195532789895,0.1016394007934571,0.0,0.09426595861439227,0.0,0.0,0.10761201557874434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577343848396312,0.0,0.0,0.11017019590606997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052472880081613486,0.0,0.0,0.20219740713309048,0.0,0.0,0.06743979387198919,0.18658528826081214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017849433184566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12746623609206167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622059271297126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09221442172034866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12939837548051972,0.2904649847125356,0.0,0.0,0.1060183700943342,0.0,0.0,0.19857979912825904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10867625079655918,0.061166430614122726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932601278400646,0.07608457336581563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15796278815571538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089922982142601,0.07350456512053961,0.0,0.0,0.06758068046884623,0.1017681402746398,0.07624982518260519,0.0,0.10937111926492912,0.2994468217722163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923946369710523,0.07178848784938721,0.2302277312445771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686429698982005,0.0,0.0,0.1515996646437025,0.0,0.1097393131592065,0.0,0.0,0.10608092204167036,0.0,0.10385396939211444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05631611534066864,0.0,0.07658766780692262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,WitchOfTheFuture,2020/03/13,"To those who are self-isolating/self-quarantining, doesn't matter if you have the virus or not, what are you going to do to keep yourself occupied until it feels safe to go out again? Me and my boyfriend are staying inside as much as we can right now, so I'm trying to find out more stuff to do to keep myself occupied and happy.

I'm currently going to up my study of languages because it seems like a good idea, read more and keep an eye on my friends. My boyfriend is just a gamer so that's all he's going to do haha.

COVID19_support,eggrights,2020/03/13,"I tested positive. (Vent) I've been fevery and coughy for a bit more than a month now, and I got my results back today. I tested positive. 

I'm in highschool (a freshman) still, so I'm a bit worried about what this could mean for my grades. I'm in the middle of taking midterms right now. I missed one today and I have two I'll miss tomorrow (Friday). My state actually shut down schools for 3 weeks (starts Monday), which also raises a bunch of questions. I hope my teachers explain more in the morning. If they do, I'll have a friend tell me what is said.

My parents keep reminding me that I should be fine. Saying things like, ""The people at risk are the elderly and those with weak immune systems."" I'm still worried. I've self-quarantined and my parents don't want me to leave the apartment. I don't want to risk spreading it, so I have no interest in leaving. I think I've already given it to my mom and dad, and I'm terrified of something bad happening to any of us. The last thing I want is to be hospitalized. My family can't afford that right now. We wouldn't be able to pay rent. 

My relatives two states away told us that their grocery stores were nearly completely empty. I'm a bit worried that we might not be able to eat, or we'll have to DoorDash everything to our apartment. Even then, that's expensive and my family doesn't have infinite money. I'm not that worried about (unlikely) death, I'm worried about how my family will be able to support me if it gets worse. I keep hearing the media say that children shouldn't be showing any symptoms, that should just be carriers. I'm showing symptoms though, and a large part of me thinks that that's a bad sign. 

If it gets worse, I honestly don't know what I'll do. I'm a broke kid, so I can't help them pay for anything. I know it's out of my control, but it's a scary thought. I feel worse than I did last week, and last week I felt worse than I did the week before. I don't want it to keep going on that same path. If my parents can't afford rent because I managed to catch it, I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for years. I know it's overdramatic and I'm overreacting. It's a very scary situation already, and it only got scarier once I started to experience it firsthand.",3.181568933250155,4.494705622270747,4.482424204616347,86.23291266375546,73.56331877729258,7.592364316905801,27.49619463505926,8.146662555663855,1.6952676731129128,1757,66,368,27,35,581,210,458,0.145,0.8029999999999999,0.051,-0.982,7,1,1,0,0,0,63.0,6,0,3,1,17,16,0,2,20,0,39,5,0,3,0,57,84,25,1,15,9,5,2,1,1,8,4,4,2,2,31,16,1,4,12,2,7,3,14,8,0,4,11,6,52,8,42,56,8,45,0,3,0,0,27,16,0,8,24,228,83,9,0.27878334068210714,0.0,0.06801308138134286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15382217441481336,0.055735734205458576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479111577596586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0573537338753255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548153138930887,0.05359179517897459,0.1163862223408199,0.04248593422659897,0.0,0.05930602238930083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282694028294979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307475715754301,0.0,0.07816980550089961,0.05564645318194252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131623896377387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04603344181305657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06263812263787485,0.06817590037901686,0.19710909188486328,0.0,0.03524030838775368,0.0,0.06691893153018266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053846829364754725,0.0,0.0728263945741721,0.0,0.03960974926856217,0.0,0.11148425244316157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06163179686726649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855227157619507,0.0,0.04671564918965115,0.0,0.0,0.0692236902410491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1858465818892613,0.0,0.0,0.11490902491850108,0.17043422352955334,0.0,0.1475956523228457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0340498645917031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759191965349144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07393626717442535,0.0,0.08162691980507195,0.05563055069606112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422378983061909,0.04722770165394039,0.05300682326180039,0.0,0.0,0.2321669310325785,0.07547379768012412,0.0,0.04831831658319755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07807528603218658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903972484811255,0.06629669943283213,0.11084985102718667,0.0,0.07053590607562928,0.0,0.0,0.07270795617971111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834103887269447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05365525894470116,0.0,0.0,0.09866214171238763,0.0,0.1113183679939264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909000781850017,0.0,0.14488131760168865,0.05240259429452872,0.0,0.06091723190732552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09260563197215874,0.08931655396558605,0.06847580418995929,0.055330708025063687,0.0,0.0,0.13212700484310955,0.0665973572548385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13616540752133405,0.0,0.16767101657659791,0.0,0.0,0.05750636315402088,0.1644336373616001,0.0,0.2236231799433041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3538975186600878,0.28410404128217753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044881832782104114
COVID19_support,The_Oaks,2020/03/13,"Question about my personal health, and precautions may relate to others. Not sure if this is the right place for this but... I am a 30 year old male living in Florida, USA. When I was younger, maybe around 10 years old I had mild Asthma, I had an inhaler I kept on me, and when I had severe attacks I hooked a machine up to a wall that was a little more heavy duty, but I haven't had an attack or issue with my asthma or breathing besides normal fevers or colds in probably 20 years. Should I be worried enough about COVID19 to get another inhaler? Could it activate my asthma?",6.70342105263158,5.903486535087719,6.93228070175439,79.20263157894739,65.2280701754386,9.705263157894738,33.03508771929825,8.841846274778883,2.616361403508772,451,16,88,6,6,146,81,114,0.079,0.89,0.031,-0.4696,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,5,3,2,0,7,0,13,6,1,0,1,19,15,10,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,2,5,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,7,3,13,1,12,4,2,16,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,6,7,63,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187268647943642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15898420394916535,0.0,0.4063469852027311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14259069573927952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18453265015989528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933066321097016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898343001714572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18640301550085567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1789954941096207,0.15769947256518874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17941905926609114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17498164726286722,0.0,0.0,0.37480325072163534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15593911636993865,0.18658999515478136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19255172833071252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20006323348179492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525160743956713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20175744083890226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16832027500079355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813682293142875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3450210065426577
COVID19_support,flashb4cks_,2020/03/13,"It's not a sense of doom, but an obsession with the virus and all the new info surrounding it. I'm sure i'm not the only one who has been feeling like this. I thought I was doing just fine because i haven't been panicking or feeling helpless about the virus. But it turns out today, I found out I'm completely obsessed. It is all i think about. All I wish to talk about.

I'm in Canada, and for the past week, i've been following closely worlwide how the virus developped.  A few days ago, while most people around me still thought that this virus wasn't going to touch us all that much, that it wasn't a big deal, that it was all going to be just fine. I was following the progression in Europe, how it all turned out. I got as much info as I could on the virus online but did not talk about it much irl because i did not want to seem paranoid.

Today, when the prime minister anounced the new rules and guidelines to avoid spreading the virus, most people around me were either shocked and scared, or were completely dismissive, laughed and thought it was ridiculous. I was calm, I knew it was coming. I had already bought extra toilet paper, canned food, hand sanitizer, etc. I was not surprised at all. But now that people have been talking about it, I found that it is all i do online, but it is also all i do in real life.

I can't stop talking about it, keep arguing with people who are mocking the virus and brushing it off as ""just a regular flu with extra media coverage"" and those who are mocking people who are taking extra precaution (2 people i know who are doing it are fucking nurses for christ sake.), i keep giving information to people who don't know much about it. I keep track even more closely of every new cases diagnosed. I can't seem to take a break from my phone. I read testimonies from people in Italy. When i try to do something else, i keep having the urge to check the news to see if a new case has been diagnosed. I google it, look at every sub. Being away from my phone and information gives me anxiety. 

The only moment i feel ""at peace"" is when i am looking for new infos and when i am reading about the virus. I realize that I am not fine at all because i am ""well informed"", like i thought. I realize that this is just my coping mechanism to deal with the fact that i have no control whatsoever over this situation and that the more i know, the more i feel ""in control"". Truth is, i feel like i have lost control over myself at this point..",4.733719512195119,5.340089231707322,5.372103658536584,83.93181402439026,69.28455284552845,8.345121951219513,28.179878048780488,8.376592526197632,1.813017073170732,1930,63,392,27,32,624,206,492,0.1,0.785,0.115,0.7885,0,1,1,0,0,0,63.0,1,0,0,5,25,25,5,4,26,0,53,7,1,5,13,98,99,29,0,4,19,0,7,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,40,22,1,9,26,2,2,5,13,13,1,1,29,11,47,12,54,67,25,51,2,3,3,1,21,25,1,7,23,287,87,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06221541815905876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745170241535464,0.05612750588145063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053691894172711564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496036646300547,0.0,0.0,0.0659418071830097,0.0,0.0,0.1283537154669158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06045879491186135,0.14717681288726553,0.0,0.23615780507152084,0.05603759729329017,0.0,0.0,0.045263991914788096,0.14471681919628887,0.0,0.14247408461220398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058631174468630136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827564583488576,0.046357015170578025,0.0,0.11826901545407073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17744007901703254,0.10028140435626118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486886778294958,0.15391006868681675,0.0,0.06488557984661114,0.0,0.13465710231430528,0.07977633978368852,0.0,0.05613394282765055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24953721980432006,0.0,0.0,0.11571673117590825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04957425935013703,0.1028676128005277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178766791563792,0.0,0.07661601926748762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063783597702952,0.0,0.0,0.3389290948060125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04755966957531038,0.1067588263363126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06700022449672256,0.3892636043092959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06634820437925339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14040945391004106,0.07988673056171444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07026816343264737,0.0,0.05592894278029647,0.12778891193499498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889170534431525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05403240676597261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05605041759439743,0.05867841608123915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06614922339699347,0.0,0.10554187403819568,0.2256505366347272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044972184178416766,0.0,0.2228785309369758,0.0,0.0,0.13305573788788078,0.0,0.0,0.04765150606886511,0.15268384784682065,0.0,0.0,0.08442479589808764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04139736418515524,0.0,0.05629876203491031,0.0,0.06310540356290302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071012998193673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,AcorazadoPotemkin,2020/03/13,"It feels quite strange but a deep search on Twitter yields no testimonies about people suffering or recovered from COVID-19, except from politicians, journalist, or media. Discussion
Today it would be very simple to just share a video, a tweet or a post in reddit or any other social network about your medical conditions and personal insights. When there's such an event we can normally find plenty of ""independent"" testimonies (natural distastes, crimes and so on). Where are those who share daily all their life and thoughts? Don't they even say ""hey, I just went through Covid-19 but don't worry, I'm feeling fine and probably you will"".

Options:

- Everybody who's infected is told not to share any information to prevent panic.

- Nobody wants to share such a painful experience.

- Nobody is actually recovering.

- Nobody was ever told to suffer from Covid-19.

What do you think? We'd like to collect, in as many languages as possible, real testimonies, or stories about relatives recovering.

COVID19_support,Gabrock,2020/03/13,"We are testing the Social Impact of COVID19 on the Halo Effect (trustworthiness x Aesthetic) in Asians and Caucasians Hello  people, my name is Giulio and I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the  Nanyang  Technological University (Singapore). Last year I started to   investigate the relationship between the aesthetic of faces (Asians and   Caucasians) and perceived trustworthiness. Our study was preregistered   and approved by the Ethical Review Board of our Institution. Around the   beginning of January, we were half the way through our data collection   stage, but as you all know, COVID-19 started to spread around,  therefore  our original hypothesis is not suitable for testing anymore   (accordingly to our pre-registered plan). On the other hand, we ended up   having standardized values of trustworthiness and aesthetics for a   certain number of human faces (adults and children, males and females,   Asians and Caucasians). Because of this, completing our data collection   will allow us to empirically investigate the social impact of COVID on   faces' perception. We are therefore here to ask for your help, or  better  for 5 minutes of your time. The study is completely anonymous  and the  participation is on a voluntary basis. The final dataset will  be  published for free for other researchers (and curious) to use on the   data repository of the Nanyang Technological University. Results will   help shred the light on how global events, such as COVID, affects   individuals' perceptions and especially the strength of the confirmation   bias effect (more aesthetically pleasing people are also perceived as   more trustworthy). Thanks in advance to all those who decide to help  us!

COVID19_support,RainforestPerson,2020/03/13,"Am I being irrational to fly back? I'm currently visiting my parents and my brother in my hometown for a week. Few years ago i moved to the opposite coast for a job where I've been seeing someone for the past 4 months. 

My job allowed me today to wfh indefinitely until corona is over and my original return flight is booked in 2 days. My parents are 50+ and are in the high risk range. Also 5% of my time here is arguments with my parents, which is exhausting.

I know if I don't leave now, there's a good chance I'll be stuck here for months. At the same time, if I catch it when I'm there, I'll be all alone with no family and maybe 2 friends + the person I'm seeing. This is also my first relationship but I have never connected with someone on this level before.

Is it irrational, selfish and dumb to leave my parents who've I've known for 25 years for someone Ive know for 4 months?

COVID19_support,punching_dinos,2020/03/13,"Asthmatic freaking out Just another ball of nerves over here. 

I live in the US in a city with no official cases but only because they aren’t doing any testing. Confirmed cases have traveled through my city and I’m sure there must be community spread.

I have asthma and am currently having a bad flare up, the worst I’ve had in a year or so. It started with chest tightness and shortness of breath last week and now with additional wheezing/coughing. I went to my allergist assuming it was allergies who gave me oral steroids so great now I’m immunocompromised too. I’ve been self isolating as best I can—working from home, ordering groceries, really only have left to go to physical therapy for an injury I’m recovering from.

I’m scared shirtless though. I felt a bit feverish and achey the other day although the thermometer was only 99.5 at highest throughout the day. I don’t know if it’s COVID or just allergies but I wouldn’t be able to get a test because I don’t meet the stupid criteria.

My mind just keeps going in circles. When is it bad enough I go to a doctor or the ER? Should I even go to a doctor? What if I have an asthma attack and need to go to the ER but then get infected by doing so? What if it gets worse overnight but I assumed it was just asthma and then it’s too late? What if they don’t have enough ventilators and oxygen?

Honestly I’ve been on oxygen and close to ventilation before for asthma complications and it is terrifying and I’m freaked out about catching this. To make matters worse I live alone so there’s no body to monitor me or make sure I’m ok.

Basically I’m just freaked out and don’t know what to do about my asthma right now or if it’s even COVID19 but my mind just is going into overdrive and making me feel so anxious and stressed.

Thanks for listening all.",2.3269502371452213,4.751106671309195,3.7739983437476496,85.28647820522474,79.77994428969359,7.000858239855456,25.858691560641432,8.098718942377014,1.7832807498306114,1441,58,282,28,37,474,182,359,0.185,0.736,0.079,-0.9916,2,1,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,2,1,25,17,2,2,17,1,29,11,3,3,4,65,59,40,0,9,21,0,3,0,0,3,8,1,1,1,16,23,0,2,6,2,0,9,8,10,2,0,9,4,24,7,39,45,6,40,0,0,0,0,8,16,0,12,14,187,40,4,0.10787738702131908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11172843883641068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07336032244772399,0.1131188462945019,0.0,0.12187074125667975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272610142199344,0.0,0.0,0.1801462242426705,0.1315221076929806,0.0,0.09179571081015088,0.0,0.11321066217299658,0.0,0.11777416662900148,0.1198274577646229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391439803103819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2208341535452103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22293235647257195,0.0,0.1425039934234263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05454604823078422,0.0,0.10357920897384523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16908444673106302,0.0,0.3678552304774507,0.0,0.0,0.1189352000316359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082098149668848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09588637825107492,0.0,0.0,0.11857318133903487,0.08793446862542112,0.12169039136828635,0.0,0.1172090966436376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19051541829034985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21602698055510733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21785081701068928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07998971556690049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24613684191284566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06910901648422398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09212669908417792,0.0,0.0,0.10800408377066532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125396418471316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635616977555347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357318235327636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20334632118231727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09931900418519077,0.12336719366638155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10598898502503544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12976321399431867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08653273280482722,0.0,0.0,0.10000341854605507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853602256499874,0.0,0.21987254719546695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06946950034266411
COVID19_support,samhouston78,2020/03/14,"Wedding planned for next weekend - Practical advice and emotional support advice for my friend appreciated One of my sorority sisters has a wedding planned for next weekend. 200 guest RSVPed, but 30-40 have already told her they aren't coming in the past week. There won't be a lot of back of house support, but I imagine the venue will have at least... 10-15 additional people milling about doing various things? So around 170-180 folks drinking, eating, sweating, dancing, and trying to act like everything is normal.

She's floated the idea of canceling or trying to reschedule, but obviously this is weighing pretty hard. She paid an outlandish amount of $ to have hand sanitizer on every table and is in the process of contacting everyone invited to tell them more about the situation (amount of people attending, what the venue is doing to clean/support, ask them to confirm again if they are coming, ask them not to attend if they have been exposed or are feeling sick, etc). Almost everyone is driving in or already local.

Her city has issued guidance discouraging gatherings over 250, but hasn't formally prohibited them.

If she does decide to have the event, what's the best way to mitigate the potential risks? The venue doesn't seem like they are going to pull the plug (unless directed by the state/city).

Any thoughts appreciated. She's taking it in stride right now (she wanted to elope afterall), but if she decides to cancel I think she'll be really upset and I don't know how to help.",8.450710784313724,8.551297845588238,8.140823529411763,68.99437254901962,61.352941176470594,11.07686274509804,37.98627450980392,10.650279960617883,4.22512862745098,1202,54,196,26,15,384,166,272,0.069,0.7879999999999999,0.14300000000000002,0.9706,0,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,8,3,9,9,0,2,15,0,27,6,2,1,1,38,43,19,0,6,14,1,3,2,2,3,1,0,0,0,5,8,3,1,9,4,1,9,6,3,0,1,4,3,22,6,35,34,8,30,0,1,0,0,29,10,0,10,12,133,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23446194597173226,0.0,0.0,0.12013024539663734,0.0,0.26477451087849146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815820976744391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679661930478118,0.22430706659824468,0.0,0.0,0.09224769711906243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589861918568873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20668296953944776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498447555278012,0.0,0.0,0.11752259863288345,0.0,0.1227568285337436,0.0,0.13494742895452602,0.0,0.0,0.1337956119317084,0.0,0.0,0.10107789674847828,0.2292684102280107,0.10781916421923313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06065923493847136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926866881296506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818036494739117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10746742638848347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041176905486462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13842653006796946,0.0,0.13542884413887452,0.0,0.1252150301049617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593106831327895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722024184152792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10199218320352693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2551738566567289,0.0,0.11754279924583692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08129316630004135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11452267101072737,0.16634088925681187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12205020198335492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07685433139989291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245169476272176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10921401853710304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348486349782935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4084135115470606,0.0,0.0,0.0902007225283489,0.0,0.10485699050669817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797011581824988,0.07687040889766872,0.0,0.09524089234618197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463420511400535,0.0,0.16290028260897144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07076001244622268,0.09522471530186516,0.09623079103489653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I've never been this scared before in my life. I've more in the past couple days than I have in probably years. I'm terrified for my family--  especially for my grandparents who absolutely aren't healthy, and my parents. My mom is my rock and I can't imagine losing her or my dad. But even if we make it through without getting sick/only mild sickness, I'm so scared for the future financially. My whole life, we've lived check to check. We have no insurance. A hospital stay would ruin us. Even outside of that, with the stock market in flames and talk of another recession/depression, I can't help but brace for us to lose our jobs. My mom's a teacher, my dad works in the auto industry (he was already laid off during the 2008 crisis), and I work a very non essential job for a non-profit that has had money issues in the past. The closest friends I have work at a tattoo studio and I'm terrified for their health and the future of their shop itself since we live in a place that absolutely is not taking this seriously.

God, it feels weird to blast this all out onto the Internet. But it's becoming harder and harder to hold it all in.

Pro tip from a printmaker: you can shorten the process by putting all paper products in a blender with some water to get the process started. Just don’t put in too much at once or you’ll fry your blender.

Posting this because I’ve been seeing stores are gouging people for $100+ for a pack. There’s alternatives to this if you’re running low or out entirely. All you really need is any kind of paper, a pot, burner, towel, and something to flatten the pulp.",5.387285115303981,7.8135761981132115,4.810880503144657,81.54848008385746,70.0377358490566,6.5979035639412995,29.70230607966457,7.3871296695380915,1.8021689727463317,471,19,82,5,9,142,80,106,0.025,0.975,0.0,-0.3382,1,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,6,0,0,5,2,0,0,7,0,6,1,0,2,2,14,11,5,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,2,4,1,0,0,0,1,4,1,1,0,0,1,1,6,1,16,9,5,13,0,1,1,0,6,7,0,4,1,50,8,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18544800984841486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16623777206072568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14247653725413706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27354425610620525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2839791568945228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182031977145205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2004687511671832,0.2022064934460044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29042076348225315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18905855419525674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2611749629396841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5482855006652884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747011073828542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21730970874555167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2099407926099983,0.0,0.0,0.1930212307152066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,AliensAreCommunist,2020/03/14,"Some guidlines I have created to protect my family from getting Coronavirus as I leave hostel for home. I haven't been tested and don't have any symptoms. I am not any expert. I have written most of these intuitively. Feel free to add something or point out a better option. 

Try to follow these guidlines for 14 days as it usually shows symptoms within that time period

1. Stay in your room. Avoid any physical contact.
2.Clean properly after using common utilities like washroom, taps, don't touch unnecessary places, clean it, if you don't (mark on that spot and ask others to not touch there). 
3. Use hand sanitizer or wash your before using common things like plates, wash them if you use any. 
4. Wash your own clothes, do your own dishes.
5. Keep distance during any interaction and use face mask while talking.
6. Ask anyone to wash their hands if they touch the same thing as you

The guidelines mentioned are of the strictest order, try to modify it as per your use case, given the knowledge of how it spread. https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-transmission#infected-surfaces

COVID19_support,Ben186,2020/03/14,"Scared of self-isolation Up until tonight, I was not too concerned about Coronavirus. My university announced that all classes will be online for the rest of the semester. This has been happening elsewhere, but I didn’t think it would happen here. I thought that, since I am young and healthy, I wouldn’t have to worry. And I still don’t think that I’ll get severely ill even if I contract COVID19. 

But I am terrified of the self-isolation. 

I have depression that gets exacerbated when I self-isolate on my own. I live alone, the vast majority of my social interactions are at school, and my family lives in another country. Once I heard the news that classes would only meet online for the rest of the term, it sunk in how much I enjoy school and how much of my social needs it fills. I have a hard time learning through online classes, so I’m nervous about coping with that too. 

I’m also feeling greater anxiety, like this is uncharted territory in our times. The world is afraid, people are stockpiling, major events are being cancelled. I know I’m young, and this hasn’t happened in my lifetime, but this is not normal. When will we feel safe again? 

Any advice for staying connected, or ways to cope with being alone?",5.219097186700768,6.83550713478261,5.4882097186700785,79.81221227621485,68.95652173913044,8.71611253196931,30.920716112531967,9.168548406835145,2.7247698209718667,971,40,177,19,17,308,136,230,0.159,0.76,0.08199999999999999,-0.9564,0,4,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,0,0,0,14,7,0,3,9,0,25,1,0,2,1,32,41,17,0,6,7,0,3,1,0,5,1,1,0,0,13,8,0,1,7,0,0,1,6,4,0,0,5,4,23,3,24,28,10,24,0,1,0,0,7,9,0,2,13,125,36,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649699847187032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26814222799618964,0.0,0.1035210827710148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08803040887581567,0.1357395654573557,0.09902886175854043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149505712367283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550047484074251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12203389744368645,0.0,0.13090757423367544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526451796321906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3434165048209489,0.0,0.11596173370734388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114231022102957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324270956485091,0.0,0.2286133649589333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1903212242233952,0.0959855018662464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126833471717177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785997798664335,0.0,0.09845252451659604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08974429998403814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12960198834137612,0.26202053225912697,0.0,0.0,0.4051336072139177,0.14624160342900874,0.0,0.10708234101953194,0.0,0.0,0.2639158555527739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13797642886715847,0.10337890180609599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16589260925152946,0.0,0.10276880509238004,0.15096662030672178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275134940214646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314627136214515,0.0,0.1839150687980628,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Acrobatrn,2020/03/14,"Always thinking worst case scenarios.. Anyone else do this?  Every time I see a story about a lack of hospital beds or equipment, I envision my sweet, loving, 60 year old parents in that position.   I picture them deathly ill with no help to be found.    

They're only 60.  I *need* them in my life another 20+ years.  I'm terrified I'm going to lose them to this virus.  I'm terrified my husband or myself will be one of the rare cases where someone around age 30 gets very ill or dies.  I cant stop thinking these things.   

I convinced them to begin self quarantining over a week ago.  They thought it was a little extreme at first but agreed to it.  With all that has changed in the past few days I think they see the importance more.  But if this virus spreads for another year, theres no way they will self quarantine that long.

COVID19_support,littlemsmuffet,2020/03/14,"Relaxing Resources Hey everyone! I have compiled a small selection of playlists on YouTube for you to help bring some peace, calm and relaxation (and hopefully a more restful sleep!). I am in no way associated with any of these creators or artists, nor am I a medical professional. I personally use these playlists for myself and went as far as creating a whole new account in order to share them.  Was going to do one for iTunes and Google Music but it requires people to pay money for the music and at least YouTube is free. 

I hope they help one of you in some way or another. Xox

I traveled a couple weeks ago to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, which is now thought to have been a vector of community spread leading to cases in several states. I had a mild sinus infection when I went, but after I returned home, it turned into a bitch of a cough that took me down for a week. I monitored my temperature, which stayed within roughly normal parameters. I had no other symptoms -- just generally tired and a bit achey, but of course you are when you're hacking all day.

I thought at the time I had just overexerted myself (I wasn't gonna take a 16-hour road trip just to stay in my room when I got there!) and made myself worse, but now hearing this news, I am suspicious of COVID-19.

My friend that I went with has been ok, but had a mild cold when he got back.

But I'm not sure if that's meaningful. He's 25 and I'm 30. Few or no symptoms are common in our age range.

The thing is, I'm not in any danger. I'm nearly recovered at this point, and was never ill enough to have considered going to the hospital or anything.

But I'm worried for my loved ones who are older and one who has respiratory disease. I just want to KNOW, so I can try to at least do what I can to stop spread. It's supposed to be contagious for several weeks, from all I read.

Is there any way to get a test for someone like me who is not in medical crisis?",4.234454513767865,4.455329827814573,5.5347751829905905,83.6912460787731,70.25827814569537,8.874451028232832,28.808644126873478,8.841846274778883,2.000447682119205,1136,39,247,19,19,382,169,302,0.109,0.785,0.106,-0.2124,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,2,1,0,1,15,7,2,0,15,1,25,9,0,2,4,39,49,20,0,4,17,0,1,1,1,1,8,2,2,2,16,7,0,1,4,2,0,7,7,2,0,2,16,4,27,5,39,31,6,50,0,0,0,1,15,17,1,4,22,165,43,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10532291369268364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423961695553941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777516445694352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09136190851248803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12971592777004573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13146726791670574,0.0,0.07662627134707149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276833824218845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179668420662156,0.0,0.1241525568635966,0.0,0.06752567770479763,0.0,0.1900554746912311,0.0,0.0,0.11764618360427595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391388411650074,0.0,0.07963963239359538,0.0,0.11918179465001615,0.0,0.11700949154053004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06529797945626603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05804732988138925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723577205299856,0.1124262503658375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196942774419874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163796177066204,0.11475290484725433,0.0,0.0,0.11641411987921335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16102513242382258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10374525140729424,0.0,0.0,0.11231920334659304,0.13394680430640532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884781323816325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268455752608834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10067212317469552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.253283369337462,0.0,0.09933521200078724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111982353455663,0.24698992895627545,0.08933458955359001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893584500879734,0.0,0.0,0.18865272445660886,0.06928236685555565,0.13656112271842868,0.0,0.0,0.1320085700919231,0.08066803389774722,0.12923731934039948,0.0,0.0,0.14292060963351466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07008055469515242,0.18862068104113008,0.2859202668853765,0.0,0.0,0.22028661442777572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12066307021304787,0.12108330827959335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The issue is that at this point, you **ALREADY KNOW** almost everything you need to know about whats going on, but you are still exposing yourself to your stressor.

&amp;#x200B;

We all know the media runs on clicks, and boy are they mining them hard now. Think about this. How likely are you to click a link with a scary title? Scrolling through a feed, which are you more likely to click, ""A Timetable to Recovery from COVID-19"" or ""How Will the World Recover From the Untold Damage from Coronavirus"" (I suck at making up headlines, but hopefully you get the point)? Hell there has been an article running amok today about Lung Scarring with a sensationalist headline like ""Why You Will Never Be the Same if You Get Coronavirus"". If you see that in passing it will scare the SHIT out of you, but only if you really read it, and it's source will you discover it's based on research with a sample size of 20 of only the worst cases (and no concessions on if you may heal).

&amp;#x200B;

Another big offender is the reddit community. For example /r/coronavirus now has almost A MILLION users (at the time of writing). With a group that big there is almost no filter on what a user can spew. I have seen people making claims about shit like ""My brother works for a finance company and they said we will need to switch to a gold economy after this"", ""10 million deaths is a gross and negligent underestimate, it will be 25 million"", and people literally claiming it's the end of humanity unironically. I have seen so many people make claims that world renown researchers and scientist are WRONG and they are RIGHT it makes my head spin.

  
The other issue with these communities is that ANYTHING remotely positive, or even mildly optimistic is immediately stamped out. If you post an article about how a very credentialed researcher thinks it may be ever so slightly less bad than ""we are fucked"" you will get called dangerous and downvoted out of existence. Some of these people do truly believe the this is the end, other are trolling, some are fantasizing, and other get off on the fear. There is almost no positivity allowed on many of these communities. If you find yourself having anxiety over Corona these are not places you should frequent

&amp;#x200B;

No amount of reading about bad things happening around the world is going to help you if you are already doing what is being asked of you as a citizen. If you are conforming to what the WHO/CDC ect are asking you to do there is nothing to gain by reading about horrible things happening elsewhere.

**So What Am I Proposing**

If you find yourself struggling with anxiety over corona, or the news it is time to lower your exposure to it.

\-Do what you need to be doing right now (stocking a few weeks of food/hygiene products/medicines,practicing social distancing whenever possible, washing your hands, coughing/sneezing into your elbow, keeping an eye on symptoms, ect). Look for CDC/WHO guidelines on what you should be doing.  
\-Wait and read any updates that come from Government/World Agencies (The CDC, WHO, The President, ect)  
\-Follow your country/state/local authorities on twitter, or find their website that official updates are released on and follow it.  
\-Otherwise do whatever you need to survive remembering to try and eat well, sleep well, and try and exercise.  
\-If you feel up to it check in on the news, but remember to have a discerning eye for sensationalism and bad articles  


This is all just my opinion, but it has helped me the past few days.

COVID19_support,Vegetable-Chain,2020/03/15,"Have been positive – but now I feel completely depressed I really just need to vent. I've been pretty calm about the whole thing for a couple weeks now, but in the last two days I can't shake my anxiety and depression.

I live in the US and I come from a family that has a history of anxiety, germaphobia, and OCD. My mother is agoraphobic and works from home (grateful for that right now), and my father is a SEVERE germaphobe, on the verge of being agoraphobic and really should be seeking therapy. I'm a 21-year-old only child, and right now I'm in school and am able to be preoccupied with all my schoolwork and hobbies. The lockdown gives me a chance to work on my music, study for some exams I have to take this summer, learn to sew, paint, read, exercise, etc.

As positive as all that is, I can't shake my anxiety. I had a day about two weeks ago where I lied in bed for hours unable to get up because I was having anxiety about the virus. Since then, I've been feeling better, reading a lot of articles about it, and keeping busy. But in the US, things blew completely out of proportion in literally three days. Since then, people have been panicking to the extreme, especially my parents. This is the worst kind of thing to happen for parents like mine. I feel worse for them than I do for myself.

My personal concerns lie with others. I have the means to not leave the house for months and I am grateful, but others don't. I'm worried about people and children who don't have food or a stable home, I'm worried about the repercussions of this and how hard it might be for me or my family to find work once this is over. I'm concerned about my extended family yes, but I am also very concerned for my boyfriend (who is still going out and still has to work). He has severe depression, bipolar, BPD. I'm concerned that he will a.) get the virus and not care, not do anything to get better or b.) will finally be told he can't go to work and therefore can no longer afford his therapy, his car insurance, etc. (he works at a grocery store so this is very unlikely, but it could happen). Every time I tell him to just stay home, he won't. He can't do that and even if he could, he probably wouldn't.

Yes this was possibly the year AND the summer I was going to go on a few trips, graduate, see one of my favorite bands, POSSIBLY get engaged... and everyone has selfish concerns during a time like this. But I am so worried for other people. I'm oversensitive and I can't bare the thought of people not having food or shelter. Like I mentioned, I'm also incredibly worried about my boyfriend. My father (because of his own issues) has disallowed me from seeing my boyfriend and going to work, which I agree with to an extent, but I miss him and really hope he doesn't get the virus. I can't even just get up and go somewhere because (perfect timing) my car battery died and can't afford to replace it right now obviously. Not that I want to anyway, I have my own issues in the past with germaphobia.

Luckily I have a therapist at school who is still keeping our weekly appointments through phone. I'm a huge yogi and have been able to do lots of yoga during this. There's so many things I'm grateful for and that's why I've been feeling relatively calm... but not anymore. Now this all feels nightmareish. Any good news to calm me down would be appreciated, even though I've probably read it before :(",4.953337856173679,5.687795776119401,5.7943080054274105,80.64170624151967,68.85074626865672,9.135685210312076,29.555630936227953,9.279504587578698,2.4399850746268656,2670,96,525,51,44,877,273,670,0.09300000000000001,0.763,0.14400000000000002,0.9815,5,1,0,0,0,0,95.0,3,0,1,10,33,22,0,2,34,2,67,4,0,2,5,87,111,51,1,9,23,5,6,3,0,7,2,0,4,3,32,33,2,2,9,6,1,12,19,8,0,4,12,8,58,14,80,84,14,66,0,4,2,0,35,24,0,10,32,362,90,15,0.11592659874262574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05138096758730982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09270645913135127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03941703121872181,0.0,0.17736706146610895,0.0,0.057484017773181635,0.0,0.0,0.0476988565894098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10600166790257508,0.0,0.049322498566263265,0.0,0.0,0.10252765591273101,0.0,0.0,0.07300274645668141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059097446760452324,0.0,0.0,0.04993024998710634,0.12154683318580392,0.0,0.0,0.09255795606279413,0.06413528827478375,0.0,0.11214459873114348,0.0,0.14977111444217162,0.0,0.06015675352264509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12928880141047192,0.1148526377095687,0.0,0.04883657965693392,0.05538641651191368,0.0,0.0,0.16392792013720542,0.0,0.1465399288220708,0.0,0.0,0.06349596123758318,0.052977405531673016,0.0,0.14017890335733413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1817005894473244,0.05560367843003061,0.19765127278485184,0.048616865462545296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10251350841463226,0.0,0.05192373108442098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17442574592394558,0.0575706349053946,0.05708217406322296,0.0668818651729526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209972504113943,0.0,0.10304088746791078,0.0,0.0603598566624002,0.0,0.04724782524613175,0.0,0.06137476479449047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0849538207004444,0.0,0.051182655281741804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855664867657883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058765687862934166,0.0,0.06313902553884156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06148990076871759,0.0,0.0,0.04626575255604928,0.0,0.0,0.042979052033529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060822732213742174,0.06172902211300189,0.039277431755979975,0.04408370109818693,0.0,0.0,0.12872276891566786,0.0,0.05533252793395135,0.16073781409619242,0.050611317262349784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13068982179077773,0.0,0.0589695136428996,0.12498848061753075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17393695518993926,0.0,0.11139832143710808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14850102287104228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732390695326547,0.09237849013053692,0.0,0.0,0.13096405938472952,0.0,0.09589568043231687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617811648674356,0.1388686972565299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0435811875056158,0.0,0.05066247848636425,0.0,0.13257216876545316,0.067299858091003,0.15403296212287254,0.0,0.05694864733656956,0.04601638513745397,0.10139659797575552,0.0,0.0,0.05538641651191368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11324344217792733,0.0,0.13944542462175147,0.0,0.0,0.09565158477824018,0.0341882557465029,0.0,0.13948398739003948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05230286206812248,0.06471395375931463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29538580597315617,0.23545817646830164,0.05906955400257032,0.04117546482507712,0.0,0.0,0.07465292878741299

COVID19_support,Skipsy222,2020/03/15,"Husband is ER physician and can’t self isolate - worried for him, me, and our toddler Hi all, thank you for this sub. I appreciate the support rather than the constant bad news of the other ones related to COVID.

Any suggestions (logistically and emotionally) regarding my situation- my husband is a US-based ER physician so he will be working in several large urban hospitals during this whole ordeal. I anticipate he will be exposed and will this bring home COVID to our toddler and me. I don’t really have any options of where else to go since I don’t want to leave him for potentially weeks or months. All our relatives within 3 hours drive are older and thus at higher risk.

Technically I am still expected to go to work but anticipate taking vacation/sick days as I wait for the tests to come back on my husband’s patients, as I don’t want to be a vector at my work.

Any thoughts on what I can do to manage all this? I’m less concerned about my work but am very worried for my child, my husband, and me.

Also- any other medical spouses on here??

Thank you in advance!!",6.558333333333334,6.656712140096619,7.32687198067633,73.25668478260872,65.28019323671498,10.378260869565215,35.607487922705324,10.125756701596842,3.592629951690821,851,38,157,18,12,284,122,207,0.065,0.878,0.057,0.3765,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,3,2,0,5,8,5,0,1,6,0,18,3,0,1,3,23,31,14,0,4,4,5,0,0,0,3,3,0,1,2,7,8,0,1,1,0,0,6,4,2,2,1,1,0,25,3,28,24,5,23,0,0,0,0,18,9,0,2,8,107,32,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138195040362248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3871511854455539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944130609630398,0.118837782370009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12260281199792444,0.0,0.1538058075679266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178966764214462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11889662820892075,0.16009963761002802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16177635698231926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427664054064325,0.0,0.1401642302394511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15070460795727803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433803022373809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11360470584538596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964450124440244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117884424482156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14847895393924498,0.16078992149425794,0.0,0.11773504120740892,0.15998242989502806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366317871120628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1615119203586486,0.0,0.0,0.1070128056594368,0.0,0.0,0.2620726635639365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129923887280404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17120283979437514,0.0,0.0,0.1174353550092224,0.1678972684057404,0.0,0.1141667899193906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589039251444661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4144653843075,0.2890816143557457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,remyymer13,2020/03/15,"Autistic college student dealing with changes due to pandemic Sorry for the long post, but I'm starting to spiral and trying not to panic. I'm an introverted college student that deals with mental illness (depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies) and mild autism. My spring break started last week and was extended another week. When classes start back up, they'll be online.

I thrive on structure. I do well when I regularly have to interact with people in person, have a schedule to follow and have responsibilities/obligations. It's hard to find the right balance of responsibilities and obligations to keep me going but not to stress me out and make me shut down. I live alone with my dog.

After hearing about my school's response to the virus, I feel like I've been blindsided or hit by a truck. Just an extra week of no class was bad news. An extra (unplanned) week of no classes, no structure, no human interaction is really tough and probably not going to end well for me. And having classes online isn't great either. I'm already panicking at the idea and feel like I will probably fail. I feel like I would be able to handle a single online class, but not a whole course load online.

Being alone is also tough. As an introvert, it's difficult to find the right balance of interacting with people and having enough alone time, but I need at least some in-person human contact. I can have my weekly therapy sessions over the phone, but I hate phone calls and know that this won't compare to in-person therapy. Also, because of extended spring break, many of my friends and fellow students have gone home to their families. I know that we ought to stay away from the public and it's not likely that I would be able to see my friends anyway, but knowing that they're all so far away contributes to my overall feeling of loneliness and hopelessness.

I know a solution could be to give myself a more structured schedule. Like set a schedule or a to do list or something. But I don't do well with this either. I can't seem to self-impose structure. It has to be set by someone else and enforced by someone else.

I'm also worried about the virus. I know I'm young and healthy, but I still personally don't want to get sick and I'm worried about my loved ones that are at higher risk of being affected. I don't really know what's going on with the virus or what's going to happen (I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fj9x3e/worried_and_confused_about_potential_quarantine/) about my concerns with quarantine). I'm scared about being alone with my dog if we're under quarantine because I don't know how to handle it, in a practical what-do-we-do sense or in an emotional how-do-I-keep-myself-sane sense.

I was already struggling a bit before the pandemic, but now I really don't know what to do.",6.2877870619946075,7.395549616981133,6.5017520215633455,75.41933962264152,66.0377358490566,9.302425876010783,31.746630727762803,9.461161749540981,2.9555649595687337,2267,88,393,43,35,727,239,530,0.177,0.731,0.092,-0.9929,1,7,1,0,0,1,80.0,1,0,2,1,20,25,1,5,25,0,42,3,0,3,1,80,83,40,1,7,23,0,5,5,3,6,2,1,1,4,16,28,0,1,16,0,0,6,17,13,3,1,5,7,41,12,70,62,12,57,0,3,1,1,23,19,0,8,30,261,57,13,0.13930530854574966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2885565747410109,0.1537268720261734,0.16710360737162142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303688113191258,0.05328408987105078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13088192302907325,0.05355859173407798,0.05815705692453786,0.08491922310436187,0.0,0.0592692786258224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07604265858668446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112314764621279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07368327260833325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055611976748829055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14361765623509634,0.05999172906219299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11637171002320673,0.07834986106602129,0.06169157768267774,0.07196981119200024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06566232352098297,0.0,0.1408738993138402,0.14927961038940052,0.0,0.0,0.12732252828236226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10762693582068734,0.0,0.03639063705028873,0.06681717279716866,0.1583408342772895,0.0,0.0,0.07679229723131507,0.0,0.0,0.06159361214207997,0.0,0.06239509705292647,0.06876757586090981,0.0,0.0,0.07850360356624926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06986729136599014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862936852385873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238209589277566,0.0,0.0,0.3062342177127643,0.05677620964832046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17014384293130871,0.0,0.06150456981873055,0.061640407190288266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06286423990245509,0.0,0.046493687588868335,0.07061685901631791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07019349302793505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05164656057775905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04719844116016099,0.0,0.0,0.08172238228648207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09657676077149548,0.2432720443318259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13341597804286445,0.0,0.15019468392880064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13386382165604666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11896597234679585,0.0,0.0,0.06973445793092939,0.0704922047018874,0.05550414749593237,0.06340916047928087,0.07266290908605627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11803293586800083,0.0536220161800609,0.0,0.07797044391168721,0.1479015215837547,0.0742404618743411,0.0556246996763193,0.0,0.07978688013782438,0.07281607745861737,0.0,0.07618869869127667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15930776090008786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04061502283832129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04728958013097607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041082940128186425,0.0,0.2793557893718061,0.0,0.1878783034164376,0.0,0.0,0.0777647010559788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147130286880266,0.0,0.09895849432634032,0.0,0.0,0.0

I recall hearing that during the 08 financial crisis, we were pretty close to a point were credit would be basically locked away and any of semblance of trade would vanish. This would create chaos and lead to martial law.

Can anyone reassure me in that sense? I've largely come to terms with the effects on the health care system.

COVID19_support,emma3mma5,2020/03/15,"Advice on managing life This seems like a trivial thing to ask but I have no idea what to do at all so here goes:

* I work in the entertainment industry so there’s a lot of faff about keeping up appearances and networking in person if possible. Especially when people can have so little time, I do always feel pressure to keep them as it can be months before I see a person again. Also, I’m in the UK, so things like mass gatherings aren’t shut down by government order yet as of writing. Theatres, tours and productions within the country are still mostly ongoing and such. I feel a lot of pressure to keep going especially as most people I know in my line of work in the UK are doing so too (in part because we have to for financial reasons).
* I live with several family members who are over sixty and have been seriously ill and I am honestly living in fear that I infect them. They are my only family and I have anxiety anyway which doesn’t help, but I’ve been firmly at home for weeks unless essential. I've only had to go into London once in the past few weeks and to say I was anxious the entire time is an understatement.

So...

* I don’t know what is or isn’t safe for me to do now - I think going to the shops to get food is fine but what about something as simple as a hair appointment, going to a seminar in London where there will be a small crowd (under 50 people) or even just keeping my tattoo appointment? Are all those things safe to do if my hairdresser or tattooist will come into close contact with me? Let alone the transport risks just by taking the underground? I have all these things coming up but I have no problem moving them if necessary, as disappointed as I might be to do so.

I very much appreciate that some of these things sound so trivial but I have no idea what the balance between trying to keep your life normal and keeping home is anymore and I'm getting more afraid the more I think about it. I know I can work myself up more and more, and so any advice from people more clued in and aware about the virus than me would be so appreciated.

COVID19_support,causeimnotdrunk,2020/03/15,"I just saw a comment about how long we might be quarantined. Now I'm scared about money. I guess I never really let myself wonder how long we might need to stay in our homes. I don't know why it even matters since I'm always home anyway. I lost my job back in January which was actually for the best since I would have fought with myself about whether to stay or quit, but now I'm really low on money. I have a few side projects that could earn me a little from home, but my anxiety isn't listening to that. Doesn't help that I suffer from depression and finding motivation is sometimes impossible. I feel like i'm whining right now, but I just want to vent. I spent more than my budget stocking up and now I'm really glad to have 2 months or so supply of food, but now the balance of my account is haunting me. I just, I'm so uneasy about it. I hate being anxious about money and heading into this Coronavirus is uncharted territory.

COVID19_support,modernjaneausten,2020/03/15,"Pretty sure I’m confusing my allergies for the virus This whole thing is making me crazier by the day. I have an anxiety disorder but I also have seasonal allergies that always act up this time of year, but with the absolute fear I have of somehow contracting the virus, I keep having anxiety attacks that I’ve caught it. I have the typical sneezing and runny nose but my head has been killing me for two days and I’m worn out emotionally and physically. My sis in law lives 2 hours away and has the actual typical symptoms of the virus so she said I don’t sound like I have it, but I can’t shake the fear. I want to just isolate and work from home with my husband for a couple weeks so I can relax and not be near people but I think for us we might still be a week or two out from that. My state is testing at a slow rate so we have no idea the actual number of people who truly have it and that makes me nuts. Sorry if this is rambly. I just got past a couple years of pure hell and was thinking I could relax this year. 🙄",2.9750233644859816,4.105194014018694,4.569240654205611,86.12573014018696,73.81308411214954,8.153738317757009,24.12266355140187,8.660442795831766,1.4527953271028036,805,23,174,15,16,271,125,214,0.201,0.7040000000000001,0.095,-0.9752,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,3,0,0,1,8,11,3,4,14,0,22,3,2,2,2,38,34,19,1,3,10,2,0,1,0,1,1,2,1,0,13,14,0,1,3,2,0,3,4,7,0,2,6,3,25,4,22,24,1,24,1,0,0,0,8,7,1,5,14,124,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.2516807780053619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10312437447789186,0.10729996180244122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1972987366582391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14670365948386618,0.12115641895887284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10295918333375263,0.2853700398987482,0.0,0.16632917423567642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477923231516486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14505576282793053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902179417200481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313620122914316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13234388822258855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12935125995022564,0.0,0.12699359999862844,0.0,0.0,0.1455732387616599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11462013720877465,0.14266836658400853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06300035403018714,0.0,0.11386864215294415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17215543788147422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13679969255426389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12310107375332865,0.1788007727716987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119245982792593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12266467386537172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14435331557399658,0.0,0.0,0.10298273837172453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12153750960218107,0.1340324610790152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567123055251191,0.16525688392779558,0.0,0.0,0.07519404680401548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519384139518445,0.0,0.15511564482845258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606034188735418,0.0,0.206878054798745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143972406323168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387996341524836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2491262202098633

Seeing all the empty shelves sent me into panic mode. Then an hour or so of coronavirus googling and time at r/coronavirus made it even worse. I stumbled upon this subreddit and I am feeling much better.

COVID19_support,Hax3521,2020/03/15,"A message to people with anxiety (or everyone actually :D) Hello everyone that is reading this! ive been a kiddo with tachycardia and anxiety issues.
ive seen a post of annonymus person that explains their problems with anxiety and the coronavirus situation and they explain that they had thoughts of diferent scenarios of armagedon or end of the world and i have a point to say to everyone:
people with anxiety belive in this beacuse of pression or fear yes fear of loosing something (like loved ones) and i think the help they need is someone to hear them and just like comfort them beacuse these toughts cant fully go away and we have those type of problems (like my tachycardia for example or suicidal thoughts)
comfort for my anxiety homies is really important beacuse if they get out of the hole they are trapped in they can be more understanding and help other anxiety homies that are struggling with problems.
Thanks to this subreddit its easier for people to find comfort and relief. The coronavirus its going to end do not worry my anxiety homie i support you :'D 
Thanks if you readed all
And sorry if bad english ;c

COVID19_support,orangepeacelily,2020/03/15,"Small family with underlying health conditions and severe anxiety... I don't know what to do. I'm just seeking some support. The only family I have is my mother, who is in her 60s and has underlying health conditions. I myself also suffer from underlying health conditions, clinical depression, OCD and severe anxiety... I'm scared to death of my mother catching this virus and being one of the unlucky ones to suffer its severe consequences, If I lose her I have absolutely nothing, nothing. I do not know what to do... We can't stay locked up, I need to get supplies and I eventually need to go into college. I am conscious of mine and my mothers well-being, but others are not conscious of theirs and those around them. I've seen group chats of people in my college and other colleges not self-isolating even though they are ill and have symptoms. People are not acting on government advice, they aren't acting responsibly, they're only thinking of themselves.

COVID19_support,tonerowzzzz,2020/03/15,"Hard to be hopeful that I’ll stay healthy. I’m 30 and have some lung issues. No health insurance. Chronic cough and some chest pain but I don’t know what it is. I’m in a household where we’re less than 50 miles away from San Mateo. No one here takes this seriously despite my pleas. They continue to go out, make plans with friends, don’t practice any form of social distancing. They truly don’t understand the gravity of the situation. I can isolate myself and wash my hands all I want, but by the time these people realize how serious this is it’ll be too late. Even after all the panic buying and hysteria, they just say “haha look at these silly people”. It’s very disheartening and quite frankly I’m resentful. It’s only a matter of time before I get sick and I’m not one to take chances but I have nowhere to go. So from here on out I’m going to try and keep my mind off of this as much as possible. It’ll be hard.

COVID19_support,illegalamigos,2020/03/15,"Worried this virus is worse then we're being told Hello,

I live in FL and I'm worried the virus is worst then what's being reported. 
We've had 3 deaths and over 77 confirmed cases so far. I know the US has kinda dropped the ball on the testing however, we're just now ramping up with testing and setting up drive through testing so that's some good news. 

I'm just a little disturbed seeing reports coming from Italy saying this virus doesn't just target older people, and affects younger people too and there ending up in the hospital.

I'm 26 and fairly healthy! But I worry about myself, my wife and my parents (mid 50's) are also pretty healthy. 

I just can't get the thought out of my head about losing my parents or other loved ones! I also worry about leaving behind my 2 year old son. 

I've been cleaning my hands and telling my parents to do the same. I'm even considering staying home for a couple weeks until everything blows over. I've heard we'll be going into quartine soon and national guard is being deployed, seeing everything close I know is for the best but also really scary to see.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",4.363736089030205,5.9826236936936965,5.183121356650768,81.16137519872817,71.07207207207206,6.845151033386327,28.82458929517753,7.285733465282438,1.7662280869104396,908,35,161,9,17,295,141,222,0.095,0.8240000000000001,0.081,-0.2377,4,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,2,0,0,2,17,7,0,1,10,0,17,3,2,1,0,30,33,20,1,0,7,5,1,0,0,1,0,2,2,0,5,14,0,1,3,1,0,3,2,3,0,1,5,6,16,4,23,23,4,31,0,1,3,1,13,15,0,3,10,103,21,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11572107186964015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841072310984087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08053134378913658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427708128663285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201047625523284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13103221600866866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488716307924843,0.0,0.0,0.07821692778057608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128609689700807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06187085541051283,0.0,0.06730222151381947,0.09932715340202618,0.0,0.1305611966087338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215356240981861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11878739786983335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301637903430686,0.0,0.0,0.1253923020284424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11869043051697666,0.10456921490771967,0.0,0.0,0.13248445808003922,0.0,0.0,0.10688090708941654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12426446656827385,0.0,0.08024613376749745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3944824319536887,0.0,0.0,0.16419846658500514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12047823058777082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07586446978045988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417430514419944,0.0,0.0,0.2831021407780518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12622260159637969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350646271546972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09401421712545173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315774961891888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14244765629003844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949913662045966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4810550863639311,0.12068261900435975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762601911808826
COVID19_support,Theseus_The_King,2020/03/15,"Just some things to remember to keep yourself sane It’s been hard to come to terms with this virus. The media and 24 hour news cycle makes it sound like we’re living in a stupid ass 14 year olds Pandemic game, complete with a virus named after a beer. For those of us who are investors, it seems as if one day it’ll zero out and there will be no economy left. For people in affected areas, it feels like the governments re dragging their feet no matter how much action.
Everyday seems to go from bad to worse, that there will be no light at the end of this tunnel, that uncontrolled spread is inevitable, worldwide cases will double by the day and tomorrow we’ll be living in bunkers with corpses strewn on the deserted streets. Any semblance of normalcy will be a distant memory for the last fading remnants of humanity.

With the media painting a picture that we are careening rapidly and inexorably to the demise of civilization and order, I think it’s high time for a reality check. Here are 5 things to remember at a time like right now. 

1. THIS TOO SHALL PASS. Repeat this 10 times every day. This too shall pass, this too shall pass. Remember three months ago when we all were supposed to have perished in nuclear hellfire in a war with Iran? Remember when it looked like Australia would be burnt to a crisp entirely by the end of January? Those situations were dire, but abated when they were given time. Perhaps some times pass harder, but they pass still. At some points, the worst will be behind us. Things will go back to normal, even if it is a slightly different normal. 

2. The recovery is inevitable. Imagine what kinds of great things that can come of the recovery and rebuild. A restored priority on transparency and democracy. Illiberal governments finally facing the music and being shown the door at long last. Unprecedented scientific advances in antivirals and vaccines. Countries that are more prepared than ever to deal with anything. Actual sick pay and labor laws. An economy that has prioritized the climate and is growing in ways it did not before. Hold on to your investments. You cannot profit of the recovery of something you sold. 

3. Humanity has overcome far worse, and by all means this will not be what past plagues were. The Black Death killed one third of Europe. Spanish flu killed 50 million. 1957 Avian flu killed 1 million. Swine flu in 2009 killed only 12500. Advances in medical technology have improved survival over time. Unlike any of the past pandemics, we can identify and map this virus, and develop a response strategy accordingly. We know the incubation period, how it works and who needs more protection. We have more ability to treat the even more dangerous sequelae like bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics. In 1918, penicillin was still a decade away, and viruses were a new concept. There is a reason Dr Tedros is saying this is the first time we have the ability to contain and control a pandemic. We as a whole can stop it right here . 

4. There is now a lot of public awareness and public action. Here is the thing: because of the incubation period, quarantines, lockdowns, and closures do not show effect until 10-14 days. Even at China’s peak, cases rapidly increased before plateauing two weeks after Wuhan’s lockdown. There needs to be patience for the actions today to mean fewer infections and deaths tomorrow. The horror numbers of 50-70% infection comes from zero controls and zero consideration until herd immunity steps in. It is far from an inevitability, even Hubei was able to plateau at 0.12% infected. If Italy is quarantining now they may not even get to that much. At the very least governments are not doing anything. 

5. There are things you can do to control your risk. Wash your hands, avoid touching your face, don’t come into work sick. These are not just for now. These are good habits people should have been doing anyways, pandemic or not. It would be wonderful if subsequent flu seasons are less
Deadly because people picked up good habits.

The most important thing is not to give in to panic. A few weeks where things look a bit different is a flash in the pan when you have many years of life to live. Turn off the news, turn off the TV, focus on yourself and productivity while taking steps to protect yourself. This too will pass, if you’re willing to be patient.",5.340204583910165,7.687928233502539,5.3737240424550095,77.80103291801262,69.96446700507614,8.633625596062144,30.21350561452084,9.259372276320047,2.9300610829103224,3480,144,585,76,66,1089,389,788,0.133,0.797,0.07,-0.9956,4,4,3,0,0,0,96.0,10,8,4,10,36,24,7,4,54,0,79,20,5,10,3,110,106,41,8,12,18,0,4,5,0,18,14,2,1,2,46,42,1,10,16,4,5,21,13,13,0,11,12,10,23,11,99,65,22,122,0,0,3,1,33,42,1,15,62,407,69,9,0.06185916270740133,0.0,0.060365619510925735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05483441537180945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08413270376421646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180964033188268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058118719642719925,0.04756587778375363,0.05164981700172765,0.07541754286088348,0.0,0.10527518264276267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753418429380599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21314476515132688,0.06485815517888892,0.0,0.20814093290315824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15957616986170328,0.06377408052461128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292593179551912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10957771477303796,0.0,0.0,0.20428696780290226,0.05595515417274528,0.052119012544796325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031277851324736164,0.04419219819821265,0.0,0.06776368909397264,0.0,0.05261737219814765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032318859371830884,0.05934094553692033,0.07031197542316035,0.10376906158174452,0.0,0.06819994526693836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055413659408011684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06535760170407505,0.0,0.0,0.0609188146873623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05498326607117837,0.2737519933531691,0.06441679881533398,0.033996178067123684,0.10084694767799336,0.0,0.0,0.06721016127905885,0.0,0.043692956013017134,0.15110631135918026,0.0,0.1638683219490989,0.05474341240172144,0.10389223409196477,0.0,0.0,0.05259044802924051,0.0,0.0,0.04129147145146096,0.06271548180579814,0.0,0.1347655256466296,0.0,0.0623165985137237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04937539350221079,0.0,0.09094720439284998,0.091735570665867,0.0,0.05974396481164933,0.0,0.0,0.12121769101881275,0.0,0.0,0.06491078543021449,0.0,0.08383473915649825,0.04704668071960765,0.0,0.07257839913596298,0.0,0.0,0.11810314062874568,0.1286560638790529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05847690340687613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636015218922089,0.0,0.0,0.2802974904975854,0.10565477391879599,0.0,0.049192889029914984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11262851692229313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953229068043651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04762220561741111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988016144897374,0.051717029893337436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046510391888179896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3287718321630779,0.0396368536993874,0.0,0.0,0.25249402663026305,0.0,0.0586352532445716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13457001143983602,0.06042741347723881,0.0,0.14881791243837905,0.0,0.0,0.05104028764920816,0.0,0.049100924050116686,0.0992393780734056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906354604475677,0.0,0.0,0.06708362322096233,0.09006841438012048,0.0,0.1260795431499214,0.08788594872250917,0.0,0.0,0.07967054530250124
COVID19_support,CautiousMoment,2020/03/15,"I just... want my normal life back I know that my feelings of sadness and anxiety are much less severe. I'm healthy and safe, and so are my family and friends. I don't want to sound self-centered. But I've just been feeling sad lately because I feel like all the social distancing measures really changed my life, and it's been a hard adjustment.

I'm a college student, and I just lost my on-campus job and got sent home to my parents. And I really miss the independence of living on my own and making my own money. I miss getting to go wherever I want and do what I want. I recently started dating someone, and I'm thankful we're not too far away, but it's still really hard to see him regularly because of all the social distancing stuff going on. I miss my friends, I'm not motivated to do school work. It's just... things are hard right now and honestly, getting sick is the least of my worries. I just want this to be all over so everything can go back to the way it was.",4.306459219172787,4.840258934673368,5.7377889447236194,81.19015461925012,70.20603015075379,9.138152299961344,30.885581754928488,9.265573868473778,2.5835918824893707,764,31,157,15,13,259,106,199,0.14800000000000002,0.727,0.126,-0.6584,2,1,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,3,12,12,0,0,7,0,12,3,0,3,3,39,40,16,0,6,9,1,6,1,2,0,3,1,1,0,9,12,0,1,6,0,1,4,3,6,0,0,6,8,23,6,15,33,8,19,0,6,1,0,7,6,0,0,9,102,32,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483701393455997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647426828654445,0.1906511652124423,0.0,0.1511424060043077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13114424151771065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141659863929937,0.0,0.11686825665606974,0.0,0.18804947196115535,0.08856447596838145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19155844149467188,0.0,0.12953883087344506,0.0,0.21136569954238327,0.0,0.09915045092324848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3331593747576523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435241553119356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12302148949459242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06813088776299807,0.0,0.13984400692500654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17512791445431697,0.060565673701120135,0.0,0.10946813127621953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532833212232134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08275120225202846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09113250558067744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12146466707796096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376544543100858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2382558311580596,0.0,0.12240581055843748,0.0,0.0,0.10587004117453516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546465963422326,0.098788355440363,0.0,0.1293281603982868,0.1400512611770295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25274441436717,0.10503971458215948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774688465372336,0.0,0.09900291871504527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419164442361688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413528506966587,0.0,0.0,0.08236042281176144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3656047588349917,0.09840193032619413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025192506944614,0.1258979552243257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,MediocreSulk,2020/03/15,"Social distancing vs grocery store job? I could talk so long about so many different things, but I'll try to pick a main topic. I was already at the end of my rope, can't-take-this-anymore from my once-again-spiraling depression and anxiety since November. And that was just from life, in general. 

Now theres *this*

Putting aside all the future fears of death, economic collapse, and prolonged stir-crazy, putting aside the short-term fears of *oh god, I have to wake up tomorrow and do this all over again*, there's the midrange: my job. At a grocery store.

On one hand, we're not losing customers like so many other places! On the other hand...so. many. customers. My department (deli) wasnt hit as hard, but with all the talk about cancelling large gatherings, it's hard not to think: what about us? How many people did I talk to, walk by, breathe by? What about my coworkers? There were people pulling double shifts, standing at checkstands, stocking shelves, all in the thick of it. 

I'm not in a high risk group myself, but getting really sick still sucks even when you don't die. And spreading it to people, worsening the problem, yeah, thats a fear. 

So, I guess, I don't know what to do. I need money. With the economy heading downward, I need money bad. But my workplace is basically a petri dish with bad radio music. Why is this considered okay? People talk about shelves being stripped bare, but not about who had to fill them up again. 

I just...I don't even know. I don't know what I'm asking about. 

I have so many things to ask.",2.117618755118756,4.698119168918918,2.538587223587225,92.83819000819004,81.97297297297297,5.885176085176084,23.158886158886162,7.229369725052465,0.8918954954954961,1198,42,243,17,33,367,163,296,0.18899999999999997,0.735,0.076,-0.9917,4,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,1,1,1,1,24,12,1,4,14,2,18,7,4,2,4,35,32,18,2,4,11,0,4,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,17,8,1,0,4,1,4,6,9,10,0,1,6,4,21,2,38,23,6,31,0,2,0,0,13,15,1,1,10,146,38,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10846703231944148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519267154764284,0.0,0.0974786825001016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18377842913554654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641384694788672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07847770529457278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465826084043611,0.0,0.1020109815567999,0.1026936194872562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08705702863979503,0.0,0.0,0.12984111919902988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33181554132486496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05135321304640465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10827908677041807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1760996218660374,0.0,0.10087535974137214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10385028771890373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19507814658212752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16205519089880024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942614072324993,0.04802022565590774,0.0,0.0,0.08698481860418243,0.0,0.10996296327213376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4982603905396762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14576369327080305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06660481378785622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27257159386226865,0.0,0.1026936194872562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09405161975109906,0.0,0.1976200620014832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06296800413440723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08130768297091875,0.0,0.0,0.10019573026690598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07849565945143673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07390291953147493,0.3160116987332486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306009112704251,0.06298117668991553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06673342596297778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182324826913644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08869272334968402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Blueskyoverandunder,2020/03/16,"Daily coronavirus mental health tip: If you're feeling overwhelmed by what's going on, take things one step at a time. What's the next best step for you to do? [https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zdVvApsWi/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zdVvApsWi/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

IMHO a decent part of overwhelm in these type of situations can come from feeling like the whole world is coming at you like a freight train, and it's easy to loose track of what specifically needs to be done right now, versus what can be done later.

A tactic I'm doing is to try to maintain laser focus on the best next step at all times. Stocked fridge? Check. Immediate work for this morning? Check. Medication? Not checked... This is going to be my focus for the next few hours. This can help your mind declutter and see the fears and risks more clearly.

Hope this is helpful!",7.854711538461538,11.172370902777784,5.282777777777781,76.9169230769231,65.66666666666667,6.375213675213676,23.57692307692308,7.321109707123232,0.8820615384615382,726,18,117,7,13,202,95,144,0.055,0.738,0.207,0.9736,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,0,3,0,3,1,9,0,4,9,0,14,2,0,0,2,15,25,4,0,3,3,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,11,5,0,0,2,0,3,7,1,4,0,1,2,3,4,5,20,20,7,23,0,2,1,0,5,8,0,2,10,72,15,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159343420559704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2593286900919492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3080795893131411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693829776021801,0.15222037861780574,0.10753541015084077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17109416195438745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16000151237128854,0.0,0.0,0.20178806975186545,0.0,0.0,0.14950573391514346,0.14823724526953988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707826114924782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15163855281246416,0.15169424765356576,0.0,0.15198779253109182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11161271241508898,0.0,0.0,0.4802565649696911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10199993921605158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16300439162139355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12854791016269929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1199492934864663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16919691035759876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317640379731207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10000241914626536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17554519848270286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219689846417176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16805628715465826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10958431891711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,theparisfrance,2020/03/16,"I Don't Know What To Do Every day the pandemic gets worse and the experts say it is only going to continue to get worse. I just don't see a way out of this. I'm not even worried about myself that much - I'm in my early 20s, unlikely to die from this - but I know people that I'm worried about. And also, the fact that life is completely shut down and we're all going to be on lockdown for a long time - maybe forever. I've always had anxiety issues but this whole thing is making it that much worse, especially because experts say it doesn't look like the virus will ever go away and without that I can't see how life ever goes back to normal. The idea of losing the life I've known forever is making me really sad too, not to mention the fact that I'm probably going to lose people I know from this. I can't live in lockdown forever. I can't worry about my family like this forever.

Hopefully the government will come through with better financial assistance, but until then, know that you're not alone, and you don't have to become homeless.

If you're a worker who is able to work from home, and is thus spending a little less money (commute, coffee, lunch, eating out, gym...) please consider donating.

COVID19_support,WaddleDio,2020/03/16,"20 years old with (mild?) case of asthma. Am I in the high risk group? With the virus being a threat to people with respiratory diseases, including asthma. It has left me worried for my well-being despite my young age and seeming lack of other major health issues.  

I have been diagnosed with asthma since I was a kid but it was never anything severe to my knowledge. I had to regularly use inhalers (first by breathing in some substance through some tube with a funnel attached to it, later using smaller disc shaped things containing dry powder) in cases of wheezing and running short on breath but I don't recall ever having to be hospitalized for it. 

Over the years I felt the need to use them less to the point I rarely use them anymore. Not because I don't think they work but because I experience the symptoms of asthma very rarely. My mother descibes by case as not severe at all, tho she might've just been trying hard to calm me down. The wikipedia article mentions episodes of wheezing, frequent coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath happening weekly or daily, which doesn't describe my sitiation at all imo. The few times I do remember using an inhaler in the past few years was at times I just felt a bit short of breath and assumed it was inhaler time. They'd be over with very quickly so I might've still been fine without them? It's not like people without any respiratory issues don't ever experience them, right?

I am a male living in the Netherlands (where apparently half of the patients in intensive care are under 50) and according to the covid-19 map there's only 1 confirmed case near me. I don't do any major exercise as of late, only a few push-ups or squats when I feel like it, and I usually avoid dirty air such as people smoking or bonfires, so does that have something to do with it? How big is the chance of the virus seriously biting me in the ass?",7.79951754385965,7.3003534722222225,7.565584795321637,74.56842105263158,62.88888888888889,9.690058479532164,35.61403508771929,8.841846274778883,3.041583333333333,1510,60,268,19,19,481,198,360,0.08,0.867,0.053,-0.8266,1,1,1,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,6,2,14,9,1,2,22,0,28,17,6,6,5,52,41,20,0,2,13,1,5,2,0,0,11,0,0,2,12,13,0,3,8,1,0,1,11,4,0,2,10,8,32,5,53,27,12,51,0,0,0,1,12,28,1,7,24,187,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13793029483526026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005756556826173,0.0,0.0,0.08345526222123524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236423347537405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11071806246960708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339855645709647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293329880989398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08874826756665456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18346993659513894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1984051345521006,0.0,0.0,0.05127807691911128,0.07245033921624967,0.19474711064344236,0.0,0.0,0.08626288394447063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896802600490575,0.0,0.09084722156877337,0.0,0.0,0.1077985737921342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10714969173025407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117001954167036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11439965774418905,0.0,0.11018684704495203,0.0,0.0,0.09909173077642136,0.0,0.08955061448297301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2151689226760376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519735930681894,0.07821689865178265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641716445330483,0.0,0.0,0.1542601688128755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968113484950284,0.21092355325836365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095869218117224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11488254203224338,0.0866071899829429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232369727167457,0.0,0.2291384049641276,0.0,0.08389089098353382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07807362140557582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098952730059165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10540820566007457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673751016472583,0.06498213741496171,0.0,0.0,0.17740634215300286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06885359855132314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4379466246875897,0.11169343592170876,0.16735470533935332,0.0,0.0,0.08134837027996812,0.0,0.0911835633706938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1955193787087656,0.0,0.07383076018578083,0.102991063435988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19592229855212054

I am thinking of going home to my family. Is this decision to risky? My  mom is in here 50s and my brother is in his 20s. They live a couple hours away from me in a rural area with no cases. For the last 2 weeks I have been good at washing my hands and not touching face, and for the last week been WFH and have only gone to grocery store twice and gym early in morning when there was no around.

Do  you think it is safe for me to go home, or are the risks that I am an asymptotic carrier or might develop a case of coronavirus later too high?

It might sound silly to some, but they’re my entire life and they have behavioural issues so they require an experienced person to look after them. I’m very obese (I’m currently working on losing the weight) and a smoker. I want to quit smoking but honestly it’s the only thing helping to keep me calm in the middle of this situation. I’m just wondering what you guys think? If I get the coronavirus is it likely I’ll end up in the hospital?

March 5 &amp; 6 someone who later tested Covid pos, was allegedly asymptotic, attended a 2 day event in Larrick ballroom

March 7 - I went into Larrick ballroom to take photos for a different event 11 am. There were two main doors. I chose the furthest away from the main entrance and I touched the doorknob to get in. I did not make physical contact when any other surfaces. That doorknob would have been my only potentiaI contact with the infected. I shoved the door open with my side to exit. I used hand sanitizer after leaving the room and again before I touched my phone and again on the way out of Larrick. Then I used hand sanitizer in the car. I washed my hands when I got home. 

9 days later on March 16 - at 9 am, I have no symptoms (no fever, cough, sore throat or sinus)

COVID19_support,Deist_Human09,2020/03/16,"i dont know what to do Hello, 

i'm from Morocco, our country is almost in lockdown, they closed schools, bars, restaurants, cafés etc... they asked everyone to stay at home.

the problem is that we dont have money to stock up on food and drinks and the worst part is that the company that i work for ( can't tell the name coz i can get fired) closed all her sites in France, but is keeping the ones here in Morocco open, they are not respecting the sanitary procedures, they sent a staff bus full with people alot of them where sneezing and caughing and we were sitting next to each other, we dont have masks and the worst part is that they said that some of us will go back home for a month without a single $ :(.

How are we suposed to pay our bills and loans and food etc...  and the goverment is not making statements about this... they only talk about online courses for students, closing all the shops and asking everyone to stay at home!

For those who live in a country with lockdown and experienced something similar to mine, could you please give me any advice?

Thank you :)",6.325753205128201,6.322595197115383,5.863269230769234,83.89839743589745,65.77884615384616,9.048717948717947,31.275641025641022,8.59863814320734,2.1978929487179486,843,29,169,11,12,259,129,208,0.07200000000000001,0.8809999999999999,0.048,-0.6351,0,2,2,0,0,0,32.0,7,2,7,1,6,5,0,0,14,0,19,4,0,3,2,39,31,12,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,3,0,10,21,4,1,2,4,6,2,7,3,0,1,3,3,22,2,27,26,13,23,0,0,0,0,27,15,0,3,3,122,32,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666376863922535,0.0,0.0,0.11954901335858024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118737502367178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2232217907541885,0.0,0.0,0.09180137057718647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532094703679052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4197626505184549,0.11695398329962058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2662965241656113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22815912967256885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28872689914489136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237487299853401,0.11452705984742935,0.0678504845551302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3592652214097992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10611680934580173,0.0,0.0,0.06561207080286445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1054210654782244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07969186839410304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529370648635513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696961825680922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089984160006522,0.09079932868688563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2585693592297851,0.0,0.08276803700093564,0.0,0.0,0.13105127018426527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11423740578763925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11356454569869515,0.0,0.0,0.12082619794730973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191008238010766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545016936287897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09595889139753347,0.1043496558043048,0.10991567336016908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436080754189839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150849792830714,0.0,0.08691528750293713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,dtheme,2020/03/16,"Trapped in a foreign country in lockdown? Just wondering if anyone else is stuck (trapped) in a foreign country that's in lockdown and can't get out?

Between airports closing, cities going into lockdown, flights cancelling and transits there are must be many people stuck or trapped in foreign countries. 

Anyone out there? 

Currently the main issues are the following

Travel insurance cancelled or not covered for COVID-19 after 10 days, yet can't get out. 

Shops closing or curfews or reduced hours enabled making it difficult to get food and clean water.

COVID19_support,purplerayn1,2020/03/16,"my sister feels entitled to travel and visit my immunocompromised mother. how do i stop typhoid jenny from visiting? my sister lives out of state and worships trump as her god. she listens to fox news.she claims she did her research and shes ""GONNA LIVE HER LIFE"" she thinks ""iTs JuSt a FlU brO""      shes currently going to the gym in tenessee and doing all the things the cdc said not to. thinks this is all a liberal hoax to make trump look bad.  

&amp;#x200B;

my mom is stage 4 liver failure, she has a genetic immune deficiency (WHICH SPECIFICALLY PERTAINS TO SUCCEPTIBILITY TO RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES!) confirmed by genetic testing. there were 4 markers for this thing. she has all 4 of them.   some of us kids might have this too.

my sister doesn't believe in any of this, thinks my mom is just an unwarranted hypochondriac.  my sister has a very low IQ and no critical thinking skills. shes as dumb as a tin can.

&amp;#x200B;

i told her to cancel her trip to come visit us because a.) my mom doesn't want to see her. she was never invited. and my mom definitely doesn't want her to visit during a disease outbreak  my mom and her aren't even on speaking terms. my mom cut her off a while back

b.) shes not even practicing social distancing. she doesn't believe in covid and blah blah blah. 

c.) my mom outright said she does not want her to come visit.  she won't tell this to her herself because shes playing some ignoring game.

my sister feels entitled and thinks i am just being mean.  i tried to explain to her why mom is immune compromised and why she was always at the doctor growing up. (shes had the liver failure for like 30 years we just didn't know)

the rest of us are making huge sacrifices to try to keep mom healthy. i don't get to go on spring break. i had to cancel my summer vacation plans. i don't even get to see my boyfriend who is also socially distancing himself and works from home.   

my kids school has been cancelled. I'm working from home.

my house is crowded AF. there are three people here who are at risk (including myself.) and my two senior parents over 75.  we don't have any spare rooms. her plan i guess is to fly with sick people and sleep next to my immunocompromised mother for two weeks?",2.50392866307416,4.9967721154734415,3.6143987682832974,86.28738208878626,79.57736720554274,6.435493969720298,24.171875801898896,7.635375032292933,1.304528396202206,1758,63,340,28,45,567,217,433,0.11800000000000001,0.8220000000000001,0.061,-0.9643,2,0,0,0,0,0,64.0,5,0,1,5,14,9,2,1,15,0,45,10,3,3,4,53,77,19,0,3,7,18,2,4,0,3,7,4,3,2,11,19,0,3,10,4,0,12,15,6,0,3,11,9,65,3,49,62,7,41,2,1,3,0,75,14,1,4,13,221,76,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050753041805798135,0.05280807253078012,0.2062933266328401,0.23135123991346596,0.08631692989027998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04880076776489088,0.05299073289595279,0.07737550878982727,0.0,0.0,0.14300693766403538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10933918040722923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495925015366613,0.0555387632469297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575436011251234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06417975363022012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06631582235488911,0.0,0.0721373922566049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991399619462954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12732140072847442,0.0,0.0,0.07323023942405513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05641072389525521,0.0,0.0,0.034878775879843706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04482729844798791,0.031005856937921624,0.0,0.11208174565552016,0.0,0.05329472538641286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08472693463723363,0.0,0.0,0.06913213238378321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06732647398230136,0.0,0.6689663425382228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04894822102152957,0.0,0.06749588611574843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07047051665384599,0.0,0.0,0.08799746074907343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207397446491852,0.0,0.0,0.06423010014849073,0.10114698405013524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635109641009036,0.12938941606427345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05305969074698138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055471321258439586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08432682511384276,0.20332946457002354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06064365178093348,0.0,0.08617731508435413,0.0,0.12399242100155175,0.0,0.2290222126408983,0.0,0.0,0.05236537913892935,0.11230013460299153,0.0,0.050907899403326136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11453481752960665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240674151119084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23135123991346596,0.040869463154714895
COVID19_support,allyallymac,2020/03/16,"I feel like I’ve lost everything Firstly, I don’t want to come across as not realizing the seriousness of the situation. I guess  I knew this sort of shut down to everyday life was inevitable, though I still not coping very well. I am a college senior in the last semester of my undergraduate who has been looking forward to this spring/summer as the best time of my life. I go to school full time, live in residence, and work two jobs on my university campus, as well as participates in lots of societies and clubs. I was looking forward to graduating this spring and walking across the stage in front of my family (I’ve even had a countdown on my phone for 4 years, lol!) and was planning on going on my first ever trip to Scotland by myself in April. I had my dream summer job lined up at a music festival and was planning on getting my very first apartment. Now, my life has completely fallen down around me. My university has been shut down so I’ve lost my home, my job, my graduation, all the galas and dinners I was looking forward to attending, all of my extracurriculars, and had to cancel my trip. The festival I was supposed to be working at also got cancelled, leaving me with no job lined up for the summer and nowhere to live. On top of this, all of my friends that I have made during my time at school had to abruptly go home without goodbyes, most of whom I may never see again. In one day, absolutely everything that had been keeping me afloat has been taken away. I’ve suffered from clinical depression for years now but had managed to keep it under control for the past few months, but now I feel like I am back to square one? Anybody else here in the same boat? I feel so selfish complaining knowing people around the world are dying from this virus but I just can’t help but feel devastated. The final nail in the coffin was the announcement that my convocation ceremony would not be postponed but outright cancelled. I have been dreaming about being able to celebrate my graduation with my friends and family and walk across that stage for years and now I have not been able to stop crying.

COVID19_support,Legitimate-Buffalo,2020/03/16,"I need to go to the dentist but I'm scared of the virus. NOTE: This is a account I post things I'm too afraid to post on my regular account. I also don't know if this is the correct place to post so If I post in the wrong place I'm sorry.

I need to go to the dentist and get a tooth pulled but i'm so scared that I may catch the virus or that having a tooth pulled will make me more weak against the virus. I'm 24 years old and i'm healthy-ish other than being a couch potato and eating un-healthy I don't have any major health problems that I know of or affect me on a daily basis. But I have horrible dental problems and I'm just scared that If I go to the dentist that I will get the virus, or that if I do go to the dentist and have my tooth pulled it would make my immune system weaker to the virus. I'm also scared because my mom keeps on going out to the mall etc. so I just don't feel safe from the virus and I'm just kinda panicking at this moment and scared that my tooth is going to cause a infection or something worse. I have anxiety so I just don't know what to do.

Can someone please tell me if there is a correlation between my fears? Should I go to the dentist and get what I need to get done or should I just take the pain and wait until this virus deal blows over?",1.7146228239845271,2.7832050141843965,3.2176015473887816,94.82454545454547,76.87234042553192,5.9783365570599605,20.974210186976144,6.1124844417494595,-0.056835460992907816,1002,23,241,6,22,330,114,282,0.225,0.7559999999999999,0.02,-0.9962,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,0,13,13,0,7,22,0,24,15,4,4,1,50,56,29,0,13,18,1,1,0,0,6,10,0,1,0,16,10,1,3,4,1,2,11,4,12,0,0,1,1,27,1,28,48,3,29,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,12,4,154,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15791661986571318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06714315694424809,0.0,0.07553197232610627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060187913737435275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014279992665339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10179140586375207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104014168536296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10103051084946214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101155771482089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110427726919153,0.04992336122374415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063397608752349,0.0,0.3927934623246607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10495064289010833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08776016692559131,0.0,0.0,0.1627864516891708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318127017952115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11563718904418928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2196321600165265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360572900948403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10506095623460207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20631403208660912,0.10838133391010124,0.0,0.0,0.3782431861285844,0.0,0.0,0.188952039980768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49425458512679205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08365780918024622,0.07601099412571259,0.0,0.11052570150009096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423640040948659,0.0,0.08629870487503584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06559511859870369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061935697322484,0.07013848104545732,0.10795117647882382,0.0,0.06358207555139647
COVID19_support,eam1188,2020/03/16,"As an asthmatic, I'm concerned. I'm 25, male, and asthmatic....... And obese. My doctor explained one of the more severe symptoms that develop is viral Pneumonia. Unlike bacterial Pneumonia, viral Pneumonia can't be treated with medicine.

Considering the talks of hospitals being over capacity at one point, I don't very much like the idea of being On a ventilator and it scares me.

I wonder how many people have I already met for the last time, that maybe today are still alive, but won't when this will be over. They will die and maybe I'll be in my room apart from everything. I won't be able to see them ever again. Maybe then one who dies is me. I'm about to start immunosuppressors, probably this week. This seems surreal. This is a psychological torture. I can't. I can't go ahead with this thought that I may have given my bf our last kiss already. Our last hug. Told him my last ""I love you"" in person.

COVID19_support,kazki,2020/03/17,"Finding enjoyment in quarantine ""preparation"" So I fully expect the US to go on a lockdown or for something to happen where we all need to stay in our houses. So I'm using this extra time I have to ""prepare"" for it. By that, I mean that I am cleaning and tidying up my living area so that if and when I am locked down to my house, its a little bit more enjoyable to stay in 24/7. I don't want this to sound facetious or like Im being insensitive, but Im actually finding a-lot of enjoyment in this, Ive always loved cleaning, so having a good reason to do some extra intensive cleaning is fun for me. Its also a great way to get my mind off things.

My life for the past months have revolved around the virus almost 24/7, I’m cleaning my hands every few minutes and I’m terrified of leaving my house. I didn’t buy any masks because from the information that has been given to us from my government they aren’t as protective for healthy people and that handwashing was way more important but now it seems like that was just plain wrong and that the virus is probably spread by just breathing, so yeah thats great. I went and visited my mom and my sister in the countryside and was there for a week, I just found out today that my sisters boyfriend was most likely in contact with an infected individual and I was in contact with him so I don’t know I might have it and my mom might have it and everyone I love might have it. I’m fucking freaking out and I’m so angry at the lack of measures my country has taken (Iceland) I really don’t want to die and I don’t want anyone in my family in my family to die.

The people that aren't worrying as much?,6.8881147540983605,8.09183449180328,6.993565573770492,72.08411885245904,64.73770491803279,9.378688524590164,30.004098360655732,9.516144504307137,2.8693901639344257,268,9,43,5,4,86,49,61,0.18600000000000005,0.777,0.037000000000000005,-0.8861,1,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,2,0,3,3,0,1,3,0,3,1,0,2,0,6,6,5,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,1,7,0,8,6,2,4,0,1,1,0,3,2,0,0,2,32,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16428717479021726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17153056226365046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21321023741795794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21836896746517168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826010447232688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1674578405302048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13713019185577474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070312695147959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15101917113560034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15624341120517055,0.0,0.0,0.2281124771076221,0.0,0.0,0.4272705743577736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632152520512044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20567737451989787,0.0,0.16370597364126366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23091878361342325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478844754722802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22936206888365904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4172606629105095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,LilyChickadee,2020/03/17,"How worried should I be? Just got over the flu and never really felt “better” after that. Work says we were “indirectly” exposed, but exposed enough that we are not allowed into work.

I don’t have a fever but haven been feeling more lethargic every day. Headaches maybe every other day. Post nasal drip and sore throat. The biggest thing that worries me is that my chest feels tight. 

I’m young (28) and no underlying conditions... I should NOT go to the Doctor right? I know I shouldn’t, I just need some support. 

Of course, I have and will continue to isolate for the foreseeable future.

COVID19_support,argh7259,2020/03/17,"COVID-19 is affecting my sex life... My partner and I have been in isolation for about 3 weeks now, working from home together. At the start of all of this we thought that would be a recipe for a lot of great sex.

But that's not the case. We are trying to keep up with this crisis on the news and monitoring the situation in 3 different countries where we and our family live. It's the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and it's taking up a lot of my mental energy.

I love my partner to pieces, he is my favorite person in the entire world. Our sex life normally is great. Just I feel like I'm slowly watching a tidal wave roll in, and trying to do everything I can to make sure I'm prepared for that, and that feeling isn't very compatible with feeling sexy.

Anyone else finding the same?

COVID19_support,justineM,2020/03/17,"I don't know if I can handle this I just want to get this out. I have alienated my parents and my sister by being 'the panicky one'. I can't hide my disappointment/anger/fear whenever I call one of them and learn that they are outside. (We all live separately, my sis has 2 kids.) I don't understand how I'm the only one of us 4 who is really set on not leaving the house for a while. I miss them so much, I love them so much, but whenever I call them, we end up arguing. They are in the at-risk group. All I wish is that they turn out to be right and tell me 'we told you so' for the rest of our long lives... But I just can't stop worrying not even for a single moment of a single hour.

Also... I think my negativity just killed my only houseplant. Can't help not to feel like a really bad person.

COVID19_support,VASA-Drekkus,2020/03/17,"Scared for my parents. I live in Sweden and the government here isn't taking any appropriate actions. They have forbidden gatherings over 500 people and advised you to stay home if you're sick. My school is located in the center of Gothenburg and therefore I kind of have a high chance of getting the virus. They are refusing to close schools. My dad is in the risk group because of his high blood pressure and I'm scared that I could infect him.

Our government laughs at our neighboring countries like Denmark and Norway where they have closed schools. They have come up with a bullshit argument and refuse to close them. What should I do?

COVID19_support,EWABear,2020/03/17,"In WA - Food Concerns I'm not particularly worried about the virus itself. Cautious, yes. My roommate is at risk, my parents are at risk, lots of people in my life are at risk. But I work from home and, in a good week, would maybe leave the house once anyway. I'm not losing out on a whole lot.

But the people are insane. In a normal situation, I'd look at the food in the house and say ""Oh, we can make it another two weeks."" But now I look and I just don't know if that was long enough. I'm not here for panic buying, but apparently the rest of the community is, because the stores around here are drained, and it's not getting better. The shelves are consistently empty.

How long is it supposed to stay like this? Are people going to stop buying eventually? Or is this it, now? Is it going to be empty shelves and panic stocking until they get a vaccine developed, best case scenario, some time next year?

I'm trying to do my part as a community member, not go out buying up more than I need. But if I wait until I would normally do the shopping, is there going to be anything left for me to pick up?",3.145101556317595,4.434752695067266,4.712429438142973,84.64076760749145,73.61883408071749,7.040780796623582,24.776839883935644,7.510576382923642,1.1027100501187026,853,26,177,10,17,287,127,223,0.10099999999999999,0.8059999999999999,0.09300000000000001,0.6123,2,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,1,0,1,4,10,10,0,5,15,1,21,3,0,3,0,37,37,17,0,7,14,1,0,1,0,2,1,1,1,0,9,9,2,2,1,1,5,4,6,6,0,1,1,3,13,4,31,32,9,33,0,1,2,0,4,16,0,6,13,125,22,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347313552118495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689978168179428,0.10482415703588936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07178046611670838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357335573010447,0.10414198771900464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166919114049032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2847721329809573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304101682812076,0.0,0.267684476476293,0.09876470813389984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11811475793647587,0.0,0.0,0.27173976892222595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06471336549232598,0.0,0.0,0.12468226147538325,0.1279377853316998,0.0,0.08317165024632217,0.05752763111121791,0.0,0.0,0.20841345448038254,0.1977638810848963,0.13173425781762155,0.0,0.20021691132466526,0.0,0.0,0.07860030849580782,0.0,0.11829761181654184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731154280675323,0.0,0.0,0.12523048292990754,0.0,0.2307437244136063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254019319093818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763129702909496,0.13074955142817407,0.127513834300617,0.0,0.2449030261040049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093641038152312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13235807070540045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12550785942803086,0.0,0.09844586209241067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06866208060082242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07994581156479133,0.0,0.11502649757827065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889069451223396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13146579267133976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572478658610799,0.11958277161321645,0.0,0.16729514447447855,0.0,0.0,0.07582836380833634

I've been out in public quite a few times. No large spaces recently, just been at a buddy's house. I really shouldn't be going anywhere at all honestly. I guess I want to feel like everything is still normal. I try and practice social distancing and disinfecting my hands everytime I touch a frequently used surface. But fuck me, I feel like I broke rules so many times and I hate myself. 

My family is immunocompromised, I want to break down. I feel selfish. Hell, I even have a duodenal ulcer. I feel like a guinea pig. What's going to happen? What will happen to my family? The shock from this will kill me alone.

Typing this all on my phone, at my buddy's still. I don't know if he's noticed me shaking.

COVID19_support,xxck47,2020/03/17,"kicking myself in the ass For some reason I can't post anything. 

Don't mean to hijack your post and I'm just really spooked.


I'm sorry if my grammar is out right horrible. 

(22 M QUEBEC) I was part of the whole ""Its just a flu bro"" having a trip planned for 2 weeks for a friend's birthday, I take full responsibility on this... went out to Montreal this weekend, and spent a night in a hotel with friends which one of them had a cold. 

I left on Sunday because of the news of the hotel having only 26 people instead of the 400 they were supposed to have  absolutely scaring the shit out of me, and came home to where I live at the moment with my parents who are over 40, and my mom who Chainsmokes along with my sister. (24)

 I have no clue on what I was thinking and and I'm literally just having panic attacks all day because of this. I'm over sleeping because I don't want any contact with anyone. 
I used to be a heavy smoker mixing cannabis with tabacco but recently stop from respiratory problems that I I knew that obviously would pop up in the future. 

 I'm annoying the hell out of everyone on social media, commenting on the hoaxs and misinformation, notifying my friends the right sources.  Almost getting into arguments with my parents about this.


Seeing people like president of the United States saying that ""this is a bad one, a very bad one"" in no way trying to get on people's political views go from ""it's just a flu"" to ""this is a bad one."" 

I really don't want to increase the anxiety of anybody because of this post I just don't know what to say and I don't know who to talk to you because they all keep saying ""it's just the flu"" exactly how I was like 3 days ago.

COVID19_support,Lee_en,2020/03/17,"Risk from childhood viral induced asthma Hi, 

I’m a 21 y/o white male in Maryland, who has dealt with viral induced asthma since I was young. I have used nebulizers &amp; inhalers in the past, and just generally have a tough time when I would get sick years ago. Although nothing extremely serious or life threatening (never been to hospital for it). Since I’ve been at college (3.5 years) I havent really gotten too terribly sick and therefore cant really tell if my asthma has totally gone away, the only case of bad cough was a couple days in Fall 2018 when I came down with a small bug. Otherwise, I have generalized anxiety but thats it. Im normal weight etc no other underlying conditions. I live in an area where the population is not very dense and (thankfully) have a medical center close by if need be. 

Can anyone give me some insight on if I should legitimately be worried?",4.6845741758241735,6.4440823750000025,6.096428571428572,74.37164835164836,70.48809523809524,9.693040293040294,29.58974358974359,10.035473477838034,3.202762271062273,701,28,125,19,13,237,125,168,0.132,0.861,0.008,-0.9404,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,1,9,0,18,9,0,4,2,28,27,11,0,7,7,0,1,0,0,2,8,0,0,1,5,7,1,0,3,0,0,3,5,5,0,0,7,3,10,1,16,16,3,28,0,0,1,0,5,14,0,5,11,78,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16074880342693826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19648405699104535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387261871313565,0.0,0.0,0.12679859169903768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17037684410283574,0.0,0.15141305371729133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20740701790628396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20065155118175576,0.0,0.1169506330412627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20224434356866253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947437469136615,0.17395983753274544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19588055396568665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280872669044485,0.0,0.0,0.16012837007735747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826830572879225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13446284706635733,0.13986218370391246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17767672595145495,0.17400260690793787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13791881575843595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17311152501859714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2323447470357008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30001606834500816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15850096208264985,0.1669554139040138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574201928284084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15662132436944448,0.0,0.1496261993593715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2208257873207116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18416167455416185,0.0,0.1288202035108012,0.0,0.0,0.23355669498635415
COVID19_support,JimmyChurry,2020/03/17,"Different Stages of Coronavirus? Hi all, is there a trusted website (no misinformation) that lists out the different stages of this virus when infected? Typical symptoms...when they start, what they are and how long they last. Like first few days, headache, sore throat, etc. Then the next few days coughing, fever, etc. And so on for the life of the virus.

I know it’s not the same for everyone but something that maps out the life of this thing in an infected person. Somehow it makes me feel better if I know what to look for and what to expect.

I’ve tried searching on Google but most of the GOV sites just give you a generalized outline of the symptoms that I already know. 

Where I live they don’t want to give you a test unless you have some of the symptoms AND have one of the the criteria listed below: 

“You have been exposed to COVID-19 within the last 14 days before your symptoms began, through:
Travel outside of Canada
Close interactions with someone who has COVID-19
Close interactions with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19 and recently travelled outside of Canada or to an impacted area within Canada”

Ok, you know if you have travelled outside your country but how do you know if you’ve been exposed to someone who is infected?? Someone can be infected and not show much of any symptoms. Just like our PM’s wife who said she had a headache and sniffles but got tested anyway and turned out she had the virus. 

My wife has had all of the symptoms for a few days now, except she has only a “low grade” fever, thankfully. People are telling her to get tested but the self assessment web sites say otherwise. We have a family doctor but can’t get through, likely swamped, and the GOV Telehealth number is always busy. It’s crazy.

Am I being overly paranoid about this? 

Thanks for any info.",5.9759549689441025,7.268240327380955,5.489534161490685,81.72503105590064,66.85714285714286,8.224430641821947,31.870600414078673,8.456263369488248,2.4376036749482406,1434,58,259,20,23,438,171,336,0.08199999999999999,0.8490000000000001,0.069,-0.6917,2,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,2,9,4,2,12,9,0,0,25,1,26,18,1,3,2,52,46,25,0,5,16,2,1,3,0,0,17,2,0,2,17,17,0,0,7,4,0,3,5,1,0,2,8,4,26,8,42,36,11,38,0,1,1,0,35,18,0,7,18,183,43,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037276459681324,0.0,0.07821274672478744,0.0,0.0,0.12784189711970104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07998423007057835,0.0,0.0,0.08313240263065466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24248026483718704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19641299623629388,0.0,0.0962095591869871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.209662234034466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898178318181136,0.0,0.0,0.08861168067570986,0.0,0.04752753296017249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995350657119413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09821874514858983,0.18034031274157997,0.0,0.0,0.07517771161693143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582905163193372,0.15323963848846803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327852342205962,0.13776605277103265,0.0,0.08300076830410441,0.08318408161296795,0.07893351638587122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274349698795642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909835668600202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09996650876926337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369456595819313,0.07148869164166362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651654451692031,0.08207425336833474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09281035679325643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08941234375064519,0.07474991266188305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805901088535476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3185722423913169,0.07236321714105819,0.0,0.0,0.0665313160793201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5861910902022954,0.0,0.0,0.08215721938245038,0.17307898181775566,0.0,0.0,0.06244720076547165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06381755851992296,0.1022413686246324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055441662381850235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,iamfaedreamer,2020/03/17,"Just want to share my relief. A bit of good news i got today. My wife's office finally implemented strictly WFH for the foreseeable future. 

They've been saying they're planning for it for weeks, last week they did a dry run test of their systems ability to handle nearly 1400 ppl logging in at once. it didn't go very well and I started to worry it would delay their plan. we live just outside DC and she commutes on the metro trains and bus 3 hours a day into the city, so she's at great risk of catching this.

then this morning my wife checked her email and it's finally a go. She stayed home today and will for however long this lasts, doing her work here instead.

I've been fighting off panic attacks for the last week (i suffer from ptsd, severe anxiety and am bipolar) and when she told me what the email said today i just burst into tears. I hate it took them this long, but I'm so relieved she's finally as safe as she can be considering the circumstances.

Day 1 of our personal full lockdown.

COVID19_support,rheydeeohhed,2020/03/18,"How do we stop our society from becoming completely rooted in fear while still applying the necessary caution to our daily routines? It almost seems like right now most people are freaking/freaked out over hypothetical situations (i know the situation in front of us seems bleak, but a lot of us are also making up long term situations in our heads.) I hope we can all start trying to look at this on a day to day basis and stop trying to think we know how this will play out. Science isn't always perfect at predicting outcomes, and things seem rough, but together we will pull through this.

To me it almost seems like one of the worst repercussions of all this isn't even the virus itself; it's the fear mentality it's caused in so many people. How can we battle the fear while staying cautious and optimistic about the future?

I called the doctors where you should call when you have symptoms and the doc said that I dont qualify for the test because I don’t have shortness of breath and high temperature. He advised me to stay at home and observe. So that’s what I’m gonna do. 

I’m scared I will die. I’m scared I’m not gonna see my girlfriend any more. I’m scared for my grandma that I live with.

COVID19_support,margotcedar,2020/03/18,"Extreme Health Anxiety I feel like I’ve been watching this like a slow bullet coming toward us. I’m a 24 year old woman living in Seattle, but have autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto’s. I’ve been treating it by eating a paleo diet, which feels impossible when trying to limit going to the grocery store and having a small apartment freezer. My hair is literally falling out now and I feel like I’m not who they’re talking about when they say young people are fine. I’m so scared about ending up in the icu. My partner is a commercial electrician and his work definitely won’t stop working. He’s 30 but smoked half his life and only really stopped 3 weeks ago using the patch. I’m extremely afraid he also is going to get hit hard with this and end up in critical condition.

COVID19_support,Quietlyflowing,2020/03/18,"I'm kinda afraid to die... I'm into the autist spectrum. I'm 29 but I'm obese. BMI 43. I don't have neither hypertension or diabetes, just insulin resistance, fairly controlled with metformin. I don't smoke and I don't drink. I'm doing some kind of caloric restriction now, and I can see the pounds shedding down, but I'm still far from my self imposed goal of reducing my weight by 10%. I consider myself to have a pretty strong inmune system. I rarely get sick, but now I think its because I kinda practiced social isolation since I'm kinda introverted.

Even tho my own physician has said that I'm not in more danger than a true diabetic or hypertense guy, I'm still scared of contracting the goddamn virus and develop a complication. I'm afraid to die. And I also afraid to need mechanical ventilation. I had a bad experience with my first endoscopy. I literally woke up in the middle of the procedure and I had to endure it.  I can imagine the pain that means to have a tube inside you insuflating air.

Today I had to break my self imposed quarantine to buy food for my dog and my family. We are fairly stocked right now. The outbreak is still concentrated in the west part of my city (Santiago of Chile) but I was pretty nervous anyways. I barely could avoid the people walking towards me. Ended applying disinfectant to all the things I bought, and took a long shower with loads of soap. I even ended washing my mouth with soap and water because I stupidly kissed a newly bought metformin box. Some times I really do stupid crap.

This shit is taking my mental health to a new level. I never had that level of anxiety before. I consider myself a pretty much rational person... except when the shit takes to extremes like this. Every day I'm watching conflicting info. This is like a cold with a particular high (but not measles high) virulence. and relatively low mortality that looks high because we don't have complete epidemiological data yet. But they are selling it to me like it is the Black Death and we are all gonna to die.

What can do? I kinda want to continue to loss weight and do useful things while our familiar self-imposed quarantine lasts. But I think the anxiety will eat away any motivation.",4.2074158048263035,6.397370780429598,5.508593874303899,76.29885474675153,72.69928400954655,8.474171307345532,28.345332802970038,9.150863307647796,2.6735759215062322,1763,70,309,40,36,588,227,419,0.179,0.713,0.10800000000000001,-0.987,1,4,2,0,0,0,50.0,4,1,1,6,14,23,6,6,24,0,30,20,4,3,4,57,58,24,5,3,13,0,2,3,0,2,9,1,1,4,14,20,7,4,6,1,4,2,8,16,0,1,10,8,44,7,41,45,9,43,0,2,4,1,12,19,3,8,23,201,58,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07637103975108951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06494304035082958,0.0,0.1461139496501521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972506970591504,0.0,0.07973822305905305,0.17464711022129084,0.0,0.08126317268336472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012957150806427,0.0,0.10711098379429737,0.07624870379027078,0.0,0.0,0.06158937710716485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2973406939034361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093553304986187,0.0,0.09771998877278916,0.0,0.0,0.16916869739502716,0.0,0.0,0.12615324314648038,0.0,0.08046257836258244,0.0,0.0,0.09341698772135833,0.09002857565996841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123195791723277,0.1154785621290836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04989462823302972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09455967307091766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015116677000648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30270188700436024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09944819499583964,0.0,0.07784496514773237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13996892295342706,0.0,0.0,0.08451418964284392,0.08019565815549108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10402712118343073,0.0,0.0,0.09624119067129096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020323489463465,0.0708117842504626,0.07365522144828937,0.09223416207697624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10161836634678824,0.0,0.0,0.1034168201955782,0.0,0.06620743637965228,0.08338661531709345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2914724462171565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061179524522119236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08155618372964396,0.0908420412851579,0.0,0.09561181489313793,0.0,0.0761008608031175,0.0,0.29888090418717606,0.0,0.19605804736794602,0.07899830163805223,0.0,0.0,0.09734987190941123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22879844398617305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14360771124589305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12689145485102185,0.12238464587532172,0.0,0.0,0.05568661692824017,0.0,0.09052250663701912,0.0,0.10610363080233293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08248103972391423,0.0,0.0,0.056328170940866125,0.0,0.0,0.2325857045251449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,westghost9,2020/03/18,"Don't feel guilty Maybe you're like me: I have had this creeping sensation that I'm probably already infected, but asymptomatic, and that I may have spread the virus unknowingly before I fully understood the situation. It's very possible. That's how this thing traveled so quickly.

You have to remember that the network of humans touching each other is simply the landscape for a virus. It's like it's spreading in a petri dish - we are all links in a chain that can only separate from each other with EXTREME effort. And to coordinate this among so many people is incredibly ambitious, and complicated. Because we exist in a network. This has very little to do with you, individually.

To clarify: you MUST do your part to break the chain of transmission, and I would guess that 99% of the people reading this are already quarantining to the highest degree they are able, given the very hard decisions people have to make regarding pay and social connections. We are all doing the best we can.

My point is just that if you are regretting a handshake from 3 weeks ago, you can forgive yourself. And if you do find out you were infected, that doesn't inherently mean you did anything wrong. Just move forward, starting today, with the best distancing and hygiene you can manage.",7.189740259740257,8.393645896103896,7.324225108225111,69.98062337662338,64.06493506493507,10.48900432900433,35.313419913419914,10.504223727775694,4.0269362770562775,1026,46,166,25,15,331,134,231,0.073,0.8220000000000001,0.105,0.8679,1,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,4,10,1,4,6,7,0,0,15,0,29,3,0,2,3,40,37,13,0,5,5,0,3,2,0,3,2,0,0,1,19,17,1,0,8,2,1,3,2,2,0,0,5,3,21,5,21,29,7,16,0,1,0,0,18,8,0,5,8,128,40,4,0.14586214189501676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12929798797189634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3219250013461591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003211451965624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08891620785574822,0.0,0.12411793949827568,0.0,0.30614663787959656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375228160910816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13331535517654072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1606835939406441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306638288934752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425217494970601,0.14619218553840715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973641123530178,0.14788131791310444,0.14653812673793487,0.15888663347582996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15502837307193856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11093473171100482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15795448551034047,0.0,0.3033673303006966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13788687090157478,0.1644376487970883,0.0,0.0,0.15726405926522988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14590161426213644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652333726418355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16395515887417428,0.0,0.14868808480930326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10324197478161708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969043257602922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13826025530388622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3610546289479849,0.0,0.0,0.11700181195941375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10361628061292044,0.15947735433955704,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,rekharai,2020/03/18,"Sick right now and nervous 
Last week Saturday (Mar 7) I had a bit of a tingly throat and fatigue/light headed. I bounced back remarkably quickly and on Sunday was virtually asymptomatic again other than feeling a little tired. My colleagues had gone to a conference in the US and were also sick - one of them went to get tested and was negative. I told myself this was likely just a case of stress or paranoia and I was totally fine. I had had my flu shots months ago so not the flu. After that my partner got a little ill but I was still fine - he also had a bit of a tingly throat, light headed and fatigue. Within 2 days he was feeling better so we thought ok we just had a mild spell of whatever else was going around (considering there were about 3000 negative tests said the news). I stayed home Monday because I wanted to make sure I was completely asymptomatic before going back to work but didn’t think too much of it because it was literally a one day thing for me.  Tue-thur I went to work and Friday 13 we did a Work from home day and bosses called us to work from home as of then. Weekend and Monday (yesterday) daytime went fine, I went to a few grocery stores but practiced social distancing and used self checkout and sanitized my hand with hand sanitizer after. I also tried cleaning my phone with a wipe and the stores weren’t super busy. However Monday (yesterday) late evening out of nowhere 💥 bam, I was warm, throat was weird again and a big headache. Then, I barely slept and moved to the couch in the middle of the night because I was coughing so much and wanted to be a little upright. This morning I puked up clear fluid first thing in the morning. Now I’m coughing, warm (I don’t know my temperature because I don’t have a thermometer but I’m lightly sweaty and warm not sweating buckets). I am fatigued have slept three times today - at 12, 3 and 5pm. I have a runny nose, it’s difficult to breathe only because my throat feels blocked up - I’ve soaked through five paper towels coughing up clear liquid (thankfully not green or yellow right now) and am having vitamin c and a lot of fluids at home to stay hydrated. I can take a deep breath and my chest doesn’t hurt. I heard Coronavirus was a dry cough which my cough sounds dry like it’s a weak dry cough, not a loud chesty one, but I have so much fluid from my nose and Feels like fluid in my throat.

I honestly don’t know what to do like I don’t want to be a burden on the health system as I’m fairly young but I also want to know so I can contact people who I worked with and or stress the importance if I do indeed have it. I’m otherwise relatively healthy - non smoker or vape, low bp, suspected Early onset RA - still doing follow ups for that but nothing diagnosed), I take vitamins daily like zinc and vitamin c and d as well as fish oil capsules, No kidney, liver, thyroid issues. 

We do have assessment centres now but I don’t even know how I’d get there I have no car and wouldn’t want to call a taxi or uber and get anyone sick. I could take the train and try and stay far away from people. I also have to be online for work though. I’m so confused with what to do - what would you do?! I’m in Canada right now.",4.844982687112363,5.349129279251173,5.52884593432518,83.26961759445989,69.0,8.437745900079907,28.11464556143221,8.407314429234152,1.8278904227388604,2512,80,507,35,41,816,302,641,0.125,0.758,0.11699999999999999,-0.3425,3,0,1,0,0,0,65.0,6,1,1,9,35,30,0,4,35,1,55,41,19,4,4,90,99,62,0,9,20,0,9,5,1,2,22,4,6,2,17,39,0,1,11,1,2,10,17,12,1,6,36,20,55,18,64,57,8,80,0,4,2,0,21,28,0,8,43,324,72,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06046307086920701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27273314768582463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04769324606200948,0.0,0.0,0.06072037862044551,0.0,0.0,0.06408450314931095,0.10489686157477243,0.0,0.2078975497349495,0.0,0.05804074672573671,0.0,0.0,0.06032522562922892,0.1489328970998651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392978181810538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07151572979190099,0.0,0.0,0.054459253296699935,0.0,0.0,0.13196728553540513,0.0,0.0,0.06923059371641302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056979780284984835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09010266511036716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795386918678024,0.0487284489750985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05801845214535864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690899892126253,0.0,0.07752937501272389,0.0,0.05455288518159816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000401125212386,0.07250286692157068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2736763366524214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301903396375048,0.0,0.0,0.07119236626063663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499433018345939,0.05559935401018679,0.07694260572773352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16661710625607587,0.20508969892062576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0579887642582591,0.0,0.0,0.04552996777179167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05444369008544134,0.0724952619512058,0.1504241604640551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06400942835635508,0.0,0.06544827537508348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386603396940777,0.0518759390653229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457492045614814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17475007364826597,0.06488227983449263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07115675439959862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953037978584492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21810482315738933,0.1089434250074313,0.0,0.15626611996922782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642860773188112,0.0,0.15385380340912794,0.0,0.0,0.06279758733920703,0.0,0.0,0.09062991942690994,0.043705506441681384,0.0670148940649166,0.054150244465185585,0.039773155814857165,0.0783960920887095,0.06465405800939872,0.06517652321476243,0.0,0.09261872615242507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16409380724418282,0.05891058616360334,0.0,0.0,0.2011568706430824,0.0,0.05471306212332788,0.0,0.0613279891183719,0.2529213200186944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2979413321807041,0.0,0.0,0.04845364275323735,0.0,0.0,0.0

A cytokine storm is where your immune system over-reacts to the virus. You get to feeling better then bam. Your immune system starts sending cells to fight the pneumonia in the lungs and then you have multiple organ failure and you go septic.


How is this combated? What are the chances of getting hit by this storm when dealing with a case of coronavirus?",4.3912499999999985,6.477962291666668,4.4545833333333364,84.49875,71.91666666666666,6.883333333333333,26.583333333333336,7.645422480735847,1.5781708333333335,404,14,72,5,8,125,66,96,0.187,0.695,0.11800000000000001,-0.8363,0,0,0,0,1,0,8.0,0,5,0,1,3,6,2,3,9,0,6,4,2,1,0,12,12,8,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,5,0,0,0,1,8,1,13,11,3,12,0,0,0,0,9,4,1,3,4,54,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23595926982036156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750548313643926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30021953217783903,0.13490001033014956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2787796653838985,0.0,0.1516262436386775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268203115602469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18496266645821688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5342184260431296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738621309381465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986561383014004,0.18883949297136324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29786806574869595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,rachaelonreddit,2020/03/18,"I'm diabetic. Diabetic, BMI is around 40, 34 years old. Severe OCD. I can't stop touching my face, so I've given up. Anxiety makes me itchy. I'm staying at home. I've stopped checking out books from the library. I'm terrified I'm going to make someone sick. I'm a little scared that I'm going to get sick and die. I'm more scared about my parents, who are 60 and diabetic (Dad's a type 2, Mom's a type 1, I'm a type 2), and my grandmother, who is relatively healthy but overweight and 81.

Most of all, I'm just scared and upset because I've come to realize how quickly everything can change. I've never seen anything like this before, with people panicking and hoarding things, with all the businesses closing. I worry about who will take my dog if I get sick. I know my parents would take care of her if I died, but what if all three of us die? Who will take her then?

And...the air is different. I feel antsy and agitated. And I'm having religious issues, too (don't worry, I know this isn't a religious forum, I'm not going to talk about those, I'm just putting it into context). I've been extremely emotional and crying a lot, which is unusual for me.

I don't know what to say, or what anyone else can say, but it helps a little just knowing that some of you may read this and may say that I'm not alone.",2.581538461538461,3.7842358717948734,4.521758241758246,85.79824175824177,74.8974358974359,7.837362637362638,26.186813186813183,8.418075326091056,1.6376109890109891,1015,36,221,18,21,348,144,273,0.233,0.713,0.054000000000000006,-0.9941,3,1,0,0,0,0,46.0,1,1,0,0,11,6,0,4,9,0,18,8,1,3,4,50,50,20,3,4,12,4,2,1,0,5,7,3,1,0,18,17,1,2,6,2,1,5,7,4,0,1,3,6,19,2,21,42,7,22,0,0,1,0,17,9,0,9,8,121,37,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193220592083213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08267641415003145,0.0,0.0,0.0755679450126027,0.11073471848047664,0.0889358010280287,0.0962088893418657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588098694812791,0.0,0.09196312516364027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101887789804804,0.0,0.11432810012967748,0.09309629403399436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11871435776989532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3364916547896853,0.11291446414315215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09028206840456138,0.1215688506225406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971300599853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054645527730636266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11292854535881812,0.0,0.1842630570858692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243981168266049,0.0,0.10840716488720246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11280131387798828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375788633324001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052799561209768586,0.2166373420467786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09188076112746499,0.0,0.0,0.14428064286213366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12657511565150098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335343213090281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340562011172893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24000706479413764,0.0,0.0,0.07492499440391788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10864435159773027,0.0,0.0,0.1081033770638162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2578346594583738,0.3246031754531928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209300557792845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915708602022003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11519264357271836,0.0,0.1807096249573566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437748888151671,0.08686589245659025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179965019412628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299998723783089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21950905147542507,0.0,0.07677276162910565,0.0,0.0,0.06959619680140335
COVID19_support,zelosteam,2020/03/18,"Webinar: How to setup a community helpline in 48 hours Hi!

We are a small and dedicated team of former volunteer coordinators who have an [app for volunteer management](https://www.getzelos.com). This past weekend we won a [remote hackathon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwolcott/2020/03/15/hack-the-crisis-6-lessons-from-estonias-coronavirus-crisis-response/#331638f4fca8) by using our app to create a senior citizen helpline manned with remote volunteers.

Unfortunately we don't have the resources to scale this beyond our local community. So we're sharing as much as we know in a live webinar tomorrow Thursday March 19, at 11 AM EST/8 AM PST.

[Here is the FB event link.](https://www.facebook.com/events/523658641861100/)

COVID19_support,OMGWhatsHisFace,2020/03/18,"Stuck between 2 choices So I can either leave with parents or stay put. 

Live in LA County. Parents live in Austin. They drove to me recently, before it got crazy. Now they’re suggesting I return with them to ATX until it all blows over; their biggest concern is longer term food shortages and potential violence. 

I worry if I go with them, I’ll be stuck for at least 2 months. Maybe more. Could my work start again by then? It stopped last week - tv industry. I’d be stranded if so. Money isn’t a huge issue; moving up in the industry is. 

I’ll also be way more bored. their internet sucks compared to mine (and most people’s). I like online gaming - and it’s a way for me to stay (semi)social. 

Also, they may or may not be moving out of their house in May. They were supposed to move to Europe in April. It’s all up the air on the timing now. 

What. Do. I. Do? 

Also, I feel like my anxious parents want me to go with them so that they stress less. 

But also, if it gets terrible - violence, food shortage, dangerous - I’d rather be with them.",0.8680288461538481,3.2861125913461566,2.518261538461541,91.82673846153853,86.54807692307692,5.443384615384615,20.33923076923077,6.918507183188421,0.5043251538461542,801,25,165,11,25,262,125,208,0.187,0.77,0.043,-0.981,3,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,0,11,1,11,7,2,1,5,0,16,2,0,0,2,28,27,18,0,6,9,3,1,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,9,2,1,1,2,1,7,2,5,0,0,5,1,24,2,29,13,9,40,0,0,0,0,16,14,1,9,17,112,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884415605555175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13718538082662585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333103266532513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695483257515047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06140046677296707,0.08675217389206702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29367593416514004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06344403361975623,0.0,0.13802700402559864,0.0,0.09712152718028112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14011804745900205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674510819719748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898457531129676,0.0,0.1285806277085896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11865262678651378,0.0,0.21445615200172616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12199635300007106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09692712509753068,0.3871940336756375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40451286004073,0.0,0.0,0.08418675453258243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12207428818748672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11990101049947025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595131301499051,0.2588640782843649,0.0,0.10152391040528726,0.139101755731408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07080889710341517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162467178272196,0.19277664724219035,0.09740669320125454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840509258490545,0.1233216951249802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,SugaSugarHoneyHoney,2020/03/18,"Super anxious, getting angry now with my family I am prone to obsessing, so there is that as well however I have two teenage kids (16 and 17).

I have an ex-wife as well who is more lenient than I am.

I am having a difficult time getting the kids to stay away from friends, so they end up going out and hanging around with one or two people each day. It mostly is the same set of people, but on occasion one of their other friends shows up.

I re-enforce that we are supposed to be socially distancing ourselves and it is hard, but they laugh it off or say not to worry because their friends are fine and nobody has the virus at this point.

Because my ex is more lenient I end up being mostly the bad cop and end up looking crazy for constantly scolding and complaining.

COVID19_support,HarjitGeo3D,2020/03/18,"The science behind the UK's Coronavirus policy. The delay phase of the UK's COVID 19 policy has been one of the most controversial of all the responses to the disease, particularly due to the previous 'mitigation' strategy that appeared to involve deliberately exposing the majority of the healthy population. However, the UK government is apparently shifting to a different strategy (thank god) which, like most of the world, is based around suppressing the initial peak of the epidemic quite forcefully rather than just rounding it off. The study is here:

 [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) 

I'm not an expert by any means, so I'll leave you to judge it. But this is actual science with real models rather than some kind of plot by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to wipe out all the poor and elderly to save the economy. Some points:

\- According to the models it will be possible to continuously suppress the pandemic at manageable levels all the way through the year by interspersing periods of social distancing with periods of relaxation. This, at the very least, shows that an end-game is being taken into consideration. In fact UK planning seems generally based on long-term expectations that the disease will resurge in the winter months.

\- The models don't seem to factor in the arrival of an effective treatment later this year (very possible), or the possibility of switching over to a contact-tracing based method. Mass surveillance is briefly mentioned as a possibility but not actually factored in either. These could make suppressing later re-occurrences easier.

\- The models do not include mandatory quarantine for the entire population (lockdown). Assumed compliance rates with the voluntary measures in place are given in the report. This should limit the economic damage inflicted by a full lockdown (remember that economic damage can have consequences in lives too), but I think compliance may end up needing to be enforced otherwise fatigue may limit the effectiveness of these measures. Anecdotally a lot of people here outside of London aren't taking things seriously yet, although this is only just the start.

\- The fatality rates given are useful outside the UK context and should be encouraging for those who are panicking over doomsday scenarios. For instance a totally-uncontrolled epidemic in the USA is 'only' expected to lead to the death of 2,200,000 people (510,000 for the UK). Remember that these are not back-of-an-envelope calculations that apply a flat casualty rate over the entire population of the kinds we see from fearmongers, these are the result of simulations carried out by highly-qualified professionals entrusted with guiding government policy.

There are plenty of intelligent and well-educated people out there who can make up their own minds and judge the plans for themselves, but it should be of some reassurance to those who have been stressed out by this unprecedented crisis that at least they exist and are available for scrutiny. I recommend everyone read this paper properly: it was written in language that politicians can understand after all, scientific jargon shouldn't be a big barrier here! :)",12.404008587041375,12.68921204918033,11.250592635961493,49.32391393442626,53.28051001821493,15.1288316419464,48.02244340359093,13.925175675911133,7.528669476971116,2801,156,350,100,28,893,296,549,0.09699999999999999,0.828,0.075,-0.9488,4,3,1,0,0,0,119.0,1,1,2,8,13,14,0,1,54,0,42,1,0,7,5,80,61,14,2,10,14,0,1,1,0,8,1,0,0,0,31,17,0,7,11,3,1,2,7,6,0,1,7,2,6,8,82,39,16,50,0,3,2,0,12,32,0,13,16,259,37,8,0.0,0.0,0.21918291491005631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763698418060948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09997341517595322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08635401928585898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966474952397845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11733265689245845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989341211746381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10731025996732807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338924349308486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189125850760484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05486553779012774,0.0,0.09916554256440158,0.09938455696757102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09547593306309456,0.0,0.0,0.14992615245203494,0.0,0.0,0.1223308108983625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11339394291982845,0.0,0.08963912538565821,0.0,0.0,0.08327119783738403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07609937017096194,0.17082287402185914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23357012924187226,0.0,0.11733265689245845,0.0,0.1061625661053069,0.5064187082201095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11944798715354407,0.11233331837685608,0.12782531785964646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25443464966890234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08949089339590001,0.20447273498582072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144786920569597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07948859018216123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12864262414495714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08443782529072875,0.0,0.0,0.1033934473688673,0.0,0.0,0.0746090749768383,0.0719591814188436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691130821718755,0.0,0.09699367201919254,0.0,0.18532335318411491,0.0,0.08914083666559577,0.0,0.0,0.10097381896055692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14463880676910262

Currently I'm at university living with 3 other people, and I've started to develop symptoms this morning (fever, cough, headache). In the UK when symptoms start the advice is to stay at home for 7 days if you live alone, or if you live with others everyone must stay at home for 14 days.

I understand why everyone else in the house would need to stay home for 14 as they may have it but not have developed symptoms yet. However since I'm already showing them, wouldn't it be acceptable to stay at home for just 7? Just want to go and stay with my SO.

The plan is currently to follow advice and stay at home for 14. Just checking whether that's necessary.

COVID19_support,Toomv9,2020/03/18,"Stopped working today Today I left my job, I am a self employed private physiotherapist. 90% of my patients have cancelled so I have no other choice, plus the risk is too high now, being in such close contact with the general public. I also think it's right for me to do so since I live with people who are classed as vunerable who have also started to self isolate.

I will apply for universal credit tomorrow and luckily I have a small bit of saving to tie me over for a month, plus I did some shopping for a months worth of food at the start of the year when there wasn't such a frenzy. After that I don't know how I'll manage but I'll cross that bridge when the time comes. 

I want to do something now to help others around me but not sure where to start. 

I feel like it's a blessing and a curse at the same time!

COVID19_support,hideawayandgoaway,2020/03/18,"The mental stress of this is starting to get to me. Should I call in sick? Hello all,

The mounting stress of having to deal with all the corona virus related news has started to become too much for me to handle. I have anxiety and this pandemic has taken an extensive toll on my mental health and anxiety. This coupled with the fact that my mother recently passed away due to a genetic lung disease has made me very anxious to go to work and potentially catch the disease from the 200+ employees at the office.

My place of employment has provided paid time off to those that are sick, returning from work or have childcare related issues.  Unfortunately, none of these options apply to me. 

My options are 1 of 3; 

1. Call in sick and use a 1 of the sick days I have left - realistically this will be a short term solution and may provide me with the ability to calm down and get everything together to be able to move on
2. Call in and explain my situation and hope that mental health will be covered as an approved covid related time off
3. Call in sick and tell them that my symptoms are similar to covid-19 - I really would hate to be dishonest as I don't want to panic my colleagues at work and feel that it's morally wrong to do this. 

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place though because I can't figure out which route to take. I am new at my place of employment and thus don't want to give my managers too much detail about my private life and current mental health struggles.

What would you all suggest?",7.5471734234234225,6.556938739864867,7.812756756756759,74.19620720720722,63.62837837837838,11.271711711711712,36.28738738738738,10.504223727775694,3.6648863063063057,1201,49,230,25,15,394,159,296,0.157,0.794,0.048,-0.9840000000000001,4,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,1,4,4,8,1,4,16,0,27,11,1,3,4,38,46,17,0,6,1,1,2,0,0,6,10,0,0,0,15,17,0,0,3,1,1,4,4,6,0,0,4,2,24,2,50,32,7,34,1,0,0,0,13,19,0,5,11,155,39,6,0.09774005839042156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14954175428473648,0.11041844537964032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09183000226377656,0.0,0.0,0.059581432404377736,0.10794621544583012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3992141104410776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10814751556337948,0.0,0.06303425182853535,0.10076570844896278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08784246216596417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04942031028235792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10213029287370633,0.09376117017871406,0.055547927603806085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08755589421384079,0.09649807247375204,0.0,0.31167933461350605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09707793169572053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020152272952149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061948594247442,0.0,0.06903669375808498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248400650476132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39399596060188175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388221398208472,0.14370037806443164,0.0,0.0,0.09439795745032332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11467689924913232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063526743209905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06261478418213605,0.0,0.09650651621203844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10986392077874814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383618327881202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22392181331408295,0.10217913067152633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158934466760354,0.07348836000924698,0.0,0.08542911910068796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09602911111520736,0.0,0.11398602810436682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441602875752753,0.0,0.080645784339086,0.11529923759252605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2134677797601122,0.0,0.0,0.13886346636256472,0.1068634103585091,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,meme_therud,2020/03/19,"Salvaging a Day With a Rough Start After a good day yesterday, today started heading downhill real fast. I woke up, and I was ok anxiety-wise, but normal life, messes, and fighting children started to chip away at the good attitude that I was determined to have when I posted yesterday. It makes me sad that my kids are starting to feel cooped up. The weather isn’t good where I am, so I can’t even get them in the backyard to feel like they aren’t imprisoned. 

Admittedly, our basement is a bit of disarray. You know, it’s the spot in the house that accumulates the stuff you really don’t need, but can’t bare to part with just yet. In addition to the junk, there are the Holiday decorations. I really had the best intentions of tackling the basement during this time to further assist in keeping busy, but I felt like my kids needed somewhere to cut loose. So we worked for an hour moving all of the random things in the basement to the smallest part of the basement so the kids could utilize the space to ride bikes and trikes (it’s an unfinished basement). The loved it!! 

I really wished I could’ve had the project to organize the basement during this time, because I think it would’ve aided me in my anxiety, but I realized as my kids were fighting over who was looking at whom over breakfast this morning, that maybe they are also anxious of the situation...though they may not fully understand it.",10.347527137042064,7.4476056455223905,9.718534599728633,68.77978968792404,59.70895522388061,13.029036635006785,42.274084124830395,11.20814326018867,4.633114925373134,1115,48,203,22,11,359,150,268,0.087,0.784,0.128,0.9291,1,0,0,0,4,0,32.0,2,2,4,2,10,13,3,0,26,1,19,4,1,2,1,33,39,13,0,5,6,0,4,2,0,1,1,0,1,5,17,7,1,1,8,2,0,2,6,5,0,0,8,5,26,8,34,29,5,35,0,1,1,1,19,16,0,2,18,144,43,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10293128236651612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09846465530746007,0.1454084073828685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12092956329199547,0.0,0.0,0.07846190159373552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13507575251933665,0.0,0.1405206354189549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20553280105906224,0.0,0.0,0.16601773621145416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501334494124711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13016174219474916,0.09195218445753536,0.1235841159211678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724693134943291,0.0,0.0,0.32387363428107885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320960849177544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675581467892014,0.14851686093549324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11440552020467767,0.0,0.0,0.07073698444368867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09091339454950273,0.1257647818511013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10808602267397692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11616799176152748,0.0,0.08591654532318233,0.0,0.12930893430020354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368009415329671,0.0,0.1908772692716208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12611085144582385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27876603371362185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12327092685912147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14650292208161628,0.2473694322151329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3644132767695167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14734493616402766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08551081805182723,0.08247372684054043,0.1264593072438737,0.0,0.15010650397737796,0.0,0.12200433202884238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13399417709259295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14801294033188986,0.0,0.0,0.0937041807213556,0.0,0.0,0.09143361608661167,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,aristhought,2020/03/19,"The helplessness is scary. I genuinely feel really scared, for myself, for the people I care about. Too many things are uncertain and uncontrollable. I’m doing my best to socially isolate but it almost doesn’t feel enough. 

I still get random bouts of coughing and difficulty breathing because of my asthma and long term effects of pneumonia from last year, and it’s super scary to me. If I get this, and it almost feels inevitable because of how fast it’s spreading where I live, it feels inevitable that I’ll have to be hospitalized for it. 

Idk anymore, every choice I make - like whether or not I go to the pharmacy to pick up backup medications, whether or not I go to the grocery store - seems crucial, and I feel like I’m fucking up all of it.",6.161283255086072,6.919942295774652,6.435164319248828,77.0275978090767,66.1830985915493,9.409702660406886,33.383411580594675,9.444778638647367,3.0583965571205014,594,25,108,11,9,191,89,142,0.134,0.7559999999999999,0.111,0.1415,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,3,5,10,1,3,4,0,6,5,1,4,1,29,21,13,0,1,8,0,5,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,10,6,0,0,7,0,1,2,3,5,0,0,0,5,13,5,18,20,4,11,0,1,0,1,1,3,1,8,8,72,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35702991285073177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17679920815471273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21734749557928384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870868276656002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18176150860644624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18420397229342636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502029424317426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4507016799176686,0.1273584797139643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16481079134603244,0.18628088049497676,0.0,0.20263364712963072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14531653169249226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17419065694422484,0.0,0.15741858825479116,0.15776625879904305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11899881073178475,0.18074114307439648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17959159243575104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235922581336356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11420643964934868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784826713291953,0.0,0.0,0.1622933150250252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18172717682816136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14236928607012658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11843685770409848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480215899420294
COVID19_support,sassylildame,2020/03/19,"I Feel Lost. TW: Ideation I'm posting this here bc all the rant pages like ""off my chest"" and ""unpopular opinion"" won't let you post about COVID19, they just stick them on these megathreads where it gets lost and I feel even more lonely and unheard and suicidal so I'm sorry if this comes across as angry but I'm really freaking angry and scared shitless. 

I feel like every single time I post something on fb along the lines of ""stop shaming people for leaving their house when they can't work from home"" or ""service/arts/entertainment workers whose jobs were just cut have the right to be upset"" someone always comments something like ""it's not about you"" or ""people are dying"" or ""it's about society's most vulnerable"". Or ""social distancing may be a long term thing and we'll all just have to adjust"".

Like, um NO. How about you STOP. Unemployment in the USA just reached 20% a few days ago. Do you know how high that is?! During the Recession of 2009 it was 10%. WE'RE DOUBLE THAT!! During the Great Depression it was 24%. We are SO CLOSE TO BEING THERE and if/when retail shops all close WE WILL BE THERE!! Guess what--during the great depression there wasn't a virus going around, but a lot of people died because they KILLED THEMSELVES. Or STARVED TO DEATH. Because they had NO MONEY. But screw anyone who cares about that/them, right?! I mean SCREW THEM.

In what ridiculous opposite land universe are people living paycheck to paycheck, on jobs that don't have paid leave, not considered some of ""the most vulnerable among us""?! This ""the poor must starve so the elderly can live"" bullshit is UNBELIEVABLY inhumane (yes, I know it doesn't just affect the elderly but service/gig workers are still supposed to ""adjust"" to not having jobs anymore). Guess what, Karen, with your cushy white collar 9-to-5 that lets you work from home and gives you health insurance and your husband and kids and pets that give you additional support you get to stay at home with--GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE.

2% of the US population versus 20% of the US population--TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE are at risk of starving to death as will suffocate to death over the next year. And gun to my head? I'd rather suffocate. By far. None of this is to say we shouldn't be concerned about the elderly and immunocompromised, we should, but myself and all of my friends are young, healthy, creative gig workers who up to one month ago had beautiful bright futures ahead of them and expected to live a long time. Literally everyone I consider a close friend is, sorry WAS, in food service/arts/entertainment. And everyone, save one person, lost their jobs. I'm lucky. I come from a line of good, highly educated New York Jewish stock, and though I'm financially independent I have backup if I need it. Most of my friends aren't so lucky. And I worry about them dying, but not from coronavirus. 

For that matter, I don't do well in isolation. At all. I know I'll kill myself if there's a lockdown and I have to live alone in my apartment for more than 3 days--all my roommates are home with their families, and my mom wants me home because she knows I'm like this. But my sister and dad are immunocompromised and my sister also has asthma and I've only been social distancing for like 3 days, in Manhattan of all places. I can't risk it. And every time I'm on social media it's people just being MEAN and HATEFUL. The irony is, I know I'll get COVID19. I know I'll survive. Because I'd really be fine with dying and that's how the universe works. I feel so lost. 

I think if one more person says ""people are dying"" to me after I've been sobbing and shaking nonstop for 4 days, I'm gonna slice up my arm. Or hang myself. I'll have plenty of time to refine the plan. Because even when there isn't a pandemic, I think about people I care about dying every single day. It's like a constant thought. It's hard to see the light on the other side. I'm supposed to turn 27 in early June. I probably won't make it that far. And I feel selfish even thinking all of this.",2.8014485477458058,5.155630040973115,3.617250994002294,87.43194024193008,77.65556978233035,6.415263831794598,23.33649504683604,7.524965506658679,1.0603062740076823,3166,102,619,45,76,1006,335,781,0.203,0.69,0.107,-0.998,6,5,2,1,0,2,130.0,8,11,11,13,41,45,7,6,30,1,59,8,3,6,8,125,110,60,12,11,29,5,6,7,3,10,2,2,6,3,34,43,1,2,19,1,5,5,18,23,2,3,15,12,69,22,86,76,22,77,1,8,3,2,53,38,3,21,37,382,103,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09120261939654987,0.0,0.0,0.05327966037532533,0.0,0.041139123613189256,0.04280487920173956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05101784999906118,0.035970294808452395,0.0,0.0,0.04579537146661243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15679654398440726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10489958047291807,0.0,0.0,0.08862755607337665,0.0,0.05559184415308583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13270648174119365,0.0,0.08861593821262946,0.0,0.3203396366369471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193328284365287,0.0,0.13002939209480846,0.09831240052634684,0.0,0.0,0.04849608850247407,0.0,0.13005618599967456,0.03675104590100682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622053445597348,0.0,0.11923471006494805,0.0,0.10750783465579042,0.0986980463589932,0.029236366842140257,0.04314813135330002,0.0,0.11343266101901107,0.11334101087964048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0460830197066088,0.050789528396532696,0.05279558401788303,0.05468173615685756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630577557671705,0.25800871518279744,0.0,0.0,0.059358567776433835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20419782797970165,0.0,0.11382859965564388,0.0,0.16963108669088953,0.0,0.0,0.10894188211993062,0.0,0.10520835353445636,0.0,0.17592790799179414,0.0,0.1817012192864356,0.09105125990473044,0.0,0.0,0.22462540160276945,0.0437351851294716,0.0,0.0,0.03433874811627111,0.05215534968889294,0.0,0.11207349307898674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0602496762964659,0.041061486573741285,0.0,0.0,0.03814449502121267,0.0,0.049684181430691164,0.05471044697029962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10457776957666744,0.039124886136264726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28531400575004184,0.08983646906984605,0.05374721467799938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14780515062210592,0.0,0.055464490851322185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659116866842369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786445581490025,0.0,0.08181942498685932,0.05150363651706151,0.0,0.04099358513192033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1573196499849516,0.04358767248186257,0.07920700648122299,0.0,0.11517294380574387,0.0,0.05483162666901464,0.041082621110175695,0.08601766904415528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05627053196556105,0.0583771552415421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03417658881944932,0.0988882125625917,0.05054270143278003,0.04084016958774446,0.1499847733432559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055955449931934464,0.0,0.0,0.1856395751027412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03034254338809218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04625363192367393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11235382825724384,0.052243085963089145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03312774637547774
COVID19_support,JaimeLeCafeNoir,2020/03/19,"Frenchman on lockdown. Starting to feel relaxed. Hi everyone, hope you're all fine!

As you know, my country, France, is now on complete lockdown since Tuesday at noon. Nothing really interesting to read here but I just wanted to talk about  my new ""lockdown routine"" and how I'm starting to feel more relaxed each day.

It was the strangest feeling I ever felt in my entire life, seeing our President saying those words six times on TV: ""We're at war."" Half of the population saw this live: an absolute record. Hearing the fact that the next day at 12am everyone will be on lockdown. Just imagine for a second what we all felt. My heart was beating like crazy, my wife was completely silent, we stayed in front of the TV, speechless, listening to this, imagining what will come next, preparing for the worst. We knew for a fact that lockdown would happen like in Italy but, when you hear it live on TV, it's completely different. Will there be riots in grocery stores? Wait how long? It's ok don't worry! Will we see the army on our streets? Are the shops going to be closed? We'll be okay! Wait. Is this it? Are we really living this? You name it. It was really something.

The first day of lockdown, some people (of Paris mainly, sadly) rushed to big train stations, wanting to get out of their big cities before lockdown, not listening to the fact that we SHOULDN'T go out at all costs. They were all packt like sardines in a crushed tin box. They probably made the biggest mistake of their life and everyone in France was really shocked, but, yup, only time will tell. 

Two days on lockdown passed by. We're at home with my wife. Of course, we're not able to see our friends, to see our families, our neighbors, to go at the park, to do anything  beside doing ""essential"" groceries, go to the pharmacy or walk around our house. We can't go out unless it's an absolute necessity. And if we want to do so, we have to print an official paper, date it and sign it, in case of control by the police (we don't have a printer at home so we have to copy it by hand, a bummer, plus we have to copy ALL of it word for word, a normal process in order to discourage people). Needless to say it was a bit strange getting out the first time for some grocery shopping, the atmosphere was almost Half-Life 2-esque. I talked with the manager of my local shop that I know very well, and she's doing ok, I don't know why but it warmed my heart talking to her and her husband. I saw social distancing on the streets but honestly it didn't felt *that* apocalyptic, just different.

Now, we try to read the strict minimum of news, just staying informed of important things. I completely stopped reading Reddit hours a day, scrolling furiously r/coronavirus and others, putting my phone down at 4 am falling asleep completely exhausted. I just stopped doing this. My anxiety was too high and I thought: what's the deal? What's the point? My life is right here, right now, in this house. Nowhere else. I just need to keep being informed of important things, and nothing else. It was hard to stop but, it was necessary. 

Now for the good news. Honestly, lockdown is something but it's not *that* bad. The weather is absolutely beautiful over here, 20 degrees C (68F) and a blue sky. Instead of worrying all the time about the end of the world as 1/2 comment on some subs and forums says on Internet, we're just doing normal or wholesome things. Well, beside the fact that my delivery of Animal Crossing I ordered a week ago appears to just be stopped somewhere, everything is fine. In the morning, we watch cartoons like we were kids, some Pokémon, eating our breakfast and coffee. Rest of the day we're working and listening to some music. We were never fan of working before (attention: kids are living inside our 30 year old heads) but honestly, it feels very good, thinking about your work, being focused, and feeling accomplished at the end of the day. Our flat is very small but whatever, we actually don't care that much. We play some Stardew Valley, too. Some Rocket League. Some Zelda. We have to be together and move on together and keep fucking hope, like what's written on Trunk's time machine. [Hope](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkSnAX8WkAM_lPH?format=jpg&amp;name=large). Tonight we'll re-watch some Ghibli films. Can't wait.

Yesterday night, we drank some beers on our balcony (thanks to our neighbors that handed us a table and two chairs because our balcony should have been under repair this month, and we sold everything two weeks ago, bummer). Everyone was drinking at their own balconies or gardens, it was actually pretty funny (we're living in the suburbs of Bordeaux). We talked with our neighbors from afar. People we never even saw or talked with before. One of them even played guitar for us all, asking what we wanted to hear. So simple, yet so relaxing. At 8 pm, EVERYONE clapped their hands (to thank the workers of the medical field). So heartwarming too. 

Yesterday night was a good night and so is today. So. Silent. No city sounds, just birds chirping. It's weirdly relaxing. It was a long time since I heard birds from my apartment. It's so cool. I tried to recognize which sound corresponded to which bird but it's VERY hard actually. I waved at my neighbors from afar, thing I never did before. We smiled at each other like hey, you're also wearing pyjamas? A kid was playing with a Switch (or was it a Game Boy Color? No way) in a garden. I don't know. I felt cool.

Well, yes, we're living something we only saw in things like SF films or games like The Division. Yeah it's very impressive. We know. But I firmly believe that even if it's gonna be some hard confined months ahead, we'll be somehow okay. We'll find a way. Take advantage of this quarantined time to focus on what matters the most in your life. Oh and unsubscribes from r/collpase and r/coronavirus, instead sub to r/wholesome or I don't know what you like the most. Or do something else. Write me a message if you feel stressed. I'm an asthmatic, maybe we can talk about this? I don't know. I love video games, if you want to talk about this. 

Well. We will saw nice things coming from all this. I can feel it. Honestly we're starting to feel relaxed. We have no choice but getting through this.

COVID19_support,StarryStudent,2020/03/19,"Currently abroad and afraid I won't get home. I'm currently in Israel and planning on flying out to the US very early morning next Tuesday. I was studying at yeshiva (a religious school to study Torah and other Jewish things) and decided to leave early.

I'm absolutely terrified that my flight will get canceled or, God forbid, the airport will be closed. 

This very likely is not going to happen, but I'd already been having a miserable time in Israel without the help of the stress and anxiety brought on by Covid. I'm just so afraid that my efforts to leave this country are going to fail and that I'll be stranded here until God knows how long. It's caused a number of breakdowns. 

As an aside, another stressor I have is that I'll get sick before next Tuesday and have to be quarantined here for two weeks, to then try to get another ticket home, and continuing the cycle of being afraid that it will get canceled. 

Basically I'm a huge ball of stress and anxiety right now.",8.580986997635932,7.209185952127662,8.499219858156033,71.33277777777779,61.819148936170215,11.334278959810874,37.378250591016545,10.25414643259724,3.779537115839244,781,31,139,14,9,254,113,188,0.18899999999999997,0.769,0.042,-0.9829,2,1,0,0,0,0,17.0,1,0,0,3,6,9,0,6,10,0,16,1,0,2,0,21,30,16,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,4,1,0,2,0,11,11,0,1,2,2,0,3,3,8,0,1,3,0,6,1,24,19,0,27,2,2,0,0,2,9,0,1,16,87,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15864922378550414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3015021211729132,0.21996100972431076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12233417520799544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476871611180761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3755586934797808,0.0,0.16341092562765544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12713169308255562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963632390553483,0.0,0.28841779962381003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07900996796516373,0.0,0.0,0.3044546179927049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07023674717934553,0.0,0.0,0.1272282799444022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057932892001208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277527618264075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14549874607452107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32936666011073806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551166264838733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383104088962565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976075956277103,0.0,0.1404383749734338,0.0,0.17293265247615655,0.0,0.0,0.2372438151214727,0.0,0.0,0.11532031728656525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13858517823263145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,pibble22,2020/03/19,moving apartments during covid-19? I am scheduled to move apartments at the end of April. I already notified my current landlord and signed a new lease at the end of February. Do you think this pandemic is going to make it harder to move? Is worth investigating to see if can move apartments sooner before this situation gets worse? My boyfriend thinks I should see my current landlord will let me break my lease early and my new landlord will let me move in because he is worried that the situation will be worse at the end of April. I think it unlikely my current landlord would let me out of my lease early but could be worth a try?

COVID19_support,TurquoiseSucculents4,2020/03/19,"How’s that history major looking now? I’ll admit, I used to wonder what one did with a bachelors in history. Outside of higher studies, that is. Now, I can see a huge use for historians. This whole fucking thing could have MAYBE POSSIBLY been avoided with the help of historians. 

Think about it. An accomplished history major, who’s studied events like the bubonic plague and the Great Depression. And studied the nuances and circumstances surrounding that time. As well as resources available back then. It would be so easy to collaborate with, say, the public health department, a medical team, the stock market, and ask them questions about how they would have used current resources to avert that crisis. And use that in helping avert the next crisis.

The main question would be “knowing what you now know about the societies victims to this pandemic were in, what would you have done differently, assuming all current technology and medical/healthcare resources are available to utilize?” This allows history to play a role in coming up with a feasible and effective solution to avoid repeating the same mistakes as back then. Even if it took years to implement because no such crisis to apply it to, it’s still handy to have sitting there for when the time comes. If people had been doing that all these years, and adding onto this grand plan, maybe it could have motivated scientists to develop more advanced medical technologies.

Same with the stock market, “knowing xyz about society back then and knowing what’s different now, what would you differently to avoid this economic crisis?” And yet more innovative business ideas to build upon over the years and stow away for the foreseeable future until the time comes to deploy that plan for when the next financial/economic crisis hits. 

But this feels like wishful thinking. Nobody will ever take history seriously as a “useful” subject like math or science. And I wish we could change that.",9.090178571428574,10.05234861309524,8.064976190476191,67.16335714285717,59.89285714285714,11.600952380952382,39.12142857142858,11.308507894218259,4.903156428571429,1578,75,235,41,20,487,183,336,0.11199999999999999,0.743,0.14400000000000002,0.8798,5,3,0,0,0,0,38.0,1,3,2,7,23,15,2,3,23,0,26,4,0,10,3,69,52,29,0,13,4,0,1,3,0,6,3,1,0,0,28,21,0,5,15,2,0,6,1,8,1,1,7,4,9,7,44,33,10,47,0,1,2,1,17,11,1,7,32,178,37,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850607994703106,0.0,0.08548551960379205,0.2098907444667351,0.0,0.05546498510580541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09625244952478336,0.23513238649870774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2179377542081939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07836718795264469,0.0,0.0,0.28518694218383583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311155023772603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06009622269131239,0.08230317973920814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04600588913558686,0.06500131194616203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411624953782056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10031376798963423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09671519551480984,0.0,0.0,0.12197367593201446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271353398264184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20001685959199492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333553280735768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640637705671566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18281785093979905,0.0,0.0,0.1833201707344859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19353195225026096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06165531761279376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06307910508289596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257445702318647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20385309424103876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07235671579459385,0.0,0.0,0.0725050607302173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266253802794098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841109098718923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06044788812521601,0.1166019160360514,0.0,0.0,0.1591661973189008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10109018628478583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3929188665648368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180846785727319,0.0,0.0,0.1015840189806382,0.20926170190170848,0.0,0.09867179496042656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3231736710048555,0.0,0.0,0.1757784239958277

COVID19_support,blabus,2020/03/19,"I'm a U.S. expat currently living in Mexico- should I return home? My girlfriend and I are U.S. citizens that have been living in Mexico City for a work rotation. So far Mexico appears to be making little to no effort to pre-empt the spread of the virus or prepare for it (absolutely everyone seems to be out and about as normal).

When the infection rate starts to explode here (I imagine we're lagging the U.S. no more than 1-2 weeks), I'm concerned that Mexico City's health and general infrastructure will not handle it well, or at least not any better than a large U.S. city would.

I'm also starting to become concerned about rumors regarding the U.S. enacting militarily-enforced lockdown. In the event this happens, when we reach the point here in Mexico where things are quite bad, it may mean that we're unable to return to the U.S.

Are these fears of being unable to re-enter the U.S. valid or unfounded? Am I the only insane person here in Mexico for wondering why everyone is walking around like hell is not about to be unleashed here?",7.551818181818181,7.500280646464647,7.938080808080809,70.21045454545455,63.24242424242425,11.240404040404039,32.64646464646465,10.832165505486646,3.627125252525252,840,29,143,20,11,277,120,198,0.12300000000000001,0.858,0.018000000000000002,-0.9638,1,1,0,0,0,0,34.0,1,0,0,4,14,6,1,1,13,0,16,2,0,1,0,23,27,11,0,3,6,0,0,1,1,4,2,0,1,2,9,6,0,0,4,0,0,2,5,3,1,0,1,0,6,3,29,18,2,23,1,0,0,0,5,12,1,7,10,96,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14480074625113865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12313307161022087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16118972357222527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15118498113057202,0.0,0.19997639123046912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1601407412886811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3460382164629261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20375287001397333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16011864392565509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924677899381001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18162688563345544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846112593500131,0.18147862177194055,0.3197743393223681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208649070728337,0.0,0.0,0.1972371310749833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17740909255068335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771106946249226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15810239280000773,0.0,0.0,0.17116865172721002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19258907977337592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16483834013479304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2563230205961862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202941417008697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452425620495003,0.0,0.1628027004743054,0.0,0.16338653270758602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19636151490125026,0.13182032695356474,0.0,0.0,0.12862616240063854,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,fifteenlostkeys,2020/03/19,"I'm miserably accepting that this is it. I'm 34. I work in a pet store. My boyfriend works deliveries. We moved into my parents house to help them financially while we saved to buy the property. I have almost $6000 in the bank. I was so close. But it's all over now. Everything is done. I will have to work to take care of my parents, while endangering them with my existence. I have no insurance for when I inevitably get sick. Even if I make it through this, the world depression that will be behind this is going to make life as we know, well, knew it is over.

COVID19_support,rainbow-rolls,2020/03/19,"I have agoraphobia and somehow, forced quarantine is a nightmare. I have a love-hate relationship with my job, but I never wanted to be indefinitely laid off without pay. Signed up for unemployment, but I don't think that will be enough to pay my rent which is still due April 1st. 

Living in the bible belt, people like to put a filter on everything, posting pictures of smiling, happy families and how #blessed they are to all be around the dinner table together. ...Can't lie, I'm a little jealous. Lots of people say they'll pray for me but what I really want is someone to actually ask how I'm doing and wait to hear the answer. 

I'm not okay. I'm lonely. I was sent home from work today and I already miss the sound of other human voices. I tried posting in 3 different subreddits looking for a quarantine buddy just to distract me by talking about something other than lost income and toilet paper memes. But I didn't click with anyone, just like real life. 

I felt like I truly fit in once. Last month I went to visit one of my penpals (who has a new job and much less time for chatting) and his entire family liked me. I had a place at the table and people to take care of me when I felt sick. I never felt that included in my own family. I was already invited back, but if we're all quarantined for a year or more, they will forget me too. 

I don't know how long I can last with only the voice in my head for company.",4.876857031857028,5.260254828671329,6.2437296037296015,78.59798756798756,68.8951048951049,9.012898212898213,27.77700077700078,8.998388855275968,2.1164823620823623,1115,34,218,19,18,379,174,286,0.08900000000000001,0.7609999999999999,0.15,0.9586,7,5,1,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,3,2,12,13,1,1,14,1,22,4,1,3,4,45,43,19,0,3,11,0,3,4,0,3,2,5,2,1,7,12,1,1,6,1,3,4,8,5,0,1,10,10,32,8,38,27,8,34,2,3,2,0,14,13,0,5,19,149,39,7,0.0,0.0,0.10897005186781858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24645274091347005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07807956665858841,0.0,0.0,0.09940654582130252,0.10439277403625699,0.0,0.0,0.08586437464285147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11385107947556407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666735714877145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538098055018955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035833304597787,0.0,0.3158067173266497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32165103940357714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11887069037541845,0.0,0.0,0.11460168295964993,0.0,0.12585586381535502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120102505853147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22162284193363907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06136879431199351,0.18204562809453384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07887310229848707,0.21821775666043652,0.11191881548624824,0.09860325400980803,0.09882102655729848,0.09377144001326704,0.0,0.12189679088711802,0.09493456533583534,0.10078305780374007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913085353089173,0.0,0.08208746684135518,0.0,0.17224763381355834,0.10784786103514166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11892080263676083,0.07566787144920463,0.08492713699884177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322457396709449,0.0,0.11666735714877145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21389060375024765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225532057593174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710052261967605,0.0715361934263681,0.0,0.0,0.11988765246346388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888014023967311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461436435713033,0.08596605581509797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917672959210048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08395904585275096,0.08975301947526801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07155115839932087,0.0,0.0,0.06511342856871,0.0,0.1058464509949607,0.0,0.0,0.075813984154585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317271738626368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10351563741384902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764218131817456,0.0,0.08129428527506045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.071909337834093
COVID19_support,snailgorl2005,2020/03/19,"I'm trying to stay hopeful through this Let me start off by saying: I am *very* optimistic, to a fault. I have diagnosed anxiety and depression and what has made me so resilient is that I somehow manage to keep optimistic through even the darkest times.

This is the first major event that I have personally been involved in that I will be able to remember well (I'm 24, turning 25 at the end of the year, for reference)- I mean, it's hard not to be since it's so widespread. I have been going through phases of denial, anger, stress, and optimism, sometimes all within the same time. My entire life was cancelled within a 48 hour period of time. I know that it's not the worst thing that could happen- it's honestly better for everyone. I'm dealing with grief, frustration, and boredom, just as most are right now.

My biggest source of anxiety is mostly from other people. I have seen so much pessimism, so many ""real"" comments from people who are feeling the same way as I am, and it's honestly disheartening. I personally believe that this kind of negativity is going to hinder the development of a cure/treatment or learning more about this strain of the virus. It's to the point where I'm starting to lose hope about this ever being over. I want to be able to enjoy my 25th birthday.  I want to be able to see my friends soon. I want to be able to go back to work. The more hope we have, the more we can slow the spread, the more we can start to return to normal life.

But with all the negativity I see, it's making me doubt everything I believe in. It's making me feel like I'm wasting my time trying to stay positive. What made it worse is that I saw a tweet, liked by some of my own friends, criticizing people who were upset that things were cancelled for them. It made me feel like I'm not valid for crying because I have nothing to look forward to right now. I have staying home and I have Master's coursework to finish.

I have an appointment to donate blood on Friday since there's a shortage in my county. I've been making plans to contribute toward groups I am a part of that have had to cancel fundraisers due to the outbreak.

I would love to do more to help while having to isolate, but I'm limited in my options right now, and with everything going on I feel hopeless.

Any advice/words of encouragement would be much appreciated.",5.508498985801218,6.079833546840959,6.1104274660055635,79.44450980392159,67.56209150326798,8.858267598227028,30.642401021711365,8.841846274778883,2.386317947562166,1854,68,355,29,29,604,222,459,0.11800000000000001,0.764,0.11800000000000001,0.3902,0,0,0,0,0,1,55.0,3,0,1,7,18,29,2,4,23,0,44,5,1,6,3,59,85,17,1,10,7,0,5,3,2,3,3,1,1,2,31,13,0,2,9,0,1,5,5,13,1,1,12,11,41,16,68,61,18,51,0,5,5,1,18,19,0,10,28,257,72,3,0.3231156327868658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054932427600560094,0.0,0.12359128733778682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0621139942188442,0.0,0.04924207267399952,0.0,0.0,0.18202033505114398,0.0,0.07144237987165014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06449538515549491,0.0,0.08873183756878247,0.0,0.08327950736085855,0.06957475526333819,0.08198889143700787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07154613621207435,0.0,0.0,0.05335370701990368,0.07306914714370193,0.0,0.07718770848602292,0.14519774806627989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.163376972475517,0.11541693631224653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06871049804620262,0.0,0.0,0.124819168184075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18363406031545546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07143252174191524,0.0,0.07236203514969841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054144399417953314,0.0,0.08102783123089753,0.2406950475019629,0.0795509529018316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07180000517187626,0.0,0.0841188022935788,0.044393975393961074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0826019065696169,0.11411306355093573,0.11839348273397073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06783393819734385,0.090370935827634,0.0,0.0,0.07290611846667798,0.2293048682640679,0.16176164543943072,0.08189713416048648,0.0,0.08799191217462772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1187635841297772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914617904660907,0.07750954103395112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08747568572990551,0.0,0.1680057717915641,0.14106605369926997,0.0,0.0,0.07636217829645989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09194408228148547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150675607982876,0.20695423869462012,0.0,0.0642386300259979,0.0,0.0,0.12874066270456502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13364229521305673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07989240571788682,0.0,0.17152718096518396,0.2582987044858974,0.0,0.0,0.09253196641589692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10733183446722414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884113239051089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10968715239755114,0.08786425587060985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06665105911393268,0.14293647889130168,0.06411853737787111,0.0,0.0,0.07262993962572528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05880800723936287,0.0,0.08232060858764974,0.11476603744569396,0.0,0.0,0.052018968438147545

COVID19_support,confusionwithak,2020/03/19,"Anxiety of feeling trapped Tried to post this under a throwaway but doesn’t seem like new accounts can post here, so I’ll water it down. 

Really struggling, I’ve been having breakdowns since they made us all work from home. Not sure if this is nation wide yet but all non essentials are shut down in my state. I feel like a prisoner whose sentence they just keep adding more time to. I’m seeing things about 18 months now and I’m scared that my mental health is going to kill me. I have OCD and I’m already spiraling. I can’t do this for 2 months let alone 18. 

Trust me, I get why this is necessary, but I’m in self preservation mode and feel like I’m not safe and being asked to sacrifice my health and safety for others. I know that’s selfish but this isn’t me being upset about missing a vacation or concert - I genuinely am scared of my mind. 

Please tell me that the lockdown won’t be 18 months. Give me some hope 

I’ll delete this soon",2.1545833333333317,4.209811125000002,3.0127083333333324,92.46145833333335,78.375,6.3500000000000005,21.604166666666664,7.3871296695380915,0.6269041666666668,744,21,159,10,18,235,123,192,0.205,0.67,0.125,-0.9622,0,3,0,0,0,1,15.0,1,0,2,1,8,14,1,4,4,0,18,3,0,1,3,28,37,12,1,2,9,0,3,3,0,1,2,1,1,1,13,5,1,2,5,1,1,1,6,7,0,0,2,5,18,7,16,30,4,20,1,1,1,0,8,8,0,5,11,92,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14569089684904904,0.15523199133753154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761157458382327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13150673946520866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21337976532411732,0.20098824953989045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07349386585314613,0.13494274165784728,0.07994556413899072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29904962328345186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14110270540410924,0.1397162837507733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12503327343059328,0.15562965918024446,0.0,0.07730812902891486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14384381651900846,0.0,0.20617163833959026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13310462501126005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14176149632197427,0.0,0.1420358202447296,0.0,0.3368425077829914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358592172107866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15441257044376133,0.0,0.0,0.2694444721975752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011630965939094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816688748501545,0.0,0.11209516241010474,0.128059982233477,0.14674868388509296,0.0,0.0,0.116363039245374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14705801993245027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13257908287514705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12295110573906565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345438468021296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08202535822544409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550517221214694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920776144136354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269320987982123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102408873529548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,hyperviolator,2020/03/19,"Asking for friends in a maybe odd pickle, but probably not, and couldn't find a clear answer for them online. Does someone have to quarantine because someone they spent time with was exposed? Asking for friends in a maybe odd pickle, but probably not. 

1. Family #1 with a kid are WFH.
2. Family #2 with a kid have jobs you cannot WFH.
3. Family #1 was helping Family #2 with various days of child care, because Family #2 has no other options for child care at all.
4. One of the people in Family #2 was *definitely* exposed for long periods to someone at work who tested positive.

So as I understand:

Family #2 where one of them was exposed, that whole family now has to strictly self-quarantine for two weeks from today, not even going out for essentials -- they're on delivery now. **Definite quarantine for Family #2.**

But what about Family #1 at this point? Does Family #1 have to self-quarantine in the standard way and go delivery only, or are they still in a position to do essentials like others are if needed? **Definite quarantine for Family #1, or still able to go out for essentials like the pharmacy, etc.?**

I couldn't find a clear answer for them online.",2.4829816513761465,5.2156324908256915,4.753001834862385,76.5172275229358,81.88990825688073,9.543045871559633,24.775045871559637,9.692545771848811,3.2394518899082563,905,35,157,33,25,313,105,218,0.07400000000000001,0.799,0.127,0.9562,1,5,0,0,0,0,53.0,0,1,5,1,8,6,0,0,10,0,16,0,0,0,3,30,26,10,0,4,9,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,4,6,8,0,0,5,0,1,3,7,0,0,3,5,0,8,6,38,19,4,27,0,0,0,0,16,13,0,4,12,104,14,3,0.072971518104509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13643703799370152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08896552027872953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14879865200858133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04706059239433514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771573447927728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813825318362034,0.04819699949725029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8254926356415688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13338929111401376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275522774773307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12441418610426128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04891127041186662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07241297202876827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07130039562422141,0.0,0.0,0.06457749724273036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14661939594928391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05410745605574487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09889477837069477,0.055498127741020066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05058926268267498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06898167108782947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15735127701773258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15225041575951412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18548559146527144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11655029723882705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425502790281431,0.0,0.06916846682741776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07128257001182134,0.07596592382559922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05792139452677261,0.05853335024931789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08147009400053798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053124134266668635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,CourtiPea,2020/03/19,"I’m really suffering. I feel like a prisoner of my mind. Would just like to speak out about how I’m feeling. I speak about my suicidal thoughts in this that I’ve been having lately, i assure you they are only thoughts and I don’t actually want to hurt myself, my mind just goes to that when hopeless I can’t stop thinking and thinking and thinking. I have generalized anxiety, depression, OCD. It sucks cause I’m such an extrovert... I turned 21 which is legal age in the US... and I’m bummed over the fact i can’t really have fun or party or anything really. Which I know I can’t control and I’d rather stay safe and not spread it than do something to make this worse. I spent all winter excited about spring and summer. Now nicer weather is here and I feel like I can’t even enjoy it because I’m just scared sad and paranoid. I’m obsessing over the idea of me just being trapped and not being able to enjoy my summer this year. I’m an in home caregiver and work at the same house every day with three clients and a coworker on afternoon shift. There is other staff here to take care of the clients during other shifts. I am one again paranoid someone else will bring it into the house and I’ll get it or bring it home to my mom and dad or unknowingly give it to my boyfriend. Another thing I’m the most worried about is my boyfriend. I don’t want anything bad to happen to him. He’s 25 and works in a Walmart as an assistant manager. He took a two week vacation and will return back to work. It’s upsetting because I feel like it will just be worse when he returns to work. I had a breakdown at work and started crying at the table to my coworker.... I even admitted to him about my suicidal thoughts I haven’t had since I last was in the hospital psychiatric floor back in June 2019. I feel hopeless, paranoid, so so sad, and so worried about the people I love, and the people of the world. Please. Just offer me some comfort.

COVID19_support,RealLifeTinaBelcher,2020/03/19,"Concerns about hospitals being overrun with patients Hi all, I have a history of anxiety, and this pandemic has sent me spiraling. I live in the Bay Area, California, which is one of the hotspots in the U.S. I've read several articles about how thousands (if not many, many more) of people will inevitably die due to insufficient ICU hospital beds and ventilators. It'll basically be like Italy where they are choosing who to treat and letting others die. Apparently my state will be seeing large increases in the number of infected and number of people needing medical treatment in the next few weeks.

I'm not afraid for myself -- I'm afraid for my parents who are in their 50's/60's. I keep imagining scenarios where I'm frantically calling hospitals and they tell me that there's no one to help my parents. I can't help but feel like they're going to die. I've spent all day dealing with episodes of crying, panicking, and intrusive thoughts/visions. I'm just so, so scared.",6.663166666666665,7.934725872222224,6.911111111111115,72.23000000000003,65.27777777777777,10.888888888888893,37.22222222222222,10.864195022040775,4.445888888888888,787,40,134,22,12,254,118,180,0.161,0.772,0.067,-0.9674,3,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,3,0,9,7,0,4,6,0,13,2,0,1,2,21,24,11,3,2,5,2,1,2,0,3,2,0,1,0,7,8,0,1,3,1,1,3,4,4,0,3,2,2,13,3,21,15,5,16,0,0,1,0,14,8,0,1,6,84,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11906181256442686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15892268957841638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17095984095120811,0.10037293346255706,0.16045482346593873,0.0,0.0,0.4845796318568093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786946996557268,0.11118704185361844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08845204439843539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20864028440111107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13833723949382554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15914928842154966,0.0,0.1520726684839913,0.0,0.1374302457137754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155828035136371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15678781616708012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11540279903415007,0.0,0.0,0.1655216227995902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21092720053373035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3456327473371315,0.0,0.0,0.2157980781295558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15567903071118802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15581970114432006,0.0,0.12402246940318587,0.0,0.0,0.1758254115758758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603352206960678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484254385676935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,SassLass1,2020/03/19,"My job isn't taking this seriously. I'm a physician medical coder. Since Monday we have asked if we can work from home. Our job is 100% done on the computer, through a virtual network. My boss laughed when my coworker said she was given the message to tell her we want to work from home. Boss said, ""Well good luck with that!""

They sent out an email yesterday saying anyone who had the ""ability"" to work from home would have to do so starting Monday. It was signed with our immediate boss's name, her supervisor, and a few others.

Our immediate boss emailed us, didn't even come out of her office to talk to us about it, saying that this only applied to departments where they already had the ability to work remotely - - not us. She didn't even apologize, just said to wash our hands and wipe down our desks. She said we would be ordering disinfecting wipes as if that would solve all of our problems.

One lady came back from a cruise on Tuesday. She apparently ""didn't know"" she was supposed to self-isolate. Now she's gone for two weeks. Lot of good that does now. Another coworker just got back from Miami today.

I called out today because this whole situation has made me a nervous wreck. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I've been nauseated. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Is there anything I can do? My boss just got back on Monday from a bike event in a decent-sized city in our state (that was apparently canceled yet these idiots decided to gather anyway) so I'm kind of afraid to even go in her office to tell her how I feel.

I have mild asthma. My mom has high blood pressure, history of stroke, chronic pain, and my dad will be 60 this year. I still live with them. This is a recipe for disaster. They'd rather wait until we all get sick than even discuss the thoughts of us working from home. If this is supposed to last months, you'd think they'd be able to set us up from home before it all ends. I emailed my states Department of Health this afternoon (from an anonymous email) and told them all of this. I told them I didn't want to give them the company name unless they could actually do something about it, and that I wanted to remain 100% anonymous.

Any advice is appreciated.

I'm in the uk, in a tiny village in the north east. I'm unsure what to do. I usually visit my boyfriend a couple of villages over, I often taxi over and back home. Should I still be visiting? 

I'm worried about taxis as obviously loads of people use them and handling money n stuff.

Any advice much appreciated:).

Also I had slight sniffles on Monday, damn sore ear today, I'm a hearing aid user so I was worried about that too :/ I'm also worried to think I could pass this onto others like how people are asymptomatic",1.9933333333333323,4.49089672727273,4.290454545454549,80.62901515151516,81.72727272727272,6.212121212121213,23.71212121212121,7.492282038375204,1.4568484848484848,440,16,78,7,12,152,79,110,0.158,0.8190000000000001,0.024,-0.905,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,0,10,2,1,0,5,0,8,2,1,2,1,9,16,7,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,2,1,0,6,2,0,0,1,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,2,2,8,1,14,11,1,18,0,0,0,0,6,9,1,1,6,52,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807718343944501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2958757323428112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12580075960073805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14224726624837492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477008899424772,0.20468989502050414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17676758125437386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2084991900718685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18556184685242968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903776434083203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599024973984394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3847500398557209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14773468100373496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117713385679061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185352682243659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17535058467207085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597735091223599,0.20374231923667746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5636044218339311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,QueefOnAYogaBall,2020/03/19,"I'm just really anxious and that made me leave work early today. At work my co-workers where joking about COVID-19 and how its  survival of the fittest. Like, I have asthma, and my parents are old. That's me and my family  you are joking about possibly dying. It didn't piss me off so much as fucking scare me. I have asthma. I will at least have to go to the hospital. They don't understand asthma, and not being able to fucking breath can do. But, I recognize I am not the joke police nor am I the conversation police, so I just asked my manager of I could leave for the day. I cried and told him it was no ones fault and I didn't want anyone to get in trouble, but im afraid after I left, he brought everyone together and ""talked"" to them. They don't deserve that, since I don't think they really did anything wrong, and now they will see me as a drama queen or something. 

Does this make me weak? I just wanted to leave. I was shaking a little, and I felt like crying. Every cough or sore throat makes me think I have it. My asthma has been acting up a little too, but how do I calm my brain down? How do I not panic over the possibility of dying? Was it immature for me to leave early?",2.08986394557823,3.7425839183673446,3.842448979591836,88.29374149659866,77.16326530612244,6.789115646258503,21.46258503401361,7.62386473244151,0.7435850340136048,920,24,197,13,21,309,133,245,0.152,0.7829999999999999,0.064,-0.9478,1,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,5,4,13,17,3,4,9,0,27,13,4,6,0,34,45,23,2,3,11,1,1,2,0,2,7,0,0,0,9,10,0,0,4,4,0,4,10,11,0,1,11,2,39,6,24,30,2,22,0,0,1,2,13,11,3,2,9,142,48,3,0.11265742287276895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727082118570673,0.0,0.07877268948819219,0.0,0.092707459989764,0.0,0.10531948275182387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576294197270432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08994778514597508,0.0,0.24749777808139556,0.07265471783687652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338412372573697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858726994093577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09491873764511437,0.10764899538272507,0.0,0.0,0.10620339203057086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10816879300095884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20829994421669534,0.058858853687366035,0.0,0.0640258096099235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12168934881341598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4771517774981369,0.12240261958243402,0.0,0.0,0.11007745253880498,0.2258246677708673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10659917746474214,0.15039940913359715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08281616834069717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11821501428664336,0.0,0.07633958533560846,0.0,0.0,0.13217921234343655,0.1250927359930723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25400863440042953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14434245970095208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278973354196307,0.0,0.08977338022388777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319138437004004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672918807115902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054976911779868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14437265533901866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678606419668274,0.10764899538272507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11728035028796074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13289653372707627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24604783678441935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231732066528477,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,MsUglyBurrito,2020/03/20,"The COVID-19 ""Don't Go Crazy"" list So, with most of us being in a sort of lockdown due to COVID-19 I have been working on this crazy, in-depth, organized list of things to do, read, watch, listen to, etc during this time. For the most part, just working on the list has been helping me.

Since I am hoping this list will help others I am trying to make it sort of a community project. The community is the world I guess, haha. Anyways, I am taking suggestions of things to add.

The list is simply a Google doc that I have been working on for a couple of days. I don't gain anything from making it or from other people checking it out. It's just something I am hoping will help some people.

There are things like books, movies, shows, music playlists, podcasts, crafts, tips and tricks, etc.

I am thinking of adding things like a list of places to learn new things online.

The Google doc can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4gyJdoLdL18z0tmeEurmy4iXqa0c4B2JN4Jqb49YAg/edit?usp=sharing) for anyone interested in giving me ideas or just getting ideas from it.

Hopefully, it helps at least one person! :)",6.533496801705753,8.08579260199005,5.2729673063255165,82.8296641791045,65.76616915422886,7.533901918976546,27.789978678038374,7.7094869923839395,1.5637232409381667,887,27,158,9,14,260,116,201,0.034,0.787,0.179,0.9796,0,1,1,0,0,0,52.0,1,0,0,4,6,8,1,0,12,1,22,0,0,2,0,25,35,4,0,3,5,0,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,1,17,4,0,0,5,3,1,1,2,1,0,1,4,2,12,7,28,27,7,14,0,0,1,0,9,9,0,11,6,108,29,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791162183010573,0.0,0.1034630557418185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13911513567108874,0.0,0.08108386447318076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28043889148685514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378537621466679,0.0,0.0,0.06568745234340223,0.12060931628565885,0.07145386044788603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385030639775503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3370900891391483,0.0,0.0,0.3746274586568089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2838621863401428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228482541663555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678482233516486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12142844511374205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851962374307034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13615067771175862,0.0,0.17432729638371186,0.10978044157653777,0.13135852336921894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576156730749527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10400312333871796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679120559272944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09453146583788928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4176389667832857,0.08056113331432273,0.0,0.0,0.07331274177562813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536074916469058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512347545851344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745934475520199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,JDreeves5,2020/03/20,"What the Media Wont tell you You guys, think about this. there are SUPERCOMPUTERS, smart doctors, and geniuses all over the WORLD working on this virus. everybody wants to be the one who cured coronavirus and believe me it’s coming. just like the media is behind on reported cases, they’re also behind on people making progress. 

we are in good hands and i bet you that one of these days soon there’ll be a headline like “man/woman cures coronavirus” all the best minds in the world are in on it and we are gonna prevail. 

the best thing to do my friends is to not watch the news too much, and please follow the social distancing things. wash yo hands and play video games and hang with your parents, listen to music, and just try to make the best out of this 

feel free to private message me if anyone needs some help going through this

COVID19_support,TheManInsideMe,2020/03/20,"How can I safely reintegrate someone traveling into a house? Long story short,  my sister is being brought back home. I'm 29 but high risk from underlying conditions. She's 22 and she traveled to Chicago o'hare from La Guardia. 

How can she be safely brought into the house? Suburban single family home 25 miles out of the city, sleep in separate rooms, taking cleaning precautions, but this feels like a risk especially because I rely on a parent for care so while I'm low risk for direct infection I'm high risk for indirect infection. 

She is currently living with my brother and his family about 40 miles further outside the city for a week to see if anything pops up. I just want to have a plan in place for when she's coming back. We'll stay apart from each other for another week, continue cleaning everything (with bleach no less, overkill but it's the time for overkill), and she'll probably use a different bathroom for a while but I just want to see if there's anything else that can be done to minimize the risk. 

Yes I'm a little freaked out.",5.479019189765459,6.769408049751245,5.918738450604124,78.19981343283584,68.00497512437812,9.722956645344707,32.267590618336875,9.957137785484203,3.2847680170575693,842,36,153,20,14,271,120,201,0.106,0.795,0.099,-0.1068,3,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,1,0,0,1,10,11,0,5,13,1,12,3,1,3,0,28,27,15,0,4,8,3,1,1,0,2,2,0,5,0,4,11,0,2,1,2,0,5,1,7,0,0,3,3,14,4,29,19,3,37,0,1,2,0,11,20,0,3,12,94,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228556166244225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23902264433623666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22334470195523584,0.0,0.08853042042573969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14807092882536182,0.0,0.0,0.12510216426170287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517336859359911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14861997480596942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12132042707639387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13052271140452726,0.0,0.273818478075312,0.0,0.07343228704495172,0.10375182583824508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3068854135199294,0.2913536159433398,0.0,0.0,0.3351501779044341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095168983846285,0.14555789052171356,0.12824011396017568,0.12852334169528468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612599274514704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517336859359911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15658172587832847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23145786471213076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14533416171180716,0.0,0.12305229669419508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15479508789804075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091943436985702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468436040821271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12543146774071415,0.0,0.0,0.1713199828690857,0.0,0.2329883348184333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I know there are bigger things going on— I just wanted to share how I was feeling with someone.

COVID19_support,Reluctant_Achiever,2020/03/20,"Doubly terrified-- of a different C word now to figure out what to do), but I need to vent somehow. If this isn't the place for it, I'm sorry, feel free to ignore and delete. 

 I am waiting on biopsy results right now of probable cancer, and I have NO IDEA how the hell I am going to have to deal with this right now.  

My Doc saw me yesterday for a follow up from an issue that's been going on since January (she's only seeing patients with issues, no checkups or annuals), and what was supposed to be a routine thing she suddenly rushed out of the room and came back saying "" I'm taking a biopsy now, and I will personally get it through the lab.  We aren't supposed to be overrunning the lab but we need to take this today"".  

She was great and explained everything, but essentially best case scenario this mass is benign and I still have to have it removed, which requires surgery under general anesthesia.  Worst case, it is malignant and I have to have a more complicated surgery plus whatever else they deem needed to start me healing (radiation or chemo).  

But, in light of all this insanity, what does that actually look like?!?!  Do I have to wait however long, knowing this is a thing, and risking spread?  Or do I risk being actively immunocompromised and surgery-- if that's even a possibility for the forseeable future due to stress on the system right now?? Fuck.  The only silver lining is that we hit our deductible yesterday. :/",5.737261172611728,6.751449099631,6.479452644526447,75.42372181221812,67.22878228782288,9.564657646576467,31.66072160721607,9.725611199111238,3.0480822468224686,1130,45,204,24,18,372,157,271,0.17600000000000002,0.743,0.081,-0.9852,2,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,4,0,1,2,10,12,2,3,16,0,25,4,0,2,1,46,48,21,0,5,9,0,1,1,0,1,3,1,1,1,20,19,0,4,5,0,1,6,4,7,0,0,5,6,20,6,34,38,4,37,1,0,3,1,12,14,2,6,17,150,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.13932148861896995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978018537689516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498267619088778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1632891619434717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471880833159803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14916272491936045,0.0,0.0,0.12493770086211405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11926478539992418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09429726619339868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12831114710530148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0721880574186165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13198720349864632,0.07459066327209099,0.0,0.16227728901087698,0.0,0.0,0.1574028060227624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611682901498907,0.0,0.2980265013912343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846184921219923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06974949121319708,0.0,0.0,0.12634565452458568,0.11988960626025935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3175831632647972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21716379772266872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246599717201464,0.14916272491936045,0.0,0.0,0.1609500638374901,0.0,0.0,0.15392862013805306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3657706282481663,0.0,0.11353526369219312,0.0,0.0,0.11376803242966906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11809960160501265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15981767834828198,0.10105229887052512,0.0,0.1140151307995473,0.0,0.16354086634061613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21468833043086968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18969813216551096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532787095981758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Yofjawe21,2020/03/20,"My dad told me I should quit my voluntary quarantine, do deliveries to a local store and a home for disabled people, and only seek help if I feel ""terminally ill"" I´m writing here to vent off some of my anger right now, since this is really pissing me off.

To explain in more detail, my dad owns a restaurant in Germany, and I help him run it, and if hes on vacation visiting his Girlfriend in Canada like he is right now, I also do a bunch of management stuff. We also deliver beverage crates to several places, like the local butchers shop and a care home for disabled people.

Now to the fun part: On sunday a friend of mine stayed over night and I drove her to work the next day, later that day she told me she had fever and the next day she told me she was quarantined for 14 days since her mother also showed some of the symptons. So I thought I am going to do the sensible thing and quarantine myself for 14 days aswell. I phoned my dad and explained to him the situation and thought he got the message: Im potentially infected, and thus wont make any deliveries for the next 14 days. But today he sent me a message if I already did the deliveries, and after I didnt reply to such a stupid question he said that hes sad I dont talk more with him about the business and if I have a problem with him, and to be honest, I kinda do after stuff like this situation. I told him that I was quite mad about him seemingly ignoring my concerns for my own and other peoples health and safety, to which he replied, freely translated from german:

"" You got any symptons? Life goes on, just wear some gloves and dont talk to people (I have to ask people in the care center what exactly they need, any idea how to do that without talking to them?). Just do your job. And if you think that you are terminally ill then get some help, They need their drinks since they arent closed. I think you are overreacting and abusing the situation.""

So yeah im kinda hella mad about this and was wondering how other people feel like this, because for me there is no such thing as overreacting in a potential pandemic of a quite lethal virus.",7.285021025116492,6.109407782816231,7.596201841118307,76.1389419252188,64.25059665871122,10.940379588589613,33.55619956813274,10.07000556051586,3.058245732469598,1667,57,333,31,21,547,197,419,0.09,0.812,0.098,0.3125,3,3,1,0,0,0,42.0,1,5,5,4,19,17,5,0,24,1,28,9,2,4,1,62,55,35,1,9,9,4,2,4,2,2,6,1,2,0,18,24,1,1,12,3,2,5,7,8,0,0,17,3,58,9,48,35,10,43,0,1,0,0,58,18,1,14,23,228,76,3,0.0,0.0904930211189465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08428276884103708,0.18323347801167605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15581481141174794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714012107161887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04655807508947951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15574075870571175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29553704683606896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17902410787161133,0.07481936219093907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07723595839237787,0.054562999642585895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05900787567771292,0.0,0.03990328574389209,0.0,0.04340621700550043,0.0,0.12216966134861686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08118407183347284,0.0,0.0,0.15357958409660258,0.0,0.15322262634073613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08621916004750006,0.16499828160031546,0.0,0.07579135329294158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05394659782771785,0.1492537406843344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050981545021651184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132636101739912,0.0,0.0,0.24368009333887225,0.07167366271630585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05808735767737003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08270771971113826,0.0,0.3176968358063342,0.0,0.07979662029660296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308147698981697,0.0,0.0,0.08555855239834563,0.24370569784730164,0.0,0.0,0.048928394401092784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304493016100276,0.07265102595875153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06952980366593993,0.0,0.086283092966915,0.0,0.1895369450688837,0.2575493303950388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140660906365899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17486439820181673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1841643058668616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10148158550716686,0.09787725989699128,0.0,0.12126795871995585,0.0,0.0,0.07239547776005155,0.2919220034841985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07362369801170145,0.08282646845064101,0.05560260704376496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Taucher1979,2020/03/20,"Tooth extraction cancelled. Getting anxious now. In October 2019 during a routine dental check up my dentist said my lower left wisdom tooth had a crack under the gum line and would need to be removed. Finally on Tuesday this week I had my assessment appointment at the hospital - I was told the tooth has a big hole and an infection around the roots. I hadn’t had any pain so was surprised.

Anyway they booked me in for extraction on Monday (23td March) but today I got a text today saying clinical activity next week is cancelled., and they will reschedule my extraction. No more explanation, no idea when they might reschedule for.

What do I do, just wait around for covid 19 with a raging tooth infection? I feel that my immune system is fighting the infection and am terrified even more of contracting coronavirus. My city has only had a handful of Covid cases so I was ok with going to the dental hospital on Monday but I am now worried that they might reschedule (if the DO reschedule) for weeks time when the situation might be worse.

I am incredibly anxious about this.",4.9733562257390265,7.374057939086299,5.4613914601373565,76.54705285159751,71.13197969543147,8.696207823230816,30.369961182442523,9.325443323948027,3.105953956404897,862,37,142,20,17,276,115,197,0.16899999999999998,0.784,0.047,-0.977,1,0,0,0,2,0,20.0,0,0,4,0,12,6,2,0,15,1,25,12,5,1,0,21,33,11,0,3,4,0,2,0,0,5,7,2,0,0,5,8,0,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,0,0,11,4,20,3,21,15,2,31,0,0,0,0,8,12,0,4,16,106,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269087282993884,0.0,0.0,0.3411929602953473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26885893754435325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09973960703915584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635437134610026,0.0,0.0,0.16542229282773518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889564293719857,0.0,0.0858215391108415,0.0,0.12077519181480327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17047007379571388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640710405344903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4805880644684454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197079613215907,0.0,0.0,0.1605991192334302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148486733622083,0.16068355714995208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14364354454044342,0.12008792028521202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697397397295103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805419743848475,0.0,0.2862765638039821,0.14429497297679506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3633894275650072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15335633423472558,0.1538904344302329,0.10727201646929936,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Paul-Canada,2020/03/20,"Friend not taking it seriously, may have to stop visits So I've practising social distancing and isolation!

* No more shops!
* 2m away from strangers
* No public transit, ubers and taxis. Cycling only (even in sub 0°C)!
* Opening doors with a plastic bag
* Hand sanitizer x 100 in public
* Upon getting home, washing myself, clothes and any products I do buy outside

Basically, I've got my game plan!

The only other place I go is to my best friend, by cycling. Unfortunately he thinks I'm being absolutely nutty and have a mental issue. I tried pointing out the dire situation in Europe (esp. Italy), and China's success.

He's still using public transit, seems nonchalant about hand sanitizing, etc. We got into a massive argument about it several times, and now he's being less communicative about his practices. I told him the visits may have to end if he can't take it seriously. He talked to a friend in China, who told him what the gov requires them to do. Seems to have made him a little more aware, but still not up to my high standard.

It's going to be below freezing today and this weekend. I still plan on cycling, and then running if ice forms on the roads. He's lecturing me about riding in unsafe conditions, but I honestly don't know what else to do. I don't have a car so!

I just wish he'd take it seriously... \[/rant\]",2.1032941176470565,4.791141270588239,4.059901960784317,81.09455882352944,83.3529411764706,6.3803921568627455,24.970588235294123,7.675431598112923,1.7262000000000004,1044,42,187,19,30,353,155,255,0.055999999999999994,0.835,0.11,0.9372,0,1,0,0,0,0,50.0,1,0,1,5,12,9,0,0,11,0,18,3,2,2,0,32,36,15,0,3,7,0,3,0,3,2,1,0,2,0,10,13,0,2,4,3,2,7,7,3,0,0,5,3,20,6,29,25,6,36,0,0,0,0,27,19,0,6,10,118,30,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364861285227706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12938458487069393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14451983195880586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504037412944168,0.0,0.12197160591410885,0.0,0.15358484055076987,0.09095721545883094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3191869302448555,0.0,0.07194862909961693,0.0,0.15652935590269124,0.0,0.22028109935640813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454998702072261,0.1381359668350903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14373513567131255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568269592731752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380232050499304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13030604915401633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878090642091068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094717602820764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14387931545216304,0.0,0.13018197782631422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507349438558768,0.0,0.1555749141383569,0.0,0.0,0.15479361245570056,0.0,0.14037963754720886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3299299938271341,0.11513306701574785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31062596269939896,0.1106873706361506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882400351040435,0.0,0.0,0.08030074356842466,0.0,0.13053449811823598,0.26317867768466435,0.0,0.09349713928938257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893861012713522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15836154798716592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,dreamvoyager1,2020/03/20,Have had all the symtoms of covid this week and last which were all mild but now I developed mild chest pressure and mild shortness of breath. Doc said wait it out unless it gets worse. I’m 21 but I’ve been vaping and smoking for 6 months which I stopped for good two weeks ago. Scared that will screw me over because of my mild chest pain leading to worse problems. Looks like mild pneumonia so far but I want to go to ER from making it worse but that isn’t the logical thing according to my doctor. I’m so lost . Is the chest pressure and breath common with other covid 19 infected?,2.1239743589743583,4.482986632478635,2.5338675213675224,94.26182692307691,80.1111111111111,5.951282051282053,21.71581196581197,7.1686216300943375,0.5604991452991457,464,14,98,6,12,142,78,117,0.29,0.648,0.062,-0.9874,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,2,3,9,1,3,3,0,7,9,5,2,2,20,17,11,0,2,5,0,0,1,0,1,3,1,0,0,10,6,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,7,1,1,5,2,6,2,14,11,2,14,0,1,1,1,1,4,1,0,9,54,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1748394536587443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12023436286019695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20188129748696496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030486361007087,0.0,0.11209481568551967,0.16543375096290475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16077517299689326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09636045079823884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16563011864774888,0.0,0.21530841303659926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13165779666633556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15743337036743862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20987497904406824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18872998520375514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876183626686051,0.0,0.19746949659259969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16489967459473773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13103606358345696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926727199831335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633599437586915,0.0,0.31642461264769833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6030066599344759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,interestedboy,2020/03/20,"American living in India, not sure what to do Hi guys, I'd love some advice as I'm starting to feel a little panicked and conflicted. I'm an American living in Mumbai, and I'm not sure whether it's better to stay locked down here (I'm working from home), or try to get back to the US ASAP.

I know that the virus is MUCH worse in the US currently, but if it gets really bad in India (especially because my state, Maharashtra, has it worst), the healthcare system could be easily overwhelmed and it'd be much better to be back in the US at the height of a pandemic.

I thought I'd wait to see how bad it gets before deciding, but now India has announced a ban on all international flight arrivals starting Sunday. I'm assuming that means no international flight departures too? And I've tried asking the embassy, but they really don't have any recommendations or anything that I can find.

What are your thoughts on this?

Is anyone else living abroad going through the same thought process?",7.554526315789473,6.965985926315793,7.905263157894738,72.22684210526317,63.42105263157895,10.968421052631578,34.78947368421053,10.355215969177356,3.483642105263157,786,30,145,16,10,259,117,190,0.129,0.807,0.065,-0.9285,1,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,3,1,1,3,6,9,0,1,12,0,14,1,0,1,3,32,35,13,0,2,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,11,4,0,3,9,0,0,1,4,4,0,0,3,2,9,5,20,27,6,22,0,1,1,1,9,11,0,5,7,91,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12154102213504843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08458149998011318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696818990826254,0.12744025293584454,0.10235273212946484,0.0,0.11627690810751835,0.0,0.0,0.19127844991625145,0.20770134800125367,0.07581984905495337,0.0,0.10583676097656164,0.0,0.0,0.22000497395209248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930594107206843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10390209855526963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288939883865607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11367950062143095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19494756362353688,0.0,0.07068704655591004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12315405842968305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476156261433632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06835505352512726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246597184904484,0.32948491726885304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225625968105912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13548441681780893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828647035545995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593598305283181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911339108445752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17607118281015313,0.1325707044249545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23445012626947456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962273990391092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16888938435041145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4488352933440688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054887396048653,0.0,0.1267520999481226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,artzbots,2020/03/20,"How to cope with touch starvation? Many of us live on our own, and can't for whatever reason safely isolate with a friend or family member. Being touch starved is a real issue, and the way that is usually recommended for people to deal with being touch starved is a massage. Which rather undoes the whole point of social isolation and quarantine. 

How are folks dealing (or not) with this? I am incredibly lucky in that I have two cats, and I turned off their heated beds so they would cuddle with me more, but have other folks found other solutions?",7.249117647058824,7.6498941078431395,7.120392156862747,74.29176470588237,63.80392156862745,10.329411764705883,29.745098039215684,10.125756701596842,2.8913215686274505,437,13,76,9,6,139,75,102,0.075,0.826,0.098,0.337,0,2,0,0,0,0,12.0,2,0,2,0,4,3,0,0,5,0,11,1,0,3,0,23,13,10,0,3,5,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,6,9,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,3,8,3,14,9,3,6,0,0,0,1,8,4,0,3,1,60,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4418079296815804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20199560397643027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23493706253811894,0.16554522243098035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22364322675368772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18920519502900185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21723713574286296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14854851363804902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025553282450808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24388727747414715,0.0,0.22030624730803053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21842227347503665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23306528946550786,0.20931160610060745,0.0,0.25774159836205546,0.0,0.2359892050885303,0.0,0.0,0.1700783250937102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392258896051601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15221195168078036,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,WeNeedDeadSpace4,2020/03/20,"Looking for opinions on self-isolation Hi,

I'm not a regular poster on Reddit, so I apologise if this is in the wrong place. I have a very small social circle, and I am just looking to get some opinions on my situation in the current pandemic. 

I live in Scotland, specifically in a small village near Dundee. I have asthma, although haven't had an asthma attack for a while now. As you will all know, having asthma means I am classed as vulnerable, according to the UK government and NHS. I'm not overly worried about my own health, but I am worried for my kids and others around me.

I am the sole carer for my children, and my ex partner (the kids mum) is pregnant, so is also classed as high risk.  I work in food retail, so come into contact with a large quantity of people that could be carriers. I feel I need to plan for worst-case scenario - I catch it, and having respiratory problems already, I am unable to fight it off - so I have two options as far as I can see.

1) Self-isolate due to my underlying health conditions, and play it safe. Not my preferred option but I have the kids to think about.

2) Go to work, as I work in a small village so not as likely to be at risk as anyone in the city. Avoid bigger cities, keep practising good hygiene etc. 

I don't know anyone else self-isolating, and whilst I'm not looking to follow the herd, I am starting to feel a bit ridiculed by those around me when I'm only trying to plan sensibly for my kids. If anyone is isolating, can I ask why you are and how long for? Were you met with the same scepticism that I've had?

Thanks for any advice!",4.488466935363488,5.125723307210034,5.6483922973578204,81.62230929989555,69.84639498432603,8.458635617256308,29.610538886400953,8.563005593585519,2.135192446633826,1241,46,249,19,21,414,171,319,0.086,0.848,0.066,-0.624,1,2,0,0,1,0,46.0,0,3,0,5,14,14,4,3,17,0,28,6,0,1,1,45,52,30,0,6,10,2,2,1,1,1,5,0,0,6,8,14,1,3,7,1,1,5,7,9,0,1,4,6,33,5,51,44,6,38,0,0,4,0,17,25,0,7,9,172,41,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643317709952823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13148631599378255,0.09528517442643374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08102690427916351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2499398757654713,0.12208448866918815,0.0,0.21213966535351814,0.11139029108398618,0.13555169525816738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13008225437949156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263821148504956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09513254060865108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09953554141297437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328850881504032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12049285721043093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14407810828353326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06225158606745927,0.0,0.06771637481493188,0.0999383764426074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533043152127797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12588978839983922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059070643775034,0.0,0.0,0.13096477078982569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05821125949210389,0.0,0.10521269568108273,0.10544506566721452,0.3001710059399686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979059103227086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834910766886693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906198594544959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260444200214236,0.0,0.12448764766311772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11401161007060699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949480826666807,0.0,0.3729020736266592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13393094502380568,0.0,0.1214596469487886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08433583513671263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096984197547644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634728011661641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808958459163361,0.0,0.11639341251600542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09831222144776336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075154284147906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26023048579325625,0.2420076618730969,0.0,0.0,0.13027313640667387,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,swiftlikeninjas,2020/03/20,"Anxiety taking over :( 
Hello,
I felt the need to post here because my anxiety has been taking over the past few days.

First,  a little about myself...
I’m 33 years old, wife &amp; mother.
T2 diabetic with anxiety disorder &amp; OCD, smoker (just quit a dew days ago). A lot of my anxiety stems from medical issues, so this situation is obviously triggering for me.
I am out of shape and get out of breath easily. I have a feeling there is something more serious wrong with me but have been too scared to get it checked out.

My husband works in a Mine with hundreds of employees that has not (and likely will not) shut down. They are required to ride buses with 20+ people or carpool with no less than 4 people to get to work. They do not have adequate hand-washing stations. They are often confined in small spaces.
The Mine is telling people to stay home and use their sick days if they have symptoms, and that they can use next years sick/vacation days if needed.
The guys that work there already come to work sick, and I feel that this policy is basically ensuring that will continue, symptoms of Coronavirus or not.

I am so scared I’m going to catch it from him (he’s basically saying it’s only a matter of time before he gets it). Luckily, he’s rather healthy. But I am not.

I’m following the CDC guidelines of disinfecting common surfaces and hand-washing.. but I feel like that’s not enough. I don’t know what else to do. I can’t focus on anything or think of anything other than this. I’ve been talking with my therapist daily and it’s not helping much. I don’t know what to do anymore.

He’s in the low 99s and is a generally warm kid, but just feeling his warm forehead was enough to send my anxiety into a spiral. We are a two household family (his mom and I are split), and my mind got lost in the possible risk people and the possible risks to the people I know. 

My kids are practicing social distancing with me and their mom says they are too, so the odds are low. We are in an area of the US with a lot of people infected so it was just too much. I’m all amped up now.

THANK YOU

Thank you to every firefighter, police officer, medical personnel, truck driver, cashier, grocery store worker, fast food worker, and every other person who is out there working to keep us going during this time.  These brave people cannot hide in their homes like the rest of us.

This is a time unlike anything we have ever experienced.  We cannot run from it, nor can we hide.  We must come together and help one another.  We must be willing to share our excess with others.  We must not do this for profit, but to ensure our country and our communities stay strong.

I know we are all scared, I am too.  We must be strong, kind, and loving during this time.  If we don't we shall surely perish.

All of my love to you all, be brave and love one another.",4.005377358490566,5.448617540880504,4.8655503144654135,83.7787028301887,71.70440251572326,7.564150943396226,23.312893081761004,8.07648339933343,1.211217610062893,635,16,123,9,12,206,97,159,0.036000000000000004,0.67,0.295,0.9933,0,0,0,0,1,0,25.0,16,3,1,5,3,15,0,1,4,0,19,5,0,0,10,36,30,8,0,7,3,0,0,1,0,6,1,0,1,1,10,19,1,1,1,0,2,4,5,1,0,2,0,1,24,14,16,21,5,13,0,0,0,3,27,3,0,1,6,92,34,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29008178189718525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11382581813061808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915068747183535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12511862691146433,0.2330816305305647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16725745122833804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861061193057592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271317888516127,0.0,0.13874653504967865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294543470821825,0.0,0.14403930320564426,0.07601721741065244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06757630990185245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3745184031526589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13934314640183526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874588249432609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589387724489208,0.12077594739103828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13905010201667578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13848274668042754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474310316625028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13036524222770246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2546934896709114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.241967031193243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4991468562476927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08158489446198795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15906151433068458,0.0,0.0,0.10069882303016242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Energizer100,2020/03/20,My dad is a pulmonologist in Brooklyn. He has recently stayed home since yesterday after having a fever and body aches. He took the COVID19 test. How long is the turn around? I'm in San Francisco and freaking out about him. He is 66 years old and had been working with patients in the ICU. I just want to know when I can get a test result to see if its just the flu or something else. He is taking rest at home and gargling multiple times.,2.535340909090909,4.56113185227273,3.315909090909092,90.88136363636366,77.06818181818181,6.672727272727273,24.63636363636364,7.645422480735847,1.1196545454545457,345,12,73,5,8,109,66,88,0.085,0.9,0.015,-0.7269,0,0,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,6,1,0,0,7,0,9,3,1,2,0,15,17,8,0,2,4,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,1,7,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,1,4,0,11,14,1,16,0,0,1,0,6,6,0,2,8,43,5,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21072556221766794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629357857557071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1977440936369531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12367324565301385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4748866955132479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13009177189661458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20948435747529284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24839142432848216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23372642436984056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18863033528485848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19581218881967927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18223392930116175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25230552754793684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17797939757794598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13802978193938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26299785891994804,0.0,0.25747675514862856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396199945496955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17233054250235824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15243599421540505
COVID19_support,wrtics,2020/03/20,"So worried about my family of lifelong smokers My mum is a mental health worker and brilliant at it, her workplace are going to start staff ""working from home"" by Monday, but she's working all weekend. Even then, they will still be going on visits to patients in their homes all across the city daily, then just coming home instead of the office to write notes and fill out forms (that's basically all her job is). So, even though it's good that they're doing this, she's still going to be coming in contact with so many people every day - even people in self isolation!

 I'm so worried about her. She doesn't seem to be that concerned and said she's okay with the thought of getting the virus, and would even volunteer to stay in the office to upload documents and continue working there. 

I know I have to respect her wishes for dealing with this however she sees fit, as she knows much more about her work than I do. But I'm still really scared for her. Other than being a lifelong smoker, she is pretty healthy and never gets sick, so that's making me feel a little better. I'm more concerned that she lives completely alone, so I really dont want her having to isolate by herself incase she gets really ill and there's no one there to phone an ambulance. 

My grandfather is also in self isolation because of age and pre-existing health conditions (also a smoker!), and my mum is the only one who can drive to take him supplies that he needs. We don't really have any other family.

Some really hard decisions are going to have to be made, like whether or not I should go there and isolate with her if need be, or whether we should just avoid each other entirely, so I can try and help my grandfather if I have to. I'm also a slightly higher risk because of unexplained lymphocytosis. I just really don't know what decisions I should be making right now.

Sorry for the long, all over the place post, I just left like I needed to share. Thankyou for any kind or comforting words you might be able to offer. I love this sub so much. Thanks again x",5.366385193753615,6.144282065162907,5.891741854636593,80.15489444765764,67.94736842105263,8.845228455754771,27.877482166955854,8.950670267944501,2.1341601310969733,1620,50,304,27,26,524,204,399,0.095,0.758,0.147,0.9818,2,4,3,0,0,0,43.0,2,1,2,6,33,14,0,3,14,1,34,5,0,3,5,65,68,35,0,11,14,2,2,2,0,6,4,1,3,2,16,21,0,1,8,1,0,10,7,3,0,2,3,4,42,11,48,51,11,42,0,0,1,1,40,15,0,8,17,222,58,7,0.08519560212717371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08823695015449325,0.0,0.2043926767223327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158718618563188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386889659947064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753485867343144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467769349968072,0.08932596791618039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494411531571427,0.08783292486678031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984861118931172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22508356682455272,0.0,0.07178096924833366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16062966294216238,0.0,0.0430774562769225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13353355737793432,0.0,0.2420931201114715,0.07145802898630832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07631852538428913,0.0,0.0,0.18111788227044714,0.0,0.0,0.057104816259626476,0.0,0.25637440607507245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454348921415539,0.0,0.0,0.0887181093629765,0.14046382461484622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256527099014177,0.0,0.0,0.08324453560650119,0.08538837501917698,0.07522927753408172,0.07539542693329764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07689235717815966,0.08061413867621288,0.1137374519491618,0.0863749685784462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585712872471803,0.09037907050756623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252571405901833,0.1895143784032336,0.06570810050274876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546148976177212,0.06479509447857912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11812780677654384,0.0,0.08901127126331687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159383659822794,0.08667455573517369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3274709056844325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275657871574492,0.0810405272195219,0.0,0.08529566022225878,0.0,0.06788986458356609,0.07755887645353839,0.1777551869781211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536950151469148,0.06030188568497121,0.0908071762320066,0.20411195373121988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06405649007612901,0.0,0.0,0.07843666404856853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370424652824962,0.0676357916478715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05784222145815219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05025057347654481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979707379150759,0.0,0.0,0.2480936520932264,0.17304053890616994,0.0,0.06052051136990427,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,RedXon,2020/03/21,"Thanks for appreciating us I just need to get this out.

I work as a security guard in many different types of security. And therefore, yes, I'm still out there almost every day, I'm still working and I'm doing it for the benefit of hopefully everyone. Now, I'm not saying that I'm as important as a person in the medical field or someone who is keeping the food distribution working but our jobs become more important and meanwhile more exhausting (at least mentally) every day. And while yes, more people nowadays stop and thank me personally for my work etc. I still feel that we and the police are under appreciated these days.

I am in front of hospitals and enforce the no visitors rule and send people with symptoms to a separate area. I stand in front of grocerie stores and pharmacies and ensure that not too many people enter. I am at the train stations and make sure that groups no bigger than 5 people are hanging out and sending them away etc. And I'm not doing that because I have fun to be the ""no fun police"" or because I like to make peoples lifes more difficult but because it is important right now and because people are too stupid to follow these rules by themselves. And yes, most days I'd rather stay at home the whole day and watch TV or play games and isolate myself from the risks but I don't because someone has to do that job and hopefully it helps us to return to normality just a little bit faster.

And yes, these days it hurts especially when someone just curses at me or doesn't follow the rules just because they are stupid and he wants to party or whatever. Because normally he wouldn't cause big harm, maybe of me a little bit and some other people there but now that ahole is hurting everyone be being a selfish idiot. So please everyone, next time you see a security guard doing public work to keep everyone just a little bit safer, just try to be thankful. Not only now but also when this thing is over. I'm not doing it because I like being the party popper that hates fun, I'm doing it so that everyone is a little safer.

Thank you for reading.",6.731862121048657,6.730325578163775,7.289135829107781,74.01122882727373,64.93052109181141,10.085618729096993,32.65821555723379,9.761364909221204,3.072054137447405,1660,61,300,31,23,548,189,403,0.111,0.67,0.21899999999999997,0.9932,3,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,4,2,2,5,23,28,4,1,20,4,27,5,0,4,1,69,53,40,0,8,22,0,1,2,0,1,4,1,1,2,23,26,1,8,1,4,1,8,11,11,0,0,0,4,23,17,41,47,13,53,0,2,2,0,20,22,0,10,23,207,46,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737853222739157,0.0,0.0,0.05380964619704536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06321865292938668,0.0,0.0,0.3281418101581706,0.07431355941502167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2203809814110808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912261368876174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2603685325564001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07030092894279771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15008629876113674,0.0,0.0,0.11338493983855524,0.3214795931754432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03402249119442085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08136409549695651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035154847977752424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643229883137375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04510127282963518,0.0,0.06749466911487416,0.13366298420304684,0.0,0.0,0.14406493734181572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13354456673780682,0.11961612492657014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047527024659633724,0.06574637233566416,0.26975829013861163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982961836326593,0.13643756441825386,0.06759915785402104,0.0,0.0,0.06778489680084533,0.06780979329969995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0498926958375546,0.0,0.0,0.07156082911329205,0.0,0.1318545760217873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05117503961161509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32653989223790264,0.11750538639793523,0.0,0.07386127232238987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730552978407514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057463004379363074,0.0,0.05350957827863267,0.0,0.0,0.05361928302210826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17103698587660948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07171933119455733,0.16120722411867955,0.05625521318199165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06341750361613499,0.06993729024874952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24779649891646924,0.0,0.0,0.04470270611226313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03923577791509971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04568367402139269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16187672429731886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03968780520906103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512389079312938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449298549417657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Marz0n,2020/03/21,"Going home to family or living alone. I’m a college student living in an apartment in NYC. My roommates have now all gone home to their families, for an indefinite amount of time. Leaving me entirely alone...

Living alone for potentially weeks/months seems extremely lonely, especially considering I will be social distancing and won’t be seeing friends at all. I will be online with friends on voice chats, so I guess that would help a bit if I do stay. 

Because of this was also looking to go home via bus to my family. Normally I’d be okay waiting, but I’m worried that nyc might go under full quarantine and I would be stuck here. 

From what I’m reading, traveling is exactly what I shouldn’t be doing. So I’m questioning my decision and was looking for some advice.

COVID19_support,ironyis4suckerz,2020/03/21,"How can we help our fellow citizens financially during this health crisis? I was wondering if we could start a thread that gives ideas on how to help our fellow citizens in a financial way during this crisis. For example, bands can’t tour, so we can buy their records instead. Pet sitters aren’t walking dogs (everyone is home now and they don’t need the sitters) so we can pay them for a “virtual” visit (even a few bucks). Restaurants are doing take out. What else??

COVID19_support,warriorpriest,2020/03/21,"Can't be in two places at same time. Worried about remote family. Stressing. How to cope.

I live 7-9 hours away from an elderly parent who also takes care of her mildly mentally handicapped son (my bro).    My job so far is safe in that im not in services industry and worst comes to worst I have an emergency fund that could keep me going for a few months I think.

But I'm torn, I worry about them alone in the home since she just went through some major medical issues that she's still fighting anxiety/panic/depression etc..    We have some cousins and family dropping in, picking up groceries, etc.. but it still feels like I'm the  main son who should be doing more.   Like should I pack up and ride it out caring for a parent?  I can't just drive that every day to check in on them.

But I have my own life here that I can't really risk giving up and losing my job as I'm still like the ""financial failsafe"" for them if it all goes wrong.   And this cough I'm coming down with isn't helping.   It feels like I should be in two places a world apart and it's starting to get to me.

&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr  - im hundreds of miles away from a parent that I worry about.   I can't be in two places at once.  My head knows this, but my heart doesn't.",2.235745907738096,3.7067148476562513,3.4533482142857146,92.01635416666667,76.3046875,6.7511904761904775,21.17485119047619,7.447530270364453,0.5020366815476187,955,23,214,12,21,310,144,256,0.13,0.7759999999999999,0.094,-0.6221,5,1,0,0,2,0,36.0,1,0,3,1,12,14,1,2,9,0,19,5,2,2,1,35,38,15,0,5,8,7,2,4,0,3,3,0,1,0,15,11,0,2,4,0,2,6,7,7,0,3,1,2,26,7,36,29,13,40,0,1,0,0,19,25,0,3,12,141,41,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09869668945851184,0.0,0.07620722953644539,0.0,0.10325189279426758,0.11579363138527905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17906523217538578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1943188309634669,0.0,0.0,0.1641760911691526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608515597718707,0.0,0.0,0.06145727246230726,0.0,0.08207728496423583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125578186870424,0.0,0.0,0.0802899921011494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1796709420879811,0.0,0.09636784402411804,0.13615727048616855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04978760795692663,0.09141547039746756,0.054158239725758194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09779997327098117,0.0,0.0,0.1129248152092086,0.06387410610966962,0.0,0.0955884698235774,0.0,0.09384619760122544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20586950685234032,0.09946302902492793,0.1891308003302205,0.08470241055998423,0.0,0.0,0.052371538431058656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730954639913397,0.1862249333298042,0.0,0.08414706797967644,0.0,0.0,0.10661052308893884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959995011059918,0.0960347604569996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606341257667318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10148586843470524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11180793358914758,0.3174408457373298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29868839922961404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06104829898065145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882885614156522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745016089961961,0.0,0.2283076882973443,0.0,0.10915988920223584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07164984167943853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06106106994454121,0.0,0.0,0.05556717326606729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792675636329645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833924869818452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29032953262074146,0.0,0.0,0.10418992113238897,0.11579363138527905,0.0

I work at a grocery store right now and lost my other ob i had a t a movie theater. I am scared and starting to have suicidal thoughts. the questions i had are:

1. Would it be ok to still see my therapist? I really need someone to talk to, possibly get me back on anti depressants.
2. 3 of my friends want me to come over to here place to play DnD. None of us are sick or showing symptoms. Probably a bad idea, right?
3. I am most afraid of Economic/Societal collapse because of the Corona virus.

I can go more in depth in the comments if anybody would like. I'm sleep deprived so sorry if this is formatted weird.

COVID19_support,vieuxfort73,2020/03/21,"Degrees of separation for exposure? I work in construction in NY (Hudson Valley).  All my jobs are still open, we’ve been deemed essential.  Yesterday I heard that a foreman on one of my jobs wife tested positive.  I don’t think he has been tested yet.  I have not seen him  in 2-3 weeks, but I saw his super on Monday for about 30 minutes.  He was in contact with the foreman on a daily basis.

I’m not as generally concerned about my health per se, but ramification since I have a 1 year old and a 3 year old.

I also have an 87 year old mother who is now not supposed to leave the house.

Can’t find any info on a few degrees of separation for exposure.

I would like some outside perspective on this. On Wednesday night my temperature went from 36.6 to 36.9 and it keeps going up and down, never past 37. I think this is stress fever. My anxiety is high, I am afraid for myself, my parents, my sister who is abroad, my friends, my boyfriend who lives alone in another city, my best friend's dad who has cancer. I can't stop reading news and I can't get it out of my mind for more than 10 minutes. Today I went for a walk, it felt good but know I feel like I have a little shortness of breath, even though I can breathe fine. 

This psychosomatic symptoms are messing me up!!! I want things to go back to normal and I will never complain again about anything. I am an anxious person in general but I thought I had it under control...

If you need a list of telemedicine providers, there is one on page 26 of this whitepaper: [https://www.ziegler.com/z-media/4685/ziegler\_telehealth\_iii\_whitepaper\_spreads.pdf](https://www.ziegler.com/z-media/4685/ziegler_telehealth_iii_whitepaper_spreads.pdf)",32.68166666666667,41.13271401851853,10.8712962962963,41.16583333333338,10.666666666666657,9.103703703703703,50.53703703703704,9.516144504307137,5.737014814814812,543,20,37,5,4,97,47,54,0.0,0.898,0.102,0.6887,0,0,0,0,0,0,66.0,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,3,3,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,6,5,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,2,0,21,5,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12837461990163854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8831002848341599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684599188064019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3348999176950434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320535807955932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259415494240772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09800533264617893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16017208109010034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Sweatygatsby,2020/03/21,"Anyone willing to calm me down? I’m from upstate NY - Saratoga County. We’ve been in our home since the 13th, on the 13th we picked up groceries at our local store as a drive up and brought them home. So like I’ve said, we’ve been home since then. 

Yesterday morning I woke up with a sore throat on one side of my throat (the right) and also an itchy ear canal on the right. I have a cough - not a bad one and it comes and goes. There’s mucus though- just a little bit. It’s more like I have to clear my throat a lot. 

No fever or aches or chest issues (knock on wood) -
So the chances of me having the virus are extremely slim right? I’m only worried because I have a mother in our home with a low immune system and two newborns. 

I do tend to get swollen tonsils a lot btw so I’m thinking theyre more than likely swollen again and I might have tonsillitis. 

If I did have it - others in my household especially my mother would be showing symptoms already too, right? 

I’m sorry if I’m being a worry wart and this is annoying - I’m just so scared and I wish I knew how to calm myself.",1.3946249473240613,3.226197800884957,2.7567003792667504,94.46653392330387,79.84070796460176,5.189717656974294,21.38137378845344,5.916634753146586,0.009655962916140126,837,24,188,5,21,271,132,226,0.109,0.789,0.10300000000000001,0.1721,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,4,0,1,0,12,9,1,1,17,0,17,13,5,2,1,29,32,21,0,4,7,2,0,3,0,3,8,2,4,1,5,12,0,0,2,1,1,3,2,4,0,3,7,2,21,5,23,20,5,27,0,1,0,0,9,20,0,7,6,117,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432745737796209,0.10382785957825202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078265141173224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10840560837953747,0.07914533962482814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14174463260036252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11184012490484886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06783268200580173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5209346295627221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13551251598628206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902903734857201,0.1301273463405482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207597178271345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13773290107972658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17595717524606197,0.09874428103929833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4435086399042403,0.12350145732070633,0.0,0.12998605391652962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.214799342686154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145338052763512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13494679233979687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319210965237465,0.1275608240080683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12682853301460525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1493021988186448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2637045866271753,0.0,0.09223004351552452,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,bibambop,2020/03/21,"my roommate won't quarantine effectively She did well by staying home for a full 5 days (and she even made a big stink of me just going to the grocery store to get more food), but today she decided to go visit a friend (and use public transportation).

I have been a practicing germaphobe way before this crisis, so I know how to come into the apartment and not touch things until I wash my hands. However, most people don't think about that. They will come home, touch a million and one things, wash their hands and don't realize that they already spread the germs around, so they won't even think the disinfect the areas they touched before they washed their hands.

My brain is going on hypedrive right now because I bet you my roommate won't get sick if she gets the virus, but I definitely will and I will definitely need to be hospitalized because she just ""had to go to dinner with a friend"" even though my city is under quarantine and there is now a fine for us doing things that are not important.

...sigh, I just wish I wasn't afraid of death, I guess... but I really am.",7.225502392344499,6.555240354066989,6.83818181818182,79.87727272727273,64.11961722488039,10.279425837320575,30.961722488038287,9.573946990214177,2.4895990430622006,850,25,170,14,11,266,121,209,0.057,0.8,0.14300000000000002,0.9613,1,2,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,1,7,1,16,7,0,1,13,0,20,10,4,4,0,35,37,16,1,3,9,0,6,0,2,6,4,0,2,0,7,12,2,0,6,0,2,8,8,2,2,2,5,7,30,4,19,25,3,24,0,0,0,0,18,9,0,4,5,121,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15755507275438285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12709946337854827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17406786722591264,0.0,0.2429809540234795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593834204486447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24597496333643395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920776602306732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2829033837903797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1726433405739296,0.0,0.22061425540061175,0.0,0.22378115390497488,0.0,0.32456786943925464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15728207022064486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2864286778032155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784650624443222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350965654495443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10586538972778994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09674761130398228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989817744235693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914649203582626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192853585939115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15217848665962946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845588512516954,0.1829681086196307,0.14027509820489106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13533341301454185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17173999337889462,0.12331121871806895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11332765301026955,0.0,0.0,0.12837130933840882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16418348473640212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My sister won't even consider quitting her job at a grocery store even though our dad is diabetic with major heart complications. She gets mad at me for even proposing the idea.

COVID19_support,gothorsesintheback,2020/03/21,"I'm a hypochondriac and have anxiety, and I'm not handling all of this very well. I just wanted to make a post in hopes folks will read it and talk some sense into my head. I've been having really bad anxiety and it's been hard to eat, sleep, and work. I'm a hypochondriac and have what I hope are allergies: a cough, post nasal drip, sneezing occasionally, and I've also been having really bad headaches, chest pains, and diarrhea, which I think at this point is from stress and anxiety. But I've still been taking my temperature 20 times a day, because I can't not think about catching coronavirus. I'm not in a danger group, i'm healthy, and I'm young (25M), but I'm still terrified of getting this. I keep reading more and more articles on here about younger people getting super ill and drying, and because of my irrational fears I keep thinking the worst is going to happen to me.

I was even on an upswing over the last couple days, I felt good enough to go out to the dispensary today to get some edibles as it's one of the only things that calms me down (I'm in California). The only reason I was okay going was because they had curbside pickup and had sent emails outlining good distancing procedures they were using. They didn't follow anything on their email. I rolled my window down to talk to the delivery girl, and she just came right up to my window (the email said they'd stay 6 feet back), probably within 2-3 feet of me, and handed me a bag. I came home and washed my hands thoroughly and then took a shower and put on clean clothes. Now I can't stop worrying that she may have been asymptomatic and infected me.

This is all just too much, and I don't know how to cope with all this anxiety and stress. And what if I do get sick, the hospitals here in California are going to be way overrun with in a week. If I get sick and need to go to the hospital I'd probably just end up dying.",6.542284595300258,5.620897033942561,7.098343342036554,78.27921214099219,65.60574412532637,11.002036553524803,31.682637075718013,10.355215969177356,2.930874778067885,1496,48,309,32,20,494,199,383,0.13699999999999998,0.772,0.091,-0.9605,1,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,0,0,5,2,17,16,1,3,19,1,30,16,8,4,3,63,69,32,1,6,11,0,4,0,0,2,7,1,5,1,14,30,1,3,6,2,0,12,7,8,1,1,18,6,33,8,43,47,10,50,0,0,0,0,16,20,0,7,14,196,47,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561599334098087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28933877238754485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07781111383246593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07270733731516316,0.15789977361854596,0.17292045213154614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21629258752978936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10462385418553627,0.0,0.12196094080659935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09813367302354556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09675387482489443,0.0,0.0,0.08374810096481823,0.09770110022358766,0.0,0.062453011146619324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10640121726624872,0.0,0.0,0.09078810126226478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24700671147833025,0.0,0.2686903276351014,0.15861732222418468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361510991007076,0.0,0.0847031488573094,0.0,0.09704121475863277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09484686875012888,0.1878298787994669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16809053292786966,0.0,0.0,0.051965225941798115,0.07707534669456749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06311652560496248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950916682042789,0.07011169972017524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06407324896106667,0.14382742604647708,0.10061371087841547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06555287298331933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0893855036267647,0.0,0.18111604888638025,0.0,0.20389362740483225,0.0,0.0,0.09505438655419757,0.0,0.0,0.18916216149524764,0.0,0.12114933969595322,0.09721879467877746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08074987411348676,0.0899439265366505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462377953442308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078357419724177,0.15102427720658282,0.07905262580222118,0.2166259948098747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710939629254428,0.15200024664911496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06281846781394226,0.1817620251938748,0.0,0.0,0.05513606818175459,0.0,0.08962755098507201,0.0,0.10505463152462373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816655864690084,0.0,0.0780181841202444,0.0557712794359776,0.07505374890017047,0.07584671273526435,0.0,0.08501674358506267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883752482766155,0.09602569265794307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,PussySmith,2020/03/21,"I need help I’m having some dark feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.
I’m far better prepared to weather this storm than most, and yet I feel incredibly guilty to have brought a child into the hellscape that 2020 is becoming.

It’s irrational, we could have never known what was coming, but I had an ethical crisis when we got pregnant in the first place. Does the world really need more people? What opportunities will be available to her? Will she survive the pandemic? If so will it be followed by a life that seems to be becoming more dystopian every year?

She’s only three weeks old, and I’m terrified for her safety to the point where I feel like it is limiting my ability to bond with her.
I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression in the past, with great success. I’m highly distrustful of anti depressants, but none of the non pharmacological tools I learned from my prior experience seem to be applicable.

I can’t get out and force myself to socialize. My hobby is photography, specifically astrophotography. I don’t feel safe leaving my wife &amp; child at home to drive up into the mountains because what if something happens? She gets a fever? My depression deepens in further isolation?

I’ve turned to a professional before, and she’s great, but no one is taking this seriously in my area and I fear she would write me off as losing touch with reality. Irrational about the pandemic is the one thing I don’t feel. I’m surrounded by high risk individuals.
I thought going back to work from paternity leave would help, getting out of the house and being more productive. It hasn’t. I work with the elderly and I’m nearly as concerned for them as my family. I live in simultaneous fear that I’ll take the virus to work, or bring it home with me. Nowhere feels safe anymore.

My wife is great. I’m going to talk to her tonight, but I fear she won’t relate to a lot of my feelings.

I just don’t know where to turn, because everything I’ve learned about how to deal with this is upside down. I can’t even self medicate with cannabis for temporary relief anymore. It amplifies everything to 11, where historically it has had the opposite effect.

I need to take a break from reddit. That much I know, but I can’t just forget the things I know.

COVID19_support,pekoe-G,2020/03/21,"Worked with someone who may have Covid I work in a restaurant, and as of the 16th dine-in service was banned city wide. Aside from taking my dog for walks, and a quick stop at the grocery store I've been staying in. 

A coworker, who has been sick for a couple months, just sent out a message. Her best friend has tested positive for Covid; so my coworker went to get tested as well. She wasn't presenting all symptoms (primarily fever) she was refused. 

I last worked with her on the 11th or 12th, I can't remember exactly, but it was slow and I was cut two hours into the shift. So at least my contact with her has been very limited,so overall my chances are low.

I have no symptoms, and feel in good health. But I know people can be carriers without realizing it. 

I'm just really unclear what I should be doing aside from the self quarantine, luckily I live alone. If my coworker was turned away from testing then surely I will. Everyone says it can take 14 days for symptoms to show, but are you still contagious after those two weeks? Where do I go from here?",4.365977564102565,5.613170437500003,4.908384615384616,84.56994871794873,70.58653846153847,8.623589743589745,28.77051282051282,9.029198982220553,2.223843205128205,833,31,168,16,15,266,134,208,0.113,0.782,0.106,0.3117,0,2,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,0,4,9,7,1,0,10,0,26,6,0,0,3,30,36,14,0,2,8,0,1,0,1,3,6,1,0,1,7,9,0,3,4,1,1,5,4,2,1,2,11,2,21,5,27,20,3,30,0,1,0,0,15,12,0,4,12,116,28,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528808760368682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386857538632327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549090400794297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16332918822391582,0.0,0.0951971307692502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14104900267641388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07463675072092729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404418872242696,0.0,0.07712085544099932,0.0,0.08389095094591913,0.12380942510101516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15690399803578378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453674786937551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08112335599771478,0.12032297897739752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034355599206346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117821998011025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023351473089887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09456363207244063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16721492238043173,0.0,0.0,0.11738649684239374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539908658318956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12507064621833286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15733409448622593,0.11788264153656484,0.12340972620210287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13912198203514134,0.46027424052202,0.22197077984991692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16055879756682898,0.2883897458035583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12179485049811065,0.0,0.0,0.11840494805835435,0.0,0.13272036117656927,0.1368372313551038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422921061647492,0.0,0.32238853568252296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

One of the silver linings to this difficult time is the beautiful art being created. I wrote this song while stuck visiting a friend in an unfamiliar city as everything shut down around us - if you have the ability to make art, or even just the desire, now is the time to pour your hopes and fears into something bigger than yourself. Art connects us. Art brings us together across wide distances and across cultures. Thank you for watching and thank you for making art with me.",8.461135531135529,10.096911395604401,6.922802197802199,72.44303113553114,61.41758241758242,10.462271062271064,33.84798534798535,10.504223727775694,3.7666908424908434,431,17,68,10,6,128,69,91,0.071,0.725,0.204,0.922,0,1,1,0,0,0,13.0,3,4,0,0,4,6,0,1,7,0,4,0,0,2,0,14,12,7,0,3,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,6,0,0,0,6,0,2,0,2,0,1,2,3,9,4,15,9,0,15,0,0,2,0,11,9,0,3,4,47,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763124769451459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308145998583964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17800061490146238,0.0,0.0,0.22286888022826853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1530181355024348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967150181031216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2644088055924694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342083635453831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15247374414569498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3646880477858749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309769397676805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7147135672711223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,TheMasterQuest,2020/03/21,"Dreading going back to work, no longer feel connected to anyone there I’ve been preparing for this outbreak since January. I’ve attempted to talk to and warn my coworkers for months and no one cared. Keep in mind I considered these people my friends and besides my husband, the people I spend the most time with. As things started to escalate their behavior got worse. Going to concerts. Making jokes. Telling me I “need to get off reddit” when I asked my boss if he had plans for our job site in the event of lockdown. Acting like work from home is a massive inconvenience and continuing going into the office for stupid reasons and socializing with each other. I realized none of these people are my friends or people I even respect. I feel like they all died/are dead to me. I know that’s dramatic but I feel like I’m grieving a huge loss and feel so sad and alone. I don’t really have any friends. But that’s better than a bunch of selfish friends. I’m dreading the day we go back to work because I have nothing to say to these people and have to be polite for the sake of my job. I’m so irritated and confused and mad. Above all else, they are putting others in danger and I hate them for it.",3.4097881355932174,5.335776504237291,4.2620000000000005,85.52325423728814,74.21186440677965,7.262372881355933,27.0542372881356,8.07648339933343,1.7291040677966103,949,36,186,15,20,305,140,236,0.22699999999999998,0.659,0.114,-0.9872,2,2,0,0,0,0,20.0,2,0,4,7,7,22,4,3,9,0,10,0,0,3,2,36,31,19,2,2,4,1,4,3,4,0,0,2,1,0,10,16,0,1,7,2,1,6,4,11,0,1,3,6,26,11,32,27,6,22,0,3,0,0,17,7,0,4,12,118,36,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12440250686716915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168205080215107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08398692513053156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1122909420782142,0.0,0.0,0.18472143514940595,0.0,0.07322074878991572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10623160775882408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12246484576118764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746398386283769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10034034031835676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07933456425724067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2429342147899313,0.17161979666795998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37120098572122456,0.0,0.06275492394671532,0.0,0.2730555939155212,0.0,0.09606662288082317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11858830575534353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048474309412847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.238390424399836,0.10676338050612767,0.0,0.0,0.0660118460412261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17604578741066212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801774320303806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12128151096280601,0.0,0.09587433233398933,0.0,0.0,0.08906345818260357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11525320370735002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139276543349003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4163617188715327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12074835463597647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07694849214128849,0.1234978197504007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551995552424207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09936004309044652,0.0,0.0,0.12244171415337585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501773616260777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654357022586417,0.10498545967410586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07979880681215773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07003979253758999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26233459058979924,0.0,0.12240704491734206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,4amsolitude,2020/03/21,"Where should I ""flee"" to? If this is jumbled, I am sorry. I'm confused, overwhelmed and don't know what to do. I think I need an uninvolved opinion.

I'm in university and I live in a very small apartment without a view or a balcony, in an 80-party house. In case of a curfew I might not even be able to take the trash out. And there is speculation about a curfew being implemented on Monday here in Germany.I am suffering from multiple mental conditions and I don't think spending 2+ weeks on less than 20sqm would be something I would survive unharmed.

Now I have two options to stay for longer time - I could move to my boyfriend (who lives in a house with his mom, who is older so a bit riskier) or I could go to my family, where my grandpa also lives (who is high risk).I'm quite torn about what I should do. Obviously there are downsides to either one. In either case, my bf or my mom would get me with a car.

Pro for staying with bf: Is closer, only one I saw since isolation began (so we'd have infected each other by now), I'd have someone to cuddle, I really don't not want to see him for so longCons: We are already a bit in a though spot rn and this would either make or break us, I can't keep a structure staying with him, I'd have no privacy

Pros for staying with family: I already miss them, I'd have privacy and be able to keep a structure better there, there's a dog, the house is bigger so more space to move aroundCons: My grandpa is extremely high risk (and I currently have a cold - no fever, cough isn't dry), but could be asymptomatic and bring the illness upon people I haven't yet and potentially kill my family (that's my anxiety speaking but yknow), I wouldn't see any peers, esp not my boyfriend, it's way farther away.

COVID19_support,gvinpi,2020/03/22,"I'm stuck in another country and unable to return home due to COVID-19 outbreak I just want to get this off my chest, despite mentioning this in a couple of subreddits...
I'm Swiss-Serbian. I've been living in Switzerland since I was 12 and I've came to Serbia to visit my dad in february, as I normally do twice a year.
Nevertheless, that was supposted to be a short visit, but coronavirus changed all of that.
To make a long story short, I was unable to return home  to Switzerland and now I'm stuck in Serbia. 
At first, I kinda felt safe, because Serbia had 5 cases and Switzerland had much more (and still has)... I'm with my father and my boss told me not to worry, since he won't fire me. Nevertheless, I started getting worried and to miss my fiancé and friends back in Switzerland as the situation got out of controll. Also, despite having lower number of cases, Serbia started to crack down on  the epidemic, by shutting everything down, imposing a strict curfew etc. I support this, but it's tiring.
I'm happy to be with my father, but I'm in a country that I've not lived in for the past 10 years, stuck without most of my stuff (I've packed for a two-week trip) and my fiancé, my job, friends, space that I'm adjusted to etc. had all been left behind until further notice. I don't know how to feel about this, since these are very strange times... In one hand, I've ""escaped"" a country which now has a very high number of cases, and in the other, I've left everything behind and I'm in a country which implemented much stricter measures... at least I'm with my dad.",5.397329497376879,5.665235424437302,6.198185818243362,79.77860890167544,67.7459807073955,8.605246234557455,31.15941783719749,8.371475516178862,2.2942758842443727,1231,46,236,16,19,406,154,311,0.059000000000000004,0.83,0.111,0.9669,3,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,0,0,0,2,8,6,0,0,14,0,17,3,2,4,2,38,43,19,0,2,7,4,4,0,2,1,1,0,2,0,14,16,0,2,4,0,0,4,5,1,0,3,15,4,20,5,52,25,9,46,0,1,0,0,11,26,0,2,16,152,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949907717546546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12455439737774755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09133684262599352,0.0,0.07240905208183084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13585617874261832,0.0,0.0,0.12565672950869214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13322530434549254,0.0,0.13143119879699275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649490259964369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21350911387300628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06006028517153554,0.0,0.11405036717765865,0.0,0.0,0.10103681184449874,0.0,0.0,0.18354299807172209,0.0,0.12411849459465965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500166570901213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12644677824561207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255008266303119,0.2382981923006581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787386049345365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06528006442178373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581162888035577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20977523987952296,0.10511927197218042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928861624090422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1746384358272275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11638218071372568,0.0,0.13523530335930933,0.0,0.0,0.08049047693117158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133918732487655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2947757290340617,0.1335171384868889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1681505252927831,0.0,0.09486030673994517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13597818737478762,0.0,0.13479361109816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06926335867181753,0.136523656058008,0.0,0.113502306063423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160337917058587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960169322132618,0.07006132752205523,0.0,0.09528060744090848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11450263297055635,0.0,0.0,0.2412599306266009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15298479492597716
COVID19_support,georgeroyde,2020/03/22,Worried about money and food I've been up all night worrying about not having enough food. I'm still in education so don't work and my parents are pretty much on zero hour contracts. Dad still has a bit of work but not much and mum's work as a cleaner has completely stopped. We have a bit of food which we managed to get with the little  savings we had but dad spent most of our money stupidly panic buying items that don't even make full meals or would last long. He did this without mine or my mum's knowledge one day when we were busy with something else. We don't have much savings left and have no idea when we will get money in and if we end up in a long lockdown situation (anything more than approx. 3 weeks) we would most likely be without food. It's seriously stressing me out. I can't even talk to my parents about my concerns because my dad is believing extreme doomsday stuff so it's hard to get a sensible conversation out of him and mum's depression is getting worse and worse by the day (she was almost at a stable level before this whole thing). I'm trying to keep a level head for all of us but I know that the social isolation is really going to start effecting my mental health soon (since there's no ease up on negativity). I'm also worried that we'll be out of gas and electricity in no time because we're on a meter. Any positivity or advice would help greatly.

COVID19_support,mpholt,2020/03/22,"Taking care of a dog of a PA friend while having immune system issues? Hi all,
I often take care of a dog for a friend who is a PA. However, I’ve had immune system related issues for about 8 years (doctor said it was chronic Epstein Barr, although I know that falls into the CFS family of issues, but know how it has impacted me for the last 8 years). 

Due to this, I told her I’d only take care of the dog for now if I could give it a bath (due to her high risk nature and the possibility of transmission via the dog fur, coupled with my existing immune issues). 

This kind of upset her but with so much unknown I thought it’s be better to play it safe. 

Am I being unreasonable here do you think?",4.199791666666666,4.358599951388889,5.973611111111111,80.7325,70.31944444444444,8.622222222222224,25.027777777777786,8.515128840125781,1.5027694444444446,539,13,112,8,9,187,90,144,0.043,0.758,0.19899999999999998,0.9655,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,0,1,6,11,0,2,11,0,10,5,0,1,1,16,23,8,0,2,3,2,0,0,2,0,5,1,1,0,9,4,0,1,4,2,0,1,0,2,0,0,5,1,12,9,18,15,2,12,0,0,0,0,13,2,0,2,7,73,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12415723009134486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42938904025040064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208428931072413,0.15533096260554022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14368780402072628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13234046506888794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2169188962053333,0.0,0.0,0.13466802952441692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832219736797686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5860929258944333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14618714424316925,0.15430149520662145,0.11443076618064416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10319755352330312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10676748964561156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582605798428249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335362456126315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31665131578124195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08995166719955705,0.0,0.11144830858799316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13414183709921038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18080391624950254
COVID19_support,hnida92,2020/03/22,"I am terrified of this virus Hello guys,

I really need to talk to someone about how I am feeling since I don't want my family to worry. 

So I travelled to germany on March 7th and returned home March 14th. I was very much aware of the situation and tried my best to be safe, washed my hands and all that. When I came back I isolated myself from everyone and haven't been out since. 
The problem is that 3 days ago I started to feel some chest pressure. I still can breathe but I feel like my chest is heavy. It is very uncomfortable but I can't say that it hurts. I don't have a fever or a cough. I am just feeling tired and worrying that the virus is in my lunges. Should I worry ? Could be just stress ? Or maybe it's because I haven't been out for a week which is very unusual for me. I have a lot on my mind right now and I am very very anxious. What do you think ?

COVID19_support,HealingPoverty,2020/03/22,"This virus is fucking with my life, hear me out? My girlfriend is an asthmatic nurse in the bio containment unit of a very large hospital. They're running out of supplies and I'm freaking out.
I live at home with my mother who constantly finds a reason to leave the house or have her boomer friends over to hang out. No one is listening to me and a majority of said boomers are convinced that this is nothing to worry about, it's all a hoax to impeach trump. And the Italian death rates? FAKE. NEWS. I cant. I just cant. Fuck. 
I'm supposed to be studying for my medical coding certification but how the fuck can I focus on anything when a global pandemic is coming to take my girlfriend away? Or that the global economy is about to go into free fall? I find myself going to work , laying in bed and comfort eating trying to avoid all of this...I'm waiting for my state to enact shelter in place orders, but my company has already deemed themselves essential and will stay open, I'm already planning on not showing up so I'm going to lose my job. This wasnt supposed to fucking happen. I'm supposed to be planning dates with my girlfriend, going to museums with her, going river tubing, cuddling on the sofa all that.

COVID19_support,cleanup987,2020/03/22,"I'm about to lose it Thank you so much for this sub, first of all. I really need it right now.

I think I'm having a panic attack and I'm having trouble breathing and catching my breath. Like, I can't breathe deep enough in to satisfy my lungs. It's getting exacerbated by reading more and more things about COVID. I'm pretty sure it's just a panic attack. And normally what you do for one of those is to breathe deeply, but I can't do that very well.

I'm diabetic so getting COVID-19 would likely be serious for me.

What should I do?

COVID19_support,julesjules76,2020/03/22,"I'm just feeling sad and discouraged. That's all. Hello everyone... I'm hoping I don't sound too selfish writing this. Of course I'm worried about my family's health, as well as everyone else's around the world as we literally witness a chapter in a history textbook unfold before our very eyes. But I'm just feeling down about this whole situation.

I'm 17 and have a history of anxiety and depression. I left my public high school in freshman year to do online school because my mental health was so crippling. It was good at first but I quickly became very isolated. I have no friends. I don't go out much at all. I don't get invited anywhere. This past fall I finally built up the courage to apply to college to live on campus and finally be able to make friends and become a member of society again. Now this virus has taken over and I'm just feeling a little sad because I'm worried I'll have to spend another semester at home without having any sort of socialization. It's just that this was the first time I have felt truly excited about getting out into the world and now I feel like it's just been taken away from me. I hope it doesn't last long enough to deter me from this next chapter of my life that I was so happily anticipating :(",4.3368727598566315,5.618554282258066,5.6752688172043015,78.91345878136202,70.69354838709677,8.898207885304663,31.11648745519713,9.2995712137729,2.837112186379928,994,43,188,21,18,334,138,248,0.10300000000000001,0.728,0.17,0.9553,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,2,0,0,2,17,14,0,0,9,0,17,4,1,1,2,33,37,14,0,2,8,0,5,1,2,0,3,1,1,0,13,12,0,1,5,0,1,2,6,5,1,2,8,7,19,9,35,28,5,35,0,4,1,0,8,19,0,3,15,123,32,5,0.11970028848339515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08140030086650198,0.12551618933525727,0.0915703930557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10655863468509703,0.0,0.0,0.11246236132269484,0.0,0.0,0.14593636968313586,0.13219956425586554,0.10185612915653856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309768307219733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09999423142233772,0.0,0.0,0.1236823959073849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2287575105781071,0.0,0.0,0.11284277892928145,0.0,0.24209624979380484,0.08551391000978603,0.11493104845597454,0.2622516302593639,0.0,0.2036340084701104,0.0,0.0,0.18496029190573446,0.0,0.12507692057071987,0.0,0.06802843243934405,0.1003989228381509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544716184400225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264699267845825,0.12006914911380967,0.23777879041021416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757171129865083,0.0,0.0,0.13005471367552604,0.0,0.08454785371391196,0.0584795146578713,0.11997113545446444,0.105697547741784,0.1059309885593957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07990087205063931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12062973698294673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799348492701073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273026147722561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11426746972736168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24228616487720814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13454813950082295,0.0,0.12201936989604276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06979820081888866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1975305480542721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10762493477331106,0.0,0.0,0.13364109734796828,0.0,0.11538680658323723,0.0,0.0,0.24312290669032255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07708306125519031

COVID19_support,Serpente-Azul,2020/03/22,"How to handle the virus when it hits (just fought out my battle and passing on my experience) Ok, I was showing mild signs of a cold for about 4 days, first symptoms were super easy going.

I occasionally experienced mild disorientation and confusion, and a little difficulty breathing, but not anything to report.

When it hit me, a lot of those mild symptoms remained the same, and didn't escalate. So I retained a feeling that I wasn't ""really sick"".

And as I was chatting to a friend over messenger, I suddenly couldn't type or respond to say ""I'm fine"". I became confused, dizzy, disoriented, I waded through options in a confused haze, not wanting to call an ambulance because I didn't want to create a fuss. But I did a test online that was set up by the health services and it said ""contact this number immediately"". I had every symptom except a fever (I had severe chills, traumatic shortness of breath, and disorientation and was barely conscious).

I called the ambulance and realised I could barely speak more than a few words without losing my breath. My voice was distorted by how weak my breath was. The ambulance said they would take an hour and I was like ""nice, thank you"".

I sat and waited, and began having even more trouble with my breathing, to the point I woke up a friend of mine to watch me in case I passed out. I at this time could not breathe very well at all, and was scared that if I lost consciousness I might not be able to regulate my breathing (because breathing required a lot of effort, and if you can imagine that when you are passed out you breathe a lot more passively).

I sat still and tried to stay conscious, and began stopping responding to verbal stimuli. So was on the middle of the consciousness spectrum between needing to be prompted with pain to respond. The pain was in my chest, and felt similar to how I might imagine a heart attack or stroke. My friend called the ambulance to arrive quicker.

40 minutes after calling they arrived, and put a kit down on the table full of gear and instruments and put electrodes over my chest and kept me talking. At one point I didn't respond for a few sentences, and constantly lost my train of thought, unable to respond very well.

My blood pressure was 132/91 and my heart beat was 125bpm. I now believe it was that high to increase oxygen flow (because later on as I recovered, the oxygen level in my blood was less as my heart rate went down). So at this point I had no fever but extreme chills, I was rather extremely shaking from chills, and clamminess. They found my blood sugar was low (hyperglycemia) aswell which was weird as I ate well the night before and don't have diabetes of any kind and am in good shape at 33.

Basically my readings were borderline (though it doesn't feel borderline!). And they said that due to my age its probably better not to go into hospital and weather it out, and I was like ""so, explain to me why I can't breathe"" and we went through everything to the point it was clear that it wasn't yet pnemonia (as it would not come on that sudden) and that currently there wasn't liquid in the lungs, and I was getting decent oxygen. Seems fine right?

Well, I slightly recovered after that first hour, and I let the medics go and decided that if it hit me again hard like that I'd go in, but for now I'd tackle it on my own.

But, it came and went in waves. I believe my body kept releasing endorphins or hormones in waves, and when those hormones came on I became very calm, and then it would receed and the anxiety and feeling inside my body was so intense that I describe it like... I was fighting in a boxing match winded, getting hit to the body, and being forced to then swim in water with limited ability to breath. THEN fever hit, and chills, and violent cramps, and extreme feelings of anxiety and honestly wanting to scream or cry... Horrifying... like some saw movie.

BUT, I was conscious, and breathing, which was what I focused on. I focused on being calm, and held myself together. I sat upright to help my breathing, and drank apple juice, sodas, etc to make sure there were no other things compounding with it.

It felt like... a stroke or heart attack in how suddenly it hit and how little control I had over such a vital function as breathing. BUT if I was calm enough, if I kept my energy level up, I could maintain my hold on it. In the peak of it my face went red, and my friend almost called the ambulance again but I told him to give me a minute first. And I was violently shaking, but felt like... I felt like my body had ""spotted it"", and it felt like blood was rushing through my body at a far greater pressure and everything sort of fizzled and burned hot. And then it felt like the grip on my lungs released a bit.

By 14 30, I could breath half okay again and wasnt teetering on the edge of consciousness. It had begun at about 6 30 (when I was woken from my sleep by a clammy strange silent feeling).

And as I measured my heart rate as I recovered it came down to 95, then twenty minutes later 91, then later 87, then 85, then 83, then 75... and the hormone waves kept hitting through this time, so every so often I'd get knocked out like I was injected by a sedative, which relaxed me and improved my breathing but then everything got intense again.

Then, it washed away. I had to be careful and move slowly, but it slowly turned into what feels like larangitis.

My tips are this:

Peoples symptoms will be different, but if you have shortness of breath, that is the hardest part to deal with

If shortness of breath is sudden onset, try to keep calm and conscious and get someone to watch over you. Do a distil pulse test to check your blood oxygen saturation (some mobile phones can do this, but the paramedics have them too). If it is above 95% you are probably okay, lower and you might need a ventilator. I thought at the time that if you have difficulty breathing and are about to pass out, that this is because of low oxygen levels. I don't know what makes breathing so unbelievably hard, or what makes you nearly unconscious, but if you CAN stay conscious, do so, by regulating your breathing, staying calm. Make sure you have eaten, drunk, and the virus hasn't somehow strangely affected you. 

Continue to drink as it improves how much blood you have in you, and eat. (I mean I didn't want to, everything tasted horrible, and I wanted to throw it up, could barely taste or smell).

Stay in the moment, have a friend there if you can. Ride it out as controlled and without panic as you can.

I was prepared to keep feeling that way for a week, but luckily it stopped, then afterwards, all the pent up traumatic pain of it all came flooding out in an outpouring of emotion. If I wasn't such a tough guy I would have started sobbing for hours because of how utterly world shaking it was.

Explaining the feeling:

My condition was upper moderate, I am young

The feeling was not like a cold, flu, or normal virus

It felt to me, like a heart attack or stroke, or extremely severe anxiety attack mixed in with it.

It felt like a serious disease, like some tuberculosis craziness... horrible. Traumatizing.

Reiterating the tips:

Stay calm, have someone with you, try to keep conscious, maintain a pacing in breathing. Make sure you have eaten, drunk... and if you aren't sure, sugary liquids like apple juice, etc get absorbed quickest. Have tons of water.

You won't get pnemonia on the first day most likely, so don't panic. If your blood saturation is above 95 you probably dont need ventilators. If your heart rate is like 125, try to be calm, hopefully your body will kick in with endorphines or adrenalines and relax you in waves so you can better breathe.

Everyone's symptoms will be different. How should you deal with that? Get facts and help if you can.

Do not gaslight yourself that ""you are not sick"" if you are disoriented and short of breath, but also dont just react too quickly. Just get your friends aware, and have someone watch you, literally sit with you.

Do this and you can be okay.

Opinions:

This would be utterly terrible for an elderly person, like throwing them into a boxing ring with mike tyson. IF they get moderate or above symptoms, with the breathing troubles... It just hits SO HARD it can send you into some kind of shock.

Do not willingly catch it. I would go so far as showering after shopping trips, definately wearing masks, and definately washing hands. Don't stay near anyone that is like ""its just a cold"", don't russian roulette it. And don't carelessly go near elderly with it. It is one HELL of a trauma. Like I feel like a legitimately need a bit of therapy. That really really really hurt, like some alien constricting my lungs from within. Hard to describe as anything but like black magic grabbing my lungs to terrifying life and death levels.

But afterwards, there is some light. I feel it ""pushes over"" as much as it beats you to a pulp. A bit like the war of the worlds where suddenly the aliens just disappear. In fact that movie, describes it almost perfectly.

In the midst of corona virus pandemic, I drove around (California) and was surprised at the number of cars with windows open. Unless you have no A/C, it's time to keep the windows up -- to stop the spread.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's something you can post on your social media:

Drive Safe: Windows Up - Defend against the virus.

Or this image:

&amp;#x200B;

An exception to keeping windows open is ride-sharing; buses may be required to keep windows open.

Corona virus can potentially remain hours in the air.

The thing that has been playing on my mind isn't so much the virus itself, but more a feeling of being trapped, unable to go out, panicking that this lock down will last for months, and that my anxiety will get worse every day I am ""trapped"".  Getting anxious about anxiety, what a wonderful spiral!  I've also been experiencing anxiety about being bored, which seems like a very trivial thing to worry about in these strange times.

COVID19_support,citybyte,2020/03/22,"Being too scared to escape NYC I live in Brooklyn, which has the most cases out of all the boroughs of NYC. It's scaring the shit out of me considering I had an extensive history of childhood respiratory problems and seasonal asthma, despite otherwise being a healthy 21 year old female. 

My family living in central Florida has been asking me to come back, but so many factors make me question if I should return.

For one, air travel. Is it even safe anymore? Despite being only $18 for a one way ticket, I'm seriously terrified of even going near an airport. It's terrifying even going outside... so many people aren't taking this seriously, talking in groups and COUGHING ON EACH OTHER right in the streets and causally continuing their conversation, or kids playing tag and soccer in the park, not to mention the increase in race-related hate crimes and hostility (I'm Chinese)... wtf y'all

I'm also scared that I'm possibly asymptomatic and might be bringing it back home, infecting my dad in his 50s or my 19 y/o immunocompromised brother. Learning that males have a nearly 2x higher death rate made me rethink if I should even be in the same house as them. 

My mom is a respiratory therapist working in Florida, also in her 50s. I'm not on good terms with her and cut her out of my life in my teens, but yet I'm still deathly worried knowing she'll likely catch the virus and will be working without proper safety gear. My 29 y/o sister is a doctor as well, primarily working in the ICU. Even if she's young, I'm hearing cases of young doctors her age falling seriously ill just from being around so many infected patients. It just feels like my entire immediate family is all at a higher risk and it's doesn't feel fair at all.

It feels like there isn't really a right choice for me to make. I've been debating for days on if I should just buy the damn ticket or not, and I really wish all this bullshit would just blow over.",6.856285968933027,6.7333077887700545,7.793682200152791,70.90646167557935,64.6951871657754,10.4393175451999,35.18920295390883,10.07000556051586,3.5651053221288507,1539,65,274,31,21,521,211,374,0.21,0.737,0.053,-0.9967,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,1,2,3,22,20,5,4,19,0,27,9,1,3,4,58,50,26,2,10,17,4,3,3,0,7,8,1,1,2,13,17,0,1,7,5,1,8,7,13,1,2,4,4,29,7,44,32,9,52,0,0,0,0,23,28,2,10,18,183,42,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645488431303927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020309556819776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09158648427237953,0.0961804585244208,0.0,0.0,0.15821928290158907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08862343519073305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06635015566853593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106074647565737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3397618109652021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19397533439124734,0.0,0.15606016659044653,0.1469973484049584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116940029798486,0.08629225022124051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015743337092906,0.0,0.0,0.11595510131327405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031986874588577,0.0,0.0,0.1187116156061934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05654106647236324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266835482001174,0.15078833823173735,0.0,0.18169277079215174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09734910862641366,0.13734860592088152,0.31291754784551323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10914117668283814,0.0,0.12049374977917203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795698935735053,0.0,0.13943054275047356,0.07824613392185491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07132518490260202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159836066768577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09844384844483917,0.0,0.0,0.11525099809677035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13181724402591488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1757207408276934,0.0,0.0,0.3090074506293202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056065394223568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08216142181352112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07735420005781075,0.08269237642908472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11945352994254442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08166266822966416,0.0,0.0,0.09250296257136913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11830882478086754,0.09917424315360286,0.0,0.22469720836582333,0.10448131367134804,0.0,0.07308417521073603,0.0,0.0,0.0662524120938527

I was homeschooled from 5th - 10th grade, have attended public and private schools, and am now a teaching assistant in an MFA program in north Florida.

I've seen plenty of people worried about their kids' schooling this year, so I put together a step-by-step guide on how to homeschool. I hope this helps answer some questions, and I'll also be happy to field any questions/concerns in the comments!

I'm a university student at home with free time and I spend most of the time reading about coronavirus. It is making me feel really anxious.

I also see a spike in my temperature every night since 2-3 days(haven't measured just feel so) and have occasional coughing (2-3 times a day). 
Since the weather in my area is erratically chilly, when it should be warm, I'm really confused.

I’m a 25 year old male in Indiana and I’ve read stats that suggest that I wouldn’t get critically ill even in the event that I catch it.

COVID19_support,angolmois666,2020/03/22,"it's the uncertainty that gets to me the most Hi everyone. hope you're taking good care of yourselves.

I've noticed lately that, despite me being a massive hypochondriac, the main worry I have about this pandemic is that I don't know what will happen rather than me getting sick. I mean, it's something that a lot of people are going through right now.

For me though, I've noticed that it's been so hard to unwind with all of this going down. I have a hard time trying to keep my mind off of stressful situations, so usually my response is to try to tackle them head-on because I don't like to run away from my problems.

This time though, I feel like this has completely backfired. I'm absolutely consumed by all of this information. I don't know who or what to trust. I feel like I've been in a near-constant panic attack for the last week or so. I've been basically glued to the screen researching info about COVID-19. The further down the rabbit hole, the scarier and scarier it goes.

For a bit of context, I live in Washington state, so this has been on my mind for a bit. The nursing home where a bunch of people got infected was very close to where I grew up. But even then, I still had this ""it can't happen here"" level of denial about it all, which I'm really kicking myself for having. I'm one that follows a lot of global news, yet the complete shutdown of everything in such a short period of time utterly blindsided me.

I'm someone that really likes to carefully plan and schedule out most of my life. Now, I understand that sudden and foreseen schedule changes are a normal part of everyday life, and yet I still somewhat melt down whenever things change. So you can imagine that I'm basically almost completely unable to process ANY of this happening. Not only are classes online and a bunch of events that I was looking forward to postponed indefinitely, the fate of the jobs and housing of my friends and I is completely up in the air.

My brain has basically been on lockdown. I moved in back with my parents for an uncertain amount of time (may return here for the rest of the quarter/summer, not sure), and in that time I basically have spent most of my days researching stories and data about coronavirus. In all this research, it's so hard to tell what's bogus and what's not. Will we be on lockdown for 3 weeks or 18 months? Do we have medicine to help fight the coronavirus or does none of it work? Will the USA be another Italy or are the circumstances different enough? Will this be a relatively minor footnote within our history or will this be a mass generational trauma on par with WWII and the Great Depression?

In all of this, I'm trying to find optimism. Although I'm very upset that most of my life for the next few months (or even years) is up in the air, I think it snapped me out of a sense of complacency I had for a while that I took for granted. In all of this, we're really seeing the best come out of a lot of people. The problem is, I really haven't felt optimistic about any major political event in a while. My dad always told me ""hope for the best and expect the worst"" and usually the worst case scenario happens. 

I know that my problems ultimately aren't unique. This is really an unprecedented global tragedy in our modern era that's gonna shake off a lot of things we took for granted. In a way, I don't want to go back to ""normal"" after any of this; I'm hoping we'll take a lot of positive lessons away from this to plan for a better tomorrow. Ultimately, I'm paranoid though that we will take the exact OPPOSITE lessons than we should from all of this. Worse, I'm even more paranoid that the neglect from governments and industries will lead to a massive collapse of modern life as we know it, worse than 9/11, worse than the Recession, possibly even worse than the Spanish Flu if you factor in the economic aspects.

It could be possible that maybe none of this will ever happen. I have faith in humanity ultimately; I believe that most people have good intentions and act accordingly. But the problem is that its the uncertainty of this all that gets to me the most, on whether or not I or my loved ones have COVID, or how long these lockdowns will last, or if the society we'll wake up to once this is over will not be one worth saving. How does one be able to cope in all of this? I feel really alone and no one to really turn to right now. Thank you, Hope you are all taking care in these times. Apologies this got so long.",6.90573959770532,6.317182271899885,7.182100549463852,76.88100936751147,64.73378839590444,10.620782804444124,33.60542686321497,10.05092399709849,3.1184007503691333,3543,131,695,69,47,1153,356,879,0.13,0.7929999999999999,0.077,-0.9905,3,4,1,0,1,0,93.0,10,4,1,9,37,40,2,5,59,0,65,10,2,4,13,122,124,49,0,17,22,2,7,4,1,15,7,0,1,1,65,30,0,2,17,1,2,14,15,16,0,5,16,10,64,24,133,84,40,113,1,2,3,1,28,52,0,33,51,499,129,8,0.05271304074546471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052784495923623116,0.054594812790997316,0.0,0.0,0.043861472653877735,0.0,0.0,0.10754002594231593,0.05527421935631091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05996869374960944,0.09905127397511247,0.08106614910288144,0.0,0.03213338037368005,0.0,0.0,0.059389545812430965,0.11063816825238558,0.046620400859544456,0.1150979758723821,0.0,0.0,0.058845186721194674,0.0,0.0,0.161233374540016,0.0,0.1115268152178616,0.045407617070607774,0.2210744812562026,0.0,0.0,0.04208707373608992,0.0,0.0,0.033995550439768214,0.0,0.0454016647528935,0.0,0.0,0.055073908180200214,0.0,0.0,0.09225907436653837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446666217406058,0.0,0.13926586505540767,0.04768196323280936,0.0,0.05036956940002527,0.04737508206553508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995989175169364,0.0753164136822471,0.050612785624315225,0.0,0.048178764264102565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0407259645195948,0.0,0.08262116441694563,0.0,0.08987410748444484,0.08842639524803432,0.08431886822412593,0.05811631351525628,0.0,0.0,0.2330698392186199,0.0,0.14166159183465615,0.0,0.054098787517470034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03533244006847452,0.0,0.052875477826333867,0.2094237737620768,0.0,0.060823771631940374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052309559184253764,0.04685377263248945,0.0,0.0,0.11587883451438635,0.08593632744676269,0.05946260597932668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14893111835336226,0.10301171627879556,0.0,0.04654658072592082,0.09329876455416207,0.04426567810763342,0.0,0.0,0.22407371102809245,0.047575577327299036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05295733454305412,0.05741995472923519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645028870830747,0.0,0.08415009242257268,0.0560256200839691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056060916849210565,0.0,0.10329517578454564,0.0,0.12002829253678644,0.0,0.056137668026378575,0.17859860316672016,0.04009064282751475,0.0,0.06184739565569426,0.05853159358004769,0.05708308627901721,0.0,0.1461783410483869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11885206632119895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20175704376702475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363852658726681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003329755493103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04200546869374325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05925166638773152,0.0,0.0,0.04466358836334945,0.04058107409202188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419340486307747,0.0,0.060382610075155926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049681417069387855,0.0,0.1585345856869037,0.0,0.046073521032856606,0.04853108569804626,0.0,0.0,0.07004040398488873,0.03377638805039696,0.15537088468107835,0.0,0.18442438779435005,0.0,0.0,0.05036956940002527,0.11713225566503205,0.10736608347390003,0.05733665140036717,0.0,0.054876134441257364,0.0,0.0,0.11611193427765475,0.0869875583424616,0.03109151717946721,0.041841158153666534,0.08456644336881887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03837572147198355,0.053532651628908114,0.21487636768275226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033945469975150966
COVID19_support,_nightwielder_,2020/03/22,"Can you give me some suggestions about what my friends and I can do to save my poor country? I know this subreddit is for a whole different thing, but I hope you don't mind me asking such a question.

TL;DR: The title.

I woke up to this news of 793 people dying in Italy. I just can't imagine what the situation is soon going to be in my country, Bangladesh. Most residents here are illiterate, filled with superstition. Already 24 people are affected, 2 died. Nobody is abiding by the quarantine laws. Doctors have no PPE. Hospitals are returning diseased people who have the symptoms. The government is trying, somewhat, but even those people are dumbasses. They themselves are making huge, dense gatherings in the press briefings. Bangladesh is one of the most dense countries of the world and I'm sure, horrible things await for her.

So in this situation, my friends and I would like to do something to help this poor country. Like spreading awareness or helping this corona situation in any way possible. We're 18 each. Can you give us some suggestions? We're each skilled at different things, for example, I can make decent smartphone apps and websites.

COVID19_support,iamthewallrus,2020/03/22,"I've been mildly sick for the past several days and I'm terrified that I have the virus This has been my symptoms since Tuesday:

Tuesday, March 17th: sneezing and allergy-like symptoms such as clear nasal mucus. No fever. Diarrhea from anxiety. Periodic shortness of breath from anxiety.

Wednesday, March 18th: similar allergy symptoms, development of phlegm. Sore throat. Periodic shortness of breath from anxiety. No fever.

Thursday, March 19th: phlegm and sore throat. Occasional cough with phlegm. No fever. Periodic shortness of breath from anxiety. 

Friday, March 20th: Phlegm and sore tonsils, not so much a sore throat anymore. Occasional cough with phlegm. Occasional shortness of breath due to anxiety, responds well to inhaler. Temperature 99.1.

Saturday, March 21st: reduced phlegm, reduced sore tonsils, cough seems to be going away, but temperature rising to 99.5. Hocked a loogie and there was a small stripe of blood in it that concerned me. Hocked a 2nd loogie, was there again. Hocked a 3rd and 4th and no blood. Seemingly normal energy level, but anxiety over possible infection drove me to bed, and once again had anxiety diarrhea. 

Am I going crazy or could I be infected? I'm 28 which I know is an age of lower risk of death but the risk is still there and it terrifies me. I've been taking vitamins and supplements like D3 and turmeric for the past several days, as well as elderberry syrup. I'm honestly quite scared, more so because I don't want to pass it to my husband who usually gets a bit more sick than I do. I know no one would give me a test at this point which sucks.

I heard people have a hard time because of other health issues. I just want to know what my likelihood of being sent to the Intensive Care Unit. (or even worse) I've also have a had a cough for a couple weeks but it goes away when I eat hot stuff and I'm not constantly coughing. IDK if it's Covid-19 or not. It hasn't progressed to a fever or any aches. But I'm worried I'm gonna get very sick. It's just me and my mother and I had to by myself to get groceries so I don't risk her getting sick. I'm still worried she may get sick.

When I eat I watch videos about the virus spread, when I shower I put on a podcast about the virus. Right before I sleep I check all the major subreddits for the virus. I have begun checking 4chan as well recently. Today I realized the virus has been killing me without even infecting me. I can not even play with my dog without thinking of societal collapse. I have no idea what to do. Is there anything at all you people would recommend. I've been struggling heavily with finding a purpose to live now that this is looming over the horizon.",4.2774380165289285,6.293840256198348,4.6347851239669415,83.38490495867771,72.05785123966942,7.815206611570248,30.28181818181818,8.548686976883017,2.432252231404959,505,22,93,9,10,159,83,121,0.136,0.825,0.039,-0.8894,2,0,0,1,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,0,10,4,1,1,11,0,11,4,2,1,2,15,13,4,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,3,3,1,0,5,3,2,1,4,2,1,0,3,1,15,2,17,9,3,14,0,0,1,0,3,6,0,0,6,69,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17288083831283052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1787656038218773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21949256647005508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2149678903936122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775163698449252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920125331052038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2371587248604796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2324262906068019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18550759881629345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456454621581606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21119196504735005,0.0,0.0,0.2101403735639666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20743213328965146,0.0,0.0,0.17941017989348462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21023524178642505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21962491119571487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346130380835301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19913461441494126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1667545211641516,0.0,0.0,0.18889031627613195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050260366802173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14923730642340494,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,FrigginFreyja,2020/03/22,"Need advice: Boss says he can't pay us if we close, and no work from home options are being given. I am definitely able to work from home (my job is heavily computer-based, I'm a graphic designer) and I have mentioned this fact several times. I feel like we're on that line of essential vs non-essential businesses (sign shop that also does blueprints). I have voiced my concerns about remaining open to the general public and have mentioned several ways we could do this safely (online orders only, no in person transactions, 'curbside' pickup of orders) but I feel like my suggestions have fallen on deaf ears. We are wiping down our front counter, credit card machine, and door handles with Clorox wipes and Lysol but I feel like that's not good enough. My boss has said if I'm worried, I can stay home, but he can't pay me if I'm not there, and I absolutely cannot afford to go without pay, even for a week. Why can't I work from home? What should I do?

COVID19_support,fitinthemaking,2020/03/22,"Feeling really anxious and scared for my parents My parents are 68 and 64, they're overall 100% healthy, my dad struggles with allergies and food intolerances but never really gets sick, my mom never gets sick but she has hypertension (although it’s under control and she takes her meds religiously so her blood pressure rarely goes up unless she's under stress) and is a light smoker (less than 7 cigarettes a day) but she's starting to quit this week... Realistically how deadly could this virus be for them? I'm not that worried about me (I'm a 24 y/o female with no underlying conditions and good health/healthy weight) but I'm terrified for them.  
I have asked for advice in the r/coronavirus community but so far it hasn't helped that much.. I just keep feeling like my time with them is running out because everything is making me feel like this virus has a 100% fatality rate, the situation in Italy isn’t helping either.. I just feel so helpless because I’m in Mexico and even though we have less than 300 confirmed cases I feel like getting the virus is inevitable. We are staying at home except to go grocery shopping 1-2 times a week and my dad is going to work (he owns a gas station and a parking garage so he can’t not go since they’re essential businesses) and he doesn’t really interact with a lot of people except his employees but he always uses Lysol and is extra careful with washing his hands and using hand sanitizer",4.8653645021645024,6.592415356363637,5.779688311688311,76.94915151515154,69.98181818181818,8.583549783549781,30.549783549783548,9.107695989026183,2.7591056277056274,1153,48,205,23,21,379,167,275,0.098,0.772,0.129,0.7169,3,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,2,0,3,3,10,11,0,4,11,0,18,8,3,5,2,49,41,26,2,1,14,5,8,3,0,0,3,0,1,0,7,20,2,2,5,1,1,4,9,6,0,0,0,9,25,5,28,39,7,23,0,1,0,0,26,10,0,1,11,129,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11623343181204028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897326238968047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13437602192615725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119919704816067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14501772488528036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127418528366735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13340894527591973,0.0949693373263333,0.0,0.0,0.07671084280065395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856323653804692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690170995866716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3007153684906035,0.2549268431698589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438309371259927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864343737226604,0.0,0.20280061484232675,0.09976692857670794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264348812916636,0.0,0.0,0.1594550593118595,0.0,0.11931333410034987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10572537701357444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743341879716479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10112431185892784,0.0,0.0,0.07939790955669207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13212307503752133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13930904915954292,0.0,0.0,0.08743958080188492,0.0,0.1834782028769628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26415267974236795,0.0,0.0,0.08246273112190593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12651455834271674,0.0,0.0,0.2286010887917753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11908649261691412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09839401830498927,0.13370118168844258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419115398951248,0.12678145750601358,0.0,0.0,0.13625315223459142,0.12434901665482435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943318701841405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168646225401922,0.0,0.13871766586791867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20546368122172876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19082388899598884,0.14484515232605066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659468368999534,0.12079624452862192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Hypsster,2020/03/22,"Say this were a Rabies-V2 outbreak and spreads the same way as COVID-19. But has the same symptoms as rabies. How do you think we would respond then? Rabies essentially has a 99.9% death rate according to CDC. Meaning you are guaranteed to die and if Not you’d be a vegetable.


How do you think society would react to this? Do you think it would’ve been eradicated quicker?


The Ebola outbreak has a 50% chance of death. And was an extremely brutal viral disease, which resulted in extreme amounts of quarantine to those infected or may have been infected and eradicated from the USA fairly quickly.

COVID19_support,deviantbluetardis,2020/03/23,"Moving back to my mothers because of covid My city is going under lockdown from tomorrow and I'm moving to my mother's. Just packed my bags and will leave in the morning. My mum has chronic arthritis and can't move around a lot on her own, she also has 3 dogs. We have house help who comes twice a day, looks after the dogs, her food and everything else. However, because of the shut down, nobody is allowed to leave their homes. So, I'm moving back with her to help out till things are better. 

Looking at my sleeping husband just now, I suddenly felt so over whelmed and couldn't stop crying. The lockdown could last for months to come instead of the 2 weeks that are planned. What if he ends up getting sick or my mother gets sick... I am so worried.

Last night, I asked mum to get clothes from this great online sale I found and she replied that she doesn't want to, with the covid outbreak, who knows if she would be here in a few months... Hearing her say that out loud, it made me feel cold all over.

I never thought we would be living through this.

COVID19_support,23Bologna,2020/03/23,"Advice really needed - helping a relative post-surgery (NYC) I'm in a near panic over this. A relative of mine is getting an urgent surgery this week and I'm basically the best option in the family to go stay with her for a few days to help her out, but I'm not ideal -

I have no symptoms, feeling fine aside from anxiety. I've been out of work for a full week, so I haven't been on the train or in the office since then, and haven't spent any time with anyone. BUT I've been out grocery/essentials shopping a few times.

My question is, what's the best way to protect her from me, just in case I am carrying the virus without knowing it? I have an old P95 mask I can wear in the car or if I need to get close and help her get up or something, but it just isn't practical to wear it for several days straight. I plan on hanging out in the apartment as far away as I can from her, and basically carrying Lysol wipes around and swiping everything I touch. It's a small apartment so we can't be in separate rooms the whole time I'm there (and she isn't taking this seriously enough either, anyway, I can't lock her in her bedroom). I will be able to spend most of the time 6 feet or more away, but not 100%.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. I'm really scared out of my mind.

COVID19_support,fearlessexplorer20,2020/03/23,"I want to go hide in the Bush but I don't know where to go or if I can successfully escape I have at least four conditions that put me in the higher risk group

1. Asthma and two chest infections in last six months. The asthma seems to react particularly to viruses, and cold weather. 
2. An immune condition that could contribute to cytokine storm. Not much is known about its other interactions with covid. 
3. A neurological disease (these are classified risky but not sure exactly why
4. Intermittent hypertension (very unstable blood pressure)

I also have a circulatory disease, very high heart rate (tachycardia), and connective tissue problems. I'm not sure whether these put me at high risk as well.

A few days ago, I was still in a place where I could not isolate properly. I was worried about the place closing down. I was not so worried about catching covid as, with seven major illnesses, I am ready to die. But I was more worried about being stuck out in the open cos that would be pretty miserable.

I've been estranged/low contact with my family for two years. My brother emailed to see if I'd come to his place to stay to be safe. I thought our relationship was getting better. So I agreed. Now I'm here and it's just the same. Pressure, put downs, and so on. We are just going into lockdown on Wednesday as a country. So at least four weeks of hiding in my room, then emerging, then having my ptsd set off, then retreating again. I've already lost the will to eat.

I want to go into the bush now. Even if I don't survive. Becusse as I said, I'm ready to go. I have a living will that says so. I just don't know how I could get into the Bush now because my brother would send someone to look for me. If I'd stayed where I was then I could have vanished and no one would have cared. But now I've completely fucked myself over. Also if I'd stayed where I was and happened to contract covid then I would have been able to refuse treatment. But now it would be harder to refuse treatment with family around. I'm sure they would pressure me to staying alive for god knows what.

Well moan session over. Basically I should have stayed where I was because I would have had freedom to go deep into the Bush and now I've completely fucked myself. Not only to four weeks of misery but also to potentially having treatment forced on me.",3.0751062271062284,5.29761244835165,3.9620329670329686,85.95213369963369,76.16483516483518,6.706959706959706,25.55860805860806,7.7094869923839395,1.4143772893772892,1844,67,359,27,42,591,220,455,0.18,0.71,0.11,-0.9887,0,1,0,0,0,0,54.0,2,0,1,4,34,19,2,6,17,0,47,12,3,3,4,76,76,39,1,20,22,2,0,0,0,10,6,2,1,0,11,22,1,3,6,0,0,12,10,10,2,8,15,5,42,9,61,43,7,76,0,2,2,2,16,37,2,7,21,254,53,2,0.07463037371827243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06615532336216838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235647319991814,0.17904564869787326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643685516731929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909879662491476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600450078082094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07609063985945365,0.0,0.0,0.06428745873339183,0.1564970538826593,0.0,0.0,0.23834512274104544,0.0,0.0,0.04813041703151165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745454530310868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07636550380701661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049292657985101136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14070974881683598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13798915584944438,0.07798258002543068,0.0,0.2544849674503888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599539300847414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843735218739239,0.0,0.15770217465040198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12304470492802895,0.060833715363683774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589998728506441,0.0,0.06267071778342938,0.0,0.08146786888749324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05956925228662785,0.0,0.0548619117637879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0505714726807542,0.05675976218618399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23391856881076195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07592592017514548,0.0,0.07141118859626014,0.08723891313948524,0.22507241590319807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012509173574152,0.0,0.0,0.0709905755896955,0.05934906862463556,0.0,0.0,0.0594707454264051,0.06794068931230299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06323407346677562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3977302424824413,0.05959991285539615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2110147320458332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0592481804386692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458060618106402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231557484851883,0.08803785605069135,0.0,0.11972796832410156,0.0,0.13420333744059626,0.0,0.06734230426867474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22737230146636325,0.0,0.3711069336760287,0.0,0.0,0.048059513821650975

COVID19_support,hellpony,2020/03/23,"I think I got exposed and I'm terrified. I have a good relationship with the people that run the shop down my street and have been going in for supplies.  There's a big bulletproof glass barrier that I thought would work in my favor.  As we shopped the other day, the owner came over and gave my ponytail a playful tug.  I didn't really think anything about it because the guys there are my buddies, but noticed that he did cough as we were leaving.

Today I went back to get some stuff and his voice sounds HORRIBLE.  I had just showered before going out to get supplies that day so I didn't think to wash my hair and slept on it that night.

I left the pantry stuff I got in the car to sit for a few days before I bring it in, handwashed the mayo and each beverage he bagged, took every egg out of the 2 cartons I bought and put them in a bowl, threw all the packaging away for everything else.   Still, I'm terrified I brought it home.  I don't know what I'd do if I got my partner sick.",4.243209549071615,4.607327182266012,4.915763546798028,87.63169003410383,70.2807881773399,8.216597195907541,28.423266388783627,8.139509932561175,1.6279612732095496,770,26,169,10,13,248,123,203,0.10800000000000001,0.863,0.03,-0.9513,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,2,0,1,1,7,3,0,0,15,0,12,6,2,0,1,26,35,12,0,2,3,0,1,0,1,1,3,2,2,2,13,14,1,1,5,3,3,11,3,0,0,0,18,3,25,3,23,16,4,33,0,0,0,0,11,14,0,2,7,107,38,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12188507920072265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13915783856234978,0.11389040884587312,0.0,0.09028882878632497,0.0,0.2520679560885429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16940278748842413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28656354209785084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12373011690114567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479230750993238,0.0,0.13311517878326848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15476674787855155,0.0,0.16835302954169054,0.1242308709494064,0.3553805311491846,0.0,0.0,0.14665599885116454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14857026895207526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139949896150696,0.0,0.0,0.15683118218735392,0.16092613241510595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13899481559416174,0.0,0.0,0.1686286009803909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102683494964611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488953295088349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488552558025083,0.0,0.0,0.1590188458418197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11828391268237988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3391098467822004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2847161253100531,0.0,0.11758585316392665,0.0,0.0,0.1403946121874465,0.0,0.16455993820305534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13730302370502315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10782864750742692,0.0,0.0,0.10521583010954924,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,DollopheadedMerlin,2020/03/23,"To combat the stress of COVID-19, I have been giving my coworkers worms on a string. My job is staying open because we are essential. So, most of my coworkers and I, despite most of us just being cashiers and fuel attendants (we're in NJ), are not able to.self quarantine. 
I am personally not too worried for myself. I am not at high risk. None of the people that I live with are. I have been doing everything I can to be sure I don't contract anyway. My boyfriend is high risk, but he loves out of state and we are sticking to phone calls for however long we know that this is an issue.
At work, we've got mad customers storming in (who really shouldn't be ""stopping in"" several times a day just to buy a refill of their coffee because they're ""not afraid""). We've got people who demand that we wear masks, that we sanitize more than an understaffed convenience store possibly could. We've got people complaining about the customer limit, the lack of product that we temporarily can't sell, etc. 
Needless to say, a lot of my coworkers are stressed and I happen to keep a large container of worms on a string (it's a simple toy, if you don't know) in my room for emergencies. 
WELL I think we can all agree that this counts as an emergency.
So, I stuff my pockets before heading into work each day, and I make sure that offer everyone a worm on a string. 
(Don't worry, we handle food at our job, so we wash our hands often. Anyone who got a worm would have to wash after touching it anyway, even of this wasn't going on).
Most of my coworkers have been ecstatic. Some of them have been confused as they have never heard of them before. Some of them have sent me pictures of their worms chilling in their car or sitting on their desk at home and I'm just happy that my silly, little 50 cent toy has just been able to distract from all the mayhem fo a little bit.",5.59445158102767,5.726105233695653,6.068418972332019,81.3481225296443,67.31521739130434,9.190909090909091,29.77075098814229,8.97023862654752,2.254897826086956,1458,48,289,23,22,472,193,368,0.075,0.8220000000000001,0.10300000000000001,0.8814,3,1,0,0,0,0,50.0,12,1,8,3,14,15,1,7,19,0,37,7,3,1,5,56,53,14,0,5,11,0,2,0,0,2,2,2,2,1,17,20,1,4,3,2,4,4,12,9,1,0,12,4,44,6,49,35,14,36,0,0,0,1,35,22,0,10,7,206,61,5,0.21713105625685375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591154154165652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13236107655657675,0.0,0.1847625364166244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11852543849097905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11085754257284927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08668074015312367,0.0,0.0,0.14003156848156414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107926186449988,0.0717065074229445,0.0,0.0,0.10373901460020933,0.09757169633616512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13127786755169307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414594717889956,0.061700291528962524,0.0,0.347319081976164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09600413798080523,0.11557002346050298,0.0,0.0,0.11141955301538932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22941088225758702,0.10890007660491026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331420515635672,0.2154690694633214,0.0964980296852463,0.0,0.0,0.11932955005107845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2176223607445652,0.09586535035008062,0.09607707603572307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09229852967476317,0.09798462781711983,0.0,0.07246833305086685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373242814515365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2257970025883135,0.09479523159411064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223913206944521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954985729829734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08633566546895434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11325752309984395,0.12264814483613287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11571640788174542,0.0,0.0907656427579165,0.2487228913329645,0.0,0.12428155563201322,0.0,0.0,0.2046434508815845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695644067408031,0.0,0.0,0.06330543251253586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13059096301758966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09761344798323413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580739949733885,0.2205071274211224,0.0,0.07712183628526098,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,avu-18,2020/03/23,"How to know if my immune system is weak? Hello all, 19 year old form India here. I was watching the interview of a renowned epidemiologist who said that given the population statistics of India, everyone will eventually be infected with the virus. Needless to say, this caused a serious spike in my anxiety.

I don't exercise a lot (only 10-15 min walking per day) , although I have decided to change my lifestyle for good. But I don't know if it's too late now. The food I eat is only minimally nutritious, nothing exotic. I am worried about the health of my family and me. We all have similar lifestyles.

My mom told we need to take steps to boost our immune system. But the more I think about it, the more I feel that the concept of immunity is somewhat ill-defined. There are sites online that only talk about boosting immune system, none of them really address the issue of determining its strength. Those that do only list severe conditions resulting from a weak immune system. I am quite sure I don't have any of those, although I used to have frequent flu-like symptoms a year ago when we were living in a city at a higher altitude and lower temperature than where we are now (just venting, I am not seeking any medical advice).

So is there a way to know for sure if my immune system is weak? Are there definite markers? I just can't stop thinking about this virus. I have my exams coming and I am not able to focus on my studies at all. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.",4.5317990430622,6.239280803508778,5.940869218500798,75.54297846889952,70.78947368421052,8.830940988835726,29.44577352472089,9.339509955726095,2.8086491228070183,1179,47,208,26,22,398,164,285,0.068,0.792,0.14,0.9576,1,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,5,0,1,2,17,10,0,0,17,0,28,16,0,4,5,38,42,13,0,4,9,1,1,0,0,2,14,2,1,0,12,9,2,1,7,1,0,3,7,4,0,0,5,4,30,6,29,33,9,28,0,0,1,0,14,7,0,5,12,150,42,2,0.12860297923030922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513386858178193,0.11399878162791907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2623633075820325,0.0,0.09838092710935313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321106849905398,0.13604489987915558,0.11078007932091503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08293828254452558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315929535215678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12288565781416035,0.0,0.0,0.12123544344628588,0.0,0.06502553038601781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15550723296052466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10786607745136086,0.0,0.14178523860981554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13669895317539324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13422809821349044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2120305023795496,0.0,0.1450697621232815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11355878677616467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10933365405555127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295539718549255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15061825497379205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09535747957684136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339802701301185,0.0,0.13494719335258876,0.0,0.0,0.3912334431073559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13678509846504588,0.0,0.0,0.08238636156242228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12233088303394128,0.10227025082956913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452847611475595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10751784909675767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2424135719416461,0.1336677366215782,0.09669343554295284,0.10336620331104993,0.0,0.118400344920098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16480719266014984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12288565781416035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107168311323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207905893706233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060256794554526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1656322044200427

COVID19_support,regis_b,2020/03/23,"Anxiety-related troubles Anyone else suffering from anxiety-related troubles these days? I'm a 37 year old man, otherwise healthy and doing sports (including stressful sports such as mountaineering) and I am currently recovering from an episode of [eye shingles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles) (""Zoster ophthalmicus"" or ""Zona ophtalmique"" in French). That episode started on Tuesday, the day after Emmanuel Macron made his second TV speech on the COVID-19 outbreak. (I live in France)

Apparently, shingles occurs either because of immunosuppression or ""psychological stress"" (I'm copy-pasting from Wikipedia here and it matches what my physician told me). I strongly suspect I became affected because of the stress generated by the outbreak, which I have been monitoring closely since January.

Another hypothesis is that I am infected with the coronavirus, without symptoms, and that my immunodefenses have been degraded. But my physician has told me that this a wild idea (""une idée un peu alambiquée"").

I'm just curious to know if other have experienced the same kind of troubles?

COVID19_support,GhostofTargetPast,2020/03/23,"Anyone with anxiety issues want to chat? I have a lot going on on top of this pandemic and my anxiety is ramping up. Unfortunately one of my anxiety symptoms is the feeling like I can’t take a deep enough breath which makes me wonder if I have COVID, which makes the anxiety worse... vicious cycle emerging.

I keep taking my temperature, right now it’s 98.

And it doesn’t hurt to breathe, it’s just the feeling that there’s not enough oxygen in the air I’m breathing.  This, of course, makes me take deeper breath, and this makes my lungs hurt.

How is everyone keeping their anxiety manageable?  I’m working at home so I can’t take Xanax during the day, and I don’t have a lot of it anyway. I’m taking what I have left of my prescription but my doctor won’t fill it so once I’m out I’m out, need a good way to cope without it.",1.835911764705884,3.8271193411764735,3.616102941176472,88.06121323529413,79.11764705882355,6.838235294117648,23.56617647058824,7.865858978985527,1.1967941176470591,648,22,137,11,16,217,95,170,0.096,0.836,0.068,-0.3204,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,2,7,5,1,0,9,0,12,8,5,5,0,26,34,9,0,3,5,0,2,1,0,1,3,0,1,0,13,7,0,2,3,1,0,2,7,3,0,1,0,2,16,2,17,33,4,17,0,2,0,0,2,12,0,4,3,86,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4626832087160533,0.0,0.0,0.08458039607538058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780113622032567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12381112787370517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24997497942510336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558567729177907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12232542193477915,0.08641625082709145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874626689832622,0.10145832996945846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133611602167442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25898756422097324,0.0,0.0,0.12625432389397948,0.0,0.21503559025456348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13142704803164384,0.0,0.0,0.05909658915541175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20567745137365784,0.0,0.0,0.32297593688050164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08969280107850078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12882203397209832,0.08196790544880328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330205122513672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572725039100466,0.4547469751841664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07134732565762016,0.09601508731304667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116604365520101,0.13117960741964724,0.08806276906345087,0.0,0.1232720012720409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,pinkyelloworange,2020/03/23,"I can't stop crying I don't even know why anymore. It isn't the quarantine. It's how everyone has become. The panic around me is making me panicked. I'm following the UK gov's advice but friends told me not to go out even when keeping the required social distance. This is also really bad because I used to struggle with OCD. How in the world am I being more lenient than some of my friends? How is this possible? Social media is full of corona stuff, so even if I'm trying to avoid it in the news I cannot. I absolutely \*despise\* it when friends talk to me in slogans. ""Stay at home."" or mention ""Lifting up spirits."" We're friends, I need you as my friend, not as a walking propaganda poster. If I didn't know they meant well and if I were in a more angry mood I'd get so mad at them, or the next person who posts ""Stay at home"" on Facebook. I've said it myself and now I'm very angry when hearing it, I feel like slapping you.(ofcs don't go around slapping people kids, cause that's wrong). I don't even know why, but I'm so down, I have that strange feeling of wanting something very very desperately, but not even knowing what.

COVID19_support,angeluscado,2020/03/23,"I'm having mild symptoms of... something I have a minor wheeze in my chest and a barely-there cough (more of a throat clear than anything else). Any other situation I'd ignore it, maybe chug a little cough medicine and get on with my life. I'm one of those people who doesn't call in sick unless I have to (thankfully, I rarely get sick -knocks wood-)

Now, though, I'm seriously considering staying away and working from home (just got hooked up for that last week. I still have a lot of things I need to be in-office for, but it can keep for a week). Part of me feels silly because a few months ago I'd still be doing all of my daily activities with these symptoms.

Someone tell me I'm not being silly, please?",4.000069930069934,4.950556174825176,4.75762937062937,86.42259790209793,71.16783216783216,7.118601398601397,24.789510489510487,7.1686216300943375,0.9004355244755242,555,15,116,5,10,179,96,143,0.044000000000000004,0.895,0.061,0.0667,0,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,1,5,5,0,0,7,0,10,10,2,0,2,16,21,6,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,8,5,0,2,1,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,1,10,3,21,17,5,15,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,1,8,72,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.152444445050915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694811779248647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415198285236588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16157509664193562,0.0,0.0,0.10483366504935526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17560453251993846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14366208761472896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695514769791354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17969848126256208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754320096352207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725037972136535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15285826294441993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401816438600525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214702187827601,0.0,0.172362980621376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462060206247441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727708509603461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13726788934609005,0.0,0.0,0.12751643349129796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11653393402704995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18623092489390025,0.0,0.11922501667058498,0.0,0.0,0.18877564865098515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19330581704984226,0.0,0.0,0.14571288821579487,0.1323938745078526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18330124626032604,0.2746770835230927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3574933633413133,0.0,0.0,0.15031272824191064,0.15833041912757445,0.0,0.0,0.11425178686285298,0.0,0.16896343816163928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2758941043689118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251990137370205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,HappyAkratic,2020/03/23,"Everything's going down and I feel like I'm the one who has to take care of everything Bunch of bad news in the last few days. All my housemates lost their jobs over the weekend, so I'm now the only one in the house earning money. I'm needing to call up our real estate tomorrow to ask for a freeze/reduction/whatever... sceptical of how well that'll work, but it's my responsibility, apparently, despite being the only one working.

My dad just had contact with a confirmed case, so he and my mum are going into iso. I was considering going to live with them and get out of Sydney (which is rapidly going to shit), but that's no longer an option.

Five other family members are now in iso as well. Two friends near me are also isolated, and somehow I'm the person responsible for picking up their groceries.

All this compounded with the fact that I might need to foot rent for a whole house in a couple of weeks, and that ***I*** only got out of iso a week ago. And my postgrad funding was denied. And... I don't know, I wish other people would like pick up the slack? It feels shitty, particularly as I was the one a month ago predicting all of this, whereas housemates/friends/family were all 'oh it'll all be fine'. Feels super unfair. And yet, I'm lucky to still have a job. And yet, I don't get why the people who **don't** have jobs can't help out.

I'm probably being shitty but idk, I'm stressed and things suck. And all my coping mechanisms aren't available anymore, except drinking lol.",1.8818624673060145,4.242509293918921,3.6413034001743685,85.96298169136881,81.06081081081079,6.251787271142111,22.72406277244987,7.4822170145007005,1.0772335658238887,1165,39,229,18,31,389,163,296,0.139,0.7609999999999999,0.1,-0.9047,5,0,1,0,0,0,53.0,1,0,3,5,13,15,3,1,19,1,24,3,2,3,7,47,50,20,0,4,5,2,3,2,1,4,0,0,1,1,15,18,1,0,4,2,3,4,6,6,2,6,7,3,19,9,37,36,9,32,0,1,0,0,15,14,2,4,16,155,34,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1922055386512855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08669890696159085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10751789153405596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10135277120756267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052144379350023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070316058853123,0.0,0.1105356430686782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11995840296762796,0.0,0.06991827914141031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062047775096718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19487163286701514,0.0,0.2044067785502892,0.0,0.16445264039825286,0.07745122475800678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08376064863633419,0.0,0.11328403397825668,0.0,0.2464574668701995,0.0,0.08670884996887293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266784551206683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501911802210781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3227535056938218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059581684906918925,0.0883721553715687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593153869323987,0.0,0.09573184673209577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11834705679367495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11501048008469646,0.0,0.0,0.08653529029043466,0.0,0.0,0.16077571588718662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2938574449641851,0.2473619682498544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15032170271750242,0.09466321824059644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688899299860415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339925160873283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112857600421908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657983040327791,0.0,0.12418825793104213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08151408987525971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720256688543559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059050550456646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17392688504730264,0.0,0.19495501987313213,0.0,0.09782707730955864,0.12104073672247763,0.12467113833530255,0.0,0.0,0.15785385860335274,0.0,0.0,0.07701443518431969,0.0,0.0,0.0

These last ten days feel like a bad dream that I can’t wake up from. My family income is gone, I can’t do anything but helplessly watch as confirmed cases rise into five digits, and I may have to start my first semester of college on Zoom. I feel simply surrounded by all the bad news and terrible predictions, there is no way I can survive 18 months of this. Every morning I wake up stressed about what awful headline is gonna be on the news today, how my home is headed towards being a war zone, how even our elected officials are giving us dire predictions. It’s all happening so fast and it’s invading my dreams. I’m getting more reports of cases near me and my friends, like it’s a monster or demon closing in. I had my anxiety under control for almost two years, and now it’s back and destroying me inside. The economy is done for and people are dying and I don’t see a way out.

COVID19_support,Billbradley8741,2020/03/23,"Terrified. I'm terrified. That the 80% numbers that feel not much worse than the flu are lies to keep people calm. I feel like the numbers being reported by the countries are false.Their actions aren't aligning with the numbers being reported and the videos we are seeing.

I have a terrible feeling that this illness is a death sentence regardless and the 'recovered' patients relapse and die.

From all the 'studies' around this, it hits every person differently.

&amp;#x200B;

Some people passing out randomly (and dying)having it attack your central nervous system so you don't automatically breathe it has to be 'manual'. Then you die.Complete and sudden organ failure (extremely rare in medicine)severe pneumonia

COVID19_support,Kanekicore,2020/03/23,"Struggling to cope I work in a major supermarket here in the UK and i'm genuinely terrified of going into work. I do online orders so 99% of the time customers in-store ignore me which is great for me because I struggle socially anyway but the past week has been awful. Customers grabbing hold of me to get my attention, screaming at me when I inform them of a 2 essential item policy and they're trying to take more. I even had a man walk up and snatch the noodles I was taking home for my dinner after my shift out of my hands when I took it off the shelf.

I'm so hyper-aware of all the customers who cough and don't cover their mouth, they'll be picking loose produce and be coughing all over it. I'm not so scared of me personally getting sick but I worry i'd pass something onto my mum and then she'd pass it on to my grandparents who she sees most weeks.

On top of this, i'm in a ldr and my boyfriend is Australian. I was supposed to fly over at the end of May and that's looking less and less likely. I feel like it's a really selfish thing to be worried about when people's health is at risk but I miss him so much and it was the one thing that was getting me through this all.

I just sit and cry on my breaks and i'm so exhausted. I want to self-isolate but then I feel awful for my coworkers who are all a lot older than me and it's not fair that they have to deal with it. I just don't know what to do",2.9902991854636585,3.60518902302632,4.495187969924814,88.61798245614037,73.24342105263158,7.3694235588972425,25.33145363408521,7.447530270364453,1.028017731829574,1109,33,250,12,21,372,163,304,0.172,0.7829999999999999,0.045,-0.9902,1,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,4,4,14,12,0,4,14,2,22,8,2,2,4,41,41,27,0,1,8,1,4,2,0,2,5,1,1,2,19,16,1,2,5,0,0,5,4,9,0,1,7,7,38,3,42,28,12,37,0,1,2,0,16,17,0,3,14,179,57,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436214730980104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17003603368133222,0.0,0.1595877816414977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13710322653123416,0.0,0.0,0.10224123575518053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156538921968492,0.11058622591340192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426234151824547,0.0,0.08797408044388316,0.0,0.0,0.1706630324371673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16454080910425534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552729146358785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507178147284904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15125092089746292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12998957438608166,0.0,0.0,0.13160194341461462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379280168492302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048937118059744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14777020744784972,0.10731599034324152,0.13516181404170832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09916622092375203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15497770590200993,0.0,0.12335229529548228,0.0,0.16148588930708035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577949318840707,0.0,0.1191694507994513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32365258072263275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23277451289468298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056790428396232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09026273740989392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17198394683751125,0.10509625885422393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09130263576555347,0.0,0.2483358767062871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22538652582130994,0.3144055122833486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,_sassysoucyxx_,2020/03/23,"""Don't touch your face"" easier said than done Does anyone have advice on how to avoid touching your face if it's a compulsion?

Rubbing my face in some way has always been a nervous tick of mine, especially socially. So far I'm still going to work, but other than that I'm home 24/7, with only my parents. At home, I don't find it to be as much of an issue but at work, I've been struggling with not touching my face. 
I work in a hot factory, constantly moving, my hair gets in my face, my safety goggles constantly need readjusting and whether it be these irritations or something triggering my anxiety, I constantly touch my face. 
Even now, I touch my face at work and get frustrated with myself and I get anxious about getting infected and it just makes whatever irritation worse. 
I'm young and healthy so I would likely be fine if I caught it but the thought that my parents, who are at higher risk than me, might catch it because of my compulsive face touching is stressing me out.",5.17536850583971,6.22814359685864,5.832146596858639,79.41759565042291,68.52879581151832,9.437132501006847,31.96979460330245,9.661875296680813,3.0108732178815942,781,33,148,17,13,254,114,191,0.183,0.762,0.055,-0.9792,2,1,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,2,0,4,8,8,1,5,5,0,14,10,9,3,0,28,27,16,0,4,9,2,9,1,0,2,1,1,2,0,11,9,0,1,2,0,0,4,3,6,0,0,6,10,24,2,23,16,2,21,0,0,0,0,7,10,0,5,7,99,35,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327682670226155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305274501661318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10393835837794466,0.1534917388430821,0.0,0.09500179986460776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282364084249061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44047389217629423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11889867096045735,0.13903974877962708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08973928244424277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12418054438223615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28394089751654644,0.0,0.07721670023267636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725726041851732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14181049707934035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637805680904782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069269222048733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14413407517481902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14440577934381402,0.09987833475504124,0.10074411959198748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333344839780334,0.0,0.0,0.30172982912082635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12924122119055945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13849992966166952,0.0,0.10459753273742474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10850405784567832,0.0,0.1556359011046718,0.1420383377643436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10786371471995368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784539363905857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.395652985811653,0.0,0.13846071355966288,0.09651645991068257,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,studywmeph,2020/03/23,"Study with me on Zoom Hi, I’m a law student from Manila, Philippines (25F GMT+8). I’m looking for people who’d be willing to study with me on Zoom until April 12. :)

Some specifics:

1. Each Zoom study session shall be limited to a maximum of 10 participants only (excluding me). I’ve created a Calendly page to manage these sessions. You may ""book"" a session through this link: [calendly.com/studywithmeph/study-with-me](https://calendly.com/studywithmeph/study-with-me)
2. For now, the only available schedule is 8 PM to 12 AM Philippine time. I might add more slots once I fix my sleep schedule. I paid for a Zoom Pro subscription, so we won’t be cut off after 40 minutes.
3. At least 15 minutes before the scheduled study session, I’ll send the Zoom invitation to the email address you provided on Calendly.

Let me know if you're willing to join! :D",5.418341323106425,8.292864530201348,5.5083652924256965,74.52645973154364,71.48322147651007,7.210162991371044,30.777085330776604,8.192908349453996,2.4644857142857144,681,30,113,11,14,214,103,149,0.027999999999999997,0.892,0.08,0.8188,0,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,1,2,0,1,2,1,1,0,9,0,13,1,1,0,0,13,18,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,3,5,0,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,11,0,21,6,5,14,0,0,1,0,7,5,0,4,8,63,14,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809658007917576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814627750758928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3376397598923138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2772748905765052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3502774537441148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3516396093918661,0.0,0.5022459421546274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289108924316752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3304266133994556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1925353687529569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Desertmoongw,2020/03/23,"Going back into my hole, don't know if I'll ever come out. For the longest part of my life I've been a shut in, spending all of my time alone in my room doing nothing in particular, sleeping or wasting entire days away. I hated it, I want to be productive, work on things I enjoy but for some reason, maybe my depression or bpd or something, is keeping me from it. It's not that I can't work or that I don't want to work, I can and I do, but I just sort of... don't. Days and weeks and months went by where I would want to do something and never did. On the rare occasion when I did do something, it would be forever in between, things that would take a normal person an hour or two to do took me months because I just couldn't bring myself to do them, for no particular reason. It was absolute hell and I wanted to kill myself every day. Couldn't even do basic necessity stuff like showering or brushing teeth.

About half a year ago a friend started pushing me hard to seek treatment, and I started going out and getting therapy, getting dentist appointments to fix my broken teeth, doctors appointments to start hormone replacement therapy, and it was all going great. I was starting to build the motivation or whatever to actually work, I wasn't having emotional breakdowns every few days, and for the first time in several years I was starting to have a positive outlook on life. I started HRT, got about a quarter of my teeth fixed, managed to start actual daily routines of exercise and meditation, showering, brushing my teeth, taking care of myself, and while the therapy was a little all over the place going out and about every couple days certainly helped.

Then the virus started to hit where I live, Washington State, and everything was starting to go into panic. I had to be moved to a different therapist for unrelated reasons but the disease caused that to be postponed, and so did my next dentist appointment, and today I can't leave the house at all anymore. My only means of transportation is the bus, and I live with my parents who are just a few years short of officially being elderly and two very young sisters. Were already mildly at risk of catching it since my mom has to work in an environment of near shoulder-to-shoulder with no at home work, and with the places I need to go typically being mildly crowded and needing to take a very crowded means of getting there I can't head out.

So now like many others I'm isolating, I don't know what it's been like for others but for me it's familiar and painful. I can already feel myself falling back into my old habits. I slept 16 hours straight yesterday and haven't done a lick of work. My work is my own self imposed work, not a proper job, it's one I can do at home whenever I want, and I do want to, and I was starting to get on track to, but now it feels like I was climbing a rope out of a cavern only for it to be cut and now I'm falling all the way back down. I want to kill myself. I don't think I can handle being down here again. I think it's been a week or a week and a half since I've done my morning routine, my bad social habits that I was going to therapy for are cropping up again and it's hard to put them down. I feel disgusting. I was just getting my life on track. I know for a lot of people COVID19 has put a halt on their life, for me it's actively taking away months of work as I melt back into the state of sloth I was fighting against. My birthday is next week, probably won't be able to enjoy it let alone celebrate it, I'll probably spend it sleeping and then crying because I was sleeping instead of working.

I'm not infected, nobody that I know is infected, yet this virus is going to kill me.",5.702772784412318,5.60999765,6.55730358265242,78.70161219358893,67.0945945945946,9.532369578881207,32.884978001257075,9.22739947703685,2.793611565053425,2911,116,571,49,43,968,297,740,0.121,0.785,0.094,-0.976,5,2,3,0,2,3,74.0,0,0,3,14,28,23,8,2,34,0,73,20,9,5,8,105,133,48,3,16,21,3,5,4,1,4,11,0,5,2,32,40,0,2,15,1,2,21,19,13,0,7,27,8,76,10,102,89,11,119,1,1,0,0,15,42,1,12,57,409,108,15,0.048535184011442016,0.0,0.09472667662140613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043023512180713465,0.0,0.0,0.1005356263804327,0.1071195649208642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04813386074636042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912008061186162,0.14928224242673255,0.04052485133356356,0.059173195372168114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061128365207748614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049484854800113914,0.049859003611498864,0.0,0.04180876342696392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05370325795470678,0.05331362059990432,0.1565058923589386,0.0,0.0418032828697532,0.0,0.0,0.050708937104624506,0.0,0.049677817447551134,0.0,0.09933668859933976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0545955493557002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0320570312933352,0.04390285263007384,0.12267895750488468,0.0,0.04362029382275282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07362254206588026,0.034673545155562494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041284002725922336,0.0,0.0,0.03749816277051059,0.0,0.1267881521506635,0.0,0.22066930853965566,0.0,0.03881802042738907,0.05351021171686633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695598318512085,0.04791844594111688,0.04981110119666581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03253211076509944,0.0,0.09736949376098501,0.0,0.09559475916593038,0.056003085890660616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04816368102960575,0.04314030160636855,0.16109097006867584,0.0,0.1066946713118816,0.0,0.0,0.051391751940778066,0.0,0.04963051401102327,0.13712734329279228,0.0948473572046014,0.04864500502980668,0.08571491337579035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04126287781192303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04920705868924507,0.048760115911616574,0.10573808793042837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05684382091602739,0.11622096247580295,0.05158521955242235,0.0,0.0719764479148014,0.03743332600880856,0.0,0.10323543763165237,0.0,0.047554175335906,0.04657081806013011,0.0,0.0509295111232688,0.0,0.03288869678658814,0.07382638903971173,0.05164485777308338,0.05694558094783871,0.05389257809292612,0.05255887456523728,0.0,0.03364818544394635,0.042379050589472674,0.101417874209249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465827466482618,0.0,0.0,0.09758253087854964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497067580617337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05063278205424895,0.0548309429420537,0.0,0.08029761152603483,0.0,0.1457107066226471,0.0494755079198174,0.0,0.11209426759967576,0.0,0.0,0.3435345305251981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05556117375206319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14596967239370665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22201685120125256,0.05635308948626505,0.06448923923886499,0.062198772299392836,0.0,0.0,0.056602512213365,0.0,0.04600567937273879,0.0,0.05392437527773171,0.0,0.0,0.0948236446822248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009321965021847,0.20039116323243591,0.03852496994142336,0.15572798806723934,0.0,0.0,0.04499260183180777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3886761121273963,0.0,0.0,0.1034340065378085,0.0,0.0,0.09376520164456173
COVID19_support,pastacats420,2020/03/23,"Struggling tonight - advice appreciated! Hey!

I'm finding it hard to manage my anxiety tonight and wondered if anyone could give me some assurance or information on my current main fear.

So I share a room with my boyfriend at university halls in the UK. As you may know we're not testing here except in severe cases and that's playing havoc with my anxiety. Neither of us will ever know for sure if we have/had it unless we end up in the ICU.

I'm not so worried for myself, I'm mostly fixated on the idea of my boyfriend getting sick or dying. I can't stop picturing worst case scenarios and it's unbearable. I'm terrified I'll be the one to pass it onto him.

Some info - he's 22, overweight, possibly obese (not being mean about him, he knows hahaha), and neither of us have gone anywhere for over a week except for occasional runs to the supermarket for supplies (we're broke students so can't afford to stockpile). However living in such a condensed environment is scary and I don't know how likely it is to be picked up at a shop.

Weight is being listed as a risk factor now and I guess that's whats set off this spiral. I've had a few now and I've made peace with the idea of myself getting sick, I just cant bear it if he does.

I wondered if anyone has any advice for me, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you so much in advance!",3.6889999999999996,4.9389645296296285,5.452037037037037,80.01916666666669,72.22222222222223,8.214814814814815,28.314814814814817,8.697196308434329,2.170459259259259,1053,40,206,19,20,361,156,270,0.14,0.757,0.10300000000000001,-0.8824,3,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,4,2,0,1,12,11,0,3,12,0,17,5,0,3,3,50,35,21,1,5,13,0,2,1,0,2,4,0,1,0,11,12,3,1,12,2,1,4,9,5,0,1,3,2,23,6,38,25,9,30,0,1,0,0,15,16,0,13,10,138,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685656704590475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344864331217664,0.0,0.21024809263670366,0.0,0.0,0.19217108611584569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971672845960016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14261771698539602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12025502026679935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1217111577857588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12430203737231395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15463294324404395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12559714722458445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435899918375932,0.1318234314405933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513809191597887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12309912937432985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31025536510761365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3020843573101084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06713527159187098,0.0,0.12134221044333338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13002780434154124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14968799258162258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10101770754171142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311768534814464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549176353907856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08803319854123606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552427122713577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11488722134051285,0.0,0.14365865529476168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12951441053541354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12651561343444478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33059277535858084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022806624750688,0.16733755013830315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29804693290413203,0.0,0.13955418804645436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,shaveXhaircut,2020/03/23,"Just need to vent. Worried about my mom, my mom is worried about me. Day 7 of sickness &amp; self imposed quarantine, I feel like hell. Yesterday &amp; today I woke up feeling a little better,I finally decided to tell my Mom I'm sick &amp; reassured her I was feeling better, only to feel just as bad as the night went on.  I hadn't told her because I didn't want her to worry. Note, I live alone. Last night I felt worse &amp; made a post on Facebook (hidden from Mom) that if I don't post anything today I probably died in my sleep. Serious concern; I'm no spring chicken, I smoke &amp; I have a few other health issues. I woke up to a call from my mom who was extremely worried, someone snitched. 

I don't have a PCP. I developed a distrust of Dr's after attempts to address my own health issues as well as the 6 grueling months of my Dad dying of cancer &amp; his Dr's refusing to even sign off that he had a terminal illness for medical cannabis. At least try to easy his dying, FUCK YOU UNITY POINT. He finally had to switch Dr's &amp; I stopped seeing mine. The final straw, me asking for anti-depressants but not Prozac &amp; her lying to my face and prescribing generic Prozac. I'm ranting &amp; this could be a thread of itself.

I'm a ""don't get sick"" person &amp; this does not feel like flu. Depending on how I feel tomorrow I'm going to try to get in touch with the local health dept or Prompt/Urgent care (whatever the one near me is called) but I don't have very high hopes of actually being diagnosed. I've heard so so many reports from people in my area that had symptoms, tested negative for flu, then were not tested for COVID and told to go home. Other even more disturbing reports, claims of people being told by health professionals they aren't testing for it more because ""they don't want it here"". Local ESDA maintains claims of no cases, Mounting evidence suggests otherwise. That's very disheartening. 

I'm more worried about my Mom than I am myself but after a week of sickness my anxiety &amp; depression are kicking into high gear. While my Mom may be in a high risk group, age, thankfully her job isn't as much, She's a cleaning lady &amp; horse tender for a rich lady. Still, it has her leaving the house. (IL shelter in place)

I'm not sure if there's anything that can be said to ease my mind or if anyone will even respond. I have extensively read up on most things COVID, no advice needed in that dept, thanks. It just helps a little bit to write this out.",4.554869383490073,5.3326057322515235,5.554822054213535,81.84595734218453,69.77079107505071,8.490970557502001,28.93533714426209,8.666027191798058,2.127755104800541,1938,69,381,31,33,640,254,493,0.161,0.746,0.09300000000000001,-0.9785,1,2,1,0,0,0,83.0,0,1,2,2,16,21,3,2,20,0,33,24,2,3,1,45,71,20,3,9,15,8,8,2,0,2,21,2,3,2,18,5,0,2,8,1,1,3,17,9,1,1,18,11,49,12,64,45,9,54,1,2,1,1,41,28,2,9,23,226,67,10,0.0,0.0,0.04719263776978877,0.0,0.0,0.04725708643262865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05008664473359577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6287798588784529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036995466580093214,0.0,0.0,0.033814618267875136,0.0,0.07959274694075501,0.0,0.04521031500335937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040378797142920766,0.05895993134100134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554144014117318,0.05279687879089685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987624650504183,0.0,0.0493065081762752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03861173254986955,0.0,0.0,0.03118836699592979,0.0,0.08330524225799632,0.04908464598813735,0.15057094453397174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042320389474887934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958244870247636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467144033055194,0.06909715890322281,0.04643343356167247,0.1589289032034682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044708281161093606,0.050532479773242635,0.0,0.05496850051249662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205618780075643,0.0,0.0,0.03241486292947905,0.15328580975621178,0.04850928389745151,0.04803265007678425,0.0,0.055801247139521636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009510942308359,0.0479900960016619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03942006650900845,0.0,0.0512065327360574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04725276059106481,0.0969393705579425,0.042702995636378006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04575964737347269,0.0,0.049029713260594035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048717874255746536,0.0,0.0,0.04883007670282645,0.3964726647095795,0.0386006981982331,0.0,0.035550355548905475,0.07171704013168555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09076565610991894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03277016379183578,0.03678015697444302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06705383040570004,0.042226313744539966,0.050526178808826934,0.0,0.04571607717668085,0.0,0.09263152225889572,0.0,0.052140539729988535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048373347035856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046001681707726096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03853686604597411,0.0,0.050450298226188565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04839518526413087,0.0,0.040975491416128385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03862056615554632,0.0404313428414972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04557897278890136,0.050264827017981635,0.0,0.0,0.04226899885952308,0.08904726011972207,0.0,0.0,0.032128407920533536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091679743845255,0.13863090276990267,0.0,0.06566688426342691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07980455849571601,0.05704826871219744,0.0,0.038791683576358336,0.0,0.043481681630096435,0.04483044557881208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2455609577826604,0.049283236536467434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I talked to my supervisor about it and all they are going to do is give out masks and gloves.

COVID19_support,pseudonympsam,2020/03/23,"Why won’t they listen? I haven’t seen or hugged my family in two weeks because we’ve been social distancing since before our state “ordered” it. My siblings, parents, and myself all live in the same area of the city, and we’re used to seeing each other at minimum once a week, but usually much more. We talk every day, but I miss them so much it hurts. 

And yet, I watch my friends posting pictures of hanging out at house parties and I watch my neighbors getting together with all their kids, and it makes me so angry!! 

Why won’t some people listen?! Stay. The. Fuck. Inside. Now even our federal government is saying it, so why won’t they listen?! 

The longer this goes on, the longer we have to isolate ourselves. If everyone would just do it, we could hope this will be over sooner.

My girlfriend has been in tears almost every day for the past week — unable to stop reading news, convinced one of us is going to get sick and die. It's totally possible of course, but it's the only thought she's let occupy her head and I'm honestly afraid she'll wear her body and immunity down just by staying so worried. Everything I say — about how we don't know what's going to happen, and there are a few smart measures being taken that could help, and in any case getting through it is going to mean finding ways to keep ourselves sane and take breaks from the scary stuff — seems to make it worse. I don't know what to do.

I asked a lot of questions and they told me to do contactless delivery, which was what I did, and I washed my hands before/after eating. 

Afterwards, I was reading articles online about doing take out and they mentioned it was better to take the food out of the container/packaging before eating it. I did not do that and now I’m freaking out. What are the chances of anything bad happening to me?

I’m so angry at myself for fighting so hard, I really believed I could build a life I could live. This has taken everything away. I wish I had been selfish enough to give up. My town has only been on lockdown for a week, and I’ve already had four near attempts where I just stopped myself and i’m rapidly falling further down the black hole. I don’t know what to do. I live alone. I can’t ask anyone to be with me. I don’t want to die.

COVID19_support,NatSurvivor,2020/03/23,"How do I calm down my mom? Hey guys!

I don't know if anyone is experimenting something similar but my mom is making me lose my shit and she is giving me more anxiety every day. She spends her quarantine days watching CNN 24 hours a day and reading Facebook and news about the virus everyday. She wakes me up at night to give me updates about de virus (even though I didn't ask her to do it), she comes to the room I'm in to tell me news about the virus (all her news are fake news for example today she told that she read that the quarantine in the world is going to last till April 2021), every time all the family spends time together she only talks about the virus and lastly I bought a book from Amazon which she instantly threw into the garbage outside because the package ""may come with the virus"". (While i was writing this she was beside me talking about patient zero in China)

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to tell her to chill out but she doesn't take it in a good way she tells me that she handles the situation how she wishes I told her that talking about the subject makes me very anxious and she doesn't care and tells me very insensitive.

What do you guys recommend?",5.136237482117308,5.763368660944209,5.357270386266097,84.32016881258943,68.39914163090128,8.445092989985694,27.97968526466381,8.447377352677275,1.7635896423462087,930,29,189,13,15,294,130,233,0.10099999999999999,0.8340000000000001,0.064,-0.9024,0,2,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,1,10,6,1,0,15,0,15,2,2,4,2,28,32,14,0,2,3,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,9,11,0,0,1,3,3,4,4,3,0,1,7,1,38,3,26,24,3,31,0,1,1,0,38,11,1,2,15,121,47,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064152971446633,0.13529554222650214,0.0,0.0,0.08517810393005525,0.12578739444816195,0.0,0.07785454098654475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10409191357891444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787446711342546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352296013822312,0.0,0.0,0.19182655392723116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2154236351881133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07354187660776337,0.0,0.18762479225722928,0.0,0.0,0.10891611523765653,0.10496552030248467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21362324485988096,0.06327954587890125,0.09339033718869996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22049677473538298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965173160609107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06119192916310059,0.18152097175283427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12456581899894308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14864640319915626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26081025566390537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448910642433168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468237659742366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22274891288879592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142933496426309,0.0,0.1251556865440721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08571830124484886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083717075494491,0.26848305257473354,0.3892793913093308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10939523407365613,0.0,0.12985154273315824,0.0,0.10554140103390336,0.21278854835700434,0.0,0.07559548790179084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837414582385068,0.0,0.08837994260369902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280404788420316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13529554222650214,0.0
COVID19_support,anjealka,2020/03/23,"Ideas/Help of how to deal with when someone died &amp; there are no wakes or funerals? I am looking for what people are doing or best ways to be supportive of a family when someone passed away. I don't know if this is nationwide, but there are no funerals , viewing or wakes at this time in my area.  

This person suddenly died (I'm trying hard not to think it was caused by the virus, since it it was listed as sudden severe illness causing organ failure and the person was under 65).  This person was a neighbor for over 10 years (they just moved a few miles away last year) , they had a large family so their youngest kids went to school with my kids and their older kids were teachers at the school and taught my kids. Normally I know the school would be doing something really big, but obviously that is not going to happen.  

I feel like it is impersonal and just not proper to just send an email or post something on the digital page. Churches are closed so can't light a candle. I could have my kids make something (do people feel safe getting homemade items right now?) . Normally I would offer to bring a meal over but , do people want food made at someone else's house (my house is clean but I don't know how people feel about this). 

Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated. I sadly feel there has to be other people facing this and more to come.",5.002095479509926,6.051324623574146,5.273352344740179,83.27924693705113,68.92395437262357,8.12581326573722,25.637727080692862,8.344100000000001,1.5280158005914657,1068,29,207,15,18,338,148,263,0.131,0.7959999999999999,0.07400000000000001,-0.9438,0,0,3,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,4,1,14,5,0,0,12,0,32,6,3,6,1,49,53,22,4,8,16,0,5,1,1,3,1,0,2,8,13,9,2,1,9,0,0,7,8,1,0,0,9,8,17,4,28,36,5,34,1,1,2,0,18,15,0,6,11,139,30,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735165248116137,0.0,0.06737686486568341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18617526570919893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039769078444281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2035620876704495,0.0,0.08534746534876518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910622267925545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10214571535658916,0.0,0.0,0.20565594757062053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08276748053966063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18680502617442246,0.0,0.2003885260030844,0.07078179192869072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198062707477677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05176449402152779,0.0,0.056308667789902324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761490388549552,0.0,0.08875499002409555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641031613137433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22864686925394534,0.0,0.11184771157606037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16335306912263015,0.08076230599766801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04840481318338237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832010942691882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093750593816914,0.06613575381785354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053049020679568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19415203890258045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34344322886310485,0.25953491004466483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948899381485456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06347230640890279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461260730062012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30081858450121945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193064848622043,0.0,0.08195886526611545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25184700097331864,0.2288267060677636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243325337803542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06348558446163614,0.0,0.0,0.05777354499161799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06726788499436417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05843914207144711,0.07864400349658031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09184688115684496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21114784474051648,0.0,0.0,0.1276067765435359
COVID19_support,asianadoptee,2020/03/23,"Should I go home to my parents?  Hi everyone; I’m not sure about the best place to ask this, so I thought I would try here; apologies if this is not the right place.

I am from NJ, M20, and am currently in CA where I was visiting my girlfriend before things really escalated here in the states. My parents are now afraid of the government ordering a domestic travel and ban and me getting “stranded” out west, away from my hometown doctors (which I don’t think really matters?). I am concerned that flying home is the bigger risk; my girlfriend and I stay inside all day and haven’t been in contact with anyone and have been very socially distant. I’m worried that flying home would not only increase the risk of me getting sick, but also the chance of me transmitting COVID19 to my parents. My parents are between 50-60 years old and I’m concerned that the emotional aspects of this pandemic are keeping them from thinking logically. The tri-state area also has even more cases identified right now than California; I’m not sure about what to do. My parents are very insistent and believe that the planes are safe and that I need to be home.

TLDR: should I run the risk of going home on a flight from CA to NJ like my parents want me to, or would it be safer to stay in CA? And if I should stay, how do I convince them?",6.196588845654992,6.266261525291827,6.427408560311285,79.49758495460443,66.04280155642024,9.499247730220493,34.25395590142672,9.21078282632365,2.945452088197148,1040,44,200,17,15,334,134,257,0.067,0.845,0.08800000000000001,0.8592,7,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,2,1,12,10,0,4,13,0,27,2,0,1,3,40,42,18,0,10,8,6,0,1,2,6,2,0,5,0,12,12,0,3,4,1,0,6,6,4,0,0,4,0,27,6,29,30,4,32,0,0,0,0,16,15,0,3,7,139,39,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433315302660612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06266148797301946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377872514772122,0.0,0.08419704370984649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625649024122187,0.1009663779979969,0.09404630868921522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577948113425909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172562272314053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10080577247280846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05919042560879099,0.0,0.0,0.08563178778469129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364116869437213,0.0,0.1018615087259763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4494600361062944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796546875974584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043781779022505525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06644901935713259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09403676253891513,0.0,0.0,0.0681568943242917,0.0,0.0,0.597046795497592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872589848964685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11482042013943212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15306289733292716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135207637252248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28655572605322605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16892376146961566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059536790584366485,0.11484443993136555,0.0,0.07114497696130029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12168656306871725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478849278367344,0.05285775186743772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100924860866824,0.0,0.19098159194386188,0.0,0.0,0.05770967105313945
COVID19_support,justanotheracademic,2020/03/24,"For those who are struggling without their usual routines! I thought I'd post this for everyone else who thrives on routine. I have ADHD, and the recent changes to my routine have been hard to deal with. I usually can't stray too far from my routine, or I'll lose track of important tasks. Lately I've been transitioning to an entirely new routine, and it's helped tremendously. I have kept up my productivity for graduate school (and in general) by:

* Waking up before 10am and going to sleep before 11pm.
* Sticking to my usual meal times, and not snacking as much as I want to during the day.
* Setting aside 4-5 hours a day for school.
* Calling a friend or family member for 30 minutes a day, so I'm not totally isolated.
* Limiting my naps, and only sleeping on top of the covers. Sleep hygiene has been key.
* Not hanging out in my bed
* Tidying up at least once a day, my apartment can become very cluttered if I don't.
* Limiting my time on social media, it's easy to go down rabbit holes.
* Checking in with my SO at the end of the day about my productivity.

It's a scary time, and everyone is unsure of how to deal with changes regarding school, work, etc. Routine can help if the days are feeling long and confusing. Do whatever works best for you, and take care of your mental health!",2.5795600000000007,4.971546636000003,4.0276,83.99780000000001,78.64,7.040000000000001,27.2,8.109356740369918,2.0001599999999997,1009,43,191,19,25,333,152,250,0.055999999999999994,0.843,0.10099999999999999,0.885,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,2,1,7,5,6,0,2,12,0,15,7,4,1,1,32,24,18,0,3,8,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,7,13,2,4,2,1,1,3,6,3,0,0,5,2,19,3,41,19,5,39,0,1,0,0,12,16,0,5,18,119,26,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12293426053092088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11297270068637424,0.17408471891788033,0.0,0.10734840511041532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044508508759841,0.0,0.10429279443575004,0.0,0.21642125732542206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3958165444932093,0.21091567079102946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08545125273617213,0.0,0.09059972729118494,0.0,0.1140818354048605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19548743536160285,0.0,0.0,0.09643113092205813,0.0,0.05172155316698727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790300021560163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11626900254010868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163290986622707,0.0,0.0,0.10873086513190364,0.0,0.0,0.13712740006171573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10073632232628538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538903827526314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052457874044292,0.0,0.11443779600848734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10308556799532592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519587292867418,0.0,0.0,0.09879357185794163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089368926553926,0.0,0.07779714063174982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796678639946868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10100031506689104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31057276027187697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070955110259035,0.10427309523143152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693707322737064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691032487770166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120786360314253,0.1789406332905493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3379782354284281,0.08440103266361795,0.060334057123309574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09860515983286412,0.0,0.1489385646942913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So my previous job was an arena, or rather, the job I had before COVID-19 caused us to shutdown. Thing is, we aren't even 'officially laid off' just that the building is shut down. Only higher ups and supervisors are being compensated for this, I get that to a degree, but other companies are paying all employees that are off due to this pandemic. So I'm in this little situation. I'm sure there are MANY like me. I was living paycheck to paycheck, no savings, nothing. My last check will be horrible which is just dandy. I'm torn between trying to get a job at a place that's essential cause I need the money, but I'm also terrified to work at those places right now. I'm around Memphis, TN our area isn't that bad, but it is here, lurking around. I don't know what to do, risk my health for a job I'll hate just so I have money? or do I attempt unemployment which MS hasn't dropped yet, so far anyway (apparently they are extending unemployment soon..) Just advice would be nice, or some information, opinions. Thanks in advance.

COVID19_support,rewrite_life,2020/03/24,"Could I have had COVID-19? I am stressed, here is my situation... On March 10th I became unusually sick. Keeping in mind I haven't had a flu in years at least 5 and I hardly ever get sick, maybe a small cold once or twice a year. My symptoms, I recorded as I roughly took a long time to think back and remember how I felt. To the best of my knowledge I believe to have felt them as follows and I know for a fact I was sick for 10 days at least, I haven't been that sick for that long since I was a child, I am 25, symptoms were:  


March 10th - March 20th: Cough, runny nose  
March 11th: Shortness of breath  
March 11th - March 15th: Fever 100+, highest 104, sweating  
March 11th - March 17th: Headaches, tiredness, fatigue, body aches  
March 17th: Severe sinus pressure  
I also had sneezing, occasional chest pain, nausea, phlegm and rarely some vision blurring usually accompanying the nausea.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel fine today, but, I am concerned I may have had a mild case of COVID-19. There are only a total of around \~35 confirmed cases in my area, I am on the border of 3 counties, \~35 is the total of all three of those counties and I am sure testing capability is low. My specific county having the most at around \~25. It doesn't seem like a lot, but with cases popping up everywhere it makes me wonder. Specifically because I live in a household where I am the only adult of 5 adults without a comorbid condition to COVID-19. Basically, all 4 other adults I live with have conditions that are high on the list of conditions that when mixed with COVID-19 cause a person to apparently become severely sick and turn into a matter of life or death. These conditions include, high blood pressure, brain issues, heart failure and more. I also have my almost 2 year old son who has a heart murmur. I am deathly scared for all of them and myself.   


Is it possible I could have had it? I can't sleep or stop thinking about it... I heard the flu has been going around as well in my area. I wrote it off as a flu and I am hoping that is the case. However, nobody else has gotten sick, though it seems some may be becoming sick and I've come to understand that COVID-19 has a longer incubation period than the flu. I am not a scientist, just a worried father and soon-to-be husband. I have been trying my best to get the facts by following a few governors and the president, WHO and the CDC. I find here and there evidence that people believe the virus may have been around for longer than we though, creeping into our society. My point and question in conclusion is:  


TL;DR do you think we could have been exposed to this virus and its spread has been at work since February, March or maybe sooner. That many of these mild cases are not seeking medical attention and spreading it unknowingly to the vulnerable and actually have been for weeks now?

COVID19_support,reservoirdogma,2020/03/24,"I just want to die I've been trying to avoid the news but I've been reading it all at once today and I can't stand it. The only way I could psychologically cope is convincing myself that we would be out of lockdown and back to some state of semi-normalcy by June, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen anymore, and I don't know if the world we get out of will be one worth living for me. Humanity will probably survive but everything I love won't exist anymore, and if we're locked down past June I'm going to lose my apartment and probably also my job. I'm not going to be selfish and break quarantine, because people who want to live deserve to and I believe in the value of human life. But if we don't get out of this financially, I'm going to be stuck with my emotionally abusive mother all over again, and I swore to myself when I left the house that I would never allow that to happen. So I think I'd rather die after I had a few years of happiness then drag on living through an economic depression that will strand me at home forever and never let me have anything I've been dreaming of.

Part of me wants to wait this out and pray for a better solution, but the realistic part knows that isn't happening. I learned better than to hope for the best or trust that ""it won't be that bad"" after the 2016 election. When we inevitably emerge from this into a depression, I'll be one less mouth to feed. My death will help the world, by some small margin. Plus, I don't want to overload the medical system in case people stupidly try to save me, which might happen if I wait. I don't want an ambulance to come for me when I want to stay dead that could go to someone who has a fighting chance.

The only thing stopping me is my dad and my friends. I miss my friends, even though I'm convinced I'll lose most of them because we'll never be in the same city again and will fall out of touch, and I know they miss me. I don't want to add to their pain. And I'm worried about my parents, to.  I'm living with them now, and I don't care about my mom, but this will kill my Dad. I don't want to torture him more than this situation is torturing everyone already. I just don't know what to do and I don't know if I have the will to keep living if the news gets much worse. I adopted a cat three weeks ago but I think he's new enough that he might be alright if I left him with my parents. He doesn't know me well enough yet and considering that I don't know if I'll be able to afford to take care of him in the future, maybe that would be for the best.

It just doesn't feel like there are any statistics that can reassure me. I know SK and China are getting better, but America is so stupid and fucked-up I don't have faith that we can adapt their measures and actually recover. All the economic data points towards an unavoidable crash that will ruin my chances to ever live independently. My industry is going to be in the toilet, and even before all this, I struggled with the fact that I'm overweight and ugly, and me finding a romantic partner was always unlikely at best. Before, I told myself that I could at least live for my job if I grew up lonely. Now I don't know if I'll ever have one again. There's going to be hundreds of thousands of deaths and I don't know if I can sit by and lose everything, but I also don't want to make it worse for the people who love me.",5.581552185548617,4.702143768361584,6.426315789473684,82.17394736842105,67.53107344632768,9.486529884032114,29.789771037763906,8.6894789155246,1.9971209039548028,2660,79,579,36,38,885,285,708,0.179,0.669,0.152,-0.9807,5,7,0,0,2,1,55.0,6,0,5,10,28,44,6,2,29,1,72,8,1,3,10,127,132,56,6,28,26,6,2,2,3,16,4,0,1,3,35,43,2,5,15,2,1,10,25,20,1,5,7,3,81,24,87,93,20,72,2,9,1,2,37,27,0,18,30,405,116,4,0.0571225639289952,0.06768089750508154,0.055743382365789435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050635706344769035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063036169738181,0.09136178747240707,0.047530549182112414,0.0,0.0,0.038845302287899015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11330046825350995,0.0,0.0,0.04700700295568458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043923725695953285,0.04769495486962168,0.0696427695572915,0.0,0.09721418925588436,0.06435756843863076,0.1798398199840399,0.15156079733782962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11648052188985893,0.0,0.0,0.04920603084735326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368231575759159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983991612190614,0.0,0.11856840573705485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06425519593320976,0.0,0.11804575672498825,0.0,0.0754578294787404,0.10334125880455844,0.0,0.05458305776785327,0.1026761543503921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02888288466350478,0.040808371084502124,0.0,0.0,0.05220898856860141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08826550238579052,0.0,0.11937672802407515,0.0,0.22724848629595204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20205317852898416,0.06080803149217558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038288050509635504,0.0,0.05729858910995929,0.05673559491066215,0.0,0.06591176935181921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133706610866374,0.05077315944336327,0.06319765357547946,0.0,0.31393067251271195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241276656944392,0.0584116917895113,0.04034735621796126,0.05581439872710515,0.0,0.3530818933823157,0.0,0.047968567015006895,0.19171661295170794,0.0,0.0,0.10311068831942928,0.0,0.03812975498658258,0.0,0.05738729326110945,0.0,0.0,0.05754497355994441,0.0,0.12119602664947755,0.0,0.06690125648804883,0.0,0.0,0.041991657094255966,0.0,0.13216932838921494,0.0551693281958495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060833666305570085,0.11612318298558373,0.0868885678186287,0.060782435460661824,0.0,0.12685569448694353,0.12371634036376675,0.054529950823060905,0.11880478028042844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05399928655725714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231755706093644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057138022106044635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06420815519779878,0.0,0.0,0.04839976304731125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06088505274933503,0.0,0.04775702122373632,0.0,0.05971690645690681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04294905908380968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03794969326052095,0.07320366491532174,0.05612262903313942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05414551143860076,0.05458305776785327,0.0,0.07756494256842708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30323131379927754,0.045341232410343366,0.04582027520389937,0.0,0.05136004511630919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05801073646513226,0.11642554552162067,0.12173469146619867,0.0,0.0,0.03678505833344814

Even though I've never left the house much, things as simple as going out to eat or meeting with family members seems like something that no one can do again. The world suddenly feels so different, and like it will never be the same.   
It's giving me the worst anxiety I've had in my life, and even though a lot of it feels irrational, I feel like there's nothing I can do to calm it. I've cried so much this past hour.  
I also get super anxious whenever my stepdad has to leave to get groceries or anything, even though he takes precautions. I'm asthmatic as well, so I'm absolutely terrified about what could happen to me if I got it.

I want to order it online from Amazon for example but the concern is the possibility of hard working employees holding the items or boxes while already being infected and then when I get it, I could still get it.

COVID19_support,rocksandbushes,2020/03/24,"Waiting on results has my anxiety off the walls I am a young, active 20-something who started getting a cough last Tuesday and well... it was all downhill from there. I have been extremely sick with a deep, crushing chest pain nothing like I've ever felt in my life and shortness of breath (amongst other less terrifying symptoms). I had to go to the ER. I was tested on Thursday and still have heard absolutely nothing from my state department or healthcare provider. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to think ahead and warn people I'd been interacting with closely (specifically at work) to self-isolate in case (so I let them know that I was a PUI and that they ought to self-isolate). This has backfired, many of these people are nagging me daily and very bitter that because I don't have my results, they cannot go to the grocery store or see their friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, I'm afraid that if I don't have it, my lungs won't be able to take getting it at a later date because this has been truly horrible. On the other hand, so many people have been sharing terrifying things targetting 20-somethings about belated cytokine storms, how more and more 20-somethings are ending up on respirators, how you can get reinfected, etc. Most of the people sharing these things have not yet had COVID19 and/or do not know that I may have it, so I know I'm not the target audience. Still, it makes me even more scared.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who to talk to because it's so poorly characterized. On the other hand, because it's not confirmed that I have it, I feel like I'm not valid in my fear and anxiety.",6.788220745662607,7.2189962624584725,6.495121816168329,78.27988464378001,64.78073089700996,9.213805832410484,35.326873385012924,8.998388855275968,3.035008711701735,1269,56,232,19,18,397,159,301,0.133,0.8,0.067,-0.9532,0,0,3,0,0,0,53.0,0,1,4,2,14,12,2,3,12,0,34,10,5,5,2,37,55,17,0,2,8,0,4,2,1,3,5,1,0,0,25,11,0,1,7,0,2,3,10,6,2,0,11,7,27,6,30,39,7,33,0,0,1,0,13,16,0,5,15,164,52,2,0.0983448099024349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3196696813237819,0.3584991252219513,0.0,0.0,0.1504670207875615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23980033325200184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710431128748752,0.0,0.10968045931767086,0.06495581942856613,0.08895851090337603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11066525262489617,0.049726090817581683,0.07025755184452165,0.09442644003199953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759809561757724,0.0,0.1541433124250458,0.0,0.11178324364917464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21619094233362976,0.08016414597741083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10056423118996638,0.06946384763564696,0.09609261306020678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06564592426983948,0.19941240282558412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18872899495115367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046458115608424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727196336799024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09846031110313834,0.0,0.07836808074677958,0.0,0.2051901698686312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2271319180667767,0.0,0.0,0.06960896262690207,0.0,0.15707658445050865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10221791304380368,0.0739430578840267,0.07904583296438768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13067184358884212,0.06301538319610138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676967040088726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811447676711989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884237948391536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07159619289000553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3584991252219513,0.0

COVID19_support,wozuha,2020/03/24,"Using Music to Soothe Like many of you, I'm struggling with some intense anxiety. I always forget how much music does for me when it comes to calming me down. Currently, I'm stuck on slow, trumpet Jazz, namely John Coltrane.  I've also been enjoying [Radio Garden](http://radio.garden/) which allows you to stream radio stations across the world. It's been nice to find local stations, hear their local commentary, weather, etc. It makes me feel more connected to people across the world in the midst of this pandemic. My current favorites are Denver's KUVO and NOLA's WWOZ 90.7.

COVID19_support,madebyafan3,2020/03/24,"I’ve been having panic attacks. I’ve been referred here from China_Flu.


I have been locked up at home some for about a week now, and I’m starting to feel like it’s taking a toll on me. I can feel the grip on my throat and it’s really hard to breathe right now. Everything is silent and I can hear my heart pumping so loudly I’m sure my neighbours can hear it too. 

I was one of the first here to stop going outside. I’m in the UK and national lockdown was only announced last night. I live alone. I started staying home from work because I was really afraid of the disease.

I have been an advocate on r/China_Flu and r/coronavirus for lockdown and staying home and no contact for over a month. My family resides in Italy so I took the matter really at heart. 

I was really afraid of the disease but right now my prevention methods are making me sick. I feel on edge, I can’t breathe, I can’t study, I can’t focus. I haven’t taken a shower in 5 days and I barely eat. I go to sleep at 5 and I wake up at 8.",0.7251344430217657,2.7578963427230083,2.8666602646180124,91.754433418694,83.22535211267606,5.750661545027742,22.357874519846355,6.980632752743323,0.6711239436619723,783,27,171,10,22,265,110,213,0.079,0.8959999999999999,0.025,-0.8352,1,3,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,2,9,6,1,3,11,0,20,9,7,1,1,20,36,12,0,0,1,0,5,1,1,0,1,3,4,0,3,9,1,2,4,0,0,3,5,4,0,2,10,8,25,2,27,26,1,34,0,0,0,0,4,17,0,1,13,108,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13491084394775174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14819039887866756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07940573918081395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08400740227565695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13328925851814438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11706995549235183,0.0,0.12279823448468605,0.0,0.197591234894219,0.0930582999880302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079972045371354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14806036287971075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668803885917232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2936266462011668,0.3087192124903508,0.0,0.0,0.3919864345904112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10617989025804396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06363881873210832,0.0,0.11502262152003652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695005666028738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039728813657793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224088209932556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08826804983599128,0.09906916393272776,0.0,0.15283291428844564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337934669233857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22248392357410468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13035481457619627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18439844702601707,0.2776812380872706,0.0,0.10890381285669493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276920759872274,0.0,0.09793986670403157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14472447708327996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448730988622824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09483137144748842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’m sure I’m not the only one looking for some uplifting entertainment during this period.

Obviously not all movies are available on all streaming platforms but most are likely to be found somewhere.

COVID19_support,enfantrebelle,2020/03/24,"Is it a bad idea to get a job at grocery store in times like this? I'm sorry if this is not the kind of posts the sub is for, but I (20F college student) really didn't know where else to post this. 

I saw an ad on Facebook saying they're looking for employees at a small grocery store nearby (less than 10 min walk from where I live!!) and I wanted to apply there because I did try to apply there before but they never called me back. Today, however, they did. I don't have a job right now and I'm starting to get quite bored at home and it's making me depressed and anxious, which means my motivation is nonexistent right now. I know the store never has more than like 10 people there at a time (it's a small place and it specializes in vegan/organic products) so that's the main reason I wanted to apply there. 

But, on the flip side I'm kind of scared of exposing myself like this. Anyone else here is still working at a grocery store or gas station right now? Is it worth it? Also how should I prepare? I want to bring up the possibility of always wearing gloves to them and I hope they let me.",3.0567048412285267,4.244190230088498,4.42302446642374,87.02996616345655,73.69026548672565,7.087558563248308,23.913586673607497,7.510576382923642,0.9624224882873498,856,24,181,10,17,284,126,226,0.09699999999999999,0.818,0.084,-0.6024,4,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,4,3,15,11,0,1,14,0,14,1,1,4,2,27,31,14,0,6,6,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,1,0,12,6,0,0,6,0,5,2,5,4,0,0,4,3,20,7,27,25,3,35,0,1,2,0,6,19,0,3,15,119,32,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348038288561254,0.10767038527160823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14618410773497925,0.0,0.0904788326140634,0.13258463037852306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09949989111481887,0.10804281151156482,0.0788804669696239,0.0,0.11010907080984536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321309096713722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145122222621633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21619262383978888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13521133797096302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979780943306798,0.1285224653988186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14607579014391714,0.0,0.0,0.25681720425584753,0.0,0.0,0.26949842057913664,0.14222868045774403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13231930763615055,0.0,0.18965353603295415,0.0,0.11426174217597387,0.0,0.10866262183598886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637487848052068,0.0,0.0,0.14095351281891974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19960106715411924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08970901651687295,0.0,0.1351944782832339,0.0,0.0,0.14587799949301142,0.2478570637957161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13763183015626207,0.0,0.0,0.08289635237312981,0.13304378680409915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3315182749850878,0.0,0.10290332755662324,0.12955103460391312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14485165550853568,0.09158932187989854,0.0,0.10333825781992532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509072669462122,0.0,0.1226551802501878,0.0,0.0,0.08785346891232304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22896875760254026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09420405804817633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,purelyparadox23,2020/03/24,"My boyfriend smokes and I’m so scared for him. My boyfriend is in his 40’s and works as a groundskeeper/custodian at a school where he is still being asked to come into work regularly despite the school being closed. He is also a pack-a-day smoker (unfortunately) so he still goes to the store every day to buy cigarettes. I also suspect that he has some sort of underlying health condition (very prone to headaches, body aches, cognitive difficulty, and fatigue) however he has a fear of doctors so he’s never really looked into it despite my urging him to. 

With all these things considered, I am absolutely TERRIFIED for him if/when he catches the virus. I keep hearing about how smokers are especially at risk due to lungs being comprimised, plus the fact that he potentially could have an underlying health condition, despite the fact that he is otherwise strong and in shape I have convinced myself that he would not be able to survive this virus. We don’t live together so we have been apart during this whole ordeal (which I’m taking very seriously whereas he thinks it’s being overblown). I’m scared that if something happens to him I won’t be able to be there for him or take care of him or godforbid say goodbye in a worst case scenario and it’s killing me. 

Anyway, I guess what I’m wondering is how bad is the prognosis for smokers realistically? Does smoking pretty much guarentee you’ll need a ventilator if you catchbit? Have there been heavy smokers who are able to survive the coronavirus just fine or is smoking considered to be as big of a risk factor for death as something like hypertension? I’m almost afraid to find out the answers, but if anyone has data specifically on smoking I’d really appreciate it.",6.99586956521739,7.79822346273292,7.289621118012422,71.47548757763978,64.37267080745342,10.415155279503104,35.354658385093174,10.355215969177356,3.789808198757763,1393,62,241,32,20,453,180,322,0.095,0.857,0.048,-0.8929,2,0,8,0,0,0,30.0,2,2,0,5,16,16,1,6,16,0,32,6,2,2,4,42,50,24,2,6,9,0,0,1,0,3,4,2,0,0,16,14,0,1,5,0,2,2,4,11,0,0,2,3,22,5,38,36,5,23,0,1,1,0,26,16,0,11,6,157,38,5,0.3721299364315671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12421145909275585,0.0,0.0,0.19839478381165412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08673396800164777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11596375223821785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10357098434750983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13778415622881532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12647042378404968,0.0,0.0,0.10685232986645103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09903849125069568,0.0,0.0,0.1599953489712191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696358614442144,0.10855113837021756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10451184042538253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395832122554011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11337334006540865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13664769309312347,0.0,0.10969109126948223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26370448056427725,0.13980582797945168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11025539527937728,0.13723554634149193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060601296643773665,0.0,0.10953251720185264,0.0,0.1041651410943701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09118610703215624,0.09197654420756793,0.09566984935297032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12619664282599086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15893064413978314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986442205507851,0.2483779899735276,0.2510769084919149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19098920379252451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1981222986227232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865302667030204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08240886478292188,0.07948194577236299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20469744677049734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384899281665561,0.0,0.0,0.13451968068657694,0.1806100171788887,0.0,0.0,0.08811680997050365,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,spinyfever,2020/03/24,"Workplace suspects a covid case. Hello, I work in a elder care facility. Tonight I found out through the previous shift that one of our residents might be infected. They had contact with a person in the past week or two that has recently tested positive for covid. The fucked up thing is that my workplace did not inform me or anyone on my shift of anything. I had to find out through other employees that the suspected resident was exposed and is showing flu like symptoms. They have quarantined him and have put out ppe in front of his room. I have to go check on him tonight and assist him with changing, toileting, etc. They have gowns, head covers and shoe covers. They however do not have any N95 masks. They only have surgical masks with a plastic barrier attached to it to protect our eyes. Is that enough when taking care of a suspected infected person? I heard surgical masks were not very good when in close proximity with a sick person. Any tips on how to maximize safety would be greatly appreciated.",5.724147465437786,7.577999172043015,5.959170506912442,76.00161290322583,68.03225806451613,9.61536098310292,33.17818740399385,9.957137785484203,3.5809413210445467,810,37,138,20,14,258,114,186,0.13699999999999998,0.759,0.10400000000000001,-0.59,2,1,0,0,0,0,18.0,2,0,5,1,3,6,1,0,10,0,20,9,3,1,0,27,27,9,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,2,5,1,1,3,8,12,0,2,6,1,1,3,3,1,0,2,7,2,19,5,27,16,2,23,0,0,1,1,18,13,1,3,8,100,27,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2320508441167443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929938511531844,0.0,0.14040326722676755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3479108390941882,0.0,0.18049018065263547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17629298704779706,0.1902830741847724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15594086226997242,0.0,0.0,0.1870727523570596,0.0,0.1577326826471492,0.0,0.0,0.09696558245760126,0.14310545873296826,0.0,0.1881058632355508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17510228213802534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335485615803788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1809976923282156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561450611460493,0.12976192949262208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628732481517809,0.0,0.44692859391489664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17151722651317444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684637205945566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17733640843344853,0.1282827630037861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11335036460533232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666680336873801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14077690723161673,0.0,0.0,0.1368586793317171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12421122019171993,0.0,0.0,0.12120143341769785,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,avalon-girl5,2020/03/24,"I have asthma and anxiety, would somebody share some calm or uplifting facts to keep me from hyperventilating? I’ve (25F) had asthma for eight years now, usually triggered by poor air quality or physical stress. I’ve heard horror stories about COVID patients with asthma having to get their lungs drained of fluid every day, and I nearly faint just from getting a blood test.

I feel I can no longer trust the government to make the right decisions regarding lockdown and business closures. I work at a garden store. It’s a really good job and any other time I’d be hyped to be there, but last Saturday there were so. many. people. I don’t know what the likelihood is of me coming into contact with the virus, but I think it’s safe to assume if I continue working it will happen eventually. And with how this thing is projected to pan out in the next few weeks, I’m wondering if I need to reconsider going to work. It’s a tough decision, however, as I otherwise wouldn’t have any income. Fortunately, I’m living with family for the time being, so rent isn’t an issue. I just need some guidance to do what’s wise. Without feeling able to trust the government’s approach to dealing with the crisis, I’m in the unfortunate situation of perhaps needing to make a decision for myself. Just very confused and conflicted.

The goal is to create a sense of community around simple positive acts in order to boost mental and physical health during isolation. It's a way of redirecting all our anxious energy to something productive, even if it seems small, because sometimes a kind act or moment of happiness is enough to steer our mood in a better direction. There's also a growing directory of free resources offering various kinds of support, and ideas for how to contribute to the crisis response. 

If you check it out and find it helpful, please share with others who may need it. If you have suggestions, ideas, or requests, please let me know. It's a work in progress.

COVID19_support,Nitronejo,2020/03/24,"I'm a bit worried about people being jerks affecting others... including me... Well, on my state today we have 45 total cases (4 of them asymtomatic). But today was also confirmed the first death of COVID-19; it wasn't considered on the confirmed cases, it was discovered after the death. That hospital however, is under control of FEDERAL goverment, not state goverment. Nationwide we have a total of 316 confirmed infected, and with that death, 3.

Our state goverment take the initiative and started on early inspections, closing schools, events, etc. They have requested the population to stay 5 days at home if possible (Today is the 3rd one, and my bet is a 50% response). So on that part, seems bright, and considering that other states from the nation followed my state on early response, it's optimistic on some way.

However, the main worry i have today is this one:

My best friend was supposed to move back to live with her family at the end of March. Then she told me the householder allowed her to stay for an extra month due the contingency. BUT today she told me that the householder is evicting her this weekend, no matter what.

The problem is that she is asking me for help to move (She actually asked me since January), and aside of her family, she told me no one else is able to help her move (not even her boyfriend). I told her to try and negotiate with the householder, but the housholder argues that already have the new residents ready to take the apartment, so can't be delayed. Also, that actually the housholder wanted the apartment free since March 20 (Dafuq? For me that's a fraking jerk move!).

I don't mind help her, but the problem is about this pandemic. I have been trying to isolate, and i wouldn't fear to only go out for those 2 days exclusively to help her move. But i'm afraid that i could actually get infected. And also, moving back to her family will mean to be a few blocks away only where the first COVID-19 death registered on my city happened. I don't care about myself, but what i don't want to do is to get my parents infected too (They are around their 50-60s). They actually get mad that ""i got too close"" when someone was asking for a guy at our house and aproached me.

So, now i don't know what to do. I don't want to leave my best friend alone on this difficult time, but i also don't want to risk myself to allow my parents to get infected. ¿What could i do?",5.624379084967323,6.489348159041394,6.2902897603485854,77.21530392156866,67.40958605664488,9.954422657952072,30.98627450980392,10.047579312681364,3.0648593464052287,1891,72,352,44,30,619,206,459,0.141,0.757,0.102,-0.955,7,1,0,0,0,0,76.0,4,0,5,5,20,18,4,3,28,0,40,4,0,4,2,52,68,26,4,10,10,2,0,0,2,2,4,0,1,1,24,18,0,3,3,1,2,8,13,10,1,5,11,1,55,9,54,50,11,65,0,0,1,0,42,21,0,4,28,254,79,1,0.06824536105438812,0.0,0.2663905115095929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068161232832883,0.07531045295192389,0.21830316231529734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060752840195167,0.19140060041787893,0.0,0.06411876321050844,0.1049529402321758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14323859204479347,0.0,0.07450625887784497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06958069390983664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654297544333259,0.10897673525271763,0.0,0.0,0.08802522416444945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05701024210747935,0.0,0.060445133597855714,0.0,0.07611161742212337,0.04507541733909417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19300695816144825,0.07679500452594931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609893849940735,0.0,0.0,0.1054523933213652,0.0,0.14262153771006,0.0,0.03878541140217144,0.0,0.0545820495675725,0.0,0.0,0.06757363696422472,0.0603491473966294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829737078571422,0.0,0.06845566152417255,0.0,0.0,0.07874598385919439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037505865665112416,0.0,0.0,0.07226198350436101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0602619041239998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433920500138147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06890836009936817,0.0,0.05447279609488949,0.435204110806916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0659117949700899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13873446856283894,0.10380734467122002,0.0,0.0,0.1515567943138525,0.07390307556001671,0.0,0.047312740462790284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07693639053489969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060318758343714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906794883297966,0.0,0.062128013587407466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129065357845839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05782407295681573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04830441781124156,0.14548094909951026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026240365458469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039794418845469415,0.0,0.3234431127947105,0.26084546831266125,0.0,0.09266824082555318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16101152850485176,0.05416999104488967,0.0,0.0,0.061360775526271776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861295371877927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,ZoePoey,2020/03/25,"Help with anxiety real quick? I’m not diagnosed with anxiety, but it’s what I’m feeling, just to be clear. I hadn’t eaten anything today since about 2 hours ago, ate a decent sized meal while watching the local and global news. Now I’m feeling tension in my throat and a good bit of anxiety and slight nausea. I was hoping Jeopardy would help, but I’m still feeling that mental wobble. I also got less sleep last night than normal, so I rationally know it’s probably those factors screwing with me, but I can’t quite get this feeling to go away. Help? Good news? Reassurance? Please?",1.904209860935524,4.625294168141597,3.3259987357775005,85.59294247787614,85.19469026548674,5.70644753476612,23.115676359039192,7.1686216300943375,1.1936579013906452,463,17,84,7,14,151,82,113,0.109,0.599,0.29100000000000004,0.9742,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,7,6,1,1,3,0,5,7,2,0,1,23,20,9,0,3,5,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,6,3,0,5,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,5,5,7,4,10,13,2,14,0,0,1,1,4,4,1,1,9,46,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14581291332219798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13154480661304507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3775095503382208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536353182958255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15454636968770874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17958349868321266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16695669630562432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326899424891491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594068174710216,0.0,0.09348503041723487,0.27593745787838864,0.1315598927429158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3307681037699693,0.0,0.0,0.1633784335240411,0.16199224128622788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040092307313932,0.13408355994016175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16577002036800942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543653191039295,0.16116798687280207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18056366228952714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17735102457527938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17495830588216896,0.0,0.18722878128390413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13607011696587945,0.0,0.16461156205039454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13136413648253967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15591990980487985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1168509423910312,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Reletr,2020/03/25,"I need help I don't bloody know if this really belongs here. I just need help now.

I went into self-quarantine on the 12th. I advocated on social media that early closures were necessary. Things were fine for me for a few days.

Then around 5 days later started my breaking. I had seen my girlfriend in private the other day (we took the most precautions we could, not using public transport, staying away from others), and we still wanted to see each other in person again. But her mom didn't agree to letting her daughter see anyone indefinitely. I started to just...break down, my depression and anxiety catching up to me. I asked my girlfriend constantly over this past week if she could get her mom to let us meet. Every time it's been no, and every time I keep asking her to ask again, because I don't want to give up hope.

Now...she stopped asking her recently, because the answer has always been no. We had an argument earlier today, the first one that we've had, I broke down several times today, had many anxiety attacks within the last week, I don't know what to bloody do at all anymore. Fucking add all of this shit to what I've already lost because of quarantine (graduation, senior prom, senior recital), and I'm close to breaking now...

And please...don't silver line my shit. ""At least you can still video call"", ""At least you're keeping others and yourself safe from contracting it"", ""At least you saw your girlfriend two weeks ago"". Don't say that shit to me, it just feels like it's ignorant of my current suffering. I'm close to breaking again, I haven't seen my girlfriend in days, weeks, my depression is ruining me at the current moment, I've completely lost my appetite, and I've already lost so much. I don't need my situation to be worsened even further...",5.376998845709887,6.457025230088497,5.787169424137492,79.82345517506735,68.08554572271386,8.609516480697705,31.258304476080546,8.841846274778883,2.565724791586508,1399,56,257,23,23,449,182,339,0.166,0.7759999999999999,0.057999999999999996,-0.9873,2,2,0,0,0,0,65.0,5,3,0,4,13,18,5,0,9,0,24,4,3,1,2,45,57,12,0,10,6,3,1,1,4,0,0,1,0,1,17,17,0,5,4,1,0,4,10,14,0,3,17,7,42,4,39,35,9,67,0,8,5,1,34,22,4,5,38,169,59,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519388997633515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18721709062569566,0.0,0.07058273980380174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12978462582127834,0.0,0.08412544782247118,0.05931291026813265,0.0,0.0,0.07551388647103087,0.31720663953622924,0.0965027950772269,0.07969762385078458,0.0,0.0,0.1551289928518758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08661770452337489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08893934496284782,0.09166769639922948,0.0,0.13545468470973576,0.0,0.0,0.21882521912679476,0.0,0.1461224941169232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056027338584402085,0.0,0.14294057001958782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04289100732197285,0.060600323110897164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07215368065992807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842106179473439,0.04431853133270504,0.08137365009801582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371530744835022,0.0,0.0,0.08425220836077009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15079601492829112,0.0,0.0,0.09323724364933783,0.06914520959811986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734824155842294,0.0,0.041442117232505134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777956024580095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08600111821639761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1986963778243258,0.0,0.0,0.06235749970525819,0.18869411739306466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748087318506654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08097683272522957,0.0,0.0740675390224152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054342256280379066,0.0,0.08375628703703762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06745772085381184,0.0,0.0,0.13519204384876485,0.0,0.08849291120146334,0.09583020264746607,0.26122064708220194,0.0,0.09534894062014997,0.0,0.08647029752986463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008177102269912,0.09041414227471938,0.13548567407987738,0.07091905018653118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056355194104289824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14838966625546265,0.0,0.1608118825125125,0.0,0.0942457585667318,0.0,0.0,0.08286351280947503,0.0,0.10203626370887024,0.07326316825702933,0.0,0.0,0.100066155302232,0.0,0.2721719498812392,0.0,0.0,0.0786353456612176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Draftaments,2020/03/25,"Funny, not so funny question. Self-isolated for 15 days. Living like a monk. What about my sexuality? 35 year old German here, started self-isolating around 15 days ago. Didn't let friends or family in the house anymore and tried to inform as many as I could. I saw my best friend for a brief 1-2min when he dropped some health supplies (Vitamin D/ Vitamin C etc), we had 2meters+/6-7 feet distance while the door was open (the other times we spoke through a closed door. I saw my father from 5meters/ 16feet away after he dropped some stuff in front of the door. I am single but very hedonistic and probably more active than majority of singles. Not ONS but kind of like long-term-friends-with-benefit arrangements. Now I haven't seen any girl in that period and I probably will keep on doing so if it really helps society and #flatteningthecurve

I still have online dating sites going and the traffic is higher than usual but well... it seems a bit pointless to get thirsty when you really can't touch, so I am actually inactive there to lower temptation (as there are plenty who will probably either be too uninformed or just too ignorant to stay home). But at some point, I would like to experience some sort of normality, while my friends in relationships are using their isolation in probably more joyful ways than I can by myself.

If I am very certain, someone has self isolated for a while and I did the same careful measures I took, can we just be rabbits again or what is sensible, rational advise? Doesn't help that some females I talk to kind of get that itching as well.

What is good advise, how are others doing it? Don't be too judgmental, I am certain a lot of people are just doing it and not thinking twice, I am just honest but don't want to break my isolation just for the mortal worldly needs.

Appreciated GOOD advise and yes, I know about the interwebs and I have multiple decades experience with alternatives, but that is obv. not the question here :)",6.5736944770857795,7.277841751351353,7.076345475910696,72.9813337250294,65.27027027027027,10.759106933019977,33.11398354876616,10.662846686107436,3.640441833137485,1568,63,280,40,23,514,208,370,0.067,0.764,0.16899999999999998,0.9918,1,3,0,0,0,0,54.0,3,1,1,1,26,19,0,0,15,1,38,5,2,3,2,63,55,33,1,7,21,1,1,3,3,3,4,1,4,2,15,16,0,2,6,0,0,4,10,1,2,1,9,5,29,18,41,38,16,43,1,0,3,0,25,15,0,15,22,203,44,3,0.0,0.0,0.09686866167660856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799274278838551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750384144901518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09844455306847573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836720631540622,0.0,0.0,0.09326306324296617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417285986044736,0.0,0.10837205188921124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012076392568195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07925530408718558,0.0,0.0,0.12803587650736015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11070710403223404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942011182020867,0.09357853689018956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2300764877941563,0.0,0.1037240959217571,0.0,0.05641478555394758,0.16651813068930466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10551442440379613,0.0,0.0,0.13307094236717856,0.0,0.09957123890720422,0.0,0.0,0.11453888542232545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08823160338742042,0.0,0.2067391717765228,0.054553639938805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150554504904004,0.0,0.14548810668234854,0.0,0.08765312201993722,0.08784671039457521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439185017630313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10063948383453268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360399868781377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972589662431593,0.0,0.0,0.10416228581675256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881809450211114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938378404447776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4280993427303934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22239981822176336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12718384913787056,0.0,0.0,0.10657383608271742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036744581830336,0.31066622473168065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08410720829770403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07026052512045577,0.10580365463358396,0.07927343614337327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11363507587318082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07978572762863312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063605227645121,0.0,0.0,0.05788242342288107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102874554710316,0.06739465619723277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573339033705876,0.10932675810430184,0.16380861809172895,0.05854927486863003,0.07879221381897264,0.0,0.0,0.17850294054350205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0705152560505707,0.0,0.0,0.06392363037955805

I think (given the symptoms and timeframe) that myself, husband, kid, and mom may have all had this back in late January/early February. The symptoms match to a T and I tested negative for flu, but it was before it was known about here and tests were being done (USA, Washington State). I'm still following social distancing/quarantine assuming I didn't have it, just to be on the safe side. I'm planning to donate blood this week and I was wondering if it's possible to test the blood for antibodies to the virus at that time? If so, I'd like to be able to donate plasma/blood as often as possible to help those that may need it if it turns out there are antibodies in my blood.

If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know. Like I said I'm not too sure as this is my first post.

COVID19_support,Commander_PonyShep,2020/03/25,"I am holding on to hope that convalescent plasma will save us from the coronavirus outbreak So I look up a lot of articles regarding convalescent plasma, which are antibodies from fully recovered patients of various diseases that are injected into infected patients to treat their diseases.  Heck, we always had convalescent plasma since the Spanish Flu of 1918, and they were proven to work!

But I still look up a lot of news articles about the coronavirus, and so few of them are about the convalescent plasma and how they're being tested and developed in order to be used for severe cases.  Instead, it's just more bad news about the coronavirus, and I'm doing everything in my power to avoid looking up that news and instead find more news on the convalescent plasma.

So does anyone think the same way I do, that convalescent plasma will help us get through the coronavirus and buy us enough time to create vaccines and antivirals against it in case it returns?",14.344786821705425,9.934077703488377,12.809767441860465,54.28135658914731,53.94186046511628,16.350387596899225,49.01550387596899,13.816669648895859,6.619403875968993,783,35,121,21,6,251,100,172,0.081,0.8440000000000001,0.075,-0.2698,1,1,0,0,0,0,12.0,4,0,3,2,11,5,0,1,10,0,12,2,0,2,0,27,20,13,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,8,10,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2,3,12,3,28,14,8,14,0,0,3,0,8,9,1,3,3,95,20,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14150183563634972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890847115320967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14199128309639236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488188561290989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17571531944295374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15283711809214096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15542988343914538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08884825884793812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398625774956622,0.0,0.0,0.16890591343725425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4284175379162157,0.0,0.0,0.2891543717971439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921170759552954,0.0,0.1406736917590408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13580849679412865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10896626631787966,0.0,0.0,0.0991621569379879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6136763175989143,0.146875465896069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13498408342591756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12380421138629673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,WillSuckcessSpoil,2020/03/25,"Should I stay or should I go? I'm scared.

I feel really really lucky in that I have a wonderful job that I can continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. A lot of my friends lost their source of income, including my roommate.

A year ago, my roommate expressed to me his desire to move out of our two-bedroom NYC apartment when our lease expired April 30th, 2020. My roommate was my best friend, but we had sort of grown apart and always seem to fight over whether to renew the lease. It seems that every year there's another bad decision pulling him away - last year, he wanted to quit his job and go live in a different city with his girlfriend. ""Hardship is necessary for growth,"" he said. But I like it here and had a lot of anxiety at the prospect of moving or finding a new roommate. I was terrified of having to give up and go home to Long Island. I just wanted to cling to the status quo, and he kept going back and forth with his decision until what felt like the last minute. He decided to stay for one more year, but promised me next year he would leave.

Now it's next year, and he's leaving. In spite of losing his job and the directive to ""stay at home"" he stubbornly refuses to to abandon his plan to move, even though it means signing a lease for a much more expensive place after I even offered to help him with his share of rent if he stayed, and got the landlord to agree to a month-to-month situation. Nope. He ""needs"" to get out of here, and annoyingly romanticizes the future struggle he put himself in. He feels he gave me plenty of time to carve out a new living situation by April 30th, but given what's going on in NYC it feels like he gave me no time at all.

So the way I see it, I have four options:

1. **Find a new roommate** \- this is hard because no one is as stupid as my roommate in NYC and no one is looking for a new place. I have tried though and I have a few candidates who are also jobless and need a room, but it's unclear if my landlord would let a jobless person sign a new lease. Further, I wonder if I really want to be quarantined with a stranger for that long, especially if it turns out they aren't taking this seriously. There is one guy I feel pretty good about, however, but there is no guarantee anyone will be reliable and supportive in this situation to a degree I need them to be. I feel pretty jaded on roommates. At the same time, he's a trusted friend-of-a-friend in the exact same position I'm in: so shouldn't I try to help him?
2. **Find a new place** \- probably bad. I don't want to uproot myself into a completely new situation now. Also, not a whole lot of places available in my area and I'm not going to travel around NYC to look at places in other neighborhoods. I can't afford a place by myself and realty has ground to a halt, so the only option would be other roommate situations. That, therefore, carries the same issues as choice 1.
3. **Go home** \- I'm leaning towards this one. My dad has a vacant basement apartment I can live in at home on Long Island. But Long Island is bad too, and my dad still goes into work every day with no hope of stopping. Rumor has it there is also COVID-19 spreading in the office where he works, since employees there commute from NYC every day. I'm worried for my dad, and feel like I'd be stressed out wondering if the whole house will come down with it.   
If I get sick, I'd rather be with family, and for sure I can eat better and save a ton of money living there. But I can't help but feel I'm much more likely to get sick if I go there. He'd have to pick me up, drive me and help my move - my lease is ending so if I leave here I leave for good. The virus has a high incidence within households especially since my dad is not and will not WFH. It could easily spread through my family and to me, and for all I know I could get it just being in the car going home with them. My mom's house is too small to self-isolate and she also cannot fully WFH, but she might be stopping that soon, so it could turn out to be safest, but what if I'M the carrier, bringing it to her?  
Of course, my job also will remain in Manhattan. So I'll have to go back to NYC eventually and go through an apartment-hunting process eventually.  
There's no where I can go where everyone is isolating 100%, or where I feel I'm able to easily isolate, unless...  

4.  I burden myself financially to **live here by myself** without a roommate month-to-month until I feel comfortable letting someone move in. This would kill 90% of my paycheck and if I got sick alone here I think I would feel the least safe. But I also can't help but think my odds of getting sick are lowest with this option. I just have to consider my mental-health and finances. NYC is bad now so it feels like a bad place to be alone, but I almost feel like this crisis makes me too scared to live with others. I just don't know!

I just wish my roommate didn't make this decision. Honestly, I'm having a hard time empathizing with him and am not sure our friendship will withstand this. But I need to let that go.

COVID19_support,ClothingOnHumans,2020/03/25,"Connecting Hello Everyone, my name is Jeff.

During this time when we are encouraged to quarantine ourselves and the news furthers feelings of our present lives looking less like the lives we are accustomed to connections with people may not be on the top of our minds. I have been thinking about how I can offer support to people while I am still in Health Coaching school not yet with my certification. I had been having a difficult time thinking of what support would look like yet the desire to take action is growing daily. I had the idea, in a conversation with a friend, to offer my support with real, meaningful conversation on the phone or Zoom. I want to keep connection between each of us open to talk about anything on our minds.

If you feel like you would benefit from a conversation please schedule a time to connect with me. I have opened my Calendly schedule for connecting with people Tuesdays - Sundays from 11am to 7 pm.

Thank you for your time, this is my link to schedule a phone or zoom connection - [https://calendly.com/clothingonhumans/connecting-for-humans](https://calendly.com/clothingonhumans/connecting-for-humans)

COVID19_support,andipales,2020/03/25,"I'm exhausted and food sourcing is now my full time job My days start at 5.30 when a panic attack wakes me up, after that, I get to spend a couple of hours desperately attempting to source food via the internet for the 9 people I know who are either at risk or in total lockdown because they would not survive it if caught. I am one of those people.

There are no delivery slots online, all the supermarket sites crash daily. Sometimes I stay up into the wee small hours because the sites are less swamped then and occasionally I get lucky and manage to find a slot to put an order in for someone.

We are bleeding money, my husband is the only one who managed to keep his job, so I can't send him to the shops because if we lose his income we are all screwed. The financial package the government put into place wouldn't cover us and benefits wouldn't even touch our bills. Besides which, the guidelines say he shouldn't be out because he risks bringing it home to me.

Somewhere around 9am, I get to get to stand under the shower and cry for five minutes, then spend a half hour getting all the pets cleaned and fed, whilst wondering if I have enough food for them. How would I know, we have no idea when the country will come out of lockdown.

My mother has cancer and COPD from the radiotherapy, the pharmacy is refusing to deliver her essential drugs so I had to ask a community group to try and fetch them. The pharmacist has contracted covid19, we have no idea when or if we will get those drugs my mother needs. My father is 70 and frail. They cannot leave their house and I cannot leave mine.

Every day is the same, I get up, I fight endlessly to get food to people, family, friends, whoever needs it. We bleed more money, we ration the food we have in the house. This is not living, it's surviving and it's hellish. 

Many of our friends and family will die from this and there is nothing I can do. This will break me. I have no idea how the fuck I'm supposed to carry on like this for 12 weeks, I barely recognise myself in the mirror already and it's been 3 weeks. I don't even have it that badly compared to other places, my heart bleeds for places like Italy and Spain at the moment, I can't even fathom the agony of their situation and I know it's coming to us in the UK too.

I don't know why I even wrote this, there's nothing anyone can do about any of this, maybe I just needed to get this out.

You guys are literally saving lives, possibly mine, as I have asthma and it could get quite nasty for me. Anyway, on to the post.

So of course I'm in quarantine and practicing social distancing, but I'm just really lonely recently. I can't see my best friend in person, and he's one of the only people that keeps me sane every day. We're really good fishing buddies and we have a lot in common and just, he's the best friend a person could have. I'm really missing hanging out with him.

On top of that I'm struggling with just being a functioning human being at all. I'm struggling with focusing on online classwork, I'm staying up way later than I should be. It's just tough. Even video games which are usually my go to when I need to destress are just not really helping at all.

Does anyone have any insight as to what I could do? I'm losing sleep over this and I want to be a functioning person again. :(",5.139028400597908,6.097562843049332,5.976609865470853,78.69241853512708,68.55156950672645,9.175366218236173,26.97428998505232,9.3871,2.2941147384155465,906,27,167,18,15,298,131,223,0.166,0.738,0.096,-0.9641,1,4,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,3,0,6,11,16,0,3,7,0,18,4,1,0,3,37,36,15,0,7,7,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,5,11,15,0,2,1,2,0,2,2,7,0,3,0,1,17,9,31,27,6,26,0,3,1,1,20,13,0,1,8,116,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07592430336329062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07806670767370752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048967429742034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343348658235969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674249474473328,0.0,0.0,0.07200356691309047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977037045812888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07374229056088524,0.0,0.09406805064855908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949675251171584,0.0,0.0,0.17251756029556353,0.0,0.05833134497089745,0.0,0.063451993258902,0.1872896830544343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11054883272150694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11867634486679556,0.0,0.0,0.0748351381214026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11653125136927345,0.11079317134726063,0.19847531275314645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858701496281044,0.0,0.0,0.1249052817562316,0.0,0.09491893048804392,0.10076645976315136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11251467928045733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08278539717396108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15131081929658674,0.08491315028224765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07740249697949769,0.2924595450215388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12586607069769012,0.10692768896974092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1187511326238777,0.0,0.0,0.3576220603737044,0.0,0.11023869080773414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08896880729036638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11172838773161847,0.22762165637147316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11900165381569187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501554310079741,0.12780997033809247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279025434859312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229642309216641,0.0,0.13170547961138013,0.08862079277629338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,yadudeHunter,2020/03/25,"Need an outlet for anxiety, looking for any support [lengthy] Hello! This is going to be long, but I can’t hold back my emotions anymore. Like a lot of people, I’m very anxious about COVID-19 and need a place to let it all out. If you read on, just know I'm grateful!

I’ve been anxious since the virus became public knowledge earlier this year. I was checking Worldometer daily and reading the news constantly and watching it grow to now has been absolutely staggering and disheartening.

Currently, I’m living at my university in Ohio (I’m part of a small group of students approved to stay on campus). Our state is currently under a shelter-in-place order, which I have been and will continue following. I’m an introvert, so luckily, this hasn’t been a difficult twist in lifestyle.

My anxiety, though — which previously took a backseat in my life — is crashing back into me.

It comes in waves. I’ll feel optimistic and hopeful throughout the day. I'll be so positive to the point that negativity seems impossible. But suddenly, I’ll feel the exact opposite. There’s this constant urge building inside of me to check the latest news and numbers. I’ll become preoccupied with something, but when that ends, I’m reminded that all of this is happening, and I HAVE to check the latest news.

I’m a student journalist, which hasn’t helped at all. COVID-19 has been a regular presence in my job, and it’s crammed into my social feeds. Yes, I understand some mainstream headlines exemplify the negatives of a situation (emotional appeal) to increase its audience, but the content is typically factual. It’s reality in your face, and I wish I could get myself to stop staring at it so much.

I keep modeling what could happen to me off of these stories.

I’ve been pretty shaken by the stories of younger deaths from the virus. There's been several of these stories coming out the past few days, especially. A lot of these people are reported to have underlying conditions, but some of them are reported to have little issues, and sometimes no conditions prior to death. These are people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, the ages of many of my loved ones, and they seem to be too common compared to statistics (which is likely a result of journalistic media). I feel so broken by that.

Regardless, any death at any age is absolutely horrific. It’s saddening just how many people are dying from the disease in such a short span of time. It’s hard to accept how many people are just suddenly not here.

I’ve been taking all precautions to prevent infection, but fear’s unrelenting.

I just turned 20 on the 5th, I’ve never have had a severe respiratory illness or condition, and I’m lucky to have a strong immune system, but I’m slightly overweight and previously had an obese BMI. I was diagnosed with prediabetes in 2018, but in response lost nearly 90 pounds and lead a healthier lifestyle. Lately, however, my eating habits/weight have taken a rough turn (stress eating, anybody?). I’ve been trying to make healthier choices again; I’m just afraid I’ve got an underlying condition I know nothing about that’ll kill me if I catch COVID-19.

Regardless, I’m much more worried for my family:

\- My mom and dad are in their mid-50s. My mom’s very healthy, and had a illness eerily similar to COVID-19 several weeks ago. My dad’s overweight and takes medication for high blood pressure and allergies. He recently had surgery for prostate cancer and is cancer-free as result. Regardless, I’m terrified these health problems will ruin his chances at recovery if he caught it the virus. I know that sounds pessimistic, but I can’t get it off my mind.

\- Several people in my family are overweight, diabetic, hypertensive or have previously smoked. One of my grandparents has skin cancer, and another has COPD, which are high-risk qualifiers for severe COVID-19.

\- My 21-year-old sister is beginning her nursing career in the midst of the pandemic. I’ve heard several stories regarding a nurse’s susceptibility to a large viral load, which worries me to no end. - My 50-year-old stepdad is a paramedic, which puts him at high risk of infection.

I just can’t shake the mindset that this is all some cruel, meant-to-be twist in reality. Like some disturbing wake-up call to my own mortality and the mortality of my loved ones. Our lives were all going quite well beforehand, and this comes and completely dismantles it — it feels so intentional, like I’m living out some disturbing script.

Honestly — I feel disgusted saying it — with all the health conditions weighed against my family, I feel like I’m inevitably meant to experience a loss during all of this. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it’s an occasional mindset I can’t seem to shake. I feel like things couldn’t keep going well, so a life-changing event has to come and remind me of life’s unpredictability. I know that's not the right mentality to have, but I don't know how to get rid of it.

Overall, I’m just looking for any comfort, reliability or factual information that can help me in this situation — specially with my fears regarding my family. What has helped you guys through this? I know some of my thinking might come off as irrational, and I apologize and hope it’s understandable. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but it's been a tug-of-war.

Thank you if you’ve read through everything. I think it’s essential to support one-another during these times, so anything means the world. I hope to provide support myself as I learn to cope with this situation, and most of all, I hope all of you are staying safe!",6.078758425744728,7.5960413219178085,6.68751630789302,72.39828468145251,66.79843444227006,10.374450967601652,34.448847575559896,10.504223727775694,3.968819917373344,4429,207,759,120,72,1450,440,1022,0.139,0.726,0.135,-0.6846,5,0,2,0,0,1,159.0,2,5,4,6,32,46,4,10,51,1,71,28,4,8,14,156,154,62,7,19,28,5,10,6,0,4,18,4,0,1,56,43,8,6,27,3,3,18,15,20,2,3,24,18,75,26,117,119,26,105,0,4,4,3,36,46,0,26,41,481,131,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04326951771874619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13277725280985925,0.10236875432702434,0.0746831713103553,0.11028892514406577,0.04840908691248009,0.0,0.0,0.040168697034602914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506791410526996,0.0,0.0,0.05390979756125749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04984322930773796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05163736946838128,0.210239115568166,0.05117919240479208,0.10549838596809948,0.0,0.07794594590038724,0.0,0.0,0.06296031299414923,0.0,0.0,0.04954386799128417,0.05065988117151032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09989516647025516,0.0,0.10981544604208912,0.08646713635592508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04386971171792462,0.04774819183244425,0.18406509590465256,0.10985572754255116,0.17276819184563227,0.0697436122917419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07650787094694014,0.0,0.08322415528049673,0.0,0.039039979247498746,0.0,0.0,0.048332252190262964,0.08632982750315718,0.0,0.043726595813187136,0.0,0.0,0.10377124548334883,0.0,0.0,0.09815438153440922,0.15471990824450976,0.0,0.24241014952525775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0509477819943631,0.04843907770609178,0.0867739498769049,0.054004025786635136,0.0,0.18778330241866906,0.0,0.0550628572780318,0.0,0.0,0.049914297939467764,0.1034335711379678,0.14308453198460006,0.04892315388443057,0.1293075381954923,0.04319770780520955,0.08198075667263299,0.0,0.053284833588338736,0.082997632322999,0.08811074392547827,0.0,0.032582859568894416,0.1484652639862443,0.0,0.053171345589296114,0.0,0.049173664846763235,0.04919172568550925,0.05178256610903335,0.04928691702806184,0.11433770009273543,0.0,0.0,0.07176590915146283,0.07238800438468215,0.0376473672397167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046837106853694535,0.0,0.10244144525900564,0.0,0.13230700853768815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0528594026616304,0.046597250115866906,0.20304350097988916,0.0,0.05099888738351139,0.0,0.04614378380702231,0.0,0.0,0.04966006938467006,0.0,0.0467071663056765,0.0,0.04907025060104568,0.0,0.051918320153732524,0.1464777429842459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04819665729683699,0.0,0.0,0.04168578329094174,0.0,0.03881782214843338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13331175983807486,0.0,0.3308667754321973,0.0,0.04037837392383181,0.16460257649626936,0.0,0.0497584055338972,0.0,0.03757840501802268,0.04827701330044416,0.0,0.0,0.15608354611308606,0.0,0.040809606998766984,0.05591478856139102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661762372489133,0.0,0.0,0.07340215856285222,0.0,0.0,0.04494018049374618,0.0,0.0,0.032428992177507734,0.06255442068021813,0.04795823474521182,0.0,0.0569261615568348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05423271121501077,0.06628124497694106,0.1061884120570267,0.0,0.10163149458197543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055118727290035,0.0,0.0,0.039154607547363,0.05944072436951265,0.08777696778097073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05613220167398699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914334253638246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943013447372602
COVID19_support,kieara62,2020/03/25,"In a moral dilemma. Advice please? I am 32, in Oklahoma, have a slew of health problems (chief among them PCOS), and am in need of at least an ovarian ablation if not a total hysterectomy. My normal body temp is 96ish, but I have been up to 99.5 off and on for a week. I have mild asthma and have been needing my inhaler, but not frequently. I have sleep apnea and my CPAP has proven to be a workout for my lungs. I have a slight dry cough. All my senses are intact. I called my insurance nurse line and she said i need to go to the hospital immediately. I called my regular doctor and they said to go to the ER if my temp gets over 102 or breathing becomes more difficult. I called the Oklahoma COVID hotline and they said I did not have the virus and they wouldn’t test me. 

I work in a prison. I regularly see elderly and disabled inmates. The job I do is not essential to survival or safety. The Governor of Oklahoma issued an order for all ‘vulnerable’ persons to stay at home except for food or an emergency. My boss (who is not compassionate ever) has said that she cannot make the decision as to whether or not I come to work, but I have not been approved to work from or have paid leave. It would it be possible to do my job from home anyway. I do not need the paycheck to survive, but it certainly makes life easier. 

I am struggling with whether or not I should stay home. What’s your two cents?",3.5976292153872222,4.879708861209966,4.871987798678191,83.96578884934756,72.48754448398577,8.62640230469412,27.615827825792238,9.107695989026183,2.1391279783087622,1094,40,228,23,21,363,149,281,0.095,0.8540000000000001,0.051,-0.904,2,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,4,6,2,5,0,1,18,0,31,10,4,3,5,53,47,24,0,11,24,0,0,0,0,3,5,4,3,1,6,11,1,0,1,1,2,3,11,3,1,1,9,6,36,2,36,33,5,20,1,0,1,0,17,11,0,8,3,167,42,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954250990866334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12380528934177065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12451747342249188,0.0,0.0,0.3433989203443476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656394834092424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11473877255602792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10140057839298597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13555137803015732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058567456059328775,0.0,0.12741766297079754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915671782873448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3373353572849433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11700294151478255,0.22248327028261689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11869737521005795,0.0,0.0,0.07917931916944375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14965481374421838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3324819692574594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10983388538992586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09788111669478354,0.0,0.12305178574418214,0.0,0.12637554592003986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726425437301523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4265298650155029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932893137007424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11218063705398797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.238966687098172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11719092499196625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950509864502636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08991960155213907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2448297064347611,0.0,0.0,0.07963239637912972,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,donotdownvotecows,2020/03/25,"I'm sooo scared that I have it and am gonna suffer extremely and/or die My symptoms started 5 or 6 days ago where I just randomly got a stuffy nose out of nowhere and had to blow my nose. Then for the next two days I felt fine, but then on Saturday I started to get a slight tickle in my throat, random little aches and pains here and there in my body, and that type of stomach rumble you get when you're sick. Sunday and Monday it was the same, then this morning I woke up and slowly progressed to feeling pretty good by midday, but now its nighttime and I feel like my symptoms have gotten slightly worse. My throat is dry and has been aching more strongly, and it looks inflamed at the back of it. My stomach has been doing that sicky rumble more, and I've still felt that same level of needle-like pains around my body. I'm sooo scared of this progressing into me getting chest pain and not being able to breathe. Like, waking up in the middle of the night or something gasping for air. I'm less than 2 months away from being 18 and less than 4 months away from going on campus for college. I want to make it to then so I can finally forge my own path and life my own life outside of my family. I'm sooo scared that it's gonna get extremely worse and that I'm gonna suffer terribly and/ or die, or that my 51 year old mom or my sister is gonna get it and experience the same fate. I hate this virus situation. The worse thing about this situation is that it's taken away my peace of mind. I feel like I can't go more than 2 seconds without looking at the r/Covid19 subreddit to try to feel like I have some control over what's gonna happen with this sickness. I want to go back to being able to feel much more certainty about my life again.


I know me feeling anxious is probably making this worse, but its just soo hard to try to managw my anxiety. I probably haven't been eating enough, haven't been sleeping enough, and maybe not drinking enough water as I should. I get anxiety about going to eat because I think about every single surface I touch and the fact that I share my house with my mom and sister who I don't think wash their hands for long enough. I also have just been lying around and scrolling through social media and read from the r/covid19 subreddit all day. I'm legit scared to go to sleep rn. I feel so alone and depressed and scared. I am usually good at comforting myself and calming myself down but I feel like my catastrophizing is getting out of control and I'm having trouble handling it.",5.247924098671728,5.435934466666668,5.495148640101203,84.96720113851995,68.05882352941177,8.227703984819735,28.412397216951298,7.831003766801068,1.5885528146742567,1998,61,411,21,31,634,237,510,0.188,0.7120000000000001,0.1,-0.9952,0,1,2,0,0,0,38.0,0,1,1,5,24,26,1,5,12,0,31,30,14,4,2,77,82,44,2,3,15,4,13,5,0,6,12,0,0,0,29,33,4,2,13,2,0,5,7,14,0,2,13,17,50,12,65,60,19,59,0,3,2,0,9,26,0,8,33,267,79,4,0.12866459673701355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05702670091491242,0.0,0.0,0.06662885950371569,0.0,0.051446515762675636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842806433332743,0.07267718569570471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145387695745333,0.0,0.0,0.1813269360209284,0.09893513289917974,0.0,0.039216371974636316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14291736161777688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14430828581328572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446703110829108,0.0,0.055409314317754664,0.0,0.13353353789294028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06302116083935612,0.0,0.13165600361375376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26588984528803145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05420273600474409,0.0,0.0,0.06292933220461983,0.060646765473894526,0.0,0.2602267441952258,0.18383602723464906,0.1235381901707068,0.07047288832479758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352767947589387,0.0,0.1828076385061004,0.10791775929256164,0.05145241587259389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0568888389865925,0.0,0.057629103187012386,0.06351482588203139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423083489754033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035355348748382115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13631941460929986,0.15714755716472328,0.0644778636664338,0.0,0.056932059636759125,0.10804585625235674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08588461741892399,0.0,0.06463044055977184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06495728227540852,0.15069042065293248,0.1026988535836293,0.0,0.047291641469973805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841812914891958,0.06037150402943551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750592528034732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20536230368512728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06544907531951663,0.13872219688882748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434970760208765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3220392676353259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14462439756768253,0.1287575167700229,0.06557867662932441,0.0,0.04952614627580648,0.0,0.0,0.09106946380350324,0.0,0.051375856578507066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373178080396592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0427395204610188,0.08244307834036517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735481541848777,0.0,0.06284330765747224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085293785425588,0.0,0.07588971274024367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062014039923819674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622404323980707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04142789093206481
COVID19_support,tiburonsol,2020/03/25,"Free yoga, meditation, and fitness classes while quarantined! :) I am a part of a youth charity foundation called ""Inspiring Children"". Our main focus is mental health. When being in quarantine became mandatory, we knew that there would be a mental health crisis. It's very easy to slip into darkness and isolation at a time like this; for that reason, we have started doing daily programming on twitch TV ([https://www.twitch.tv/inspirehouse](https://www.twitch.tv/inspirehouse)) in response to the quarantine. Our channel includes daily Yin yoga, fitness, and meditation! We wanted to make sure everyone who is quarantined has access to these programs- and it's completely free!

I hope that people who want to do live classes find this resource helpful. :)

Much love and strength to you all &lt;3",7.794332307692307,11.603266464000006,6.284800000000002,67.12978461538464,68.36,8.966153846153848,32.81538461538461,9.466822959209583,4.0995723076923065,648,29,81,16,13,192,91,125,0.057,0.637,0.306,0.988,0,5,0,0,0,0,42.0,5,1,0,1,2,8,0,0,5,0,10,4,0,2,2,20,17,7,0,4,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,0,0,1,10,9,0,0,4,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,8,10,13,13,4,12,0,0,0,1,12,7,0,1,6,58,18,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20955560962508854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21517239178643893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960993536562218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18757008735002706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43628486578500897,0.0,0.0,0.13755663872166374,0.0,0.0,0.20383272660540888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10026158264755672,0.0,0.18121565270430212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852217534283758,0.0,0.13698793387025412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41363299319519337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15086250481164928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22223649035228804,0.0,0.14227577553061752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21100340503145631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14525788272726178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19342023154216711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11966717099133503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16933045259546178,0.24209166350672745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14578451806780618,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,jakemistakes,2020/03/25,"My dad is a medical worker and I've never been more anxious I remember sitting at my laptop and laughing at coronavirus jokes a couple months ago, now I'm feeling almost hopeless and thinking about how the end of my life could be rising on the horizon. I'm trying hard not to let it get to me, or think too much, but it's hard. My dad is a biomedical engineer, he fixes hospital equipment and is essential to making sure things like ventilators stay up to shape. Normally I have never had to worry about his position, but today he told me there's 5 cases of Corona that walked around his hospital unprotected including the CEO of the company he works for, and now his entire team is freaking out, he's freaking out, and now I'm lowkey freaking out. I've heard so much about viral overload and double exposure lately killing Doctors, but nobody has mentioned other medical staff, nobody mentions their family. We only just moved in January as this was all starting, so his hospital told him that if he \*is\* to contract the virus he'll be put on leave without pay, possibly even fired. I've been having stomach pain for the last week, it gets worse at night and feels fine in the morning, as well as some sniffles and this feeling of mucus in my chest. I don't work so I'm fine in self isolation but I'm prone to anxiety, I'm only 19 going on 20, slightly overweight although my immunity is strong, I've only ever been sick about 5 times in my life at most, but the idea of losing my life so soon scares me, death scares me. I hope this isn't considered fear stoking, because I'm not looking to. I just want some advice, and some peace of mind in this highly taxing time.",9.368401567944254,6.7604766676829255,9.376411149825783,69.56719512195123,61.286585365853654,12.298257839721256,39.2822299651568,10.608840637214634,4.081769337979094,1329,52,244,24,14,440,189,328,0.19,0.695,0.11599999999999999,-0.9872,0,1,0,0,0,1,35.0,1,0,1,6,21,19,1,3,11,0,20,12,2,2,5,51,44,26,2,5,12,2,6,1,0,1,10,1,0,1,11,15,1,0,7,2,2,5,7,10,1,0,8,8,24,9,42,31,9,45,0,2,1,0,22,20,0,8,19,155,35,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10806978803871532,0.09803364831891362,0.0,0.11074249258870074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460302006565447,0.12493813510151633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09845084210732062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741620954439358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829917516012761,0.12236858492161158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11319619059569902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09795219918741836,0.0,0.0,0.07304535526432507,0.10003731905604686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10425684079144557,0.1244473977007031,0.16775679230730908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11556011575005673,0.0,0.06285231113073818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19813845599097574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11684713144072123,0.0,0.10984338444428128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484556007379495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12235430277233834,0.0,0.0,0.09014771230498894,0.12475324594363238,0.11710157262599233,0.0,0.11308840468455884,0.2343444270217924,0.05402994774763226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0928699127270538,0.123724807174813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382140510472282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.222820776393872,0.0,0.0,0.11166697817293117,0.0,0.08827394127178377,0.11754240915559434,0.16259654070499485,0.0,0.17059162915108736,0.0,0.0,0.10378364344338024,0.10835724618191447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523319189763454,0.11767830118426212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246765157402654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11117608755458218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12527983302909956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2214449287911469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153721790184199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827799648120659,0.11787697417443893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10423219669585866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347279521651008,0.1417265179061852,0.0,0.0,0.12897484410348806,0.0,0.1048288334377675,0.2113518967406469,0.0,0.07508510150777667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523036832256011,0.0,0.08871069586015462,0.0,0.09943600996287744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10660729944377743,0.0,0.16102542901409886,0.1123121320481284,0.1127032859706846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Bowtieredneck,2020/03/25,"Help As the virus gets closer and closer to home, I feel my anxiety growing. I live with my dad who is insane, and it is driving me nuts. I cannot keep living like this, this virus has taken all my joy from life, except my girlfriend and my truck. I keep hoping it will just stop, but every day I feel like i have less of a chance of ever seeing normal life again. I just wish I knew how long until everything will be normal. I hate to vent, as theirs other people that need help but I couldn't keep it in longer.

Yesterday marked two months since the Wuhan lockdown and China is now reporting close to zero new cases - that's down from several thousand per day a mere month ago. I'm an expat living and working in the emergency sector in China. I won't play it down, the broad impact of this pandemic has been worse than I ever imagined - but we are also often inherently more resilient than we believe. [This link is a sharing of my personal experiences and observations of how the crisis was managed in China.](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ice-angel-id/covid-19-the-way-i-see-it-from-the-ground-in-china/2806513296064665/) I hope it will offer you encouragement of what is possible when people come together.

COVID19_support,CommutingKillsME,2020/03/26,"How big of a deal is visiting my boyfriend? I am in Canada, southern Ontario to be specific, and I am currently quarantined with my family (younger brother, mom, dad), and have been for two weeks. None of us are showing any symptoms.

I'm 21, if that matters. My boyfriend lives around a 45 minute drive from me. I'm having a very hard time mentally, dealing with this quarantine. I'm considering going to my boyfriend's house, to spend some time there. He's been isolated there, and we've been isolated here. He'd come pick me up.

My parents are wary, but is it really that big of a deal? If I do go, should I just stay for a week or so? I just don't see how the virus could be spread, especially considering I've waited the entire period and have not shown symptoms. If I'm isolated here, and he's isolated there, I really don't see the problem. am I just being a selfish idiot?",3.2140097402597405,4.763717965909095,4.800357142857145,83.03750000000002,73.88636363636364,8.892207792207794,28.48051948051948,9.424239791934726,2.5396701298701294,686,28,141,17,14,231,103,176,0.121,0.855,0.024,-0.9448,2,2,0,0,0,0,30.0,1,0,0,0,12,3,1,0,9,0,22,2,0,3,0,27,32,13,0,6,9,4,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,4,9,0,1,0,1,1,5,4,3,0,1,3,3,16,0,14,23,2,17,0,0,2,0,12,5,0,5,6,89,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10961878931019237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434985915332695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13885605750395044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870186783385154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4985579103272775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15196121730449175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18322277247847155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443999297247633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859985102983696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14233899743826006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624476271231969,0.0,0.0,0.18879077539924607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17898905179963398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15424277620414475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20653253597180166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569046407940355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1718134594501126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3350886736410662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187989336362389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574650429655786,0.0,0.1938989080261048,0.0,0.0,0.13300355956300153,0.0,0.0,0.25860337275717143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,guaip,2020/03/26,"My wife is pregnant and due next week. What now? She's almost 39 weeks and is due next week. We're in Brazil, where as March 23 we had 2,550 cases and 123 in our town. It's already considered a nationwide community transmission and we are climbing the ""transmission wall"" right now. Our hospital had a few cases (5 confirmed, 1 in the ICU), but it's in a different building. And quarantine protocols have been in place weeks before the first case.

I've been a bit nervous about getting it because if I do it would probably mean I cannot be with her in the labor room, and even do my share of caring the baby in the first few weeks.

I know all statistics work on our favour (we're on our 30s and my town have just a few cases compared to the major European cities), and symptoms on newborns seems to be mild, but there are exceptions. I try to have a positive attitude towards this situation, but when I tell someone she's due next week, their response is always ""oh, that sucks"".

But we're doing our share to be safe. I already worked from home and she is in her leave since March 1st. I only left our house to go to the supermarket once and to a couple of appointments with her doctor. I wash my hands paranoically and make her do it too.

Anyone else facing the same situation? I know chances are everything is going to be fine for us, but having a ching should be only joy combined with the common worries of the subjetc. Adding a fast-spreading-virus in the equation is keeping a part of my brain thinking about it ALL. THE. TIME.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers.

I'm a Software Engineering student from Colombia, and currently learning web development. I would love to build a web app that helps solving one of the several problems people are having due to the coronavirus outbreak and isolation due to this. So I've come here to ask you guys if you think any of the struggles you or other people're having could be solved using a web app. Or just share some of your main struggles and I'll see if I get an idea. If I end up developing something I'll be sure to post it here so everyone can use it! \^\^

I think that we’ve overreacted to this virus so much, that the societal and political damage can never be undone. Even after the virus is gone in about a month, people will probably still be thinking ""I hope this guy doesn't have a virus"" whenever they're even 20 feet away from another person. Also, ""drastic measures"" are almost universally accepted now, and I find that extremely disturbing. I'm feeling sick to my stomach knowing that I'm one of very few people who aren't afraid of the virus and don't want any drastic or society-changing measures taken place. People don't even care about the economy anymore. They aren’t thinking about how millions of people could starve to death in a worldwide economic depression if these cancellations and quarantines aren’t lifted soon, not to mention how unhappy everyone will be during this virus and beyond. Even the term ""social distancing"" makes my bones chill! Just last February, I seriously thought I was already in the roaring 2020s. COVID-19 wasn't even affecting the economy until we were told that the virus can be spread through casual contact, and everyone believes that because scientists said so. The WHO can say that blinking causes cancer, and 99% of people would believe them just because they're scientists. I’m not saying that the WHO is evil and has a plan to destroy the American Dream, but that they were forced to come up with a solution fast. I can prove that this virus isn’t spread through casual contact, and I don’t need sources to do so, just scientific thinking. If people didn't start socially distancing until mid-March, and people who’ve had the virus weren't quarantined until two weeks after they got it (supposedly infecting people they've come in contact with during those two weeks), why did it take until now for the numbers to skyrocket everywhere else? You see, I think it’s just airborne, but I could be wrong (could be right too). Back in the Middle Ages, science was all about disproving stuff, but now, you either agree with everything the scientists say, or you're a ""conservatard redneck"". The American Dream is done for, and I find that very disheartening.",9.467741596638652,9.121239394607848,8.501358543417366,68.71647058823531,59.465686274509814,12.281232492997198,39.036414565826334,11.58411153163022,4.701814985994399,1835,80,299,46,21,571,209,408,0.10300000000000001,0.846,0.051,-0.9641,4,2,0,0,0,0,56.0,1,2,4,1,29,15,2,2,24,0,44,6,3,5,4,62,73,28,1,9,14,0,1,0,0,4,3,4,0,3,25,17,0,0,14,4,0,3,15,9,0,4,17,6,20,6,39,42,7,38,0,3,1,0,25,12,0,6,23,207,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843832309044045,0.0,0.09299293702136194,0.06738988888338641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05730580973174783,0.08836339408740794,0.0,0.0,0.08357220428010657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07917349949984745,0.06479765941288343,0.0,0.10273920053095716,0.0,0.0,0.1898846117560531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08591786177133602,0.08656747600155516,0.08914542836763059,0.1451805636879471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018458184938599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07258076625059122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623644460891372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07039593636832575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27829439882016466,0.07622613502403039,0.0,0.16104528160647125,0.07573554353603383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0426089384184412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1540406787428343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06739761744859431,0.0,0.0,0.08343955878913614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369813118897403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04631203859514646,0.06869048226310069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05625021188366313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672627118557271,0.0,0.06194741114201228,0.06248439575820924,0.06499344784697171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05710285532338188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673721133477161,0.0735804404247416,0.08804316929543607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085623482377436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196526559290882,0.08015911644124836,0.20104227341631875,0.0,0.0,0.06715148268462565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2577048998744396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059646031955774975,0.0,0.06729733228360274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09646784385981386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335980062075894,0.0,0.0,0.07758357333610369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239770355406036,0.0,0.13380034618016962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08052264080323562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16463713654148016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13906150078696172,0.049704039555847616,0.0,0.13519101760260735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07603966532817105,0.09408332912091563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05986227982997903,0.09213492277032054,0.0,0.0

I know it is early in my quarantine ( I'm only almost a week in), and there has not really been enough time for things to set in. I suggested to my friends who I had regularly seen one to two times a week that we try to meet via video call occasionally. They don't seem to really want to make an effort to do this. I know that I shouldn't let this be a concern, but as an introvert, it is slightly stressing me out.",6.315052631578947,5.418656715789479,7.470526315789478,75.34368421052635,66.05263157894737,10.968421052631578,31.63157894736842,10.355215969177356,2.919168421052631,368,12,77,8,5,126,68,95,0.052000000000000005,0.887,0.061,-0.068,0,1,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,1,1,1,4,0,1,5,0,11,0,0,1,0,13,18,3,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,2,0,2,3,1,10,2,14,12,1,10,0,0,1,0,8,4,0,2,5,55,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.216487400634884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15116810813247275,0.22151664828895265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207585914159923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18060262822719286,0.0,0.0,0.2233865438893705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33406241900852524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23762950875687225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22107335856195046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14431139961506348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14649887880914894,0.16442553639365115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2769992582194539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968152059285587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476498841181507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14362991189729027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521293145437327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467817643602823,0.0,0.21119045428713928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1275170221520548,0.0,0.3468361151415177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,erikrthecruel,2020/03/26,"My Experience  

I drove out here out of an abundance of caution. Didn’t want to risk going straight home, not with dad’s age and health. We had a little get together before I left school. I wasn’t too worried about it- after all, no one there had it, and I was coming out here anyways. So, the plan was to spend a couple weeks out here alone in the boonies, long enough to be sure I wasn’t infected.

When I say out here, I really do mean out here. Woods or fields on three sides, an empty house on the fourth. An empty cabin in the woods. One store near enough, but they were sold out after the supply chains went to hell. Wifi sucked, phone signal was in and out.

At first, the only thing I minded was the loneliness. Had been a week without seeing another human face, which is never fun. I worked out like crazy, watched a ton of Netflix, smoked and drank way too much to kill the boredom. Took long walks in the winter woods, since spring hadn’t had time to make it out here yet and there was most of a foot of snow on the ground.

The economic news wasn’t great either. Any time economists use phrases like “Black Monday” three Mondays in a row you know you’re in deep shit. Unemployment claims for the first week came to almost three and a half million people. I still had a job after graduation, I hoped…anyways, that was my biggest worry.

At first, I put the cough down to the weed. The reason it was getting worse every day was that I was smoking every night. And of course it was a dry cough, it was because the smoke was irritating my throat. Made sense.

Then, when my throat started to hurt and my nose stuffed up, I put it down to allergies. Timing seemed about right. Gotta be allergies. Nothing to worry about. Same with when my eye swelled shut from conjunctivitis. And if the cough was deeper now, and I was starting to cough up thick green mucus, well, that could surely be allergies too, right?

I’ll be honest. There’s nothing quite like being driven to your knees from a coughing fit, and looking down to see your own blood splattered on the floor in front of you, to tell you that you probably aren’t dealing with allergies.

When my buddy tested positive, I knew that last meet up had been a mistake. Started reaching out to other friends who’d been exposed. One was sick, and her boyfriend had lost his sense of smell and taste. Another felt like he had a weight on his chest and a brutal cough. More were holed up at home in their rooms, terrified to come near their parents.

Talked to a doctor. Told me to stay out here unless I thought I was about to die. Something real eerie about that. Can’t shake the feeling that the world is ending. And to be honest, part of me worries a little that one of these nights I’ll realize I’m drowning in my own lungs and be too far gone to do anything about it.

Just glad dad is safe.",3.1003511904761893,5.004051951785719,3.3939285714285745,91.50940476190478,75.01785714285714,6.166666666666668,22.559523809523807,6.9077264865688965,0.522184523809524,2223,61,461,21,48,685,293,560,0.171,0.73,0.099,-0.9934,5,1,3,0,0,0,72.0,1,6,3,8,31,24,5,2,38,0,50,24,11,4,4,69,85,26,3,4,8,3,4,4,1,1,10,1,3,1,21,35,3,1,9,1,3,14,11,10,1,12,48,15,41,14,87,27,12,107,1,2,7,0,27,55,3,5,40,308,62,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811316560839583,0.08391417778690892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05509762066394447,0.1699168999023633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06667406004993419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049390153674379884,0.0,0.06894360717128713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266738553805252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13958625946130868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468933599133751,0.0896491104296654,0.0,0.0522523755963305,0.0835299459003332,0.0,0.0,0.08408786464848796,0.0,0.0,0.08292927304366532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176129010077792,0.16743441142039442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136528767249433,0.0,0.0,0.07925489359960355,0.0,0.0,0.04096707012538778,0.0,0.07779365976450145,0.0,0.0,0.20675137377007727,0.0,0.0,0.06259726249678005,0.0,0.08466112102855647,0.0,0.04604657138863502,0.0,0.0,0.08932685021392978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612241326689149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1625429970379312,0.0,0.0,0.09348831006953537,0.08673554145352505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08040166134732378,0.0,0.08963864710708806,0.0,0.044527477172627485,0.06604360278080125,0.0,0.0,0.08803045201766435,0.0,0.0,0.1583326882545679,0.16241031154745994,0.0,0.14340353443592965,0.0680379287461273,0.0,0.08844489507237929,0.0,0.0,0.07666481165962859,0.05408269861538252,0.0,0.0,0.08825652188077199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818089484648778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059560365278724735,0.0,0.062489027759613264,0.0,0.0,0.1520669919948614,0.0,0.15548525620526316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21960994713544807,0.06162075035770233,0.0,0.0,0.08996515051036402,0.08773874303737511,0.0,0.05617033318846952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735523299832622,0.0,0.0,0.1628986288711857,0.0,0.08617668610559379,0.0,0.09222057697279216,0.0519046570088269,0.08330393224226654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383843949916793,0.0,0.06443180874656662,0.0,0.08199841439418985,0.12912781225144002,0.07375922826298759,0.0,0.0,0.0831677410207263,0.06702209248652252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237456073305168,0.0,0.0,0.1720429983378179,0.08635848720199385,0.06470413564024996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527242260405241,0.0,0.0,0.06512227542782834,0.07081664791160447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053827301640862656,0.0,0.0,0.06432228035035732,0.14173343651586706,0.0,0.0,0.07741982773830036,0.09001823089022465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997684454140142,0.0,0.0,0.04778877272187977,0.06431135495524444,0.19497246718724395,0.09866275778401412,0.07284835273332428,0.07510804527985221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810214988238946,0.0,0.05898485496468171,0.3291263925303623,0.08256816352207104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,MyDadIsYourDad,2020/03/26,"The affect quarantine has had on my mental health &amp; some things I do to help I've had a long history with diagnosed depression and mental health issues. When the year started I was definitely in a much better place however just before this all went to shit I can't say I was. At that time it was genuinely worse than it had been in a long time, life just kept on piling on, but I kept on going thinking that with time and effort things would get better, and then world got sick.

Before going on I just want to say that I consider myself very lucky in this case, I haven't lost my job and have been working from home for the past 2 weeks, I don't have to worry about money, food or rent at the moment. 

All of the issues that I was dealing with before are still present, just in a distant way. Being at home for two weeks has made everything feel distant, I feel static. Living the same day week after week with little variation and no end in sight; any progress I had made in life and all of my plans, one of which was finally moving out of my homophobic parents place, have been put on hold indefinitely. 

I never realised how I took for granted going out every day, even if its just going to work.

Depression is the devil I know, I know how to recognise it, I know how to deal with it and so when I can feel it coming on I immediately get to work, over the years I've come up with a five point system, a lot of the time when I'm feeling down and don't know why is due to either a lack of:

1. Good food
2. Water
3. Sleep
4. Exercise 
5. Sunlight/Fresh Air

However all of those are external factors that can help mitigate the affects of depression, when depression in internal, when its something you can't run away from they're merely band-aids on a far more serious ailment. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be entirely honest I don't know where I'm going with this post, I just needed to get my feelings and story out there.

Some of the things I've been trying in order to help weather the sunny storm that is this pandemic and enforced isolation lie in variety and productivity. Things which personally help me out a lot, and if they can help you then all the better for it. I try to not let myself get stagnant, spending days on end doing nothing but watching movies and YouTube, its easy to do so but I'm left worse off in the long run, instead I try to do something different, go for a run, bake, cook, take up one of my many abandoned hobbies and small projects, things I can feel proud of, things that have an easily achievable end result that I can look at and know that I did something, and its something to be proud of. 

All of that along side keeping up with my list of 5 and being strict with myself, making sure I eat and eat good food, making sure I keep moving and don't let myself stop, because when we stop we sink.

COVID19_support,heathaleatha,2020/03/26,"Anxiety support needed... 28/F. I have OCD and an anxiety disorder that I take medication for. I’m 100% aware that my anxiety manifests itself in physical symptoms (my whole body gets welts and I shred the skin on my hands from scratching). When I was pregnant last year I convinced myself I had complications multiple times. I didn’t. I know that I do this- but my god I cannot shake this paralyzing fear that I’m sick with COVID19 and I’ve gotten my baby sick. 

My chest is tight and achy, I’ve had sinus pain, a stuffy nose and a headache for days. I feel foggy and shaky and have to try not to concentrate on my breathing or else I can’t take full breathes. My appetite is gone and there is a heavy pit in my stomach. I’m waking multiple times in the night with a racing heart. What if this time these aren't psychosomatic symptoms and I have the virus? Will I not be able to hold my baby for weeks? Did I infect her and now she is going to have breathing problems for life? I take our temperatures twice a day but I read of cases where a fever isn’t present for awhile and get worked up. 

There was just a confirmed case in my suburb tonight and I fear this won’t ever stop. Every time I hold my phone I obsessively look at the news, covidpositive, covid19_support, etc.

I try to talk to my husband and he is caring and loving- but he doesn’t understand anxiety. I just want to curl in a ball and cry- sometimes it’s hard to hold and kiss my baby because I’m so numb with fear. 

As much as I’ve always convinced myself these things aren’t a big deal and I’m normal- as I read this post back I realize how concerning it sounds. Sorry that this is rambly I just need some comfort...",1.913650163877868,4.130558923753668,3.2704441952734165,89.47860746938072,79.99706744868034,6.475107814386753,23.225892703122305,7.618777277803332,1.0296889080558915,1327,45,279,21,34,432,186,341,0.16399999999999998,0.759,0.077,-0.9816,1,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,1,0,0,1,12,16,0,6,14,0,26,24,11,1,1,49,49,28,0,6,10,1,6,0,0,2,11,1,0,0,18,20,0,5,4,3,0,3,10,9,0,1,8,9,44,7,30,38,5,33,0,0,1,2,10,12,0,4,17,174,62,3,0.11173759924046428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09297463368051367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34191583031878714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08591931666553336,0.0,0.06811420338608676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241152833175415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11392392934626915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227385059722014,0.14412301537830102,0.1151965584354006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12806096922118387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09334242630983593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246169596535518,0.0,0.10107305561128344,0.09414374656322973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3772075921417557,0.0564978875151835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675656760761445,0.0,0.06350305264234082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10009494141826067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324095930955147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06140806235188868,0.09108105679968613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892357081693256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09383144152851187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008475458416584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11256387584312144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213999213468963,0.16570402802965042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10485816757461693,0.10947912311698607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11889668367836308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701373294709962,0.0,0.0,0.10691779198072647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2235356740434151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11051134277183364,0.12508109425771086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09341763624352184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679850346762064,0.0,0.23227629834693245,0.2520383061390797,0.08981044972445211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423349592839656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26062037074834005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15172499047125645,0.0,0.0,0.11632278144740893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590573105339627,0.0,0.08962916220261387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12475103917226253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134630303544207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195535044976456
COVID19_support,lorenzo_st_dubois,2020/03/26,"COVID-19 IS AN ANXIETY FARM For the past week or so I have had a feeling of shortness of breath. You know that feeling when you really struggle to get a good, full healthy breath of oxygen into your lungs? It’s been very consistent, but within that I am still able to catch good breath every once in a while. It’s gotten better during my sleep though. Doesn’t wake me up at night and I’ve not hyperventilated.

That being said, there’s also been strange pains in my torso. Now, if this was any normal time in the world I’d attribute it to a sore back as it feels a bit tight, but due to all this panic and scaremongering in the news, I’m always worried with every sensation I feel.

I haven’t experienced any other symptoms, fever, runny nose – I do cough sometimes from this tingle in my throat, but again, in any other time, I wouldn’t seek medical help for this cough as it’s not persistent. I might cough 5-6 times a day, who knows, maybe more, but it’s not the type of cough that would make someone think I have a “cough”.

I’m highly certain that this is anxiety, but knowing something is anxiety doesn’t really make it any better.

Whoever is reading, thank you. I hope youre all keeping safe and doing things to incite calmness in your lives.",5.014337044534415,5.659184672064779,5.479207995951416,83.2752492408907,68.67611336032388,8.280263157894737,27.17839068825911,8.278499904357787,1.6393078947368425,982,29,197,13,16,315,147,247,0.096,0.752,0.152,0.9369,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,6,0,3,9,12,0,2,12,0,20,19,8,3,3,38,38,17,0,5,10,0,5,0,0,3,11,1,0,0,21,5,0,3,8,1,0,1,7,3,0,0,6,8,19,9,26,28,5,30,0,0,0,0,9,15,0,4,14,125,40,2,0.12240428812408265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09788666498937763,0.1018501733223148,0.0,0.0,0.33295645338507257,0.0,0.2809168361389605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941213420016249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21651329153357124,0.13363378019882025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07894063958592999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20626178399639486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475651436515256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395118849414969,0.0,0.0,0.20533381889273114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08204501415791568,0.1293268508648509,0.0,0.12157507696903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10879855542199833,0.0,0.0,0.20181058681293487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108085228964081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634116256153991,0.0,0.12297155967518612,0.0,0.0,0.1233094427007814,0.0,0.12985160631039627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148681325105712,0.11993021347044115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13035657200834408,0.0,0.0,0.13024679270801734,0.14361505863641674,0.0,0.0,0.11684874334833475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12243741246282533,0.0,0.15683064262643265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643450830593947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224926870370814,0.0,0.10371275611060664,0.09423280113037237,0.12106097082426075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775222261195722,0.0,0.0,0.12796353876755495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12722492312577435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11269342296989952,0.0,0.0,0.08131997005343584,0.07843172536138172,0.12026159160139513,0.0,0.2141247742630879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10099635691645444,0.0,0.0,0.09818533662029752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12430749623554553,0.0,0.08695249433275337,0.0,0.0,0.0

Just taking 10 mins out of your day without any Internet, could be whenever your in the shower of if you work out, just after then, and finding 3 solid positives in your life right now and just repeating them to yourself.  It could be things you have started since in isolation like picking up an old instrument, or even reaching out to friends and family that you wouldn't normally have done if it wasn't for the situation.

What are your positives right now?  Mine would be:

1. Reconnecting with my family who I'm isolating with. I haven't really seen in the past 7 months or so. My little brother is now a full blown teenager and it's shocking me every day more and more how much I haven't seen him.
2. I've picked up some new software and I'm learning a lot about concept art, games design and animation (for anyone interested in that kinda stuff, there are a lot of free to use software up there which are taking the industry by storm and actually being used in mainstream companies, will link some in the description)
3. So far no one who I actually know has been infected (I know this may not be the case in 3 weeks, or even a weeks time, but it's right now that matters)

Big shout out to everyone who I've seen on here who have been diagnosed and are powering through it. Also anyone living in any major cities please keep safe.

We are isolated but not alone.",6.293003300330036,6.543103267326735,6.630445544554457,77.50758250825083,65.83168316831683,10.561716171617162,31.684818481848183,10.380263240014207,3.1384442244224418,1242,45,239,29,18,402,171,303,0.035,0.867,0.098,0.9356,3,2,1,0,0,0,29.0,1,8,1,2,20,7,0,0,14,0,29,4,0,5,0,55,42,21,0,7,14,1,0,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,21,16,0,2,5,2,1,0,8,1,0,2,8,4,20,7,38,23,11,49,0,0,3,0,22,29,0,12,20,172,41,2,0.0,0.0,0.21363863415313786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336982711579792,0.0,0.0875368817831776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14887609922188078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1530770307097188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11950437192617284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17479331934103304,0.0,0.0,0.1411881268213982,0.0,0.0,0.111101828827091,0.0,0.11436470114630043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201783505230033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14459750145958136,0.0,0.09222662455626136,0.104595822988511,0.0,0.0,0.20638244052562046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004646771450744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08457022417836631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838478761115407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07337020528812542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729503283403787,0.0,0.0,0.1203151248596502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15463277806740036,0.05347770176507709,0.3291296434205934,0.09665712803029064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.186121696049769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08737168370049472,0.0,0.08046731187368196,0.0,0.0,0.10571927485100828,0.0,0.0,0.1072497149630392,0.0,0.0,0.11486216536391645,0.0,0.07417441961619076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449405579509746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12015662470561182,0.0,0.0,0.10483452944213892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402485765048751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37392048279542295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054826298162752,0.12304009907343705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.077477908550692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530803038490212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16460390330491875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21816546531496292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382828908497233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18908039087062065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17560794834526575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1055176546211714,0.0,0.07968978528011753,0.0,0.0,0.07775880624786465,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sure, she is an OR nurse, but she is in the hospital every single day during this crisis. She is over 60, she smokes, and I am just waiting every day for her to call me and tell me she has fallen ill. 

She is there working in the hospital, being essential, and I am just sitting in my house sewing fucking masks because our government was too selfish and incompetent to bulk up our system in anticipation of this disaster. 

I try to just not think about it but I am staring death in the eyes right now. I'm only 29 and lost my dad two years ago. I haven't given my mom a grandchild yet. It just feels like shit and I feel helpless and useless.

COVID19_support,Straxicus2,2020/03/26,"Need advice My sibling is sick. They got sent home from work and told not to return until they have a doctors note stating they did not have covid19. They go to doctor. Told they were going to be tested. Several hours later they are told they don’t have enough symptoms and aren’t in the high risk group so they can’t test. Doctor says can’t give a note without a test, but even if they tested negative still couldn’t give a note as they aren’t an essential worker. Their job says they are and won’t pay them while at home. So they can’t return to work without a test they can’t get, with no pay in the meantime.  Any suggestions?

COVID19_support,Diytr,2020/03/26,"Need Advice and Small Rant Info: I'm a 20 years old college student with Asthma in NY and I've been in isolation since 3/16/19.

I don't know if I'm getting cabin fever but I've been getting more irritated with my family mostly my mother. every day I wake up to Covid19 this Corona that, a constant update on how many people have gotten it how many have died, which country is at the top of the Most Corona Chart. I get the concern but since were inside anyway can we not focus on it all the fucking time. Then there's the extreme focus on home remedies and other stuff I just don't believe will work in being shoved in my face. for example, my sister boiled some lemon skin with onions and other stuff and told me to put my face in it while it's boiling because it will help my lung or breathing. Then there's my sister daily insults calling me lazy for sleeping most of the time and staying in my room all the time but what am I supposed to do my mother owns the tv in the living room watching African movies or Spanish shows and I don't want to be around that I so I stay in my room. My room which I share with her not that she sleeps there but treats it like her warehouse for her online business, you couldn't do a proper push up in if you tried. But the worst thing of all is at night its hot and theirs no air conditioner when I ask my mother to open the I'mwindow they say no because she's scared of the virus so I sleep hot and sweaty. And when I get up in the middle of the night to get a cold drink from the fridge (which I do a lot) She's yelling at me for doing it saying I can't drink anything cold and got to keep myself warm (which I get but I think it's harmless since I'm not sick) but i'm getting real tired of the drinking something cold is gonna get you sick and then Corona. Due to staying at home all day and not being that active even before the corona outbreaks my astma condition is getting worse, so since there is no ventilation since the(cuz closed windows) I suggested going outside to get some fresh air note not talk to or be around anyone just get some air and be away from my family and my mother and I get into an argument. she even agaiinst me going outside with my older sister for a food and supplies run. I'm kinda getting stressed and don't want a huge argument since were going to be in close proximity for god knows how long.

Tl;dr: Getting tired of family need coping methods and Advice.

Right now: my asthma is in control, I'm going to start some light exercise and I gonna put a fan in my room not that's its gonna help with ventilation issue. I don't know what I can do to be less irritated and angry.",4.001105785858987,4.7175844552102415,4.86635209249469,86.50477938633331,70.99268738574041,7.083531795049162,25.935520529670445,6.885778809224403,1.0087682098917936,2095,61,435,16,37,681,239,547,0.14,0.809,0.051,-0.9946,0,1,5,0,1,0,34.0,1,3,2,3,21,10,2,2,26,0,36,24,9,4,4,83,78,45,1,7,20,7,4,1,0,5,8,3,8,0,27,34,6,2,5,6,0,8,16,5,0,0,7,12,57,5,61,58,16,76,0,0,1,1,31,43,1,14,23,287,84,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13806249856639274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0493950329839658,0.0,0.05813294015739433,0.12577399746941978,0.0660414079826532,0.0,0.06637116170926242,0.0,0.0,0.08612629396700644,0.0,0.06011175241048326,0.07959015549758412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07213411637678871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763396850152006,0.0792318183708342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911174217183785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07331599125525955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2076089175754018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933177018247663,0.0,0.059519539160582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19978701069279015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854214585304161,0.0,0.0,0.06530805715783129,0.5167106840512701,0.0,0.16059154501669487,0.0,0.056499437245517724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09470065348000516,0.0,0.14172081785229315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07373264707289158,0.0,0.06279049618001524,0.0,0.0,0.11647017583288677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034512465133999484,0.0,0.06237881679643121,0.06251658500681752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060057915108398474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14324126237451754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10476136488527067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258681620605714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07412765220824435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048974767929546865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420308923260115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08040688205315008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06032849767018539,0.0,0.11235585411452777,0.07072568735123733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35061833242112944,0.0,0.21208121470866104,0.0,0.0,0.05438421784608016,0.0,0.0,0.05000128145479035,0.22588722352456625,0.0,0.0,0.08092099812330479,0.0,0.16173802863358142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0567799431671633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04693188479565782,0.0452650031298126,0.0,0.0,0.12357701596554985,0.16238683143944802,0.0,0.06750214715491643,0.0,0.047961770386563365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333381416268193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05142874217178875,0.0,0.07199096778176843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045491596152185655
COVID19_support,SlightlyKarlax,2020/03/26,"Plans for after. The last few weeks have given me a lot of time to reflect. Like most y'all I'm a bundle of anxiety and sadness. I'm grateful I get to keep working at the hospital as it's keeping me on an even keel. 

It's made me think what do I want to do when this is all over?

For me, that's applying for my Clinical PhD in psychology. I've been browsing the MIT Online Course Library for biology, who knows maybe consider avenues if that goes well.


Also, it's living more genuinely. I've made a lot of comments about considering moving back to Europe to be closer to the family, setting up a clinic for the poor and getting a little cabin in the woods to escape to as needed. 

What's everyone's plans when this is over? 

It can be small things too. 

I'm excited to watch a Chelsea game, sit at a coffee shop and hug a friend.",2.0753682170542653,3.805091924418608,4.318046511627909,84.52772868217055,77.43023255813954,7.377364341085273,24.83875968992249,8.238735603445708,1.5790289922480618,649,23,134,12,15,225,109,172,0.046,0.836,0.11800000000000001,0.8738,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,0,3,8,6,0,0,15,0,9,3,0,2,1,17,23,9,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,12,3,0,2,3,2,2,1,0,1,1,0,4,1,8,5,29,17,6,21,0,1,1,1,5,11,0,4,8,90,20,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613160942399496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15431590134399684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15511088540990026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13323472173758494,0.0,0.0,0.19275292076444847,0.0,0.0,0.1901644686622813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15584903158011232,0.0,0.21078164121739212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585975274881422,0.0,0.0,0.11086050602319096,0.1644294195130169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098550620057944,0.20217728989824407,0.1781232099735782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3429917133035659,0.0,0.3817462993382313,0.0,0.0,0.20265571118955367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21439734421908666,0.0,0.14957345740842348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13401437217371215,0.1292545782530387,0.0,0.0,0.1176250522917859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1189801862260376,0.0,0.16180830164088106,0.0,0.18137127364441893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14685518435589562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,KLWK,2020/03/26,"I think I figured out exactly why this is making me have panic attacks. I am immunosuppressed, have asthma, and have bronchiectasis, which, basically, is a form of COPD. I'm used to my lungs not working so well on a normal day, and I cough a lot just on general principles. I use inhalers and a nebulizer semi-regularly. I also run a fairly low resting temperature of 97.1 and don't get fevers easily- last time I have pneumonia, I was running 99.8 in the hospital.

So, when I get sick, because, despite the fact that I'm socially isolating (12 days and counting), I'm under no illusions- I will get this illness eventually-how will I know I'm sick with it? I could just have a cold. And how will I know when things are starting to get serious enough I should be hospitalized- as a matter of course, I've had to learn how to treat things at home, under doctor guidance, of course.

So, I'm afraid I won't recognize I'm sick, or how sick I truly am, until it's too late.",4.046361607142857,5.285576151041667,5.922113095238098,77.03062500000003,71.34375,9.44404761904762,29.86011904761905,9.784248007369934,2.906361904761904,759,31,148,19,14,263,118,192,0.171,0.777,0.052000000000000005,-0.9673,0,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,1,13,7,1,2,9,0,20,10,1,6,2,31,37,18,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,1,0,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,2,4,5,1,0,2,2,18,2,18,28,4,19,0,1,0,0,1,8,0,2,9,99,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512968374391624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21523330282521272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532973550572075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15105448059765178,0.0,0.0,0.2440264793181385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19364610988786726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19548599211675327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39538021121428796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18977508128726348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.207950037933168,0.1542167957356598,0.2134169060437151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16084434022274408,0.0,0.0,0.1262871820134297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853680684028864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22197614131289106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928574992956195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391112747373465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.251381621614494,0.12122664515500363,0.0,0.0,0.11031942286485194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3268024240495985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17010640031921756,0.0,0.17071642459586875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13773408697549375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,areyoufuckingkid,2020/03/26,"Today has been my tipping point I know I’m not the only one but I guess I just need to get this off my chest. 

This June I was set to graduate from college and start working my dream job that I’ve wanted for 6 years. It’s been pushed off three times throughout the 6 years. Life happened 🤷🏻‍♀️ Last year I found out about the program and got in right away. I’ve been kicking ass in school and was ready for clinical rounds. I was going to be a surgical technologist.

Welp the virus was getting worse and worse and the hospitals stopped taking students. We were told hopefully May we can go to clinicals. I’m angry that my plans have been pushed off for who knows how much longer. I was hoping to live with my boyfriend and start living my life. Now it’s all fucked up and I just want to scream and cry. 

Today I’ve been on the verge of tears. I’m just sad that it’s all been out put off again when I was so freaking close. Part of me wants to give up but I know I have to keep chugging along. I just want this whole fiasco of a virus to be done. I know everyone wants it to be over. It feels like there’s going to be no happy ending in the world again. 

I’m probably being over dramatic about my feelings but that’s where I’m at. Sorry if this is all rambly. I’m really trying to keep hope up and be positive but it’s not easy",0.5955005889281466,2.670668226148408,2.182286219081273,96.2184705535925,84.05300353356891,5.610789163722028,18.267255594817435,6.88968998030894,-0.05937210836277984,1040,25,242,13,30,338,153,283,0.182,0.713,0.105,-0.9797,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,2,0,0,2,16,9,1,0,9,0,26,7,2,1,3,52,64,17,0,10,11,0,3,1,0,1,4,1,0,0,15,16,0,3,7,1,0,6,3,4,0,2,17,4,23,5,40,40,6,46,0,1,1,2,5,23,2,6,17,150,38,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658251182900663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12461073185791907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609057242238907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047595811460533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10839871131287117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11471938746407627,0.08104300156930258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12438331930219294,0.0,0.10487531926961276,0.11853754633528475,0.1088239222837989,0.19341514227245712,0.0,0.09072994631209284,0.0,0.12496917431040246,0.0,0.10031640340837936,0.1207611394594019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3380205667503088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11257370020150756,0.20166495898238035,0.0,0.0,0.2493790691367442,0.09247038699307723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.160254906843427,0.055422040667390295,0.0,0.20034276356977604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339293731525134,0.0841158202188663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07687124847861664,0.08627776790573519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12284665253469093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723937635587204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12230968422537132,0.0,0.0,0.11404056273516228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267386269460771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687886502160473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148093803576332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12698905346438571,0.16058969091020014,0.0,0.0,0.094842608100335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08529428081120191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06614895398716247,0.0,0.21505954057331608,0.10839871131287117,0.0,0.07701968487395937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33455521212124456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266539637920342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08258714145891842,0.0,0.2312142194766245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191588241102343
COVID19_support,eyeseemanipulator,2020/03/26,"One of my roommates is a nurse in an understaffed, overtaxed ICU, I'm worried about her &amp; our friends. I'm living with my father right now, for the forseeable future, keeping him company after the loss of one of his parents recently and helping him with the gradual shuttering of his business. I'm worried about him, dealing with the grief and stress of losing a parent all while going through this. It can't be good for him, of course, and I've been urging him to sleep well and eat well, to stay home as much as possible. I'm fortunate he agrees with me and is taking this virus seriously. It's been stressful, with online classes on top of everything, but I'm managing well, I think.

The four of us were renting out a house a few hours away, me, my buddy, her (his girlfriend), and a friend of hers. She's working at a hospital, under a contract for another year, that she has a laundry list of complaints about; thin staffing, poor pay, awful hours, and a lack of support for nurses in general seem to come up a lot. I doubt she has access to any kind of suit, might not even have masks: I haven't spoken to her too much recently about her work. She had been making up her mind about quitting, and despite not taking this very seriously before things may have ramped up to the point where she goes through with it. I hope she does. It's understandable for a person to panic at the idea of medical staff leaving en masse, but I won't wish for my friend to put herself in harm's way. What's worse, the hospital is a ""teaching hospital"" that serves as a sort of overflow protection for other hospitals in the area; they're light on experienced staff and support for them, and heavily burdened by the flu season we're already going through (which is apparently quite bad this year).

The viral load you're exposed to matters in how sick you may get, right? There's a difference between having your faced coughed on working over a dying patient, possibly without a mask on, and, say, touching a chair somebody not yet displaying symptoms touched hours prior. Yes, you'll possibly get sick in the second and, yes, you'll still have to face some possibility of dying, but the statistics we've seen out of Italy and China about medical staff and infection rates is really disconcerting. She and every other nurse is potentially in line to be the next forgotten national tragedy, tens of thousands of women and men sickened severely working in a system that doesn't support them properly.

I feel guilty, too, for being grateful to be with my father. We may get sick eventually, yes, but I'm not nearly as worried about myself here as I was there. I was, not without reason, still, scared of the likelihood of catching it from her. I'm glad I'm not living with her right now, as worried as I am about her, and I don't like that feeling. I also feel guilty for being frustrated with her over this, the virus. She wasn't concerned about it: didn't start following it early like I did, and I kept to myself about it for fear of seeming panicked or worrying others. It's just the flu, more worried about the panic, media exaggeration, less air pollution here etc.. I wish I had tried harder to convince her to be concerned. I also feel like, if I had, I would feel guilty for scaring her and my other roommates. I wish there was something I could do. I have some masks I won't need I'm going to mail back, but I've been hearing some hospitals won't let nurses bring masks from home! That's outrageous. I wish I could do more for everybody. (Just want to add, not a hoarder; only bought a pack of 10 masks. Now that I know you can sanitize them, with heat or iso alcohol, I want to give most away)",7.991569020866772,6.776178598314612,7.889219903691817,74.73362921348317,62.87640449438202,11.002311396468695,36.63499197431781,10.025080133382057,3.5040504333868365,2910,116,549,51,35,938,327,712,0.207,0.7090000000000001,0.083,-0.9985,4,0,2,0,0,0,102.0,3,5,3,9,35,36,2,9,39,4,54,15,3,3,1,96,103,38,3,13,19,4,8,3,4,10,11,2,3,3,27,34,2,3,12,0,4,8,18,19,3,6,17,13,76,17,116,67,14,70,0,3,1,0,58,37,0,17,25,389,103,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581792012916197,0.0,0.0,0.06796293767816726,0.0985024231951746,0.0,0.06672963773640249,0.0,0.04188136540413839,0.06457948353662919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11572628598738567,0.047356707180431064,0.051422687305249265,0.0,0.0,0.05240611789448075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05305186564727254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834463578487053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349363446703359,0.0,0.0,0.12783545071308833,0.06434545051996267,0.0,0.0,0.053895319043327714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06301901689499828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06868593812264591,0.04067772346808037,0.0,0.05188981956431283,0.0,0.05535054801182583,0.0,0.0,0.06930265191637433,0.1557015359994581,0.04399786332645237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427462089470232,0.0,0.09653021226489887,0.059079994158368676,0.105004168530121,0.05165636894220472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06941317996473848,0.0,0.04128056005643922,0.0,0.12355384081556503,0.061169923824092164,0.1819527739219216,0.0710632878127136,0.0,0.06952438181075866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05474147755654105,0.0,0.06413352640872415,0.03384668012010186,0.0,0.0,0.06521188611815644,0.0,0.06297702073675243,0.0,0.09026509346911547,0.0,0.1087651414594888,0.0,0.0,0.06890025346836283,0.0,0.05235918191462593,0.0,0.0,0.04110989250457713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408512344548238,0.0,0.06533422033914356,0.06218545234255465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054726471971204,0.0456660820788744,0.0,0.0,0.06549861940833683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08346607649776465,0.04683979328161726,0.0,0.14451847230201645,0.13677045566610205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05377551292707384,0.0,0.0,0.05821975164733832,0.2777209755168761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191208365601712,0.0,0.1310110032561876,0.0,0.0,0.039454297302999465,0.0633218346599684,0.12161973668170233,0.0,0.0,0.1577852367226583,0.0,0.04897656365641199,0.12331893717511175,0.0,0.0,0.11213323383421336,0.0,0.06957593527865641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616316149812133,0.0,0.0,0.04741278731284766,0.0,0.0,0.043591692900602816,0.06564369413182539,0.09836713510504028,0.0,0.14109571582043562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20966506133917376,0.0,0.06401261714283818,0.09261172555288924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040915757551305415,0.039462550922093935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0418136236678389,0.0,0.0,0.06411438211109552,0.07408174337270891,0.0,0.0,0.050815838353646337,0.0726513787151651,0.04888500309194683,0.0,0.0,0.16612269875623498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28328867476884256,0.11873560559081185,0.0,0.1793446783594075,0.3752683657734694,0.06276255463567494,0.0437497354495137,0.0,0.0,0.07932019465610457
COVID19_support,Thekellbelle,2020/03/26,"I'm not sure fully if this allowed, if not I will happily delete it. Desperately need help getting bare essentials (ignore the couple that aren't) items for my baby. Details below Tldr: Broke, issues with husbands job, family now unable to help, obgyn warned incredibly unlikely I'll make it past 34 weeks, currently 25,have nothing but a few clothes, am completely broke atm. I hate this virus.
(please no hate on me not being able to afford my child please) 

So on Halloween we found out I was pregnant. We are/were not ready, but decided to continue with this pregnancy happily because she is honestly our little miracle. I was told at 17 I had around a 1% chance of ever conceiving naturally, so we were simply thankful for her. 

We thought we were okay. We had 1000$ in savings, okay insurance once I hit 15 weeks, and my husband had an okay stable ish job. All of that has since changed. Our vehicle keeps breaking down every few weeks and fixing it has used up all of our savings. Our insurance has decided none of my now many medications will be covered. 

All this money we thought we would have to prepare for our little girl is gone. And now we are having issues with his job. They refused to close their store front (he works front and back) until this Friday. We had a shut in order placed on Tuesday. He decided to take Tuesday and Wednesday off, and have his weekend on Thursday and Friday and go back in Saturday when the chances were less. 

I am very high risk. I am pregnant, have diabetes, have asthma, and an auto immune disorder due to a skin condition. I hate it but it is what it is. Every time he goes to work it puts me and our unborn child at risk. He had 15 hours of pto we thought would be more useful now, than when I gave birth. This morning his job called him. Upset he had been calling out even though they told people they wouldn't be getting in trouble for it if they felt it was unsafe to come in. 

They informed him that they are now forcing anyone who calls in for feeling unsafe, to take a minimum of 7 days. To dissuade people from just taking a vacation, because getting pto is almost impossible for them. So now our next paycheck will be even shorter. None of our debt places will take late payments. 

Due to what's going on our family (his I have zero contact with mine) have mostly lost their jobs, or desperately need the money they are getting to stay afloat. So having a baby shower to try to get things is unfortunately out of the question. 

This pregnancy, though a blessing, has been a nightmare. I had a bleed at 12 weeks. I had the flu, strep, and a sinus infection all before 15 weeks. Then I got diagnosed at 17 weeks with gestational diabetes. I have pre existing high blood pressure. Then at 23 weeks we thought we were losing her because I started leaking fluid, thankfully I wasn't it was just bacterial vaginosis but it was just another thing to go wrong. My insurance won't cover any of my insulin or testing supplies, or my blood pressure medication. All of our ""extra"" money right now is going to that stuff. 


I am making prefold cloth diapers, a few onsies, and some cloth wipes, and burp cloths from extra fabric and old clothes I have around the house. I'm not buying maternity clothes at all, and just altering what I have and wearing a lot of dresses. We are trying to get by with as little as possible. 

Unfortunately due to everything I've had going on with this pregnancy at my last ob appointment (last week) my wonderful ob sat me down and explained my chances of going full term, of even going past 34 weeks, is very unlikely. They are sure I will develop pre eclampsia at some point. My blood pressure just keeps going up, as do my meds for it. 

I am freaking out that at almost 25 weeks I have only a few clothes for my little girl. If anyone is able to help I put a list together with a few bare needs, and one or two would be wonderful to have items. We have a family member who is willing to loan us their used car seat (no accidents not expired yet) and our insurance will thankfully cover a breast pump. If I'm not producing in the first 24 hours, my hospital charges the insurance company and gives you free formula. 

If anyone is able to help, or even point me in a better direction for help, you would be a literal life saver. This is causing me so much stress.

COVID19_support,marinego,2020/03/27,"I feel kind of guilty but stressed as I feel my mom isn't taking quarantine seriously I (22F) just need to get this out of my chest.

I started quarantine on friday 13th and to this day I've only left the apartement once to stock up on food and snacks. But she is going out almost every day. She now works from home but she told me she gets side money from driving our neighbour (F) to get groceries.

I understand that she wants another source of income as her office job doesn't pay well (on top of that we're from Venezuela, to get you guys on social context), and my job got suspended as I work in the entertaiment field, the business decided to help the employees so I'm still getting paid some money and have a little bit saved up.

What troubles me is her, going out almost every day with our neigbour. Why doesn't she (my neigbour) makes one big purchase a week instead of doing it daily? Putting my mom at risk with her, as well as me.

My mom tries to explain herself, telling me she uses the mask and carries and uses her alcohol gel and that they don't get into crowded spaces; but that doesn't stop me from worrying and I discovered i'm kinda hypochondriac as I have to mantain myself distracted, because just taking a glance at news about the virus triggers a big worry and sometimes start getting a headache if I get too worried, or a discomfort in my throat like getting the flu. One day I got what I think it was a panic attack because suddenly my heart started beating really fast and my breathing got heavy,but that only lasted like 5 seconds until it went away and hasn't happened again.

I feel guilty about feeling this way, because I'm scolding her every time she has to go out but I know she is worried about the money. I just wish she wouldn't have to leave the apartment too often.",7.983852526926262,6.467373943661972,7.811019055509528,76.25518641259323,63.08450704225352,10.268434134217069,36.657000828500415,8.841846274778883,3.1020787075393526,1430,56,270,17,17,459,186,355,0.158,0.769,0.073,-0.9885,4,2,1,0,0,0,31.0,2,1,1,4,16,14,1,5,16,0,16,8,4,4,0,53,57,26,0,5,10,3,4,2,1,1,2,0,1,1,13,18,3,1,9,0,6,6,7,8,2,3,7,5,49,6,47,49,2,49,0,0,1,0,31,25,0,7,19,176,62,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08921411930689813,0.1671851742976945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08753545748192054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09496989922420143,0.07843166925331321,0.0,0.0,0.15266485085851322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09113791285124402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21534929627224508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2110050520134674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1688388254343316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094365399149287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3925309941496569,0.0,0.14232984574085975,0.0,0.2002983702974882,0.0,0.0,0.08265775693803354,0.0738205812359797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892352244354474,0.055954499970578664,0.0,0.08373667136331663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16568089960183047,0.0,0.0,0.08693097663025269,0.045878109676688,0.0680468745191751,0.0,0.08839265927814326,0.09070064124444784,0.0,0.0,0.08156766224354317,0.08366831627258528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055723165475295884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29331028644956514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061898937050400775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890286484156694,0.11313563983999247,0.12697973129312415,0.0,0.09794512045276707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08391988089242734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05347905828461553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08509676259352071,0.0,0.0,0.08256328745810543,0.0,0.17726150341391345,0.0,0.06666677790727209,0.06979253858814231,0.09562540110804324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12553227930142988,0.0,0.0729646983418413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05349024580553936,0.0,0.0,0.04867752496673464,0.0,0.0,0.07976816953625862,0.0,0.0566770509191995,0.0,0.0,0.08690502713732833,0.0,0.14419884316610254,0.0,0.0,0.049238328678465816,0.0662620831774156,0.06696216060682637,0.0,0.15011605995589766,0.0773862647908776,0.0753271981007134,0.0,0.0959972207398981,0.0,0.0,0.12154803358123957,0.3391096395482049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,GeneralsAndMajors,2020/03/27,"My girlfriend works in healthcare and we live apart. Are we able to be still seeing each other or is that extremely ill advised? My girlfriend is not in direct contact with COVID patients, and is seldom in contact with patients at all now, but does work in a COVID building. I have been working from home and have sheltered-in-place for over 2 weeks, only leaving very sparingly to get groceries or pick up food. 

Up to this point, we've been still hanging out at my place a majority of the nights. She has severe sleep anxiety and when she's not with me, is really struggling to sleep with all that is going on right now. Plus, her roommates are loud and stay up late. 

My roommate, unfortunately, is still continuing to go home to see his family and hang out there every so often. He's alternating being at the apartment and going home just to ""mix things up"" IE not get bored. 

I feel kind of overwhelmed with what we all should be doing here. Personally, I understand that I am at a higher risk myself by seeing her, but I am willing to take that risk. I do not want to ban her from coming here. I especially do not want to ban her from coming here so my roommate can continue to go home.

Any advise on how to deal with this? just a lot of anxious people here trying to cope with this as best we can.",4.484314236111112,5.592308039062503,5.213697916666668,83.01428819444446,70.171875,7.720138888888887,27.112847222222207,7.984000788550335,1.5900258680555552,1022,33,201,13,18,331,142,256,0.1,0.841,0.059000000000000004,-0.7103,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,4,0,0,4,17,7,0,4,6,0,25,4,2,2,3,49,41,17,0,3,11,0,1,0,2,2,1,1,4,1,10,24,1,2,2,0,0,8,5,5,0,0,2,5,25,2,47,34,7,42,0,1,3,0,20,22,0,4,11,152,35,5,0.11569575969528935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07867708396944666,0.0,0.0885069394936764,0.1307032769669619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12141556193906633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19932330514963706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11927724806208295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012461389693139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747866746048044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906766558179064,0.0,0.058499252370557725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13989977186500502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12089251854881038,0.0,0.2630102657786456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4642091209200794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204793299794692,0.0,0.0,0.13050985628886824,0.12250510436837887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216147545551818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09836039757341587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085726330283276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799183869886869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020887231801982,0.10102107477244254,0.12087744429437206,0.0,0.10936988908640866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411766622004339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09880354662888603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765836238899261,0.0,0.0,0.1307032769669619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315586275785739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12331628602452314,0.2771843494288904,0.0,0.0,0.12095032827609806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698881277590853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686312185560902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854982636397842,0.0,0.0,0.12044336607290765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954611183887669,0.13648071328410666,0.0,0.09280415976691644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526836729640547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,hoppingwilde,2020/03/27,"I can feel myself slipping I to the dark... Iv been in quirintene for 3 weeks yesterday. I had chemo in December so to go to work is dangerous. My state hasnt been hit that hard abd while one of my doctor's think im freaking out the other 2 think im being safe. So iv decided to take this time in isolation to work on myself, aka work off my antidepressants. And started online therapy. 

But today all i could think about was killing myself. Watching my life savings be so little when I need it. My plans for the year be evaporated. How little people notice me being gone. I always m didnt like people but now that im away its less stressfull but obviously it must be having its toll. Also today i was looking my checking account fall and was thinking i need to go back to work and my first two thoughts were, i cant and its dangerous. And thats where the slipping started.  My normal defenses started of ""my mom couldn't handle it"" but that will only hold so long. Therapy just feels like in filling out worksheets and not helping. I fear that to go back on antidepressants will cement my dependency on them 

I have dealt with this for years, im only 25 but still. I know others have it worse. That im still healthy and its all in my head but i had to get it out there. Im scared. I have no money but more isolation to go. The idea of ending it will only get more and more appealing and the idea that no one will notice or care sounds more and more likely. Im sure this will just fade into the black, but that feels fitting right now.",2.1250795755968177,4.139290500000005,3.6584261715296233,87.99576923076927,78.2948717948718,6.482935455349248,22.617595048629532,7.503015589744147,0.9170465075154732,1204,37,248,17,29,398,156,312,0.11800000000000001,0.823,0.059000000000000004,-0.9424,0,2,0,0,0,1,30.0,0,0,1,6,18,14,4,2,7,0,30,5,1,2,5,55,55,27,1,6,12,1,4,3,0,6,4,1,0,0,23,15,0,3,12,0,3,7,7,7,0,4,11,8,30,7,32,30,8,49,0,0,3,0,3,19,0,2,25,174,53,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06497783755228995,0.06760884148548846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633968350726385,0.12495678081276496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08284264831892739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06487375194320577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316568729327424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196586673490821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09143199348999698,0.12325157637312333,0.05804701901006892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911359309502009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490247241949991,0.0,0.18471136265807028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278655220197744,0.0,0.08338881776014408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05446204140785559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18344904990902444,0.6143687953369835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989418839804598,0.0,0.044654415824280716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05739125799803028,0.11908804656423473,0.16287330984135584,0.0,0.07190617416463542,0.06823189084514378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951623013601266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12049584839516925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961049576404948,0.0,0.18501371050467905,0.0,0.0,0.1101180048952225,0.18538925521488275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11266092644153755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938945017694248,0.0,0.0,0.08134823090603925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17253345743458445,0.0,0.1297771875657284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765798056514121,0.0,0.06109199614804694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18583932396320446,0.0,0.0,0.2082540623906522,0.0,0.06450564990231465,0.047379163101523285,0.0,0.15403631403361653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937218246329376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0651760978231603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23661203447178025,0.0,0.08280354832292874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10464828287052463

I feel like I'm on the verge of cracking. Upper management can't see / understand the work I do, because they don't understand computers much. I'm drinking so much. I'm so tired. Starting to feel really depressed. Can't think straight. Can barely write. I don't know what to add. Feeling so down, so down. My life was great before this.

COVID19_support,sombielovesbanana,2020/03/27,"Aerosol Safety Box for medical personnel Hey guys, I whipped up a quick design of an aerosol box for an urgent medical requirement in my city.  It's used for containing the aerosol particles ejected by a patient during intubation procedures that could infect the medical personnel. It's designed for quick &amp; easy fabrication &amp; any decently equipped Maker space or a university lab can manufacture these really cheap &amp; fast by laser cutting. Please share wherever it could help save lives.

COVID19_support,valueyoghurt,2020/03/27,"I’m so stressed about my symptoms but it might not even be covid19! There are no tests available for the masses in UK so I don’t know if I have it. I’m so scared that I might. Last time I went our was exactly one week ago and I’ve been gradually feeling more unwell since Wednesday. I also suffer from severe anxiety, but I am a very self aware person so I usually am able to sort myself out with that.  
I’m so exhausted today that I can barely think straight. Every time I eat, I run to the toilet soon after (diarrhoea), but temperature is perfect and I’ve no cough. Just EXTREMELY tired. It’s a tiredness I’ve never experienced before and it’s crazy how bad I feel. I get weak every time I get out of bed.

COVID19_support,LimeGrenade,2020/03/27,"I feel like I'm going to fail my family. I'm at work right now, and as I type this I'm slowly crying at my desk at work (my job is still open). In my current situation I feel that my family is in a good place, my wife stays and works from home, our son who is 14 is home schooled and enjoys being at home (he misses his time at the library with his geeky friends but they are making it work through Discord and the lot) and my mother in law lives upstairs and doesn't leave the house much either, they are safe in my eyes and I couldn't be happier for the situation. And then there is ""me"", I'm the bread winner of the house, I'm also the only driver, grocery getter, errand runner, etc. I am the one out in the world now, and I never had a problem with my role in this, but now in the world that we live in I am just....terrified of bringing something home to those I care about most. My wife and my mother in law are Diabetic and since 2016 our lives have been one tragic event every year. 2016 we lost a child, stillborn, 2017 the trauma of that stillbirth caused medical issues for my Wife and we were in and out of the hospital all year, 2018 I got demoted from my job. These cascading event have really crushed me and mine, I was never an anxious person but now I always worry about ""What's going to happen now?"" Come 2020 things start looking better, I get my old job back, during my time in my less paying job I turned by passion for art into a side hustle that I really love. Things were going really great, the BOOM this shit happens.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my anxiety is through the roof, mostly stemming from the idea that I'm going to fuck up and get sick and bring it home to my family. I have always been the ""dirty"" one of my wife and I, I don't really get sick, I mean I wash my hands and I'm sanitary but I never put thought into just being ""clean"" all the time. My wife is a clean freak, always reminding me to wash my hands and sanitize, cuz when I DO get sick, I give it to her and she takes getting sick worst then I do. So in our 16 years together I have improved my cleanliness for her. But now that this shit is going on I am so fucking paranoid about being sick. I'm washing my hands more than I ever have in my life, I don't touch my face ever when I am out in the world and I'm the only one going out to make a paycheck and keep us stocked with supplies when needed. And I keep running lines in my head of ""Don't fuck up, don't fuck up, take this seriously, you're gonna fuck this up, cuz you don't try hard enough, you might be fine but the love of your life is gonna get it and shes gonna be BACK in the hospital fighting for her life again, your Son is going to lose his Mother AND Grandmother because you fucking can't just BE FUCKING CLEAN STOP FUCKING UP!"" Over and over and over. I'm at work just like ""Stay away from people, wash your hands, is that cough a sign?, wash your hands, am I hot? Is it hot? WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS cuz if they get is sick it's YOUR FAULT""

\*deep breath\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm crying and can't wipe my face cuz what if...

&amp;#x200B;

My family knows I am trying my hardest out there, they appreciate it more than they can ever tell me. I just don't wanna fail them...I went to the clinic and got some anti anxiety meds, my job is offering non paid leave if you feel unsafe. I'm going to take it week after next. I need to get out of here and not feel like I'm going to bring ruin to all the things I care about.

COVID19_support,elsuzu,2020/03/27,"My test came back negative - I question its accuracy I developed symptoms roughly two weeks ago - first a sore throat, then a cough and temperature (around 100 but only for a few hours on two different days), runny nose and GI issues. The whole thing lasted for almost two weeks, I got a temperature of 100 again yesterday, but also a cold sore, so maybe that's where that came from.

Anyway, the reason I'm questioning the accuracy of the test is that the paramedic that came to test me did the following:

swabbed my one nostril for 2 or three seconds, no twisting or anything as far as I could see, didn't feel it at all besides some tickling - I'm not sure he even reached the back of my throat. Then did a cheek swab like they do with DNA sampled. He then placed the swabs on my dresser before putting it in the thingy. Also, they came after I had had symptoms for 12 days already, would there still be enough viral trace in my body to catch it? (especially the way they did it)

Does anyone know if this could somehow compromise the test result? Or was what he did alright?

The reason this makes my anxiety go up a bit is that I was kinda hoping I already went through it with extremely mild symptoms. I'm scared I'll get it now with a much more severe outcome (I don't really fear that I'll die, I'm young and relatively healthy, but I don't want pneumonia or anything). I'm very relieved that I didn't infect anybody with this, though, so that's a huge plus! But still, I'm worried again.

If this isn't the right subreddit, any advise where I could get my questions answered?

COVID19_support,Streetwearthrow,2020/03/27,"Mental health going downhill fast  

I wasn't exactly in a great spot mentally before this  crisis really started but I was feeling hopeful, I was doing better than  I had been in the past, and had plans to find an apartment with my  boyfriend in the near future. Now it just feels like it's all down the  drain. I knew that this sort of stuff would be difficult but I didn't  know it'd be this bad. Between the lack of any social interaction or a  routine and the anxiety and hopelessness about the pandemic, it's  scaring me how fast I'm becoming non functional. I'm hardly ever out of  bed as I use sleep as an escape, and when I am it's probably to eat  shitty food, go to the bathroom, or to smoke enough weed that I can go  back to sleep (yes I know it's a terrible idea to be smoking at the  moment but I don't think I could cope if I had to be sober). Waking up  usually involves crying until I'm too tired to keep crying. I feel  hopeless, it's only been two weeks but I already can't see any sort of  normal life emerging from this. Am I going to be wearing gloves to touch  the grocery cart handles for the rest of my life? If he survives, will  it ever be safe for me to visit my immunocompromised grandfather? Will I  ever be comfortable going to restaurants again? Me and my boyfriend had  tickets to see RATM in July, and the notion of a gathering like that  happening then, or ever again, just seems laughable. I get that my  concerns are pretty trivial compared to some of the shit healthcare  workers or immunocompromised people have to worry about. I'm just  worried that if heavy self isolation and social distancing like this  keeps up for the next few months as I know it has to, I'm not going to  be able to keep myself going through it. It's barely been two weeks and  I'm cracking, so what does 4 or 5 months look like? ",4.713278688524589,5.376821325136614,5.7039480874316935,81.3300204918033,69.35519125683061,8.395081967213113,29.1844262295082,8.472884824447931,2.072832786885246,1439,51,282,21,24,476,195,366,0.16399999999999998,0.726,0.11,-0.9736,0,1,1,0,0,2,29.0,0,0,0,4,17,16,1,1,19,1,33,11,5,2,6,57,66,28,0,8,16,0,5,4,0,3,4,0,1,1,23,10,2,4,11,1,0,8,5,7,0,2,12,8,28,9,49,41,6,42,0,2,3,0,8,11,1,13,27,196,51,1,0.09192951559633454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10144650643277307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250304460058419,0.0,0.07032582780904667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706881230232322,0.07675730562450761,0.0,0.1015289274409234,0.07822524684372166,0.0,0.0,0.08130418597211353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07339823783090796,0.0,0.20196051241015375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08044813860042581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09406684468377853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09498776391952657,0.0,0.0,0.33262203968391124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13944697577517334,0.06567446431040715,0.0,0.0,0.08402191181145256,0.0,0.11116153516308397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04802937764825242,0.0,0.3657196356094064,0.0,0.0,0.10135261548465847,0.0,0.0,0.08129296703995108,0.0,0.08235078917725595,0.0,0.0,0.0977167762609515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09130675163128624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10377723340916503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451335321043571,0.0,0.0,0.15156617282164486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12986507108891182,0.17964847112469953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07719764006078753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852866593365623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14675452458051305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776808275431777,0.0,0.09007140680011431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991653911363835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08775712467821141,0.06373235110900984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09352536661890187,0.09911556625413677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05889240168079226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203748234559153,0.0,0.14651184355154276,0.08368917836775984,0.09590253384935282,0.0,0.09436432669700086,0.0,0.0,0.1839918119861488,0.18742112838715885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506818429770568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523730141389427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058904721642982924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10565945479993467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17960355771311884,0.0,0.0,0.07939758539172571,0.10124737372522576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474806246169596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867177709059124,0.0,0.06530409029298008,0.0,0.0,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

Here's three things that happened here:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The first patient in the city of Mostar came back from skiing in Italy and developed symptoms. He was admitted to the hospital by a family member without following the proper procedure. He got admitted to the LUNG DEPARTMENT, while having a high fever and coughing. A lot of doctors and nurses had to go into self isolation and one nurse tested positive. The patient kept denying that he went to Italy. Last I heard all cases in the city are related to this one.

&amp;#x200B;

\-A party of 200 people was held by politicians and businessmen to celebrate the 30  year (I, think) anniversary of a company. One of them was infected and spread it further. All cases in the city of Konjic are related to this party. The driver of the infected person has died. This was held after measures were already implemented. Schools were closed, people were told to stay home and work from home. Gatherings of no more than 10 people, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

\-This morning two people (mother and son) who were tested positive escaped from the infectious disease ward in the city of Banja Luka. They were moved there after they complained at the conditions of the student housing they were placed in, and the son treated to jump from the fifth floor. The police are currently looking for them.

&amp;#x200B;

This is along with around 50 people every day who get fined for not sticking to self isolation or being out after 6 pm. Our hospitals are not even close to prepared enough to handle a lot of people at once.",7.277406331687484,9.076723236421726,6.810393552134768,71.57578783038049,64.23961661341852,9.652570432762127,34.355068254429284,9.910423181423305,3.795109904153355,1435,63,214,31,22,447,184,313,0.081,0.847,0.07200000000000001,-0.4723,1,2,0,0,0,0,60.0,2,1,5,2,8,5,0,0,24,0,22,7,1,2,2,39,40,14,1,1,4,3,0,0,0,0,6,1,2,3,12,20,0,3,3,1,0,7,4,3,0,6,19,2,10,2,53,20,8,42,0,0,1,0,25,21,0,4,13,159,22,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815421277416628,0.0,0.0,0.4003120546542087,0.4489369176802793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657799237912641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05681871323186988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451324831057484,0.0,0.15181574886210125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04765450074963782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668867038474365,0.0,0.0,0.07563202743080259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061727638890697274,0.0,0.0,0.07635062706229084,0.08240958575061665,0.04880524939903822,0.0,0.06225755448420359,0.0706073780739408,0.0,0.0,0.0696592014368285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285285841949173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03860574193495473,0.0,0.04199476761994452,0.0,0.059098521968550574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06534282683517813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780714033204489,0.1482402529223272,0.0,0.0,0.08526193673391406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712449318567967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06023218815045602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06524836448894973,0.0,0.0620510261865266,0.0,0.0,0.1256413935592115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853595308070656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07869302036411495,0.1502142573082708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585939219302624,0.06452001479449798,0.07720185626377314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517516038837806,0.0,0.07070507073032369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07478307838871634,0.0,0.0,0.15417182790962486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07875949267642507,0.059010585551051924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680252182236487,0.05555790709908846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04909084337546577,0.04734728188971411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706073780739408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218216161837675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06849901768569362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07122966023347714,0.0,0.05379456499445935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4489369176802793,0.04758429863472066
COVID19_support,give-it-to-me-easy,2020/03/27,"Safely moving food to my parents house I live by myself next to a large super market. The idea is I'll do my parents shopping, bring it to my house. I'll then sanitise the shopping and put it inside a container. I put the container inside my fridge, close it and wait for 3 days(I heard this is how long the virus can survive on surfaces ). when my parents are over waiting in the drive way inside the car, I bring the container over to the back of their car. I leave. My father opens the container using a part I haven't touched, takes out the shopping, puts it in the back of his car. They leave. I pick up the container. Clean everything. Rinse and repeat.

The idea is, I can get them clean food. I can also get them clean food even if I'm infected, because of how I leave the shopping I handled in a container for a minimum of 3 days before giving it to them.

I was just wondering if my plan makes sense at all? Does the virus live for longer or shorter in the fridge?",2.886173469387753,4.493332362244903,3.877295918367349,89.08288265306123,74.86734693877553,6.940816326530613,25.005102040816325,7.645422480735847,1.1787612244897965,757,25,158,10,16,244,100,196,0.036000000000000004,0.87,0.095,0.9211,3,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,5,3,8,2,0,0,21,0,10,4,0,5,1,28,23,11,0,2,4,4,1,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,6,6,3,9,3,4,4,10,1,0,0,0,2,2,25,2,23,21,2,32,0,0,0,0,12,13,0,4,8,102,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09340515203681456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17962443118324262,0.0,0.07120037445335974,0.0,0.09938844651352692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753265262761513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10221272342386922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771454918935167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10497257193605493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4237061334171208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12204666457641085,0.11204548391184906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695437122081922,0.0,0.26370662741696205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3710239366642644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.206273597030187,0.10336458372946794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07796510248278311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12414022684733275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12421843657419494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3890787086625445,0.12648333510994386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3522496644786837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781928428825826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10087795165125853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271063590133337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12666493528783376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Rootbeer_Float,2020/03/27,"With so many of our lives changing suddenly, I'd like to bring attention to the feeling of depersonalization. [Depersonalization](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depersonalization-derealization-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352911) is a feeling of detachment. You may have experienced it in an overwhelming, unfamiliar situation or while intoxicated. It's the third most common mental health symptom after depression and anxiety. 

It's also thought to be a symptom of anxiety and a self defence mechanism of the mind to protect the individual from trauma, such as a car crash or childhood abuse. Many reported the world around them feeling unreal after 9/11 happened.

You may currently feel the world around you is dreamlike/unreal. You may suddenly feel like you're an outside observer of your body and its actions. You feel numb as the world around you changes instantly.

If you feel this way, please don't panic. It means you're obviously stressed, rightfully so, and your mind is trying to protect you as it tries to deal with the situation objectively. Reach out for professional help, even if it's done remotely. Find something, just one thing, that relaxes you and helps clear your mind like working out or journaling. 

Stay safe and keep busy.

On a similar note and for those curious: Depersonalization Disorder is a loss of self/identity with a constant feeling of depersonalization and derealization. Many of us are losing what used to be a part of our identity, such as our jobs.

COVID19_support,Cainheim,2020/03/27,"Not able to see my daughter due to the pandemic. Sorry if this isn't the type of preferred content, I just couldn't find anywhere else relevant

So I usually get my daughter on weekends. For the past two weeks, this hasn't been possible due to my countries health and government officials heavily advising not to travel. I would need to get two trains and a bus to get to her, and the same on the way back with her, which usually isn't an issue at all but given the current circumstances I just feel like it would be highly irresponsible to do that, as a parent and as someone actively trying to prevent the spread of this virus.

I work in a massive UK supermarket almost every day due to the lack of staff we currently have, and as such at a much higher risk of getting the virus than a lot of people, I just feel like that on top of that much public transportation would be putting too many people at risk.

The decision to not go and get my daughter due to this has been entirely my own, I'm not being prevented. I just feel like such an asshole for not doing it. I would love nothing more than to have her with me right now. I know this isn't anywhere near as bad as some peoples situations, and people are losing their lives. 

I just want all of this to be over and for everyone to be safe.",7.977441860465118,6.11454624031008,8.162441860465119,74.83575581395351,63.341085271317816,11.70077519379845,36.22868217054263,10.504223727775694,3.544528682170542,1022,38,204,20,12,336,136,258,0.085,0.815,0.10099999999999999,0.6369,3,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,1,0,1,3,11,9,0,2,17,0,22,2,0,0,2,47,38,16,0,10,12,4,3,3,0,4,1,0,0,0,12,11,0,3,7,2,0,4,10,4,0,2,3,4,21,5,43,25,10,31,0,1,1,1,12,12,0,4,17,153,33,5,0.11868755569732535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884844264897153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912634041856496,0.09909915142475324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654365464827355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914822313060916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09999938462729926,0.11341104571225374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18003598296779644,0.2543712405151925,0.0,0.0,0.10847827570098886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3100467460182137,0.0,0.06745287305858437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12615932162593915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12539991899321146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12387897215296413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06522757666351603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1739542337211196,0.0,0.10480328613755964,0.0,0.0,0.13278101572432144,0.0,0.10090391554670937,0.10712015288839197,0.0,0.0,0.12033055272860417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17449801960544314,0.0880053186650092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138839107126623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131788484876635,0.0,0.11330070168995475,0.32913202785433604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338023859157961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11931377519866257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10135852406772912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457861536113052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334097854174401,0.0,0.0,0.10056358078666776,0.0,0.0,0.13286100150985106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058105946271349,0.0,0.23188099187986505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2614351490980724,0.0,0.07000499543881568,0.09420865726155547,0.09520399805739678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08640595410961882,0.0,0.0,0.3372489370201915,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,hermesthehedgie,2020/03/27,"Stressed for days Hello everyone! I am extremely glad I found this Reddit. I was one of those people not taking this seriously at first...but boy did that change.

I have really bad anxiety and paranoia. Last weds, March 18th, late at night at my girlfriends house I got this extreme pain in my stomach and had really bad diarrhea to where I couldn’t breath. I freaked out. Diarrhea is pretty common for me though, I have stomach issues (never been diagnosed, but I get diarrhea often). But then the fear set in, I HAVE COVID-19! Why was I struggling to breath. Since then, every day I’ve been so stressed. Every day since then my stomach has been hurting. It’s a dull pain. My stomach is constantly gurgling. I’ve been constipated up until today March 26th (8 days later). It wasn’t diarrhea but it was still pretty soft. My stomach still just has that bloated, dull pain, and I’ll get an occasional dull pain in my chest. Later, I started getting constipated again. I keep worrying myself. I see articles and start to get hot with stress. Is this stomach issue Covid-19, or is my stress making me sick?

On top of that, I got pretty sick at the very beginning of February and have had a dry cough every day since then. So even though I’ve had it for that long, I still think it’s Covid. I thought, maybe it’s acid reflux? I get a dry cough after I eat, so it’s not a constant cough. I also seem to struggle breathing through my nose, not to where I need to go to the hospital.

The problem is...these are things I’ve had before. I have bad stomach issues before (it’s an on running joke that everything I eat just goes right through me). I’ve had this cough for over a month. My breathing issues, I’ve always kinda struggled with breathing out of my nose and I snore really bad (I’m 31 and overweight but not drastically, 198lbs, 6ft make).

I’m so scared. I’m almost always fighting with myself to get a hang on things. Set my mind straight, but then I hear the news or my stomach starts to hurt again and I start stressing out. It’s not extreme pain. Just dull. I stopped going out on the 18th and haven’t been anywhere since. I was an Uber and Lyft driver (Bakersfield, Ca) and picked up strangers for weeks up until I decided not to on the 18th. 

Am I just paranoid? Are these symptoms my usual and now they just seem escalated because of my worries? I live with my parents as I help my mom take care of my 88 year old dad, they’ve shown no symptoms, my girlfriend who comes here (who doesn’t go anywhere else) has shown no symptoms, but I know it can just sneak up on you. 

This is very scary. I’m so worried and paranoid.

It's not a platitude--I have significant mental illness, PMDD, IBS, and asthma.  I cannot work and have been in college for about 126 years trying to get some degrees. This week I had an IBS flare, my PMS is horrible, and I have a cold. 

I have learned that to get through hard times, gratitude lists help immensely. 

I am grateful for the fact that this is a mild cold that hasn't gone to my lungs yet. I am grateful for my doctors and therapist.  I am grateful for my DVR and favorite shows, lol.

COVID19_support,burrahobbits,2020/03/27,"The most depressed and anxious I have been in years Trigger warning// panic attacks, suicidal thoughts 

I am on my 17th day of being at home, originally did self isolation which then turned into a mandatory stay at home order. Since March 10th I haven't been able to see my therapist or go to my support group. I was supposed to see my psychiatrist but then couldn't so my meds haven't changed in months and I really needed to adjust my meds because the effectiveness has greatly diminished. So basically I am the most depressed I have been in years and my anxiety is out of control to the point where I have had multiple panic attacks over these 2+ weeks. I feel nothing but yet at the same time feel everything from being sad, scared, alone, worried, helpless, angry, afraid, etc. I can't fill my time with hobbies and activities because I feel so drained and anxious, like I can't enjoy things anymore. I felt like I could barely function in daily life when there wasn't a pandemic going on and now that everything is falling apart I feel even more dysfunctional. This has put me back months on my progress I have made dealing with my mental issues. I feel as bad as I did when I had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital a few years back. Everything just feels so bad. I feel like I am falling into a dark pit and can't escape. My suicidal ideation is non stop. I don't really want to kill myself because my biggest fear is the unknown after you die (hell, nothingness, etc.). My fear basically keeps me alive. But even still I keep saying ""why don't you just kill yourself"" and other bad things to myself. I think I still think these things not because I actually want to go through with ending my life but because I want all the pain to go away so badly. I would go to a psychiatric hospital but the coronavirus... :(",6.792485714285713,6.8174782771428575,7.047000000000002,75.70850000000003,64.8,10.314285714285717,35.214285714285715,10.008157457239328,3.4479428571428574,1447,62,268,29,20,469,176,350,0.325,0.624,0.051,-0.9989,0,2,0,0,0,1,41.0,0,2,0,3,19,26,5,6,14,0,35,3,0,5,1,55,63,25,5,7,9,0,8,3,0,1,3,1,2,1,9,14,0,4,14,0,0,9,11,20,0,0,12,11,48,6,37,45,8,54,1,4,2,0,7,19,1,3,27,188,57,0,0.0778596170654982,0.0,0.07597975487113881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063908204793394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05956239394396266,0.1759184108502422,0.07721581862576501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17715310918254876,0.07315167321490114,0.11973847907204972,0.26003811220525397,0.2373124994814476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236515103849687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08732618107657457,0.06216456873209846,0.0,0.0,0.0502130118418356,0.08026984639021595,0.1341207481793982,0.0,0.08080599006575526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896051076132914,0.0,0.17366810857662499,0.10285108552044883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2099256102041393,0.0,0.0,0.1752274309214503,0.2755771326563585,0.055622925988678996,0.07475744240131664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22124707326951004,0.0,0.0,0.08584050268330617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15619908840367175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08126521165280562,0.0,0.13841041016224867,0.17228026084197506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998910023158584,0.1141148281711034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07367265223415732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17296896473107806,0.0,0.07846418122464996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12429360703520972,0.0,0.0,0.05773191949844132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07470840245983003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828481220688571,0.18270296966941785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360250457917605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827042012135861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09975772880319228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061917092546686835,0.0779510594025803,0.0,0.12408806856519693,0.0,0.08122456115084016,0.0,0.0,0.06440627981566248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08298799224013174,0.12435758152774867,0.06509412618962579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1703315678848885,0.08835417076772133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040101644250446,0.15517940977002226,0.09977859756405116,0.0,0.06181183894638428,0.09080113768269292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468890541539549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13777085825504873,0.0,0.06245428839023931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025619411287404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790702205257645,0.0,0.055309238061783936,0.0,0.0,0.15041712198708718
COVID19_support,DarkDoubloon,2020/03/27,"I need some support and reassurance So I live close to Ottawa, I’ve been stuck inside for a month now and I’m already depressed and anxious every second of every day. I haven’t seen my girlfriend in weeks and I can’t stand having so little human interaction..

I have a hard time keeping myself from the news and I’m trembling nearly every day because of how scared I am, and I’ve never felt so depressed. I’m especially scared not knowing when I’m allowed to see people and have fun again..

Any good news or reassurance is helpful. Thank you.",3.6185565939771536,5.559661551401874,4.92704049844237,80.91357217030117,73.67289719626169,6.250882658359295,26.84215991692627,6.937597516519254,1.3918876427829705,434,16,78,4,9,144,71,107,0.17600000000000002,0.6579999999999999,0.166,-0.0258,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,1,0,0,7,11,0,3,3,0,8,0,0,2,1,20,21,13,0,1,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,8,0,1,2,0,0,0,4,5,0,1,4,4,9,6,8,17,1,14,0,2,2,0,7,4,0,2,9,47,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010498073334818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238945921560735,0.0,0.0,0.2058214206257644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11106056617826766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23499333313061704,0.0,0.3138377932389801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4605056189025918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17492976344001074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528112729993689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16320532741873453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12211727346552716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619377250584658,0.0,0.0,0.1001261680189333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18260098229868696,0.16087599713964282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14542131577385234,0.0,0.0,0.13509064377277594,0.1405151894984313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263067340802658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36480542787941705,0.0,0.1451808394093444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20674562551732764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16773491590961967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10623572065005243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14614081946878316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Throw-me-away999,2020/03/27,"Sorethroat making anxiety too high, wasn't able to sleep. I've been mostly at home, but did something dumb and had a beer with friends three days ago.

We were in an open air place, but were less than 6 feet apart. No direct contact, but could've touched the same stuff. Kept using sanitizer on my hands.

I now have a sore throat and it's giving me strong anxiety. I only slept for two hours and woke up feeling really jumpy.

It doesn't help that my auntie is wearing a mask around me.

COVID19_support,Ravenous222,2020/03/27,"Does anyone know what ""Pre existing conditions"" are mostly affecting people who contract Covid-19? For the most part I am very healthy, as far as I know. I am not nearly as active as I used to be but still not too bad for a 28 year old male. My anxiety is making me worry because as a baby I had a procedure done where 25 percent of my lower intestines and a valve were removed, it's commonly known as short gut syndrome. While this probably doesn't affect a respiratory illness like the flu or covid 19 I'm still worried that I will contract it and develop complications. I work at a hospital, so that doesn't help my fears any.

COVID19_support,rraak,2020/03/27,"How do I cope with all the hassle of staying healthy when my main reasons for trying are gone? I'm not a young guy, I've loved a lot and I've lost a lot. I lost the biggest in my entire life tonight and, while I'm actually quite calm and maybe a little numb, my future no longer really has any interest. I've been through a lot in my life, and meeting her was so wonderful and beautiful, we just clicked... And now it's ended, and my hopes for the future went with it. All my interests and motivations. Too many eggs in the basket I suppose. But there they went. 

I've seen it coming for a few weeks. My fiancee had an extremely traumatic year with the loss of a very close family member and, in her own words, is utterly broken. Little hints here and there, some strange shyness around me the other week, and lots of talk of having to go it alone through this ordeal. She ultimately wants to make major changes in her life and, prior to recently, or maybe tonight? Always seemed to plan to want me to go with. Due to my health potentially causing severe complications if I get sick, we decided to stay apart during the quarantine. Now I'll probably not see her again at all in happy times. 

Tonight we broke up. She seemed to be looking for an opening and took it the first time I said something controversial. I guess it was easier for her to have something to get angry about. Yesterday I came very close to posting in this forum about how hard it was to be away from her, and from her dogs (who adopted me as their own daddy). The whole pack got me through the loss of my own beautiful dog a year ago... And now they're gone to me too.

I guess I'm already a casualty of COVID19. I can't help but feel indifferent at this point about whether I get it or whether it takes me. My future ended tonight and I'm old enough that I don't have the heart or the interest in picking up the pieces and trying to move on again.

At the end of the day, I just don't understand why anyone would want to throw away such a close relationship over literally nothing, over text of all things. We were such close friends, and her family was wonderful to me, and more than than anything I suppose I fear for her. It was too abrupt and unnecessary to make any sense.",4.309891273041476,5.264401203125004,5.0068433179723515,84.90589861751155,70.45089285714286,8.548502304147465,28.06768433179723,8.841846274778883,1.9455953917050688,1761,61,370,31,31,568,223,448,0.08800000000000001,0.82,0.092,0.878,1,2,2,0,0,0,51.0,4,0,2,8,23,15,0,1,27,0,21,9,1,8,4,80,60,34,0,6,12,0,2,0,2,1,6,1,0,1,17,36,1,0,9,0,0,11,6,7,0,1,19,7,48,8,66,38,19,76,0,5,4,1,27,29,0,16,33,249,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.08480061910142313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703047544724394,0.0,0.0,0.09000087053495859,0.09589490254650856,0.0,0.07230669948272506,0.0,0.0,0.11818822408657455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06076160815129913,0.0,0.07151024540611453,0.07735828774869052,0.0,0.0,0.16328842301345609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09938898990111378,0.0,0.08926892666009026,0.09192732738204568,0.07485555598327186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056042487875309036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308994290398431,0.08978961114062654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638407659514444,0.09778522351705582,0.04393860574925157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391601004087009,0.0,0.0,0.06713773841795807,0.0,0.1362029896613776,0.0,0.09877309459317116,0.0,0.06950084774304034,0.0,0.19145748254814335,0.0860433987236023,0.0,0.09250530732128627,0.07784418784311964,0.0,0.0,0.09236927979291852,0.0,0.1029754060606092,0.0582463827920907,0.0,0.0,0.08631004021141739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18413741548388265,0.0,0.17419070064946252,0.0,0.0,0.0729730419583785,0.0,0.18972044440692892,0.2955127496633172,0.07842949094911503,0.0,0.1160111457833668,0.08810166660201582,0.17460289600523554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09235959099487127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08338166912247255,0.0,0.0911855926508889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214738210612905,0.0,0.0832249563393792,0.0,0.09369152177833794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242748929765816,0.0,0.0,0.05566954761179385,0.08934636099072679,0.08580200617615785,0.09329670838231853,0.0,0.0,0.08266058590645388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924703202369534,0.15821866885267222,0.0,0.09817082311426162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13379776608109895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852449545772479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06533702559042914,0.06984590249582652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05773165076499401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10134268929486626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654767951978946,0.11799705850654822,0.0,0.0,0.09046463608573836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434010957506761,0.15376535623176107,0.0,0.1394098291054867,0.0,0.0,0.16111197505936475,0.07841258196457485,0.09701932174944397,0.0,0.0,0.1884759181399469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061730360115295466,0.0,0.0,0.11191985803404664

COVID19_support,arseen33,2020/03/27,"Is there a hashtag for all the creative recipes being made during quarantine? I hope this post fits in here! So many people are getting creative with what they have in their pantries while they're stuck at home and I love seeing what people come up with! This is how I learned to cook, and where some of my best recipes have come from.

Cooking like this is what taught me the value of every cultural dish I've ever made. We all have ancestors who, once upon a time, only had a few ingredients. Maybe not enough of them. But they also had a hungry family and their own ingenuity. Most of our comfort foods and most famous cuisines came from one brave person somewhere back in time, taking a desperate situation and turning it into something comforting and worthy of being passed down through generations! Cooking is how I honor the courage of our ancestors. I would love to have a hashtag so we can celebrate the courage and ingenuity of modern people during this pandemic as well!

I've been struggling with anxiety for years now, staying with a case of mono that tripped something in my brain. Now, it seems a bunch of things there me down my anxiety well.
The biggest of all is the sensation of not being able to breath. This does not bode well, considering the state of the world and this pandemic. 
I do not wish anxiety of any kind on anyone, but I almost feel jealous of people that have the more tangeable anxiety disorders.
I know, about 99% sure, that I do not have Covid-19, but that or course does not translate to my anxiety.
I don't know if I'm asking for help dealing or if I'm just looking for a place to put all this into words, but I heard about this sub and thought I might give it a try.

He was different from the time he was little, and grew up a little odd. I guessed early on that he might be somewhere on the autism spectrum, and I was right, I am sad to say. I'm not sad he's special, I just hate for him to have to deal with the struggles that come with it. He has grown up into a wonderful young man of 16 years. I was away from him for about ten years when I had to go do 9 years for a non violent first offense drug bust, 10grams of LSD, and in the time between we had been separated because I could not get in touch with his mother.

I went down to visit his family during my father's recent death, and it was so beautiful to reconnect with him. He is smart as a whip, and loves transformers, pokemon, and anime. We get along famously, and have been in touch over facebook since I have been able, to support to encourage him.

About as soon as I was through being homeless in Feb, this whole COVID-19 thing started. First it was in china, then it was in Italy, then it was in the internet, in the news, in America, then no ramen soups or TP, lockdowns, and now my poor little nephew is sick with the creeping crud!

I wish he was asymptomatic, but he is showing signs of infection and got a test after being exposed to some family from Florida that had it. He tested positive, and now he's eating pudding to help with his throat. I am keeping in touch and am doing everything I can to get people to pray for him during this troubled time for our great nation. Would you? Even a brief nod would do wonders with the heart of God, I am sure. Thank you in advance.

Gabriel is a good dude, and he makes me proud. If anyone wants to pray for him, or suggest some cool stuff for him to check out while he is quarantined down in KY that would be awesome. I'm stressed out, but don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Thanks for being there for me, internet. You better believe you are in my heart, and in my mind.

COVID19_support,InfoBlue,2020/03/27,"My Conspiracy-Theorist Father I dont need any advice. I just really need to vent about this.

Ever since Father got into InfoWars (I already know what you're thinking. I think it too.) he's been into Conspiracies more than he's ever been. Went from not being at all, to full blown Jet Fuel Can't Melt Steel Beams aka Trump is God and he Can't do Wrong (even though we're Canadian). Anyway, normally I'm able to put up with it. Ever since I was young, I've been pretty good at not listening to my parents. 

However, with this pandemic that's come along, it's become absolutely impossible to shut it out. I'm in the High-Risk category due to Immunosuppressants and low lung capacity, so it's not like I can go live on my own right now. I would not be able to support myself.

He's going on about how the flu is killing more people, and when I try to point out that it's due to different time frames (one year of stats for flu and two months of stats of SARS-CoV-2), he dismisses it because it's coming from his Son and not one of his fear-mongering gods.

He's completely incapable of seeing that InfoWars makes money off of situations like these and people's fear. So why the hell would they not play it up to get more people viewing.

It's tough. Especially because I'm in that high-risk group and he's completely invalidating my fear. I'm just so fucking sick of it and I know this is just the beginning.",4.045633802816901,5.055285112676058,5.570535211267606,80.4163661971831,71.11267605633802,9.060281690140846,26.171830985915488,9.3871,2.0619864788732403,1108,34,228,24,20,376,157,284,0.135,0.818,0.048,-0.9737,3,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,1,0,18,13,3,2,4,0,16,5,1,2,4,41,39,14,1,5,9,4,0,2,0,2,3,1,0,0,20,17,0,0,4,1,1,6,9,8,0,3,6,3,17,5,39,29,6,36,1,1,2,1,16,18,2,0,14,135,37,0,0.22077245617724986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10786814452601047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12181394762324567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506642040531797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13458084014979807,0.1219129163184026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19017592246747025,0.2314757199300937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153301138416042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12937183720613996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07290906257522502,0.29955198911095865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726455873936659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020502891279517,0.057672248152758565,0.0,0.1254700745487802,0.09258673088161996,0.08828595057631804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23325822120021414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212600629972264,0.0,0.1213307682164931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785827044069908,0.0,0.09747306177170506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07368366441226591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08810923411429432,0.0,0.0,0.16369997885779605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815506631144674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496011299417789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225708429630619,0.0,0.0,0.2295837349030042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10435066552582974,0.0,0.0,0.11230247853147622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096864810984804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07071624431448716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942692356475824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796353203350492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826252571494336,0.12407874537326845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526498349898602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14146207551731155,0.10845390863558156,0.0,0.06436709730100855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494500292986142,0.0,0.1078313050963109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232913935045068,0.0996064013705382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568304185971036,0.12069001169451653,0.0,0.07108511173442361

COVID19_support,cicadaghost,2020/03/28,"Essential employee, worried I might have COVID I hope this is the right place for this - I'm worried more about my (and others') physical health than mental health here, but I need some advice.

I'm a cashier at an essential retailer in Colorado. For the past two weeks I've had a mild cough, so I've been trying to come in as little as possible. On tuesday I thought that my cough had gone away so I came to work, but about halfway through my shift I started having breathing problems. I've been home since then and my breathing got worse, plus a dry cough and now sore throat. Unsure if I have a fever, as we don't own a thermometer. Aside from having to breathe heavier, I feel fine enough, so I plan on waiting this out at home for now. But I'm really worried about spreading this to coworkers/customers - moreso if it is COVID.

I've been using up some emergency sick time, but since I've been sick all of the past week too, I'm almost out of it. My work allows us to take a 2-week leave of absence, but it's unpaid. We do have a policy in place that gives unpaid time if we're ordered to self-quarantine, or if we're diagnosed.

Because of all this, I've been thinking of calling my PCP to see if I can get a self-quarantine order, so that I don't have to choose between my livelihood and the health of those around me. I don't want to add to the overload on the healthcare system though, and I also don't know how to confront the issue, because I don't want to demand a doctor's note. Testing here is scarce, so that's unlikely too.

What should I do? Should I call my doctor, and if so what should I tell them?",4.110727272727272,4.748321769696972,4.813333333333336,87.27000000000002,70.69696969696969,7.8181818181818175,28.03030303030303,7.84624498591911,1.546939393939394,1264,43,268,15,22,407,162,330,0.133,0.8420000000000001,0.025,-0.9855,1,2,0,0,0,0,42.0,3,0,1,3,19,4,1,0,17,0,28,17,4,3,2,50,51,32,0,14,12,0,1,0,0,4,13,0,2,0,16,15,0,1,5,0,1,3,5,2,0,1,11,2,30,2,45,36,7,34,0,0,1,0,8,17,0,12,11,178,46,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1034453281692683,0.0,0.0,0.10600366389186353,0.0,0.0,0.08465633579493168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423799060921767,0.0,0.0,0.09945910982754733,0.0,0.0,0.12906274818915345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21619012891350026,0.12107582741991775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09118915874555084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10744583925109304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21670472934560084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10938184876796092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05352608022338471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055307567054544184,0.10155071645950067,0.0,0.0,0.08466604455127914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3375732158130376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21237275383796644,0.10514302986317628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049050904400697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05817797826381488,0.0,0.0,0.11209062985386403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10609969590682264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668214785771096,0.11230090624210226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07849397108227657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20211101185612693,0.0,0.0,0.22120268271170687,0.0,0.0,0.11934143038322935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101293881285907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06781673247606787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040400259669616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08435684583356952,0.0,0.2208704789147635,0.0,0.0,0.17513724502107075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07492836972651755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07959366970514807,0.0,0.09252645028472978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06783091935852052,0.104007074742463,0.08404114640482062,0.12345582716499738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187210326823469,0.0,0.10340999923215173,0.0,0.1273367444130293,0.0914291938192863,0.0,0.0,0.12487813625232848,0.0,0.2547439172016424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541349219820186,0.3225184087419521,0.10788055213743668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,alecubudulecu,2020/03/28,"Wynn hotel staff stuck head in my car window - during quarantine wife and I went for a drive last night. we live in las vegas suburbs. we get groceries delivered, and don't interact with people - all CDC and news says driving is ok.  so we assumed so.

we went by the vegas strip to see how empty it is.  there were police EVERYWHERE.  that made me feel good... I was happy they are ramping up security. other than cars, no one really around.

casinos closed.

as we drove , some roads blocked.  as we passed Wynn - a road was blocked, and police motioned for us to use the Wynn entry to do a U turn.

so we did.  as we go through - right at the entry point - 5 Wynn security guards circle our car.  blocking path. and they keep motioning to roll window down.  flashlights pointed at us.

I tried to motion that we doing U TURN. ... they drew closer... and one started banging on the window to roll the window down.  I cracked the window open.

I screamed out so he could hear ""we are doing a u turn!""

he goes ""I know but I need to see your face"".

at that point my options were - to run them over - or open the window.  they were completely surrounding the car in that moment. so I rolled the window down.

and - he proceeded to shove his face IN OUR CAR to get a good look at us. and breathe on us.

ii was FURIOUS.  I wanted to get out and yell at him.  but I figured the quicker we get out of there the safer.  so we drove home.  it resulted in anxiety for a few hours for us.

I have ideas for next time - maybe drive less haha.  but also maybe have a sign I can post to the windshield in these cases telling idiots like this to BACK THE F- UP from the car.

statistically i'm sure it's fine... but now i'm contacting corporate. i'm gonna need them to monitor that staff employee and let me know asap if they get sick.

what kind of imbecile service industry training is this? during a quarantine, when you've shut down your hotels and casinos, have countless infected IN your work... you are training people to put their heads in cars???? do they not realize there's a social distancing/quarantine in effect?

I also get they were anxious and nervous. they likely wanted to make sure we not going on the property to do damage.  I get it.  (I drive a sports car... and my wife looks very young... so I get the anxiety.... ) but man... friggin put a barricade up and just stand a few feet back! how hard is it!??!",1.2916969037252066,3.702023198717953,2.8559103370424133,90.31466618287376,84.1068376068376,6.010707950330592,21.43702628608289,7.354871404402295,0.8223477181099819,1819,59,374,29,53,595,232,468,0.096,0.846,0.057999999999999996,-0.9539,1,3,0,0,0,0,100.0,20,4,11,2,20,18,2,1,28,2,27,8,6,7,3,76,66,36,0,6,10,2,2,2,0,1,2,4,8,1,15,35,0,7,8,5,2,25,4,5,0,2,14,10,58,13,61,49,5,81,0,1,4,0,49,41,0,5,15,239,73,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333548626188003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12756802674019088,0.09419351311059207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422418046539409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1282252146754194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08742034478027885,0.0,0.0,0.06657062318356154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04215846934364775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3484929007182659,0.0,0.09477138405681784,0.13986717809011687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08875753102146602,0.0746903947178892,0.0,0.1711399571800045,0.0,0.09397317119590637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08363502609137813,0.0,0.08211062693483102,0.0,0.0,0.094123718831365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741102805627251,0.0,0.08682545389313405,0.09164483940816948,0.06796427459070342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08525974972057712,0.0,0.08146864986252604,0.0,0.07362438418547984,0.0,0.1400331985894852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889436813998632,0.05565552490377812,0.0,0.16752900355000966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12364759981387907,0.0,0.0,0.08867354842238774,0.07824469263452616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11299830809883005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1156077436097174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2364577458337637,0.0,0.07985316581238823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16763602645658146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05341414176316976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712044363441127,0.0,0.06630560656361294,0.0,0.0,0.13288309116450653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499346635026099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059015443778093715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15716573291316907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07287612882404082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04861843687328669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056608252456595724,0.2720742695666216,0.0,0.0,0.5014679024928177,0.07201190239708291,0.0,0.0687956592609149,0.09835711968659352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15458465614946065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060700245151947003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Saarlak,2020/03/28,"Recommend a therapist, please TL;DR SIL is losing her mind because of COVID-19 and I am trying to find her some help

My sister-in-law is losing her mind because of COVID-19. She (40's) came down from [Major City] to our much much smaller town and has moved in with her parents until this epidemic subsides. She brought her daughter and her cat and not very much else. Here's the problem:

She screams if anybody leaves the house because ""she just knows they'll get infected and bring it back"". She screams if people don't listen to her because ""she just knows best"". She had a panic attack because my wife (her sister) went over with out kids *at their mother's request*. Come forward to today and while I was at work their dad came over unannounced to help my wife (his daughter) with a [overly specific mechanical problem]. When my sister-in-law found out that he had ""snuck out like a teenager"" (yes, her words) she demanded that her mother (my mother-in-law) immediately drive her over. After some yelling she crumpled and did just that. Now I have my sister-in-law standing in my driveway screaming at her sister (my wife) that she was ""trying to murder her dad with the virus"". My wife is a wreck and now that I'm home I am in damage control with the neighbors.

Can anybody recommend a mental health resource in central Florida (or anywhere in the State if they offer virtual or phone support) for people suffering *in this way* as a result of COVID-19? It doesn't have to be free or charity of any sort. I'll find the money to pay for her to get better because we are at a point where she won't allow windows to be open if she hears *anything* outside.",5.410956873315363,6.300935845911951,5.529550763701707,82.3895283018868,67.8993710691824,7.692362982929021,31.49505840071878,7.62386473244151,2.080313387241689,1301,52,242,13,21,410,164,318,0.131,0.7959999999999999,0.073,-0.9529,1,0,0,0,1,0,61.0,2,0,4,6,9,17,2,1,14,1,21,2,0,3,0,48,36,19,1,6,11,13,0,1,1,2,2,6,4,1,9,21,0,1,5,0,3,9,4,12,0,0,10,6,46,6,43,22,7,42,0,4,0,0,56,23,0,10,10,164,55,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830491485093974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09475738756162057,0.0,0.0,0.13099801910883158,0.0,0.08854207324907604,0.0,0.4211606669771867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12084122541844194,0.10183947291164347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26339836989603044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991902193757676,0.0,0.0,0.12914881133226316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619177931482993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21048724883222605,0.0,0.0,0.1262543646415761,0.0,0.0,0.1203206561996686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12239744940627692,0.1297807054336084,0.0,0.15436319752360175,0.0,0.1155033138391112,0.0,0.0,0.13286588551987635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12656518617369064,0.0,0.0,0.12192561394492747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05625573083960614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25764339003690656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11604258439329793,0.0,0.23253427884515696,0.0,0.0,0.1223846108936085,0.25394214534712645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13510193088020814,0.12785875987701312,0.0,0.0,0.15965891464893378,0.0,0.0,0.12639845234427538,0.10885253265733337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.220363087989608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13066913026796706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13369626007737695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10914729486043942,0.0,0.0,0.15635651843365314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950095551318441,0.0,0.0913995035182061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10674379436693276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08382946468189229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Sandra_Pan98,2020/03/28,"To work or to wait? I was just cut early from my temp job in IT. 
I was really counting on working there at least through the summer before going back to school in August, but that was before this whole thing with the virus escalated and they needed to cut down on staff. 
My plan was just to save some more money for the commute and other necessities for school. And I like to always have some extra money laying around for emergencies, kind of like now.

My friends who have also lost their jobs are now working in food delivery and some stores, despite being fearful, and I'm thinking of doing the same. There are a lot of jobs for stocker/freight in my city right now. 
I guess I'm just not sure if I should wait it out or risk it and go work for a little while and hope I don't get sick. I think I know the answer but I would like outside opinions.

COVID19_support,Avgvstvs-,2020/03/28,"My sister has washed her n95 mask with filter with bleach and now wants to use the mask because it ""smells clean"" Well the title says it. She is so paranoid about cleanliness that she took the n95 mask, soaked it in solution of bleach and then rinsed it with water to dry.

It has the ""detergent"" smell and she says that the filter still smells fine and that air quality she breathes in hasn't changed.

I'm afraid that bleach vapors may damage her inner linings. I'm not sure what to do. Can i somehow neutralize bleach on mask to stop the toxic fumes be inhalated?

COVID19_support,sarun_23,2020/03/28,"I'm doing my best and still breaking down. Please, I need comfort and advice. The virus entered my country a month ago. 

The past few weeks I've been struggling with my mom (58). She was proud to lead her regular life and just doing the absolute minimal: washing her hands. She kept doing all of the other things you're not supposed to. I had my first breakdown around then. It was an awful week and we kept fighting about it. There was no convincing her with a civilized talk. But eventually, with a little help, she almost miraculously realized how important her cooperation is and was on board with every safety measure and haven't left the house since. It TREMENDOUSLY helped relieve my stress levels. 

Then there is my uncle (60+), who lives with us. He is just not willing to understand, going out (almost) every day to do grocery shopping by the piece. We tried to talk to him but this is the type of human being who is NOT willing to cooperate or really support anyone under any circumstance. He's an asshole like that. He won't understand even if his own mother who is 91 lives with us. Everytime he leaves the house I get into so much panic and stress that won't go away unless I clean and disinfect every area he is in and touches after entering the house. The only days where I'm sort of at peace are when no one leaves the house. 

I've been the only one in this household who has taken this seriously enough since the beginning and the only one responsible for raising awareness, organizing cleaning rounds, safety measures and sharing information, correcting processes and such. 

On the other hand, I'm in a long distance relationship and my boyfriend isn't really of much help. He has been insinuating I'm exaggerating with all of this and got mad at me for asking if he took a shower after moving from one state to another. He took offense on that and thought THAT justified him in being a jerk to me. Never apologized. I don't trust him anymore when it comes to talking about my anxiety and fear of all of this. I don't know when will we be able to visit each other. 

And even after all of that I was sort of managing. I discovered cleaning and disinfecting the house really helped me ease down a lot. Everytime I felt bad, I resorted to either cleaning or comfort myself with reassuring words and reasoning. Maybe not much but I've always been kind of unstable and being able to do this all by myself was a huge step for me. I felt in control and strong enough. 

And then it happened. I'm recovering from a cold I caught before the first case of covid19 was detected in my country. But there's a residual cough that won't go away. I talked to my mom about how I'm worried about that and she accused me of hiding information about being with someone who was already infected. I hadn't been out much other than grocery shopping and always had extreme precautions. I don't know where it came from. It took me off guard and it totally destroyed me. It ended in a fight again. I spent most of the day crying in my room, suicidal thoughts triggered, unable to feel anything other than rage and hurt. It felt as if all of the stress and fear I thought I had successfully managed up until then came pouring down on me. I haven't been able to recover. I feel like crap, I only want to sleep all day. Today, I don't feel as angry anymore but I really don't want to do anything, be it cleaning, getting off of bed, nor even eating. 

Last night, I went to bed early, hoping a bit more of sleep would help me feel better in the morning. But these voices woke me up. Laughter. Somebody freaking coughing. I looked out the window and there was a group of 3 people from the building next to my house hanging out on the roof, smoking, everyone next to each other and one of the guys was coughing in the general direction of my house. It triggered my anxiety SO BAD, I was shaking, about to cry and wasn't able to sleep until 7 am. People in my country are definitely not taking this seriously and I can't even describe how that makes me feel.


I don't know what to do. I don't know how to handle all of this anymore. I feel so lonely in this battle. I don't have many friends and I feel like they're tired of me talking about this, I don't want to push them away. I wish my family was really united and cared about this. I feel terrible, I can't even describe it....

TL;DR: uncle over 60 putting at risk an entire household of people with all the risk factors by carelessly going out everyday in a country full of people that doesn't take this seriously.

COVID19_support,tunnelcatto,2020/03/28,"Mum says it’s nothing and I’m fine ... (kinda venty, fed up with family just ignoring me mostly) Other end of 20, badly autistic, and Woke up feeling pretty crap today, stomach issues, feeling like bad gurgles and then being unable to go..real tired, dizzy, it took too much effort to get out of bed because I felt disconnected from limbs. And my hearts been racing. Tho I suffer bad anxiety anyway, I’m celiac too with ‘ibs flares’ and my doctor mentioned raised bilirubin levels a few weeks back but now my scan‘s been pushed out of the way..

but I’m worried this might be Covid, tho I’ve got no cough (and idk how to tell bc i had a normal bad cold a while ago and a small cough has lingered and won’t go away so mum says we can’t count coughs.) and while my throat hurt first time I woke, feels pretty moist atm...I told my mum how I felt tho and she basically yelled at me that “you don’t have it stop going on the internet” and dads banned mentioning the virus in the house.

mum says it’s all just ‘because your period is due, and you‘ve been putting effort into cleaning your room so you feel achy bc your just older than you were ten years ago’ while dads paranoid that a parcel I got from eBay had the virus on it even tho mom wiped it over with a disinfectant wipe and I washed my hands after handling the item, which I’m now not allowed to touch for a month. (My mum dosnt want any of us to get it lit bc she’s the carerer for my grandad, and he’s threatening to go talk to strangers if she dosnt keep going over there. She even said if I get it she’ll move out to live with him so I’ll have ‘to just deal with it alone’..and she’s a big support for me too..tho she acts like I’m a burden 60% of the time)

the news isn’t really clear on symptoms of covid or what they actually feel like either, just vague descriptions and ‘stay at home if you cough’ so I’m worried. I have a bunch of medical things the doctors were in the middle of trying to figure out and then stopped so I’m terrified if it is covid it’ll be real bad and I’ll die and then my friends would never find out, and I’m scared and my family are tbh, just always ignoring me When I try and talk about how I feel for help...I don’t really know how to know if it’s covid bc the U.K. isn’t testing unless your in hospital suffering or over 70 so...",1.7482152960920665,3.470861703092788,3.1391464876528445,92.64571325821147,78.36082474226805,6.161112443059219,19.938863581874852,7.025160622230231,0.2013553104771036,1806,42,405,20,43,589,241,485,0.17,0.7709999999999999,0.059000000000000004,-0.9951,1,1,0,0,0,0,52.0,2,8,1,3,32,19,1,1,22,0,27,16,5,5,3,85,63,52,1,8,18,8,10,3,1,5,10,5,4,0,19,33,1,6,12,0,0,9,9,13,0,2,17,18,44,6,54,38,7,63,0,3,2,0,40,25,1,10,30,242,63,3,0.0,0.0,0.08436031684941132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15326103475773428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07193126823051088,0.0,0.0,0.0587872832619764,0.0,0.06613212208889081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08122029797200317,0.06647281272962942,0.3609003736548447,0.10539522104294263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08912360518162722,0.0,0.0,0.0897188854694093,0.0,0.0,0.17696541543464608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07656685057472824,0.0,0.0,0.11419555350667213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1629900710038818,0.0,0.2622628048383687,0.1235162621531102,0.16600636678869465,0.0,0.07901147420752021,0.07353222291731386,0.0,0.0,0.06678914547449086,0.0,0.13549579573149695,0.0,0.2456506109380797,0.0,0.1382799701000575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10244073657740543,0.057943955595371466,0.0,0.08671391880423328,0.0,0.0,0.09974884032220567,0.09254386637508637,0.0,0.0,0.09022875916738796,0.0,0.07683853466194572,0.0,0.0,0.09501860087404512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267016862328306,0.0,0.0763347507693254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870867894372193,0.0,0.09170716572192014,0.0,0.10124629965797026,0.06900159186897725,0.09188004100642964,0.0635488796545885,0.0,0.06667366269908359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470022261802733,0.08294873435053159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17589642827791507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690364232647049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19679242463659266,0.11076099974641587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223139514684755,0.20623963137910567,0.08654905614135992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214156234048758,0.0,0.14454800807677542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980996300076672,0.0,0.08985208146878207,0.0,0.13896649641516898,0.07555894955673577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05743189616280432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081649721284744,0.09935871616965247,0.08194214823492793,0.08260431736434716,0.09604638411452557,0.11738439351492752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10398573184440993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05098899162775993,0.06861802370332706,0.06934299230289331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17558332132603632,0.0,0.061409843391900365,0.0,0.0,0.055669373558470035
COVID19_support,wickedspacer,2020/03/28,"Supermarket had eggs! Small victory - but still a win.  the supermarket near me had eggs again! Our 4 kids eat a lot of eggs if given the chance... Scrambled eggs for our family means cooking up a dozen eggs at once... Not having eggs for a few weeks was hard on them. The biggest impact this virus has had on them so far is that they cant have eggs for breakfast. :) We had a huge family breakfast today and it was really nice to see how happy they were to have eggs.

I am proud of my teenage kids. They are taking this in stride and being stoic. The teenagers know I may lose my job, but they know how much emergency fund we have and that I have a life insurance policy in place that will take very good care of them if I pass, and that if I am on unemployment I have a budget set that will allow us to keep house.   I have talked them through how to pay bills and take care of little ones if wife and I are in hospital at same time. I know at that age I was aware my parents could die from just about anything and was sort of ready for it. I see the determination on their faces and realize they have grown up. They are ready. In the face of a challenge, they have risen up and are ready to make a life for themselves in the face of massive uncertainty. It helps knowing that they will be ok.",3.820118293198142,4.5757726615969565,4.420880861850447,89.39103400929447,71.43346007604563,7.973722010984369,23.73658639628221,8.167268648758528,0.9591945078158006,1002,24,227,14,18,319,138,263,0.07400000000000001,0.721,0.204,0.9914,4,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,5,0,13,4,8,10,0,0,16,1,34,17,3,5,0,36,49,19,1,5,8,2,1,0,0,4,2,0,0,2,12,11,12,1,6,1,4,2,2,1,0,2,10,3,33,9,36,32,4,31,0,1,2,0,24,22,0,7,6,160,45,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12058032207586235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987907750316429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699094014774715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15207326199113333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499350518692313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27626771821834506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12290100255975794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559821209839335,0.13126059333946433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09821484399805636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16907400764360364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454067475932011,0.1302411031024791,0.0,0.0,0.3221125298012405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069945710964744,0.0,0.14685987069159434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16392770923092714,0.0,0.12457313749086805,0.0,0.0,0.09780879119841536,0.0,0.0,0.15961229638196278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771517473041192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15604787829371944,0.09929138159886804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16270235854871767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1530909071040329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09386979365999612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23352819940122266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170177053759504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305131821781931,0.11777391296584627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08544184155578463,0.0,0.13889171395129815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17625552702063454,0.0,0.0,0.12090120942424845,0.0,0.0,0.11753617959646355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,MrPaulProteus,2020/03/28,"I might have it, 2 questions, please help! I have no fever. No headache. No cough (ok maybe I cough 4 times a day but I also smoke weed so I feel it to be normal) 

I have a little bit less energy for yard work and exercise than usual.

I lost my sense of smell a couple days ago, which spooked me.

I have a slight sharpness in the top of my breath, I could call it a very slight rawness in my lungs.

My friend is a doctor and said “you have it, stay isolated, it’s good to get it now and get over it, you will be immune”

Problem is, my girl wants to visit me (we live 4 hours apart and haven’t seen eachother in almost a month). I am terrified to give it to her and have her actually get sick. 

So my question is: if I do have it, when am I no longer contagious?? I believe CDC says 7 days after symptoms disappear, 3 days after fever breaks (i have no fever)

Question 2: isn’t everyone gonna get it eventually??? If it spreads this easy?? Is it fruitless for her to avoid me because she’s just gonna get it anyway when quarantine is over? That is the part I really don’t get. Are old folks just gonna stay in their houses forever? I can’t imagine it just disappearing, because if it spreads so easy, than even one person having it in the world will result in an outbreak (yes no?)",1.6875335076822466,3.2814015977443636,3.3377280156914035,91.7316426936908,78.13533834586465,6.580974174566853,22.46747303040209,7.423996415210882,0.6770126185027778,979,29,223,13,23,325,143,266,0.142,0.758,0.10099999999999999,-0.8838,0,2,1,0,0,0,41.0,1,2,1,3,12,6,0,1,11,2,29,12,2,1,0,26,44,15,0,7,7,0,2,0,1,6,10,2,1,2,19,6,0,1,5,2,0,3,10,3,0,1,3,6,33,3,22,32,3,33,0,1,1,0,20,12,0,8,15,144,52,2,0.0,0.0,0.11778754063372235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10699485868051796,0.0,0.12086541251541222,0.0,0.0,0.09652518198178099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14715738803300124,0.0,0.0,0.135989589899824,0.0,0.0,0.13177509882479094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12325002812896167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637056184148396,0.13355424056065449,0.0,0.31137068987351657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235434019201256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07972239733800512,0.0,0.0,0.1153357378379955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06103045431648532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932539075275306,0.0,0.3783702371320245,0.1157881603850423,0.0,0.10123893912304463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090386901167793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188669547083366,0.13927366588240206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209749082505272,0.106581896486437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13176026773992022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126117666302005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280455303191474,0.0,0.0,0.09634302133510064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826213183996405,0.0,0.0,0.12665622979392122,0.0,0.08179066018800905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307082818551374,0.0,0.0,0.10539215184918818,0.0,0.13249432501780772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154953168354407,0.0,0.0,0.4056409034510399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07732466072615106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11481504763094752,0.09598691212723456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573041075132135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254553810640714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038218741642084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329359747485099,0.09959162192230747,0.07119304606155248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08787234442854715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,furyofsunsets,2020/03/28,"A little break from the worry and anxiety... I have never had more anxiety than now, at this unprecedented time in our history. In the first week or so of quarantine, I felt that my anxiety would not stop until this was over. And when would that be? Two, three months from now?! How could I bare to wake up every day knowing I would have feelings of hopelessness and helplessness every waking minute. I worry about my parents, who still go to stores when they need something. I worry about my boyfriend, who has an autoimmune disorder. I worry about his parents and grandparents. It is all too much. 

But I found a saving grace, and a way to get rid of all of the noise, even just for an hour - YOGA AND MEDITATION. 

Maybe some of you have started this during quarantine too, and maybe some of you are thinking about it. So I am here to say that it has not only helped me escape for a short period of time in the day, but it has actually helped my anxiety even after class is over. I never thought it would, but after three straight days, I feel a little more at peace with myself. 

Don't get me wrong, I still worry, and this is not a cure all for anxiety, but the high levels of panic have subsided for the most part. I can't say this is all attributed to the classes, but I know they are part of it! 

So, if you can, go online and see what classes are being offered virtually. Many instructors are hosting free classes, and others at very low price. It gives you some social interaction (even if you don't turn your camera on like me) and gives your mind and body a rest.

Anyway, long post, but give it a try. You might like how you feel. : )",4.876782376502003,5.56317603738318,5.4798397863818415,83.00037383177573,69.0,8.855718736092568,26.50066755674232,8.976282227363876,1.8332947930574093,1272,36,258,22,21,411,164,321,0.077,0.821,0.102,0.8095,3,2,1,0,0,1,49.0,1,9,2,1,23,10,0,1,17,0,30,3,3,3,6,58,50,29,0,8,13,2,4,2,0,5,0,2,0,0,20,13,0,1,9,1,3,2,8,5,0,4,5,7,35,6,39,37,14,46,0,3,1,0,27,17,0,8,26,204,55,4,0.0,0.0,0.08548839020352618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3350822323376433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973077524079193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06994427551940194,0.0,0.0,0.1694910528564903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1004012137184716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17358387928614374,0.0,0.14761947338735082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328849027198156,0.0,0.08411310904411712,0.0,0.0,0.07451550207556934,0.0,0.09605272860913493,0.0,0.0,0.09153843804789928,0.2521118120648925,0.099574188746095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743757422616828,0.0925579195991412,0.0,0.0,0.08627181238133315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09628919771144938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08559730132713099,0.17560346545508845,0.0,0.0775263508995196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08881621068174136,0.1760190039003003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09293348176595494,0.088454573596894,0.0,0.06992428704232335,0.0,0.0643986606950054,0.0649568937100644,0.13513045720992498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06662641801283241,0.0,0.1027838454396957,0.19454666454712088,0.1897321319716112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389994810890332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393316568835008,0.0,0.0,0.06980865654998965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930074773912647,0.0,0.0674414630241134,0.0,0.0,0.062006216287517776,0.0,0.13992055479043494,0.07324045818644917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056132792853720616,0.0,0.06954740267335655,0.10216462401474198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947703381983217,0.09528746446128583,0.08557590138534116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228207151698307,0.0,0.06953558977043796,0.07027025271196834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4448280911967691,0.0,0.24892408422768245,0.09578068752613994,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,probablygonnadie2020,2020/03/28,"My life couldn't be more fucked. It would still be hard without COVID but now it's even worse. I have never been more afraid for my own survival. I am awaiting my COVID-19 test which I only had yesterday. 7-10 business days to get results. 

Where do I begin? I feel like vomiting because I am so terrified.

My husband and I have been having problems for a while, but everything came to a head this week. Two days ago, he broke his promise to me that I would always have a safe place here, and told me he wanted to divorce. 

I'm not here to get relationship advice. Regardless of who is to blame for my situation, this is the situation. And coronavirus makes it almost impossible to survive it. 

It is really really hard to find a job right now because of the economy tanking. I don't even know what jobs I can do given my mental health issues. There are no courts open for divorce lawyers because of coronavirus, so we can't start the proceedings. Some people on legaladvice told me that even if I find out my test is negative and I go stay with a friend, it will disadvantage me in the divorce process later for some reason they didn't really explain well. They say don't leave the house under any circumstances. We are trying to do teletherapy, but my therapist is completely overburdened by all of the other people dealing with massive life crashes due to coronavirus, including losing loved ones and losing their income, etc. Every friend of mine is stretched to the max so I am here dealing with all of these intense feelings of fear totally alone. I'm afraid of losing more friends. My emotional neediness has always been a problem for me but now it is not only making the symptoms worse, but making recovery harder.

I am so so so so fucked. I HAD a safe place to be, my husband's job isn't affected by the virus because he worked from home anyway. He was willing to take care of me. I blew it and I don't know what I'm going to do or what will become of my life. I could lose everything. I've started reading suicide forums again because there may be no place for me to go. It all feels like blackness and darkness imagining life after this virus.",4.388718525179859,6.0262281318944835,5.197223471223023,81.01115894784174,71.03836930455634,8.37796762589928,29.57801258992805,8.930421266530582,2.495407733812949,1709,69,317,33,32,555,208,417,0.16699999999999998,0.7190000000000001,0.114,-0.9792,5,1,0,0,3,1,41.0,2,0,3,7,23,23,2,3,16,0,47,11,1,6,5,59,77,22,1,9,10,2,5,2,3,6,7,1,1,0,21,15,0,2,10,1,0,4,14,12,1,2,11,7,43,11,44,54,11,35,0,5,1,3,27,11,2,6,21,228,64,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07515689653084767,0.0681772852243089,0.0,0.07701562303495461,0.07965697972486692,0.0,0.0,0.1279928351899719,0.0,0.0,0.05230236615392216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23442227366147825,0.08494256091803525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796611306501588,0.07841626331713697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064010375182894,0.0,0.0,0.06140746726450037,0.0,0.0,0.09920293645783336,0.15858448196676705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08651493454943876,0.0,0.0,0.08577650347954728,0.15239769524744087,0.0,0.0648011428549431,0.0,0.13824595263308706,0.0,0.0,0.08654666916876261,0.11666609244454673,0.10989099020458153,0.0,0.0,0.14059118996695635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17826459131377215,0.14220663671623876,0.08036602847234599,0.0,0.1311315048388529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13779495366791045,0.0,0.07893325025064664,0.0817531853184364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07714837087690263,0.0,0.0,0.0887453898271148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027548370548958,0.22896798884402095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453695048640045,0.0,0.0,0.08143803126826113,0.0,0.0,0.2172990888436897,0.07515001678325076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34417658070376794,0.0,0.0,0.0694155104637418,0.0,0.15401680171418047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07750856699019633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593187867479851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052117131954656885,0.11698911891478572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10664131401716384,0.0,0.2410680225651113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14718757994668996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07693217911789041,0.0,0.14781417109791345,0.07907769362258024,0.0,0.08257402360481055,0.0,0.06568188616518783,0.0,0.061163005088306424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17290319526071915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10887652116190896,0.08197728257062864,0.06142151608633771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412855097634997,0.0,0.0,0.07994035791260835,0.057827775351554485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930002364842693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14698421199127976,0.0,0.05221776879035369,0.0,0.07513122873783656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04536431625952149,0.0,0.06169365843072301,0.0,0.06915255454691051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413981205236314,0.0,0.0559923903196352,0.0,0.156758504964418,0.10927125515308966,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Moses-Pharmacoach,2020/03/28,"Essential workers - Collaboration from the general public?! Hi, I'm a pharmacist. I'm one of the many essential workers who still have to go to work in the midst of this pandemic...which I don't mind. I love my job and people need us more than ever.

But, am I the only who feels like it's hard to get collaboration and understanding from the general public?

Despite all of our warnings and the government's, I still see at the pharmacy a lot of people who shouldn't be there, ex. 70 year old and over, immunocompromised patients, people who just can back from vacation, etc. Many people are still very combative and don't want to comply with our new procedures: physical distancing, no items passing, no cash payment, come at the pharmacy's only if there's a necessity, better to call the pharmacy instead of coming for questions and refills, etc.

I feel like some people still think it's a joke...

Do you have any specific new procedures at your workplace? How do you get customers to collaborate?

I did a fun video on things to do and not do at the pharmacy during this COVID19 pandemic...in the hope that people receive and understand the message!

COVID19_support,helix_66,2020/03/28,"It's almost impossible to be ok. Hey guys,

I know i'm one of the many who have terrible anxiety over the virus.
For a lot of people that might be insignificant, but it's breaking my heart daily. Me and my boyfriend have been living together for 4 years and a couple of months and on his birthday 26th Feb I left the UK where we live to attend to a medical issue with my bladder back in my home country. Meanwhile this covid nightmare happened and now I can't return I don't know when I will see him and the worst part is i don't believe i will ever see him again.. He is alone and lonely, thankfully I am with my beautiful family, all of who are in the risk factor. I kinda forbid myself to worry about them by focusing all my emergy on not seeing my boyfriend. The pain is so strong that I literally forbid myself to think about him and it hurts to see him on camera.

I try not to focus too much on the bad news, but it's so painful to see all these families around the world broken, because of this disease.

I just want health for eveyone... I just want this to be over... How do you guys cope with being away from loved ones and being scared for the future of the world?",4.085750000000001,4.717140741666668,5.1575000000000015,84.80250000000002,70.75,8.0,25.416666666666664,8.07648339933343,1.3355416666666673,918,25,192,12,16,303,140,240,0.201,0.711,0.08800000000000001,-0.9844,0,3,0,0,0,0,23.0,1,1,1,1,15,15,0,2,13,1,20,7,2,1,4,36,34,14,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,1,2,12,13,0,2,3,0,0,1,5,11,0,2,1,5,31,4,36,25,7,25,0,2,5,1,15,14,0,4,9,145,43,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12498846085817912,0.12927511198479216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954863938383009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111156064627097,0.0,0.0,0.11727180551373298,0.09597830789868543,0.104218870124494,0.0760886636274429,0.0,0.0,0.14062856511697744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13811013938028482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11290616858004192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2353369832997343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2471813870117013,0.11037726122666752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326770387687077,0.0,0.14791142653441253,0.0,0.0,0.1252038969968934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13362160161944986,0.0,0.0,0.13027888053883732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13719480425606234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13561649345542173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22043539040561885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10611687303296806,0.11265425728764315,0.0,0.0,0.1265471405812515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257422748832734,0.0,0.1324135120319782,0.0,0.0,0.09962954413915087,0.0,0.09175651950990643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16916152465321746,0.0,0.2656329905098576,0.0,0.0,0.13516709727365106,0.0,0.08653396010864932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1249658562285177,0.0,0.4973239573277546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149168065174323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997914315363107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08474408559406671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14724326944905308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12676001950337568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037951241290223

COVID19_support,n0cturnalowl,2020/03/28,"Being Told To Come Into Work - Advice Needed (England, UK) For some context, I work in a payroll department for a recruitment healthcare company in England, UK, and as of the other day- the government outlined that we are only to go outside in the following circumstances:

* shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible
* one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household
* any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person
* travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home

It's the latter one I'm having an issue with my work, and honestly- some conflict between myself and my family and loved ones. My management believe that what we are doing is essential because it is in the healthcare sector, and therefore everyone has to come in, however with the list of key workers, from what I understand recruiters &amp; people in finance aren't those, and therefore aren't essential. I understand that without finance- there's no pay for workers, but we are still being made to come into work.

More of an issue, is that hypothetically- the only thing that stops me from being able to be 100% functional at home is a printer. We use a system whereby we print out the time-sheets of our agency staff as part of our process, and the company want us in the office to do this. To give you context, our building is a huge communal office block, which whilst they have their own measures (lots of hand sanitisers etc - it's still a risk and requires me to trust that other people in the building as being as hygienic). In theory, yes I could buy a printer, but it's the principle that my company won't get me a printer to ensure my safety and health during these times. This is all because the company won't get me a printer.

I'm unsure as to whether I should make some form of complaint and if so- how. There is no HR (I'm technically the most qualified person there, but with no work experience- just a qualification), and I'm honestly worried about the reaction of my management as they don't have the best coping skills for these sorts of thing (personal experience, and experience of other people within my company). 

I also worry that if the situation here gets worse, there will be tougher restrictions and I won't be able to do my job at all, which would mean very minimal pay (as the company itself won't close, I most probably won't be entitled to furlough). 

What would be the best course of action?",8.490685028248585,7.7713259639830525,8.830000000000005,66.78435028248589,61.60593220338983,12.273446327683615,38.94632768361582,11.538034831475384,4.690109887005653,2013,91,340,52,24,670,228,472,0.091,0.8079999999999999,0.10099999999999999,0.8031,2,1,0,0,0,0,68.0,9,2,3,12,13,8,0,1,34,1,43,5,1,6,2,73,68,37,0,9,12,0,1,0,0,9,3,0,2,3,29,31,0,5,3,3,6,10,13,1,0,3,3,1,35,7,69,45,16,36,0,0,0,1,21,18,0,12,7,269,64,23,0.17709162042462218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865259409487741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09170675536080164,0.0,0.07081005243606507,0.0,0.09593934837099033,0.0,0.060214187309583264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079534081058557,0.0,0.0,0.0997608063912593,0.18584672995090584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09027835478035257,0.0,0.0,0.22882312534815746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069662441637824,0.0,0.0,0.11420944474965625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061310629586766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09875198441459533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08460931620519724,0.0,0.2598443789895212,0.08347310949286467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878459372716884,0.08494120953729879,0.05032262448265349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412005566693174,0.0,0.0,0.059350390119738486,0.0,0.17763733445404176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18483764187587395,0.0878680537930663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07527848141436902,0.07991605077585273,0.08378418657101253,0.059105015886202227,0.0,0.0,0.09645234541495867,0.0,0.08920058829720895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13131119262508276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18000279775032565,0.2020292360804528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958864837337184,0.0,0.18415954753190614,0.23194435831882745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998220967619226,0.0,0.0,0.09546735954925964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995292006026543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414255968296751,0.07402826215641566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11765180362836762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326354800268388,0.0,0.0,0.08460931620519724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18435862233346506,0.10650970732735457,0.07647515035629998,0.0,0.07305956669258011,0.052226613006057264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853550012800619,0.0,0.386774426460434,0.17984513677302474,0.09023574528654343,0.12580080614284014,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,_Myrtenaster_,2020/03/28,"My best friend has it, his fiance's father is currently in the ICU, I think I may have it too now, on top of other things. I have (or rather had) a friend who was one of those idiots who thought ignoring the quarantine was a good idea, meanwhile i'm in the worst hit area of the US. She gave it to my friend, and somehow it bypassed his fiance but got her father, who is now on oxygen in the ICU, and most likely not going to make it. My friend who now has it also has severe asthma. I believe I have it as well, because i've had odd symptoms here and there, coughing fits, body aches, chest pain, but chalked them up to anxiety, as I have severe anxiety and panic disorder in the best of times. My father has severe COPD and is a goner if he gets this, but I have nowhere to go at the moment. He's also still out in the world, working, as he's essential. but he's pushing 60 and has COPD.

On top of all of this, I ran out of my anxiety medication because the last two weeks have been so stressful, and my doctor refuses to renew my script early or up my doseage (i've been on it for almost ten years, with no incident) and I can't get it until the 4th, which means i'll be going through withdrawls on top of rebound anxiety on top of stress from this whole situation.

Even before I ran out of my meds, I had flu-like symptoms, chest tightness and body aches, and i'm only 27. My immune system is also garbage, I get the flu or a very bad cold that leaves me bedridden at least once a year. The symptons my friend has and the symptoms I think i'm feeling line up with the incubation time, because we know who the idiot who spread it is, and can deduce our last exposure to them.

I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks in an extreme manner, I have clinical depression, I most likely have covid, my best friend has it, his fiance's father is dying from it, and for all I know I already spread it to my family without knowing. I was denied a test, my friend only managed to get one because he works as a psychiatric counselor.

I don't think I can get through the week of hell to come, between all of this sickness, unsureity, the benzodiazepine withdrawls that are already starting to kick in, not knowing if I have it or not.

COVID19_support,yourname510,2020/03/28,"Anxiety and catastrophic thinking - tryin to adapt to a new routine for some “normalcy” Like many of you, I’ve been extremely anxious last several weeks I’ve been at home. I live by myself in  NYC as an Asian American female with senior parents. 

This combo with anxiety and catastrophic thinking has been extremely difficult. Not only am I worrying about covid19 as a pandemic, but I worry about the racist attacks on my community, the vulnerability of my senior parents, forced self isolation while living alone, being in the epicenter of the virus and the scary/unknown nature of this all. 

I’m doing my best to cope, but as someone who is obsessive about preventing uncomfortable situations - this fucking sucks. I’m doing my best to adapt to this new “normal”, but it’s really hard especially when you don’t have roommates or anyone to focus on the present with. 

As I’m writing this, I hear someone intensely coughing outside my window. Sigh, another point of escalating anxiety. 

Anyone relate and share their coping strategies?",8.52248484848485,9.569062400000002,8.950707070707075,60.03590909090912,61.111111111111114,12.323232323232324,40.252525252525245,11.911945987284742,5.5925555555555535,832,43,119,26,11,277,116,180,0.24100000000000002,0.67,0.08900000000000001,-0.9797,2,2,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,2,1,2,4,10,3,1,9,0,11,2,0,0,1,19,19,14,0,1,5,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,1,7,7,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,5,1,0,3,2,13,4,28,15,4,15,0,0,0,1,10,6,2,2,10,83,20,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14680758816571454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486345390084527,0.3253091867448915,0.1601342485242925,0.0,0.19822619698545235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16125816437052204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29751036426090016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13104321447773698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269778547922852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597596549269057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14218422915947496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11554307381340385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06925063411058452,0.0,0.2503311543495209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14370964536612948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738011013750953,0.0,0.0,0.13888238507325093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10780530751249473,0.0,0.0,0.3147874915471673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13399713768817195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09080703298296858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14787348292587565,0.1601342485242925,0.0,0.0,0.15933004973353074,0.0,0.0,0.2402042740416119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1816520586162984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137012378653675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879027904662533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Phylakt,2020/03/28,"Getting stressed out about all this. Shit is starting to really hit the fan here in the US. Confirmed and suspected COVID cases are going through the roof. Many close friends of mine have come to me for support, and I'm trying to help them but it's hard to pour from an empty cup, and I'm getting more and more stressed out as time goes on. The fact that a ton of people are *convinced* that things are going to magically return to normal any day now and that it's ""just a flu,"" along with the sheer amount of ""positive news"" that is just multibillionaires donating pissiant sums of their gargantuan fortunes to help us poors doesn't help. To top it all off, my uni barely understands how to move everything online, and is setting up to basically drop anyone without a solid internet connection out of anything. And this is all *before* things have truly begun to get bleak here in the US. The sheer amount of misinformation and fake news floating around doesn't help as well. I just wish I could get solid answers on how dangerous things are, rather than twelve different reactionary pundits desperately trying to save their stock portfolios.",7.887,8.18384365238095,7.193095238095237,74.66107142857145,62.47619047619048,10.428571428571429,34.16666666666667,10.125756701596842,3.364238095238095,917,35,161,18,12,284,130,210,0.153,0.706,0.142,0.3326,1,0,0,1,0,0,23.0,3,0,3,1,12,10,2,2,11,0,13,2,1,2,4,37,27,13,0,4,6,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,12,16,0,0,3,0,3,4,3,5,1,0,0,1,11,5,38,25,8,24,0,0,0,0,11,12,1,0,6,110,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904634750551762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09301614041143427,0.0,0.10947055599628754,0.11842295775488768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131968715236187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459168244162292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062118846924691,0.0,0.0,0.08579193474003527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13898575182201536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955682129846144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10277695889879793,0.0,0.2780061686156224,0.0,0.15120554434097636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11916679177746335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3566629577516487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348693235822341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138751336090025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13033901297714404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09222473627724656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522102384791687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13655113913380387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415777124918956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30476582234954946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509583865710052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2651333052460901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756958796787618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18063430669661512,0.0,0.0,0.13848664557178006,0.4800482419070422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11960798054233017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15297542066783254,0.12823406532806453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,ouceroni12,2020/03/28,"Just need to vent... I just need to vent. Today has been really hard. I'm a freelancer in NYC, so I've already lost a lot of work. Today, I officially lost my part time job that I had to supplement my not always stable freelance income. I also found out that based on my 2018 tax return, I won't qualify for the stimulus check, because I was a student then and my mom listed me as a dependent. I no longer receive financial support from family, and I'm sure there are others in this situation as well. I tried to quickly do my 2019 taxes so they would look at that instead, but the website I have to access to get one of my returns is down until further notice and I can't contact support because they're closed due to the virus. I also almost got scammed on UpWork today when looking for remote freelance work.

I just feel like I can't win. I was only just now getting financially stable after finishing school last May. It has been my dream to move to New York my entire life, so I did right after graduation. I've essentially been living paycheck to paycheck since I got here, but I was finally just within the past couple of months starting to make more money, and it feels like my progress doesn't even matter now. I'm just scared. I'm afraid of having to leave New York after working so hard to get here. I also have dealt with illness related anxiety since I was a child, so that hasn't been easy during all this either.

I know there are people going through much worse during this time. I know how privileged I sound. I know how lucky I am to not be sick myself or have lost someone to the virus already. I know. I just needed to vent, and I'd love to here from anyone who can relate.

I hope you guys are doing okay. Sending love to all. &lt;3",4.08111111111111,5.175699356125357,5.249132763532767,82.43568205128206,71.10826210826211,7.553321937321937,26.57561253561253,7.839951260653429,1.5481005356125357,1378,44,267,17,25,457,195,351,0.11599999999999999,0.742,0.142,0.9452,3,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,1,1,8,29,18,0,2,10,1,32,5,0,4,3,45,64,23,0,5,13,1,4,2,0,3,3,1,0,2,11,8,0,0,7,1,4,4,8,5,1,1,16,7,40,13,42,44,7,40,0,3,2,2,11,11,0,7,27,184,51,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550510277602238,0.0,0.2104991693842758,0.2288160169345901,0.07936031935926001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07296223823082554,0.0,0.0,0.06668898818734441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11628042444773565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553152639339604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06299482699689776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08991183115112897,0.0,0.09644975664514474,0.1362730041005324,0.0,0.10447954456069143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10457465945909583,0.0,0.0,0.14948978219916315,0.0,0.054204274203452,0.0,0.15256150569961313,0.0,0.0,0.09443705286385833,0.0,0.0,0.17087599494063854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09472970560252313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09464578070972453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096642168540485,0.07774401972951182,0.0,0.1009892180268692,0.0,0.0,0.0673667594811688,0.09319161221674067,0.0,0.08421859294694874,0.0,0.16018332895466145,0.0,0.3123419094943977,0.08108510814276923,0.1721607954292809,0.0,0.06366409782541138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11170300305356913,0.07612806644074459,0.10136939854369607,0.0701121988861603,0.2121598773177792,0.0,0.18422911495018668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10858599873098332,0.0,0.0,0.06462912130778893,0.07253760591251639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032827144875742,0.09104700842782326,0.06612158192083184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061100190005394885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08145042579065026,0.0,0.0,0.09548783032171576,0.09652541772454226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779172126267088,0.1072064133415043,0.0,0.0,0.08081161944143192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750749350391214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164626916207069,0.08989057791014772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11122881067318413,0.0,0.2712153648703234,0.0,0.0,0.06475391847176065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08575431281299474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083041900365406,0.0,0.09719610474908093,0.06775224326319015,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,PlayfulTitan18,2020/03/28,"I just need to let this off my chest Lately I have just been feeling nothing but overwhelmed by this pandemic.  Some days I am fine I continue my daily routine of getting out of bed, going to work, going back home and repeat. I try to do my favorite things to keep myself entertained, but lately I don't even think that is working. I feel like I am just starting to lose my happiness.  


When I drive out for what I need or heading to work I see the roads almost nearly empty. Places I normally loved to go to like my local parks, mall, stores all of it is just shut down now and it sucks. I know everyone is going through it and I know the reasoning behind it all. It just hurts to see everything so empty.  


I haven't been able to see any of my friends either. A huge connection I had to socializing as an introvert was meeting up with my local friends to play Pokemon Go. I loved that and it was a huge part of my life just feels like it was taken away. You might think it's silly I am upset over a game, but it's more than just a game. It was a way for me to be myself and to see wonderful people who loved the same stuff I did. Also even if my best friend lived closer I know I shouldn't be seeing him.   


Then comes the most difficult part of what I decided to do lately was to at least limit the amount of time I see my girlfriend. Normally we love to hang out over the weekend, but this weekend I said we should really at least quarantine ourselves for at least two weeks so to skip this weekend. I know it's not permanent and i'll likely see her soon, but it was hard to do. We also had two events that we were really looking forward to going to get cancelled.  


It's just all a lot to take in. No dining in with friends, no dining in with the girlfriend, no fun trips to go to, no sports to watch, no stores to go to aside from essentials, no hanging out with friends and the list just continues. Anyway thanks for those who toke the time to read my post I honestly appreciate it and even if this post didn't get a single view I appreciate that I was able to find a place where I can let out all my emotions and feelings.",3.4636942112240376,4.362637273972602,4.602970982471644,87.22690897039328,72.37899543378995,7.843393725143615,25.544557372219767,8.155646560271837,1.355502047429666,1658,50,358,24,31,545,203,438,0.087,0.695,0.217,0.9973,0,1,0,0,0,0,34.0,4,1,0,6,22,28,1,2,18,0,34,9,2,1,4,74,78,24,0,8,19,0,5,4,7,3,1,1,2,0,30,23,2,2,14,10,2,14,11,6,0,2,16,16,51,22,68,55,18,65,0,3,10,4,25,29,1,9,25,267,81,4,0.14621083138249813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07320451375936822,0.0,0.0,0.11692474903206533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049714189561572066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06868494452505483,0.05621355213856464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671962352223909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0629738424221229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04714694526071151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223375293271057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14485631277142166,0.0,0.0,0.06985535755675185,0.06570243375887891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14785717898185116,0.10445304715396214,0.0,0.0,0.066817025525528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824053140861729,0.0,0.11458368715175128,0.0,0.3323799396184205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782207439301571,0.06548809309233165,0.0,0.07502724741215908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07333069258957778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07826085949965303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06497945245733355,0.0,0.0,0.1607072983684882,0.0,0.24739827944250986,0.0,0.0,0.14951048117550625,0.05163651708672253,0.14286245363825426,0.0,0.06455342140867659,0.0,0.06139013711122303,0.08178626051738251,0.0,0.062151610146295326,0.2639219675493755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755329329536985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10841347883940493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432555712559526,0.07014661801971786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583320822457403,0.0,0.05068209041004209,0.0,0.15275919940557106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14002956005764866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312519905497261,0.0,0.09366640252593693,0.07516454302039384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695399912941219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40778885921094177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07452176491514396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05174438949777567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368821064901565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05496617451858053,0.0,0.0,0.06730564474614481,0.0,0.0,0.04856798978096182,0.09368599701528904,0.0,0.0,0.0852567115754942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049633778488840194,0.0,0.14282673699597218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058027676198707225,0.058640754816822835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07927970484891164,0.15966483991358393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,NoRealImage,2020/03/28,"Adive - Should I go to work or stay home and risk the financial consequences Hello,

I was wondering if any of you give me an opinon/advice on what the right course of action is. I live in Ontario (Canada) and I work full-time at a warehouse. We do not ship out anything essential but it is still legal for us to be open. I take two buses to get to work and I am terrified of contracting Covid-19. I am 24 and in good health but my dad is 60 years old and my mom is 52 with a host of serious mental health problems. I do not want to bring this virus home, but at the same time I am scared of asking work to lay me off. 

They wont penalize me for it, but I am scared of the financial consequences. To be honest I am in a better position than others financially. I do have savings but I am a student who intends to use most of that money for school but I live with my parents and do not pay rent. I help them with bills and while my parents arent well off they are at least stable financially speaking. However I know this virus is throwing Canada and the world into a bad reccession. I initally agreed to work despite the pandemic because I thought it would be wiser to work a lot and save money to prepare for the recession, especially since I recieved a temporary raise of $17 (CDN). Also I have severe ADHD so having some sort of structure is helpful and keeps me from letting myself go. Buisness is booming at the moment but how long will that last? We ship out stuff related to hobbies and the like not exactly the things people buy during a recession. Will I even be able to come back to my job after things calm down, whenever that is?

I am doing my best to keep a distance from people, but I am worried it is not enough. As more days pass and the fear and paranoia in the news and in society increases so does my anxiety. I almost burst into tears at work today cause I was scared of contratcing the virus and taking it home. I don't know anymore if deciding to work rather than isolate is a good idea. Every time a public service announcement comes on the TV it tells people to stay at home as much as possible and here I am working. 

Between my parents income and my savings I might be okay or I might not be. The uncertanity and anxiety is driving me insane and I don't know if I am just going to trade one concern for another. I don't know what to do. If anyone has any advice on this situation that would be appreciated and any tips on how to stay sane.",3.9757314974182414,4.954370767068276,5.384444061962135,81.80143373493976,71.24899598393574,8.582994836488814,28.485599541021234,8.922882184376627,2.19767176133104,1934,71,389,36,35,651,245,498,0.128,0.77,0.102,-0.898,8,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,3,1,3,11,12,20,0,5,27,1,54,2,0,5,1,87,75,43,0,10,22,5,0,1,0,8,2,2,5,0,20,32,0,2,8,1,7,11,11,8,1,2,3,2,54,12,69,56,10,52,0,0,0,0,21,25,0,14,14,288,74,17,0.07269331411872086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736323711885173,0.1420701304720256,0.0,0.0,0.07279185356243006,0.0,0.0,0.05813281703737005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14830183908206346,0.07622527810029804,0.111220372660942,0.0,0.07209223432957552,0.05082885543555017,0.0,0.0598204036479307,0.0,0.06795843582491637,0.0,0.0,0.055896671466802425,0.060695880887372676,0.04431316957182434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762871483465173,0.06429132897849625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467605789488052,0.0,0.12523770681471366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0468811738387433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361440905689186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07511162563237049,0.0,0.0480132483884415,0.0,0.061247252381951826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180018832788451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03797925632113626,0.06973405078923144,0.12393985689525094,0.12194340594370992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15453918723116475,0.0,0.0,0.09744959228896233,0.0,0.2916692844464943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206190337943041,0.0,0.0,0.07213689750045278,0.12922631528949394,0.0,0.0,0.15980137738099096,0.05925475325414847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433383880910725,0.0,0.035514281397280745,0.0,0.12837905634016675,0.06433129546987675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06180125612622354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07325776298171961,0.15423223730157784,0.0,0.08513753092154648,0.0,0.0,0.05343795007718339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627940483596139,0.0,0.0492588709646016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24215196796533436,0.0,0.0,0.15118917320423425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08195078929770619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06955768416510244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062079693067867286,0.0,0.0,0.21833606665206048,0.0735695147989652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212275362493156,0.0,0.0601326606309867,0.08171033079990933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2324442020920411,0.058052974556992376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321645294290825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10931265084542564,0.0,0.06353716062727982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965884156154221,0.0,0.0,0.057710371488282175,0.0847761120935457,0.0,0.06890476197842882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101080514232652,0.0,0.08744110639312795,0.06278368353959662,0.0,0.0,0.042876400086046505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0653600195087954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07883279827258095,0.4762943860645926,0.07382358910499927,0.0,0.10327848935373246,0.0,0.0,0.046812110948533416
COVID19_support,hennyrivs,2020/03/28,"PLEASE help ease my anxiety: Does anyone know of someone, or have news articles of people who were diagnosed, over 50+ years old, and only had mild symptoms, or have even recovered? Not only do my brother and his wife work as ER nurses, my dad, 60, has to go back to work as a security officer at an off-site ER and I am petrified. I have no doubt one of my family members will contract this. I have been having anxiety attacks about my dad going back to work for three days now. 

My dad was recently out of work due to hip surgery and was approved yesterday to go back to work (he starts Wednesday). He is fairly healthy, I believe only on HTN medication, but with his age, I don’t know what to expect when he does contract this. 

I am a student nurse myself and currently under a lot of stress aside from worrying about my family. I have done a lot of research and even tried searching the “good news,” of those who suffered mild symptoms, but the bad is just so overpowering. 

He cannot, not work. None of my family wants him to, but money.

COVID19_support,a-l-b--,2020/03/29,"(Unemployment related, hope that’s okay) just frustrated that I don’t know how long I’m going to need to stretch the last of my money. I know money is coming in. I’m in Michigan and have applied for unemployment. I applied the Monday before last, 2 weeks tomorrow. It didn’t seem like anything further needed to be done. I logged onto the website and saw the amount I was allowed to get and when my unemployment started. I could see they verified with my employers how much money I make and the reason I’m seeking unemployment.

I’m stressed because I have no idea if I am waiting on them, or they are waiting on me to send in something I’m unaware of. Nobody answers the phones or answers my chat request on their website. They’re just too busy and I’m not trying to complain or say it’s the employees fault. 

I have a little bit of money to get me through, but it won’t last me all next week. Granted, I have a boyfriend who is still working and can pay the mortgage so it’s not life or death. 

It’s just really irritating having no idea if I’m all set, and then also if I should expect my check tomorrow or in 2 weeks from now. No idea!

Has anyone received their unemployment check after becoming unemployed from covid yet?",3.7538395168248506,5.318281459016394,5.087273511647972,81.46255823986195,72.52459016393442,7.759792924935289,30.05522001725625,8.371475516178862,2.2808885245901642,972,42,186,16,19,324,135,244,0.128,0.8220000000000001,0.05,-0.9372,16,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,5,1,12,7,1,1,10,1,19,1,0,5,2,46,42,22,1,9,14,0,0,1,0,2,1,1,0,0,8,9,0,2,9,1,7,4,8,4,0,0,4,3,25,3,24,34,5,34,0,0,2,0,13,11,0,10,19,123,33,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142089824003268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985946237794996,0.0,0.11752445134415328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08705860582118011,0.15772777929548767,0.12152491689307812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15591682536607412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12302234591748938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402603523027892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14614917382708795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492297272973986,0.0,0.08116496932503901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418473683558539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4836617399483941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15697461113162015,0.3492394872514978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008743507254291,0.06977212090814215,0.1431379965683301,0.0,0.12638664641670985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09533002005913248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498534581510596,0.21179080048026835,0.0,0.0,0.1518852111166925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09149084865388908,0.14683744959060072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11357209934989004,0.0,0.0,0.11380494360742248,0.13001327392817644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099458473429458,0.0,0.0,0.10108508452468777,0.0,0.1140521221464982,0.0,0.163593925937926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09696190722357864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3436723699777061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397091030825137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,vicepresident_,2020/03/29,"anyone else seriously worried about losing a loved one to suicide? Hi all, 


I live in a quiet neighborhood in Brooklyn and the lock down has taken a serious hit to my girlfriends' mental health. I'm actually more worried about losing her to suicide than her getting sick. I'm struggling too but I think she's at the end of her rope with everything happening. I feel like I'm juggling trying to take care of my parents and making sure I'm there for them if anything goes wrong and trying to be there for my girlfriend but I'm fumbling the ball.




I go to see her once a week. She lives 10 blocks away and she picks me up in her car. I've made us masks with filters and we go straight to her apartment. She's an extrovert and the only interaction she's had with anyone is with me and my family for the past month. It's been extremely hard on her and me. I'm worried when she doesn't text me back or call me in the morning....worried that I've lost her.




I still feel guilty for leaving the house but I know that our once a week meeting is keeping her alive.

COVID19_support,tsniagasaxor,2020/03/29,"My roommate and I have been fighting alot because of COVID19 Hey y'all. Before I get into it, I just wanna lay down some information about my roommate(s) and I so you have a little bit more insight.

me (tsniagasaxor)
• an essential worker in my area, I work retail and my job has no intentions of closing
• have been diagnosed with MDD/General Anxiety, for this I am taking medication and seeing a therapist who is also monitoring my manic behaviors
• I do everything I can in order to keep my roommate from freaking out, including wiping down groceries, disinfecting the apartment, washing my clothes as soon as I take them off and showering before I sit down

my roommate (🐝)
• has been diagnosed with anxiety and contagion OCD (she is not on her medication since I've asked)
• quit her job and hid in her room since the virus hit the states
• has freaked herself out so much that she woke up sick because she hadn't drank/eaten anything

roommates boyfriend (🐕)
• is also an essential worker, works as a delivery driver for a pharmacy
• has graduated with his psych degree in December


Okay sorry, now for the problem. I had to leave work to get my dad from the airport. I then dropped him off at my aunt's place where he suggested I wait around for my cousin so he can give me money to get takeout. I agree, considering I didn't want to cook. So I sit outside with my red bull, watching a birthday celebration way more than 6ft away from me, scrolling on Facebook. There's a huge thing of hand sanitizer too, so I use that a few times (in addition to washing my hands after going to the bathroom). It was nice, seeing people trying to get something fun out of this whole pandemic thing. I post a picture of the gathering on my Snapchat. My roommate is outraged. She says I'm not following CDC guidelines and putting everyone in danger. I tell her I have been limiting my distance and washing/sanitizing my hands frequently. That gets overlooked of course and she goes straight into I can't be around her (or her boyfriend) if I'm just going to ignore what her and the CDC says. I explain I'm not ignoring anyone, and if she wants I can just stay in my room, I don't want to leave the apartment I'm also paying for. This escalates by her saying that her, her boyfriend and his dad pay more than I do. That's upsetting. She then goes on to say how I feel isn't as important as their health. Okay cool I guess. At this point I'm crying and my cousin slides me an extra few dollars so I can get something to eat. I leave and get takeout from McDonald's. I told her I would just stay in my room and that I'm not repeating myself. So thats what I did (and I'm still doing). I don't know how to get through to her without having to feel like I am being completely ignored. What makes it worse is that her boyfriend (not that I expect him to side with me or anything) isn't seeing why I'm having a difficult time with this. Any help will be appreciated, I'm kinda tired of being in my room and I want to eat something else that isn't potato chips.",3.668197236180904,5.388968199329987,4.835834380234509,82.54460584170856,73.03685092127303,7.990075376884422,29.187918760469014,8.660442795831766,2.2886371021775544,2393,100,465,45,48,788,278,597,0.10800000000000001,0.835,0.057,-0.9623,3,0,3,0,2,0,64.0,0,2,2,7,25,17,3,1,22,3,45,15,3,5,0,76,88,41,0,10,14,5,5,1,0,2,9,4,5,0,24,33,3,6,6,1,5,5,15,11,0,0,11,15,92,6,81,70,11,68,0,0,5,0,52,44,0,8,11,325,116,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199974414262216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05668355656320336,0.0,0.12753111472647038,0.0,0.0,0.05828303249556315,0.0,0.13718642687639784,0.14840540715878522,0.0779247081129631,0.0,0.07831379677233777,0.0,0.0,0.10162361044744952,0.0,0.14185617490093458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100094455768387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08739504956290788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09156041983725786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920504584714874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1705838371913315,0.06963154450888087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07964828847117839,0.07491317173538503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842925414454691,0.0595480913876466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3483920637369194,0.07996072139278214,0.0947439618044086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182379315147844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860137016711482,0.0,0.0,0.055870407718098716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16543190300552907,0.07408883663384368,0.0,0.0,0.04580916091324158,0.0,0.0,0.2647794502186724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040722538388826175,0.08354257380003588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055639420888129634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16794070693738813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0612747573038293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057787146161578935,0.0,0.08708715556281045,0.0,0.07879644213489427,0.0,0.07983006017042281,0.0,0.0,0.07975849016807403,0.0,0.08379376035134838,0.0,0.08865720520110279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26514568371882546,0.0,0.0,0.19926696184251896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379025273565078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19250987059758354,0.0,0.09330794287599901,0.0,0.17768847856002673,0.06656658651028435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253436207997732,0.0,0.07285504199895,0.0,0.0,0.0967803813440172,0.1107533450786953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09720873810075686,0.0958031243415622,0.0,0.07964828847117839,0.0,0.05659187276769745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07199106563729878,0.0,0.0,0.19665731979162487,0.06616249998336808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07521399123147816,0.09306172852009087,0.0,0.0803502506499937,0.0,0.182048044315142,0.0,0.08494481451148886,0.05921226731859725,0.0,0.0,0.0

It's annoying to me and others around me but now I'm very self conscious because I don't want to make people be fearful that I have covid while working in their home and amongst co workers.

COVID19_support,rward40,2020/03/29,"Social distancing and meeting with extended family or who have isolated themselves I live on a large, 500 acre+ forested property in northern California. (I'm very fortunate to be living here during this pandemic). I have 4 adult children and three weeks ago, three of them decided to leave other cities in California and shelter in place with us. Two kids brought along their significant others. We have a total of 8 people sheltering together in 3 different dwellings, including my MIL who is 87. Four of us are in a higher risk category - MIL's age, autoimmune disorders, and past tuberculosis/lung issues (I'm 60 years old and have the past lung issues). 

We've kept my MIL at a distance from everyone, per her request (we provide her with meals). The rest of us get together for dinners, play games, etc.

I think we've had very good practices. I stocked up on essentials soon after the outbreak of Covid19. We send one person for groceries and supplies when needed and try to limit any trips to the store.

The challenge is this: My daughter-in-law wants to visit her family who live 20 miles away and my daughter wants to see her boyfriend who is also close by. We are confident that the daughter-in-law's family has been very safe and the boyfriend has also practiced self isolation. Do we bend our rules and allow them to make these visits of other people who are following safe practices? Is there any research or articles on how to deal with this situation? Most everything I read says to hold firm and not have any closes contact with anyone.

This issue is causing some family drama. It is hard to gauge the real risk here.

Thanks for any input.",6.579262295081969,7.706270491803282,6.7614344262295125,73.74838114754101,65.39344262295081,10.165573770491806,33.610655737704924,10.241411754978122,3.621324590163935,1320,56,224,31,20,424,184,305,0.039,0.8740000000000001,0.087,0.9416,1,1,0,0,0,0,41.0,9,0,3,2,8,9,0,3,12,0,20,3,1,4,1,45,33,17,0,3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,15,24,2,5,2,4,1,6,1,3,0,5,4,3,25,6,39,28,5,32,0,0,1,0,37,16,0,4,10,143,40,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09106761581904614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.164312908077721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27945095036633577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07183409884909271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09652210562345263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553626042756782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591438652255597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10733530966600736,0.11774222404527553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11457572180347357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816687262515436,0.09233082001950337,0.0,0.3873944135106136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05367434756123585,0.0,0.0,0.08616852181201083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09202960972372552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3216832506190655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878061982369948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27214838139487696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685758356909181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617606251196601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10780219739718998,0.0,0.06961531153406729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961427210424999,0.14244583343853412,0.0897034877498469,0.10733530966600736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276194056392347,0.11693394182828595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816983109754898,0.0,0.0,0.08186580794586927,0.0,0.1071741127176701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154774769051264,0.0,0.10472451734690966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09458379265156412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582788820663298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697497369025801,0.0,0.1003563261898646,0.0,0.3707295605789789,0.0,0.0,0.2542992722042208,0.12119051415508132,0.0,0.08240712967604809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0661574174038894
COVID19_support,velvetgalaxy,2020/03/29,"My neighbor doesn’t think the virus is a real thing 
My neighbor is a hard working man in his 40s with a family and has always been kind to me. I ran into to him yesterday while making my way to throw out our trash. He starts mentioning how everyone is making a big deal out of nothing and he doesn’t really follow the news. He mentioned how our president(US) is making sure we profit from this which he thought was a plus because he is helping our economy.  Just a way to look out for our country because the virus is just a way for corporations to profit anyway according to him. He didn’t think we should worry about social distancing. 

I felt the anger building up in me as I asked him if he had read or watched the daily news briefing our state has held regarding our healthy/safety but he said that would be a waste of time. I walked away feeling like I couldn’t trust my fellow human being and I’ll never be able to look at him the same. I hope he doesn’t visit his older family members but I’m sure he will.",5.536051779935279,5.424209805825247,6.284611650485437,80.58073624595471,67.44660194174757,9.196763754045307,29.302588996763763,8.841846274778883,2.1408006472491903,804,25,161,12,12,265,122,206,0.045,0.83,0.125,0.9371,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,8,0,0,1,6,9,1,0,14,0,22,0,0,5,3,39,40,12,0,5,6,0,3,1,3,3,0,1,2,2,4,11,0,1,5,1,2,6,6,1,0,0,9,7,26,8,25,24,1,26,0,0,3,0,37,10,0,3,7,106,30,4,0.14906527008369838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12403424607944985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393559051959358,0.0,0.1400517281722635,0.0,0.0,0.1817376101384152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15367974802224849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424382536167837,0.0,0.0,0.2810509403312225,0.0,0.07537187946453901,0.10649225873244343,0.14312603583632186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13353320259203916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991530837606603,0.0,0.0,0.14805544774267845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15522854001038916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07282576138526553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503545676453941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2985066758749824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149683258709539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14303214695787486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14910560926279653,0.16966891189604538,0.09549502905000604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417952074529706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15195327061821967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550916539997623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809845058777542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09903234179937782,0.19103001215567,0.0,0.1183411736942105,0.08692115773695204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17930716598807864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549632189257263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10852129197973058,0.15138301757039674,0.0,0.10589169097592244,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Username8891,2020/03/29,"Useful Resource Recommendation-Actually Valid Self Help Book written by the Creators of Cognitive Behavior. How to Find &amp; Recommended Use Last night, I remembered a valuable resource recommended to me by a therapist. The creators of cognitive behavioral therapy wrote a book discussing how to moderate the intensity of your reactions to situations. It is called *A Guide to Rational Living* written by Albert Ellis &amp; Robert Harper. The oldest edition is available in archives.org for free to borrow digitally (may contain more biases therapists had at the time), while the most up to date edition is available from multiple sellers for fairly low cost. On Amazon, I see for $5 to $25 after tax/shipping. 

For people unfamiliar with cognitive behavioral therapy, the idea is that your emotions are valid, but sometimes the intensity of thoughts attached to them can create maladaptive behavior. These maladptive thoughts are to be identified and challenged so the feelings are not so overwhelming. It is normal and healthy to experience fear/grief right now. The idea of targeting such thoughts is to not become immobilized by worry/anxiety/hopelessness/despair. 

Some people might be able to use the book alone easily enough, but it is recommended that if you are having a particularly hard time that you have someone to discuss it with that has some grasp of cognitive behavioral therapy, at least to start. I imagine it would also be a good book to discuss with friends who are struggling.

Chapter 13 How to Feel Frustrated But Not Depressed or Enraged

**Chapter 15 Conquering Panic &amp; Anxiety**

**Chapter 18 Accepting and Coping with the Grim Facts of Life**

The two bolded helped me last night as everything started to click.  The thoughts that occurred to me is that I can't control the CDC, federal government, or friends who put themselves at risk, but I can control my exposure to the virus and how I use my waking hours for productivity/connection that I felt were missing. Instead of worrying/obsessing about what people do wrong, I can discuss what I understand of safety protocols with people who understand the threat there is and try to frame the discussion calmly and persuasively for those who do not see it yet. If persuasion doesn't work, I can either rework my message or accept that I tried and the person is responsible for their own actions.",10.390542732376792,13.494215558951964,8.450109794135994,57.7866244541485,58.25764192139738,11.26048658764816,40.15995009357455,11.150228224882083,5.583433611977542,2458,124,302,69,35,735,250,458,0.079,0.775,0.146,0.9809,0,1,0,0,0,1,117.0,0,4,2,5,15,22,3,4,27,0,40,2,1,11,1,68,62,26,0,7,14,0,4,0,2,6,1,0,0,2,24,12,0,3,17,6,6,2,6,12,0,2,10,7,24,11,61,42,10,33,0,5,3,0,24,10,0,11,21,221,48,12,0.08148971729584749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439877110562745,0.0,0.13033459496013058,0.0,0.35317629857602595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06233941068415861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899989904313316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321011245565396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18279529431719832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07018697409886099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09166496374173973,0.0,0.08420066154112921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07323770341820364,0.07971258016612923,0.0,0.09169858744780653,0.08240729911364733,0.0,0.07824290789818715,0.0,0.07448012529770039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259175068775759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06834970861430681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07299878048538416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092416795477762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08025095668288625,0.0,0.0,0.18398394372906346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328499917675985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057558597263306574,0.0,0.0,0.07195691333306316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08644771233765287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15294515883462312,0.07984262104469579,0.0,0.0,0.08550975025607177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09561062530623553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2259788378425865,0.07115367793781117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08191967349327105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231196422519153,0.06959177331840304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12987350835105133,0.0,0.08501154738653723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18319571305169047,0.0,0.0,0.06904597302064375,0.0,0.08059541409226903,0.0,0.1730365239818219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519074583215239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27957178088125445,0.1892316851997816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25877493217260433,0.1425519284344677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11065233783670174,0.0,0.0796036128790069,0.16966733918842378,0.0,0.2815238063890165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593254847292258,0.0,0.0,0.23155182845104125,0.08909621339287484,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,sweetehpie,2020/03/29,"Will I be safe working as a delivery driver? Also just want to vent... I recently moved to the city I am currently living in and have been hired to work as a delivery driver for amazon. My background check still needs to go through so I won't be starting until approx. 2 weeks. I am concerned for my safety while working there. I'm concerned about picking up packages that may have been exposed to someone sick or that the vehicle itself will have been exposed. Is there anything I can do to protect myself? 

I'm also scared of exposing others to it I have been feeling kind of sick for a week now I have not been tested for covid19 but my (so far) mild symptoms match up a lot. I may have contracted it from my parents who went to a casino earlier this month before lockdowns they got sick too but have since gotten over their sickness.

I hate this situation so much I feel sick but I have not been getting a good amount of sleep and I know that's not helping me get better. I can never relax enough to actually fall asleep I hate it so much. I just feel so anxious and scared that my sickness will just get worse and worse. I'm so scared of the future and I don't know how to deal with this fear at all.",2.5063075196408526,4.507584024691361,3.6255462027684295,88.74238215488216,77.06584362139918,6.064272353161242,25.037224092779645,6.980632752743323,1.0125818930041142,950,34,191,10,22,307,133,243,0.23800000000000002,0.7120000000000001,0.05,-0.9947,2,1,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,2,4,18,11,2,4,9,0,29,9,2,2,2,31,49,22,0,2,10,1,3,0,0,6,7,0,0,0,13,6,0,2,5,2,2,4,6,6,0,0,9,3,26,5,30,32,6,22,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,4,12,143,39,5,0.0,0.0,0.12616424933522755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20677954665081247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1460561059114292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10639116231745686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11001265703360497,0.0,0.0,0.11434274595024105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13328793875751851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13358674745181218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454824204331752,0.19611229033224614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20263941619682205,0.0,0.07347607520978422,0.10843875922048847,0.10340163051375027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552858382495189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665751782622437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13463122109836112,0.1421041420880006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11416169223492935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10991412747137523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10319465794118816,0.13741029947953556,0.19007981470785146,0.09586375079198073,0.09971314616889967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435565334358549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12765408808778195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3883127911280482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10694651436029147,0.14532260795680815,0.12937912583044975,0.0,0.10954340252977632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150912437826864,0.0,0.10324777270736152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13437740436599252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07625608927666591,0.0,0.20741047206282615,0.0,0.0,0.11984919218555287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2823647130886833,0.0,0.2635064635617507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Mantisss8,2020/03/29,"How to prepare yourself for what might come after the crisis is over? I know that the world will have to change after this mess is over and I really hope that it will change for good but I still have lots of fears about what if it won't. Crash of economy will be hard, food shortages etc... On a personal level, debt and studies worries me a lot. It seems like there's nothing I can do and perhaps that's what makes me so afraid. 

So is there anything that I could do to prepare for anything bad that will happen after this crisis?

COVID19_support,ferorealism,2020/03/29,"Should my wife and I go be with my family in California? In NYC currently My parents are getting increasingly worried about my wife and I living in New York, and are asking us to come join them in their home north of San Francisco. We’re currently as safe as we can be—have been at home for about 4 weeks. I lost my job, and am finishing grad school from home, and my wife is working from home, so we don’t have to leave the apartment except when necessary. Right now, we feel anxious but relatively insulated—however, I can’t help but imagine the worst case scenario in which one of us gets sick, and the hospitals here are so overrun that we won’t be able to get health care. We’re young and healthy but I’m worried about one of us getting very sick.

Is it the smart play to take my parents’ advice? The virus of course is in California, but things are not looking nearly as dire there as they are here. It feels like a difficult choice to uproot everything indefinitely—and my mother-in-law is in the NYC as well, so I know my wife is reticent to leave her.

COVID19_support,godotwasthere,2020/03/29,"Partner in distress - how could I help him? Hi all, I’m looking for some advice here. I have the impression that the lockdown and the unfolding global pandemic situation has been quite hard on my partner’s (31/M) mental health. We have been self-quarantined for almost two weeks now, and ever since it started, he became extremely distant emotionally, he hardly ever engages in any activity, does not really fulfill his work-related duties and his behavior changed quite substantially. His sleeping patterns are a mess, he is awake until 5 am-ish, sleeps until midday or even longer, he is extremely irritated and when he is awake he plays some online games non-stop. This is a very big change, as he used to be a much more active and motivated person. We normally have a very loving and balanced relationship, but he stopped sharing his thoughts and worries with me, and therefore I have no idea how could I help him to feel better. My problem is obviously not that he is acting “lazy”, but I’m very worried that he is sliding into a depressive period. 

We are in Europe, our country is not really affected so far, but his only living relative, his elderly mother lives alone in New York and I believe he worries a lot about her. A few days ago I caught some words from their Skype call, and I heard that they discussed her will and potential funeral arrangements. I believe he must be in a horrible pain emotionally and I want to be there for him, but it’s very hard as he really gives me no clue how. Please help me - how could I be more supportive?",6.162234119782215,7.179122065517241,6.923321234119783,72.6111705989111,66.27586206896552,10.381125226860256,33.53901996370236,10.426177893888326,3.7140689655172414,1229,53,213,31,19,407,173,290,0.17300000000000001,0.711,0.11599999999999999,-0.9649,0,3,0,0,0,0,38.0,4,0,2,4,13,12,0,1,11,0,26,5,2,8,5,55,39,27,1,7,8,1,4,0,2,2,2,1,0,3,7,17,0,2,4,2,0,3,5,5,0,1,5,6,32,7,20,25,9,26,0,1,1,1,46,10,0,6,13,140,39,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09519966364164316,0.08635873646925546,0.0,0.09755407349836416,0.10089982458767432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06625030962357238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2195224948478651,0.0,0.0861618536351275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947876776770187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2061191442378172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333506503797509,0.0,0.0,0.06282913890126351,0.0,0.0839094370941915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08525466014364612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21917330409471736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434632081684928,0.1762475766554786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04925949700680306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345607211659854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26181296420315864,0.0,0.0,0.10355504422343506,0.0,0.0,0.1958997653574592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997759449588278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17205084477094842,0.0,0.0818099546089327,0.0,0.0,0.08282471165895079,0.08792717039545175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817847526186607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07161638911915394,0.0,0.0,0.09409078728776174,0.0,0.0,0.09545288814629203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409383093571825,0.10366389065784372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506514406125422,0.0,0.10694011505777287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09321970936759692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072406056025966,0.0,0.0,0.18723310859721234,0.0,0.0,0.10459478285520428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10163240657252222,0.0,0.0,0.08058849593404463,0.10950642450110867,0.19498474014425146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895580227179632,0.0,0.0,0.16289833037327986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055334591672618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734219622470942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516715078688368,0.0,0.0,0.08414133970729151,0.0,0.3215334545303833,0.057462027419759136,0.0,0.07814606247101527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709243857978225,0.2968103497166275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,ThrowRA551199,2020/03/29,"My Boyfriend doesn’t take this as serious as I’d like him to. I work from home and our young child stays with me while I work and my boyfriend who lives with me works outside of the home. 

I have this set up on our porch to take off shoes and leave any groceries out to be sprayed down, hand sanitizer, etc before entering the house.
(To some I may be over reacting, but this helps with my anxiety) 

I have asked my boyfriend to use hand sanitizer often as he’s the one picking up the food for us and also working around people. I told him I can send him with bleach or Lysol wipes and I have some face mask as well.

Many if not all of his co-workers wear gloves and mask all day long and his response was.. “I probably wouldn’t wear that stuff, I use the sanitizer at least twice a day though.” 

I truly didn’t know how to respond to his response. I feel like he’s being selfish and doesn’t even care about us at all. 

Fast forward a few hours and I finally decided to have that dreadful conversation with him once again and asked him to please be more cautious and mindful. Use hand sanitizer more often and wear a mask if needed. At this point he starts to get upset with me and says he wishes he would just get the virus just so it would over with already. 

So my question is, would I be a jerk if I were to ask him to leave during all of this (for the safety of me and our child)? He has a friend he can stay with that has an extra room.

I've been having really bad insomnia, and paranoia about the whole situation. I'm paranoid about getting the virus because i have many health issues, including asthma so if I do get the virus, I will more than likely get it worse than the average person would. I feel very isolated from those around me, everyone else I know seems to be doing fine and I feel like an alien because of how I'm reacting to it, but reading this subreddit has helped me realize i am not alone with how i am feeling. I don't want to keep feeling this crappy, so do any of you guys have any coping mechanisms to share that might help with insomnia and anxiety?",5.941022727272728,5.778501625000002,6.336022727272727,80.72488636363637,66.60416666666666,10.10681818181818,30.47537878787879,9.800150414767053,2.6211083333333343,760,25,154,15,11,246,120,192,0.105,0.7879999999999999,0.107,-0.1829,0,2,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,1,0,1,14,9,0,1,8,0,24,4,0,3,0,34,38,15,0,3,3,0,4,3,0,4,4,0,1,2,8,15,0,2,8,2,0,0,4,2,1,0,3,4,17,7,22,30,2,15,0,0,0,0,9,8,0,3,8,101,25,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440639867917947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18918335625587493,0.0,0.1064098910417912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24765412330393816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11614134924003874,0.16958618041063872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897069571111738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11619885986496015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329144768484345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2813293107360038,0.09937192080374548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21801951011082715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13772927954539446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14785508878923342,0.0,0.0,0.18646944349210973,0.0,0.1395270310449515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3005002708675051,0.1451825849310018,0.0,0.1236370441916009,0.0,0.0,0.15288967972871184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20386934822270794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14102393963798285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14756141499745246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12145535277748801,0.14532821663880166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782720729453885,0.0,0.08910999331651458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14077500131420664,0.0,0.12662995415668288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15635242338044195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14826038087652332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14541584340116087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11477074300147935,0.08204383697453098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12506616167566,0.0,0.0,0.1552983899375925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126528782926957,0.0,0.1417531474749442,0.0988115085047799,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,MoonlightConcerto,2020/03/29,"$200 DIY 'good enough for now' ventilators to solve acute but temporary shortage  

**Imagine** if it was possible to BUILD a ventilator using less than $200 in parts available at home or at hardware stores, and imagine if we were able to teach almost anyone to do this with stuff readily available within a 15 minute drive.

We wouldn't have to worry about shortages due to the exploding coronavirus situation, would we ?

Don't have to imagine too much. Its pretty much available right now: :

[https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/5dm4mb/people-are-trying-to-make-diy-ventilators-to-meet-coronavirus-demand](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm4mb/people-are-trying-to-make-diy-ventilators-to-meet-coronavirus-demand)

This is the best one so far:\*\*Low-Cost Open-Source Ventilator-ish Device or PAPR [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n57u1NvXBgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n57u1NvXBgw))[https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator](https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator)\-

DC power supply- Breathing tube.- And a blower, which, the guy in the video says it's just a standard brushless dc motor.

**Very rudimentary, but probably the cheapest one I was able to find.**

They can be easily modified with pressure regulators and ICs which work better for patients with fluid in the lungs. Those portable devices, are not expensive and are available at hardware shops, hobby shops, etc.

\----------------------

**Imagine if someone made a video or released information on how such a portable device could be built by anyone ?**

Then imagine if everybody who is now sitting at home collecting free money, just went out and made one with parts available from ordinary electronics and hardware shops (well maybe slightly better hardware shops), and normal DIY tools and equipment? And they sent all of it to central points where qualified mechanics or engineer friends would test them and tweak them for the next 12-24 hours. And when they pass muster, these are sent to the hospitals that need them for them to use for the next 3 months until proper $20k (now $40k) ventilators are shipped in.

No need to buy a bmw when you can make a bicycle to do the job that is needed in the short term right now. Any other issues can be solved by the same DIY inventor's mindset that created this device. This is not perfect, but it saves lives until the best solutions arrive. Remember, its better to have an imperfect ventilator compared to no ventilator at all. It will also stop the industry from ripping hospitals off by jacking up the prices of ventilators etc at this emergency time. This is, of course, the ONLY reason why industry has not stepped up to fix things even though they've had so much warning that it would be needed.

Btw, the **same basic idea - diy methods that are advertised for everyone** to use from home - can be used to create basic personal protective equipment for hospitals, including certain types of masks. As long as it is cheap, people will gladly donate their personal time and money for this purpose.

**Someone will take it and run with it. Spread the word, people.**

I get dressed every morning because it helps to keep me from staying in bed all day, however, I’ve been having a harder and harder time giving a crap about my outfits. Who’s going to see me? Other than my husband who insists he loves me no matter what. 

Today was the worst day yet. I pulled out my grey, glittery sweatpants, a “born to be a unicorn” shirt, and a bright pink cardigan with glittering buttons. They don’t match, at all, and I don’t care. Or at least, I didn’t, until I walked outside to get a package, forgetting what I was wearing, and my neighbors greeted me from their front porch. Whoops, hope they don’t judge too much!

COVID19_support,Jellyfish2_0,2020/03/30,"Feeling hopeless My chronic depression and anxiety have morphed into an oppressive sense of dread, loss of faith in humanity, and repeating thoughts of imminent doom. I am unable to see anything but death, destruction, and dystopia coming out of this. 

I am not on social media and do not go overboard with COVID-19 news, but I do stay on top of the updates. Simply reading about and seeing people go about their lives like nothing is happening or that their precautions don't matter is incredibly overwhelming. I am a deep empath and I feel like I'm physically drowning. 

I am doing the best I can staying on my medications, being outside as much as possible, soaking up time with my kids, and relaxing as much as possible, but these horrible thoughts still find their way in and suffocate me. 

I feel like nothing matters. Everything you work toward as a contributing member of society is futile. Nature will always overtake and my efforts don't matter. Like I could die and just be swept under the rug with the others. I need all of this to go away.

COVID19_support,Frondeur-,2020/03/30,"Potential workplace infection So I don’t know where to go about a situation I’m having. 

Last week the county I work in stated we would be entering a shelter in place order for 14 days. That only essential businesses would be open. My business is one of them thankfully (so I don’t lose my job). However it is kinda a questionable essential business, I don’t want to give to much info out. 

I felt sick towards the end of the week, and as a precaution I went home, one of my upper management people felt the same but continued to work. 

I came into work today and the upper management guy, the maintenance lead are self quarantining, and they sent home other 2 people. 

Now before I left to go home, I found out two guys worked there were in contact with a person who had the virus on Friday. One of them came into work to ask if he should be allowed to work or not. 

I feel like the fact that we could have potentially 6 cases of the virus at a company that is usually in rather close quarters, should be considering a 14 shutdown just to be sure...

For all of you under lockdown (like me and my family), I know it’s a struggle to adjust to the new reality. Beyond the natural concern about the virus and the bad news from all around, there is another challenge that for many is closer to home (no pun intended). Many might go into a state of stagnation and neglect, with overeating and unending time on screens. If you are worried about this, please read my post on how to turn being stranded at home into more effective and healthier time.

COVID19_support,little-lion-sam,2020/03/30,"Does anyone sometimes feel like no matter how many measures you take, it won't be enough? I'm working from home and am staying in my apartment as much as possible. My boyfriend who I live with, however, is still working (he's an essential worker), and I get worried that that exposure is really bad for me. That being said, I wash my hands constantly, wipe everything down with clorox wipes (including the groceries I buy from the store), keep my distance from people, etc. Still, no matter how much I do, I can't help but think is that all it takes is for me to touch a handle or something at the grocery store and have the virus. I know the only way to prevent this would be to literally live in a sanitized bubble, and I also know that I don't take nearly as much as this precaution on an average day and am not constantly infected with the cold or flu, but with how overwhelming this virus is I can't help but feel like I'm bound to get it no matter what just by virtue of existing. I also know that so many people are still out working and have way more risk than me and I'm super lucky to be able to work from home, I just have this major anxiety over all of this.

Anyone else feel me on this?",6.967837465564735,5.595445714876036,7.244421487603308,79.04269283746558,64.99173553719008,10.87658402203857,32.5633608815427,9.928628108626363,2.8290980716253453,941,30,195,17,12,307,128,242,0.09300000000000001,0.8029999999999999,0.10400000000000001,0.5994,1,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,0,6,11,7,0,2,10,0,21,4,1,3,2,40,38,22,0,1,8,0,5,2,0,2,3,1,2,0,17,12,0,3,7,0,3,0,8,3,0,0,1,7,21,4,33,31,9,19,0,1,0,0,6,10,0,3,8,137,38,5,0.114036564488033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823899988416081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08723765970154226,0.0,0.0,0.15947403474444916,0.1168439365357046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09521576803702672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2464660279596592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07354415008518267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09979416606232466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526291677740224,0.0,0.0,0.11783025501131922,0.12718091360860906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248871104171813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17298094026159302,0.1629354889116675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915879651874098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15287261077743144,0.0,0.2287759443092671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013609381806004,0.0,0.0,0.1880145405864514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114250103989734,0.0,0.2013927513792909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312303552886355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25148998834195296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08672994597755071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15811719054693565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285590921515895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305474328415354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847488693862446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08779091866535238,0.11278507818606827,0.0,0.0,0.12154780469653485,0.2732092431215361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2572239134083291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307002592927281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18103383385088068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33207990846486424,0.1158096667041659,0.0,0.08100830354342348,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,sweetbreez,2020/03/30,"Out of hand sanitizer? This video is very helpful! With the lack in hand sanitizer EVERYWHERE, I am hoping that this video will be helpful!

We have all heard the 20 second rule of washing your hands, usually by singing a song, but I like this guy’s technique so much better! To summarize:

You make it 30 seconds: (w/ soap &amp; water of course)
5 seconds rubbing them palm to palm 👏🏻
5 seconds rubbing the top of one hand 🤚🏻 
5 seconds rubbing the top of the other hand 🤚🏻
5 seconds scrubbing your nails against one hand ✊🏻
5 seconds scrubbing your nails from the other hand in the same manner ✊🏻
5 seconds rubbing your hands together with fingers interlinked (sorry, no emoji for that one)
Lastly, 5 seconds rinsing!

The video explains it very well, although I do disagree with him on 2 things. 
1.) For me personally, I would not be touching the knobs to turn the faucet on and off (but it just depends on how conservative with water you are). 
2.) I disagree that bar soap is just as good or better than liquid soap. I do agree that antibacterial soap is useless, but liquid soap in general (it seems) would be cleaner than a bar of soap. That’s just my opinion though!

COVID19_support,Gudomana,2020/03/30,"I have to get to work after my work from home duration end and it's really scare me Hi, first time posting here.

I work in news industry and I have to get back to work after my work from home duration end (our team agree that we divide in to two teams, one team work at the station and another work from home for 14 days and we swap when it's finally 2 weeks).

While my country doesn't have a lot of infected but the number keep increasing and the thing that worry me the most is that I have to use transit because I can't drive and my work place is far beyond working.

It's really scare me that I don't know whether I will get infected or not and living with 60s parent is really worrying me if I some how got infected.

COVID19_support,submisivecookie,2020/03/30,"I recently got diagnosed with Bronchitis and I'm really starting to worry. I'll try to make this short, about a month ago I had a serious chest infection, a week ago, I woke up unable to breathe in a full breath because it felt as if someone was stabbing me in my left lung. I was breathing like a hamster, My partner was concerned and rang my doctor. The doctor wanted to see me right away just incase it was mild pneumonia. 
An hour later I was seen by my doctor.
He did some checks on me to make sure it wasn't COVID-19 and came back all clear. But I did get diagnosed with Bronchitis. 
The doctor said that he was unable to give me antibiotics and to take ibuprofen to help with the inflammation. That's fine, I'm glad that it isn't COVID-19. 
So I'm sat at home, still unable to breathe, I can't walk fast, go upstairs, play with my son, cough, yawn or laugh without being in absolute agony. 
I'm trying to deal with my pain and not make people fuss over me, but I am getting increasingly concerned about contracting the coronavirus, because unfortunately it can kill people with underlying health issues. And when I think about this, I get seriously terrified.
I wear gloves when dealing with the outside world, essential shopping and going in the garden. I wash my hands constantly and haven't spoken to anyone outside of my house for a month. If I am outside, I'll make sure to cross the road if someone is on the same side as me and keep my distance.

I watched the news today and 2 doctors have died suddenly from the coronavirus and It's making me a nervous wreck.
I can't breathe as it is and if I do get the coronavirus, my chances of survival are even more slim than they were 3 months ago.
Does anyone know how to help me, help my Bronchitis or does anyone know any advice about what I can do? The coronavirus has spread fast through my county and even young people have unfortunately died. I'm scared that if I do get it, that I won't make it.

COVID19_support,EagleSkyline,2020/03/30,"Roommate not practicing social distancing Welp, our roommate told my wifey and I we are being hypochondriacs and overreacting to this whole situation. He is choosing to go in-between his boyfriend's house and our house as he wishes, despite our city and his boyfriend's county having stay home orders. His boyfriend and his boyfriend’s roommate don’t want him at their house all week.

Our lease runs 'til June and his name is on it with our names. Our landlord said we can’t do much, and our once serene and nice home life has been completely upended. We have looked into potentially subleasing and moving into a new place, but it would be a giant pain in the ass. 

I selfishly hope Florida or our counties tighten the order, but I doubt it. I see on Tampa’s guide that reporting can lead to a misdemeanor charge, jail time or a fine, but I’m not sure how seriously they’ll take us.

Then yesterday I began showing symptoms but because they're not dire and my state is hardly testing unless I'm in the hospital, which thankfully I don't need at this time. My employer has good benefits and will grant an extra 14 days sick time to my already generous allotment with a positive covid-19 test for me or my family (but again, good luck getting one). I guess my question is around with professional burn-out and this pandemic, does anyone know if I would qualify for some kind of FMLA or how I'd go about getting it?",7.137989510489511,7.0501956923076925,7.224606643356648,75.10306381118883,64.1048951048951,11.066083916083915,35.357517482517466,10.686352973137794,3.7830706293706293,596,25,109,14,8,192,104,143,0.064,0.6859999999999999,0.25,0.985,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,5,11,0,2,3,0,6,3,0,1,0,26,21,12,0,3,7,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,5,8,0,0,3,1,0,1,2,3,0,2,1,2,11,8,18,18,4,15,0,1,0,1,3,4,0,9,9,63,16,6,0.17095169381467878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886494451076576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11953339914008647,0.0,0.0,0.15218325135886288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421056583317262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17429664517721008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2204994000593957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14960097928036065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15364035937178291,0.0,0.16115804261734934,0.0,0.0864383129163755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1786304084944184,0.0,0.09715578717821187,0.286772340047151,0.0,0.0,0.18832256400124636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15313913932326592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17147848744525274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1780198823525808,0.0939505801475206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15429057806749186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267585148425373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23168258398687303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19150502120551524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3916491753584645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17768426610794788,0.2570687970956815,0.0,0.0,0.15738935158014286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19936661484088808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12445486912193288,0.0,0.0,0.12143917844223685,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,PsychResearchCov,2020/03/30,"Coping with COVID-19: Resources and survey  Hi all,

We are a research team from Coventry University (UK), the University of Oxford (UK), and the University of Amsterdam (NL), and we are linking to helpful resources on coping with COVID-19, in particular with regards to mental health and the detection of fake news online. Most of them are UK-focused but can be used by anyone:  


* [Free Guide](https://www.psychologytools.com/articles/free-guide-to-living-with-worry-and-anxiety-amidst-global-uncertainty/) To Living With Worry And  Anxiety Amidst Global Uncertainty (available in many languages!) from Psychology Tools.
* [Mind UK](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/coronavirus-and-your-wellbeing/), a UK mental health charity, with a specific webpage for dealing with stress surrounding COVID-19.
* [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-at-home-tips/), the UK National Health Service, with a specific website about caring about your mental health whilst staying at home.
* [The Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-health-anxiety), about how to take control  over your health anxiety.
* [British Psychological Society article](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/coping-life-isolation-and-confinement-during-covid-19-pandemic) on coping with life in isolation and confinement during the Covid-19 pandemic.
* [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief) on making sense of all the different feelings you might be experiencing.
* [Popular science article](https://theconversation.com/how-to-spot-coronavirus-fake-news-an-expert-guide-133843) on spotting fake news about COVID-19.
* [Full Fact](https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus/), a UK fact checking charity, with a specific part of their site dedicated to coronavirus.

  
Besides this, we are running a **survey** to examine exactly how people are coping. It is not a short survey (it takes about 20 minutes to fill out), but we are hoping to run this research and relay our findings back to the public as soon as possible afterwards!

COVID19_support,decantre,2020/03/30,"Not a frontline worker. Still very overwhelmed. I work in an industry that is one of the hardest hit by Covid19. Since February our company has cut our budget drastically to cope with the losses. We started with cost-saving measures like reducing energy usage and reducing the hours of part-timers. Today I was directed to reduce/terminate contracts with our agencies and freelancers. These are people I worked with for years and consider friends. The collective stress since February came to a head and after I contacted them, I had to go to the restroom to collect myself. I am overwhelmed because I know their livelihoods are affected and I hate that I have to do this; overwhelmed too because now that we are cutting contracts, I don’t know when it will be internal staff next. Every time I see a colleague led into a meeting room, my heart jumps. 

As a salaried white collar who still have my job, who’s not on the frontline, I really feel I don’t have a place to feel this way. A lot of my friends are in the gig economy and are even more affected, so if I were to ask for support it feels so grossly privileged and tone-deaf.",6.1448893360160985,7.181747798122071,6.243101945003357,77.40095070422538,66.32394366197184,9.653789403085176,35.402079141515756,9.784248007369934,3.5722558014755212,903,43,159,19,14,287,133,213,0.08800000000000001,0.794,0.11699999999999999,0.608,2,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,5,0,2,4,8,13,3,4,15,0,19,2,2,3,0,27,32,12,0,1,3,0,3,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,10,15,0,0,5,0,1,4,4,8,0,1,4,5,25,5,25,25,2,22,0,4,2,0,14,6,0,2,12,115,35,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553021029336035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20253345559299912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18999987262163676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10972233767429547,0.0,0.1399653623330578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519895665657598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566916468354983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09441123916149737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16401156608259615,0.17048960071874614,0.0,0.0,0.19685595008203036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16359718947646051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648509378554389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18259315166473528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115905727116902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1412314001026755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1766731523596948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11256889826962203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17989446777084642,0.0,0.11516841755011695,0.0,0.17356264431307405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106422320678263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13237811629858484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27483648019929785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175823532009434,0.0,0.2653312696448598,0.0,0.19029275062300893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885138326125074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096867359635692,0.0,0.1574646959938703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370684517145207,0.0,0.1318602999175335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418783019467665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10697743679384264
COVID19_support,riptille,2020/03/30,"I know this is a really weird topic but please bare with me: This is a really bad time to be a “sex addict” I use affection, sex, flirting, dating, etc. to ease the pain of depression and anxiety. It helps me feel better about myself and makes me feel wanted and loved. 

Although I know that to be a fallacy I still seek out a person to make me feel better about me. 

Well, now I can’t because I’m not going to risk my or anyone else’s safety due to the coronavirus.

I couldn't sleep at all last night. I had a night terror for the second night in a row and I think it's from all the stress from this pandemic. My family, who I haven't seen in months because I moved out around 6 months ago, recently had a wedding in Vegas and I wasn't able to go because of COVID and my job restricting travel. They didn't get sick from the travel but they are still in high risk groups and my sister is an essential worker dealing with the public a lot.

Anyway, I had an argument with my bf last night as soon as I experienced this night terror and I just couldn't sleep afterwards.

COVID19_support,Jeduka,2020/03/30,"A Challenging Situation of Coronavirus for International Students - Impact and solutions **Remember: Crisis is temporary but dreams are forever.**

After the shock of the sudden spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, you may be worried that you will not be able to study abroad at least this year which can put a pause to your career. Although the situation is a bit worse right now, we want to encourage you to keep your dreams or plans continued, as we know the situations are temporary and everything will be back to normal soon. You will just have to re-plan your decisions for the next few months. So, here are the ways you can adjust to this crisis, while also not giving up on your dream of studying abroad:

**1. Continue your application process if it started.**

If you have decided to study abroad this year, that means you must have already started your application process. And suddenly the virus has emerged as a hurdle in between. But still, you should keep going with the application process as the academic year start of 2020 might not be lost just yet. Usually, the classes in most of the universities would start around in the months of September-October. While it’s difficult to estimate as to when we will be out of this crisis for sure, as the virus is spreading at a high speed, some estimations mention the period between May and July. And then you can start your classes abroad. In fact, some universities are still accepting online applications from international students at this time. If this situation continues further than July, universities will adapt to these changing conditions. Just like students, Universities are also affected by the situation and they will adjust the application and enrolment deadlines which suits the changes in the academic year schedule. So, try to continue going through the steps of the application process. Contacting universities for more information will be best for more clarity. If applications are postponed by the university, then it is the best tie for you to do research about visa information and work permit information, if you plan to work while studying abroad. Some universities have already extended the application dates in August.

**2. Postpone your studies for the beginning of 2021**

If you have not started the application process and want to wait till the problem is solved, there are no issues, you can postpone your international studies for 2021. Or maybe you want to change your initial study destination because it is among those countries which are affected most by the virus. Just because you are not starting your classes this year doesn’t mean you can’t start researching your future study options and decide by January 2021, when the new applications start. Here is how we can help until you start applying:

* Figure out what you want to study and in which country you want to pursue.
* You can check the list of courses and select the course you want to pursue
* Check out the programs, universities cost, etc everything you want to know about study abroad.
* Read about your study options based on careers after graduation
* Read about the exams you will be in need to clear to study abroad like English proficiency exam IELTS or TOEFL and entrance exams like SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT. Prepare for your test and score a good result.TOEFL already launched a way for students to take their language test from home.
* After the quarantine ends, you can gather some professional experience by volunteering, getting a short-term job, or starting an internship. Universities prefer the students who have some work experience for a Master's degree such as an MBA. Click here to know more: MBA universities abroad

Make good use of your time staying at home by doing your research thoroughly, comparing your options and figuring out where you’re going to apply next year.

**3. Study an online degree**

Many prospective international students are considering changing their study plans altogether, and they’re looking at online study options offered by prestigious universities all over the world. Online studies don’t mean low-quality education. Many universities have started offering more online Bachelors and online Masters as a result of the outbreak. This option will likely not delay your study plans too much, as many online degrees have rolling admissions, meaning you can apply anytime. You will still have to meet the admission requirements necessary to apply. Classes can start at any time or once every few months. Just make sure you have the right system requirements on your PC or laptop. The only downside is that your online degree might take more years to complete compared to on-campus options, depending on the course intensity.

**4. Keep learning with online short courses**

No matter which one of the previous options you’re going to choose in the future, you should also not give up on your personal development right now. There is an abundance of online short courses to keep you learning and help you manage your time staying at home. Many of these short distance learning courses are also offered free of charge, and a lot of institutions provide support for people around the world. Setting aside some time every day for an online course can help you better schedule your day and keep your motivation and mental health up. Whichever path you choose to follow, don’t give up on your education dreams and never stop learning.",7.067036762187463,9.762962226681127,6.444569585569128,70.46591591505882,66.10412147505423,9.364562164630668,34.14893252654413,9.811843763644266,3.8863826464208246,4391,203,650,104,76,1352,359,922,0.054000000000000006,0.8320000000000001,0.113,0.9948,1,1,0,0,0,0,118.0,4,57,3,17,36,20,0,0,60,0,72,1,0,11,7,148,125,61,0,21,26,0,0,4,0,18,1,0,3,1,25,34,0,10,27,6,5,8,14,4,0,1,2,2,64,17,129,98,23,132,0,1,2,0,83,45,0,33,77,455,89,45,0.05018875071172302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16615360329819892,0.16054370324587475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03413007152956732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08935725753298883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0385920513306182,0.0,0.06118919319744826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10533999494419977,0.044387871458953655,0.0547931170047319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21237217384858365,0.0,0.05262195024030016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473518439461791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04445233632014775,0.0,0.055973723840667775,0.0,0.0,0.08457237419539057,0.0,0.09021282590073808,0.09818845732454053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02622155078258082,0.14443686879360648,0.11409369451874485,0.08419188581568819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053348295074771984,0.0,0.0,0.10092138500582312,0.05302717068056007,0.15103022731338625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05238401629624009,0.0498045908301071,0.22305033833189397,0.0,0.0,0.08274727452581909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09807875386410954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04214591023798096,0.0,0.05478695012361493,0.04266868108839715,0.0,0.0,0.06700276164422275,0.20353406314309508,0.05042134591651947,0.2186810514460372,0.0,0.0,0.05057845619726869,0.10648466648525952,0.0,0.0,0.12018054596845625,0.0,0.03689450656478682,0.037214322713391486,0.038708658587218815,0.04847260818328306,0.10675261152176044,0.0,0.04917431961672794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053449381524358124,0.034009196377341115,0.038170806507988826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03479456039045675,0.043822881251117135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048023856292280974,0.0,0.05045355669124445,0.0,0.0,0.10040466500088477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05685407084414708,0.12858275664340954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2820712931309972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618101289599174,0.10698906086585504,0.12024240344950275,0.04196004289849335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05695359954405905,0.09460460717266353,0.0,0.07547138893624601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14632732073623753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03407486725713904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04334696636318346,0.055275818295670666,0.0,0.20721837860826745,0.07967498844182389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096140247898112,0.05096911256768928,0.05114662472017443,0.035652648520002765,0.0,0.0,0.2262393696886472
COVID19_support,MightyMighty97,2020/03/30,"Hoping all my carefulness hasn't been ruined I've been self isolating with my mother and grandmother that I help take care of, since the beginning of this month in North Carolina. I've never gone out, groceries have been delivered and then subsequently wiped and washed.

Food is well stocked and I'm not even all that concerned with self-isolation, I can block worries about that off and I have enough content to binge for at least three months haha. 

It doesn't stop the anxiety though. Having allergies, being slightly sleep deprived, and being a mild hypochondriac has caused some psychosomatic symptoms. But I can eventually rationalize those away and have been forming a healthy schedule for myself every day.

My mother contributes to the anxiety by essentially talking constantly to me and on the phone about nothing but the virus and assorted negative outcomes. I can't complain too much as she follows self-isolation protocols pretty carefully....until yesterday.

My uncle who doesnt seem to realize that we're in the middle of an epidemic stopped by. He stopped by here before he was getting ready to hold a church gathering (of about 5 people but even so). He does not care about this shit. My mother knows this and decides to let him in the house. Stand over my grandmother like it was nothing.

I was in shock, but I should've done something. Worst part is I fist bumped him without thinking. Immediately after I did, I washed my hands for about five minutes. And my mother defended her decision by saying he's 'probably' about as healthy as I am and that I should've stopped her whenever I bring this up.

I don't know if I'm more upset over the potential of exposure or angry over my grandmother and I being put in danger via idiocy. I don't know where my uncle had been previously or if his actual level of health. I'm hoping everything's fine but after going through all those precautions to stay safe and feeling good about it only to have it all potentially taken away.

COVID19_support,Yozhur,2020/03/30,"My fight against depression during the time when our world needs us. So. What is depression. My vision of depression is a limitation on your mind. It emerges slowly but surely. It affects your mind by limiting your imagination to reality. Every single thing you've experienced in your life is part of that limitation. Everything you've ever felt is part of that limitation. What would it feel to remove that lock on your mind. Think so far ahead. Way beyond the limits of our imagination and mortal shell.Our sole being is brain. When you unlock the potential of it. it will change the way you see the world.  

So, How do we visualize this. Imagine it's a lamp with glass container. What does the container do? It keeps the toxins your mind is emitting from releasing. What if we could remove that container? What would our flame look like? Flame which could burn freely, passionately. That would be a sight to behold. Now that you've that image in your mind. Now think of the words glass container and the flame in your image. Glass container is your depression. Flame is your mind. If we remove the container. Our mind unlocks it's potential.  

I would visualize my feeling of curing depression like this. I felt one with the universe. Universe also felt one with me. It felt like an out of body experience. I saw myself as more than just a human. I saw myself as one being belonging to a higher entity. Looking back to my birth and as far as our extinction. Everything just made sense. As i've spoken about my experiences after feeling this out of body experience. Everyone just marks me as a crazy person. As if i'm having psychosis. But i'm not. My ideas i have after winning the battle against depression. Those ideas just feel too real. Like i know it's right. Other's think its fantasy, but now in my mind everything is a possibility. Everything we've ever done is a culmination to something. What is that something. How could you know. Humans can't visualize things beyond our bodies capabilities to realize our idea.

If anyone can donate anything extra, please help them or support your local food bank or even just sharing the video could help them.  I also want to say that my father volunteers there and I'm really scared for him.  He's elderly and has already had pneumonia several times in the past.   He won't stop working because he says that the low-income families that use the food bank need help now more than ever.  I used to help out there when I was still living in the US and pretty much all of their volunteers are elderly.

Hold on everyone.

COVID19_support,india_aj,2020/03/30,"In response to the removal of post with title ""A significant number of COVID-19 infected do not show any symptoms therefore masks are likely to have a major impact on the spread of COVID-19 virus in the community and everyone should wear one even if they are homemade."" Highly irresponsible behaviour of the part of r/COVID19_Support moderators to remove this post on the grounds that 
&gt; ""Your information does not link to a reliable source and therefore may not be accurate"". 

The information is linked to not only valid, but is from a research study carried out by a premier research institution, the Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health in Cambridge, UK and published by the Cambridge University Press, UK.

The moderator has also stated that:
&gt; ""If you want to make your own masks, and/or cover your mouth with a scarf or bandana when you are out, please do so but there is NO evidence that the medical masks that healthcare workers need provide significant protection to, healthy, uninfected people who observe the advised distancing measure of 6m from others when out. Using medical masks when there is a shortage puts frontline healthcare workers, and workers who are in regularly in close contact with multiple members of the public - such as supermarket checkout staff - at risk.

&gt; The advice that they are not essential for everyone from Who, CDC and all other reputable agencies is not misleading.

&gt; Please do not let your fears, and misinformation from others, put nurses, doctors and essential workers at risk. This is a time to work together, not to be selfish.""

The above statements indicate that:
1. The moderator who deleted the post has not read the post properly.
2. The moderator's action are based on 'old' information in a constantly evolving situation.
3. The moderator is under the false impression that the post contains misinformation that will put doctors, nurses and essential health care workers at risk.

The above conclusions are based on the observation that the moderator hasn't understood what the title of the post states, namely that: ""A significant number of COVID-19 infected do not show any symptoms therefore masks are likely to have a major impact on the spread of COVID-19 virus in the community and everyone should wear one even if they are homemade."". The title clearly states what new evidence is showing, which is that a significant proportion of people who are infected with the COVID-19 virus DO NOT SHOW any symptoms of the disease. This proportion has been found to be as high as 50% in two studies carried out, one in Iceland and the other in Italy.

The advice to use masks in based on this new finding because the old advice stated that people without symptoms or those who haven't tested positive should not use masks. However, given that testing is only being done on patients who have symptoms, and that 50% of those infected don't show any symptoms, it is CRITICAL that everyone wears masks because those 50% who don't show any symptoms are also spreading the virus to everyone they come in contact with. They might be spreading it more than the confirmed infected case because they remain unaware of the fact that they are infected. Putting on masks will halt this spread. Hand hygiene and physical distancing are required but so is preventing the contamination of common surfaces through oro-nasal secretions.

It is on the basis of above mentioned new development that the advice for everyone to wear masks has been given. It is to prevent spread from people who are infected but not symptomatic who might be as many as 50% of the total infected (equal in number to those with symptoms). Moreover, other studies have also clearly confirmed the benefit of using ANY mask over not wearing a mask for people who are uninfected and the advice in the post was for people to make HOMEMADE masks. In no way is this advice meant to encourage people to take away limited supplies of N95 and surgical masks that are most useful for the healthcare professionals. However, telling people NOT to wear any masks in view of the new findings is intentinally putting their lives and the lives of other community members at risk and this is not acceptable.",13.196614247821145,10.578345027472533,11.608586585827966,56.54675824175827,54.08241758241758,14.711708980674493,49.553997726411524,12.909472586513994,6.497942156119742,3412,178,502,85,29,1074,271,728,0.105,0.823,0.07200000000000001,-0.9845,2,0,0,0,0,0,86.0,0,6,8,9,13,13,0,5,60,0,69,30,8,10,5,100,86,39,0,8,26,0,2,2,0,8,22,0,0,0,53,29,0,7,14,7,0,9,23,6,0,4,9,3,14,7,104,62,9,74,0,0,1,0,38,41,0,9,14,368,67,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3046975352656521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12467734076462705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24738207567295625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04882602588325895,0.0,0.0,0.09503836945516432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05298525098905853,0.0,0.0,0.04476617810980736,0.0,0.0561593821846853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10638372636150767,0.04547790020467528,0.053181719933488115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06864928091241201,0.0,0.0,0.29794822021639106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05847890213319752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09499635881810298,0.0,0.0,0.056980672189804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11047996576255427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981494334659277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053141213654404836,0.0,0.050778273953055314,0.0,0.09177810497912604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06937862589680853,0.052687804493203885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10470539855978613,0.0,0.11026052745490447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03853391278474432,0.0,0.20076563215394228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906419511653227,0.0,0.10564540570924767,0.07904862545693479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056276716821550256,0.0,0.2882267810263078,0.0,0.0,0.11409140268178865,0.0,0.0,0.3483995568280223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2612129969680949,0.0,0.0,0.051982466994264565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058414663044122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43212055754552336,0.03907377196423234,0.0,0.04542267535192654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03030319406160501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05076557901887005,0.0,0.0,0.22442007532775726,0.0,0.0,0.030652310901844355,0.04125009985252202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050095686579566964,0.0,0.037833616766011456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Kielprice,2020/03/30,"ISO a helping hand Hey y'all. Hope everyone is holding up okay. It's rough out here. 

I'll try and keep this short.

I am a 31 yr old who struggled with addiction for a long time after being sexually abused for several years as a child. It was a mechanism I used as a young boy and it got me in more and more trouble as I got older and tried to ""grow up"". 

Fast forward to now, I am over 17 months sober and working hard to keep rolling. I have been fortunate to make it this far as many don't. I recently left Tucson, where I worked at a recovery center for a year, and moved to Phoenix to pursue a job on a food truck with someone I met at church. Owning my own truck has been a dream of mine for a while and I saw this as the first step. I was sleeping in my car at first to save money to get a place. I just got enough money to sign a a lease and the country shuts down due to this pandemic.

I have been laid off since the 15th  and applied for unemployment on the 16th and have not received anything from them. Who knows when they will get the federal relief checks will get to us. 

I am in a tough spot right now with my rent at an extended stay hotel and with food. Just trying to stick my hand out and see if anyone can help pick me up to keep my head above water. 

Thank you everyone for reading and I wish everyone the best.  

God bless you and yours.",2.062880814837335,3.3861059965035025,3.411313469139557,92.75285649133477,76.44755244755245,6.93195500152022,22.57464274855579,7.586124646067393,0.6652145332927937,1049,29,245,14,23,343,169,286,0.051,0.804,0.145,0.9772,5,0,0,0,1,0,23.0,1,4,2,5,7,10,0,1,23,1,18,8,4,3,0,36,36,22,0,3,4,0,4,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,10,20,3,4,1,3,4,6,2,3,0,2,10,6,29,7,48,23,6,50,2,0,2,0,16,26,0,2,19,160,39,5,0.0,0.13828378434059424,0.0,0.1272325245576529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08160724201185222,0.0,0.09604344059907767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248128989255345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12059395314649105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3345678943657616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985491136092261,0.28225549081260604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829304832149377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28003402186157844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10455038419508528,0.0,0.1197794464862722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15645822424558398,0.0,0.0,0.11592063728871603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158179384890552,0.3112150498696993,0.0,0.0,0.06414146829596372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12680714933118656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032858118358175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790568697952628,0.11832692133716187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09315783176184364,0.12404562228942585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122468857455613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193844890756356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674286568033693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523831077157633,0.0,0.0,0.09967079708561838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930037810534704,0.0,0.0,0.1318505280577732,0.0,0.0965447784900804,0.0,0.11679556944194144,0.0,0.09888909045373907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12439869762842035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201197263015512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074520677642291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805528707226352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2377178979427164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14038930190462734,0.10080107476565192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342122143650038,0.0,0.0,0.16993440656839712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15031647809211754
COVID19_support,Chrissylalala,2020/03/30,"Frontline Provider I can’t go back to work. We are reusing PPE. I can’t even explain the situation I am witnessing. Staff coughing and sneezing and not wearing masks. No fit tests for N95 masks. So I guessed my size. No training on how to get in or out of gear with reusing masks. Storage of used masks and face shields is right in a heavy traffic area. In brown bags open  to air. Nobody wears masks into non-covid suspect rooms or I halls. 

I’m high risk due to health problems (lung disease) and I work as a provider in a hospital. The sense of dread I feel is beyond anything I have ever been through. Mind you before this I had basic issues. The other day I sat in my garage,  before going to my 12 hr shift, with the car running. Garage door shut. I know what’s it’s like to not be able to breath. I can’t die alone on ventilator. I can’t help myself. I can’t help these people. The amount of shame I feel is insurmountable at this point. Shame for not wanting to work.

COVID19_support,LottaRespect,2020/03/30,"Free, At-Home Covid Self-Test... Try It to Help Validate It?  **Urgently-needed, free, at-home test for Covid-19** using readily-available materials is being validated. Will you donate a few minutes of your time to help? **We need people with Covid-19 to take this new test to validate it's accuracy. You can take the test in a few minutes at home, or wherever you are.**

**Why**: Currently, most people who need a Covid test can't get one. Even when testing capacity increases, 2/3rds of the world's population will still make less than the cost of chemistry-based tests \*per month\*. Even the least expensive tests being developed will still be inaccessible to most people on earth. An at-home self-test has the potential to save millions of lives if it is validated, especially in high-need communities. 

**Status**: This new test is based on solid science, existing published reports, and it looks promising. Our team needs to validate it in enough patients to demonstrate that it's successful before it can be rolled out -- that's why we need your help. 

**Ask**: If you are Covid positive, or if you know someone who is, PLEASE message and we can provide further information. We just need a few hundred more people, out of the hundreds of thousands infected as of this writing.

Ask #2: Look, um, can we ask you to respond with some encouragement? Trying to do something we hope has the potential to save many lives, which might just be... well, you get the point. Could we ask you to please respond to our volunteer effort... positively?

COVID19_support,inflammatoryessays,2020/03/30,"In need of some support/Some hope Hey all, hope you're staying safe. I live in California (LA) and as many people know we've been on lockdown for a bit now. 

I had to leave my college campus and come back home to an extremely unhealthy environment, and though I take social distancing seriously and am trying my best to stay patient, being in this house is literally killing me. Being in such a safe environment for school, surrounded by people I could trust to suddenly being thrust back into what I left behind is... Really hard. I feel my mental health and physical health slipping away 

To make matters worse, I keep googling how long this will last and it's REALLY not helping... lol. Does anyone know if there's a chance after this next month that we'll be able to visit close friends? I used to camp out at friends places to get away from this place, how long until I can do that again? 😣

Trying to not be self pitying right now is hard.

COVID19_support,TheLazyLounger,2020/03/30,"Y'all, I just need some folks to tell me to calm down for a bit. Science and facts appreciated. My anxiety comes and goes in waves but today has been BAD. I'm 24, VERY mild asthma, and for some reason I'm so scared I'm gonna die recently. I know this is close to impossible, but my brain said ""fuck you"" today. Throat has felt a bit weird, obviously no clue if it's anything from allergies to a cold to anxiety to the dreaded Rona. Viruses and medical issues are a very big fear of mine, honestly my biggest. I'm so level headed almost always, but I'll cry when I have to go to hospitals, my heart palpitates, it's just not my bag. My fear of contracting this and dying (yes I've been quarantined for awhile now, yes, I know it's not particularly rational), but whatever. I just need the happy positive vibes you may have. I've tried giving them for awhile in this sub and now I'm just sorta breaking. I feel bad for my girlfriend who has been helping me for a week straight with severe anxiety. Been too glued to other subs and posts that have freaked me out. Please and thanks!",2.417499999999997,4.489049453703704,3.9729259259259284,85.8146666666667,77.6111111111111,7.653333333333332,23.76296296296297,8.548686976883017,1.5752507407407412,846,28,175,18,20,281,128,216,0.231,0.631,0.138,-0.9808,0,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,3,1,0,10,13,1,4,7,2,13,7,4,1,2,37,31,16,2,3,11,0,2,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,9,12,0,0,5,0,0,2,3,9,0,0,6,4,21,4,23,23,4,20,0,0,0,1,10,9,1,6,7,101,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13267757840855576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024892585069024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3040817548703103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10903454036409096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22126054225570985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2893069347592216,0.0,0.0,0.14791155506087306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413526962440887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14554279923761426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750239498023438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2981941074326232,0.06699495512707343,0.0,0.12721883037136664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249223890958093,0.0,0.12710412688418965,0.07530165019112373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14104655364744415,0.0,0.0,0.1359811436495054,0.0,0.0,0.15701073328527698,0.0888105968527899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382934574039067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456348391999501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13347776603174275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19649113286294684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14544298348377582,0.0,0.0,0.12689643015138974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362299814313749,0.13082576143605756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12603591190816985,0.0,0.13265358317328596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496849928935182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11580906651529285,0.1219863297978976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.251185167369728,0.0,0.0,0.08995742474040051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186494043487793,0.0,0.0,0.10628187997697383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,cagewithakay,2020/03/30,"How could we have let this happen? Beyond the worry and fear, most of my thoughts go back to how on earth this has spiraled out of control. More than anything, I'm angry. At China for taking the virus seriously upon the initial discovery, and then more personally at my country, the supposedly greatest country in the world the U.S, at their reckless dismissal of the virus when it first broke in Washington state, the subsequent utter lack of preparedness, the lack of testing, ""social distancing"" well after it seems too late....why the fuck? 

I just can't get over how we let it get this bad. I'm wrecked with worry every day for the health of myself, my family, friends, and the whole country. Luckily I'm young and healthy, and able to work from home. My dad though, who is 64, is an ""essential"" worker. Other friends of mine still have to work. Some lost their jobs....this should not have happened. Who else is struggling with just sheer anger at this?",5.361929595827898,6.973961316384188,5.053333333333335,83.08318122555411,68.6045197740113,7.932029552368538,29.43459365493264,8.384062270229773,2.1062945675793143,751,28,138,11,13,230,114,177,0.196,0.716,0.08800000000000001,-0.9664,1,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,2,0,2,6,12,11,2,2,13,0,12,2,0,4,0,25,25,11,0,4,3,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,1,10,10,0,1,2,0,0,1,2,8,1,1,2,0,11,3,28,19,8,22,0,2,0,1,11,12,1,3,8,101,21,4,0.15473264100297734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273317794700008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11897984985536247,0.1291952920507536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17354581406835934,0.1235414231312872,0.0,0.0,0.099789752734912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925926669915713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13036892360909275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458681630852123,0.17411723936321222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13161550539192626,0.0,0.0,0.2390921092159773,0.143047833278693,0.16168283713962672,0.0,0.08793812569710326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2736591268530771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16447356176166927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15520945505438194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17454515873080728,0.0,0.0,0.3164492177654253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689089559893192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351065738076114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408627850175363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577304415615755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12356968698127838,0.0,0.0,0.16176015243452116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633968931946866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15202403416489627,0.12284043315264324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13912322690481835,0.0,0.13962214138245546,0.17275346785864826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22529441101405515,0.3142770156793112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,marlborofag,2020/03/30,"So... how much worry about all this is TOO much, and how much is healthy? As an individual with pretty severe OCD and generalized anxiety disorder, this pandemic has been making me go, well, crazy. It’s all I think about, all I read about, all I dream about. I spend most of my days in quarantine crying about it all.   It’s getting ridiculous, and I’m sure many of you are experiencing similar levels of terror.

Now, obviously this isn’t healthy. But... how much of it is irrational? Where is the line between pure, unnecessary panic and a normal amount of anxiety and awareness? I’m scared, you’re scared, your mom is scared and hers is too, but how scared should we all REALLY be?",3.857822410147989,5.924937488372095,4.991388301620859,80.16437632135309,73.34108527131781,8.721916842847076,25.68076109936575,9.339509955726095,2.2346372093023263,532,18,103,13,11,175,79,129,0.221,0.703,0.076,-0.9433,0,1,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,2,0,0,15,9,1,6,3,0,12,0,0,5,9,29,18,14,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,7,1,0,1,1,10,2,14,15,12,6,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,1,2,75,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344167015526204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682984709814363,0.09881040562321852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17559660793986984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800480323992727,0.0,0.08707509169763061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022715872033866,0.15533502781667405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17944247712426353,0.0,0.0,0.4505199072840736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15011726661517474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17976370943916092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15587379940860252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15325554052218984,0.0,0.09815286203248506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6135760844292738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17308829818312085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14440245588198736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817339506416034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377578569474375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15559633402349832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So for the past few days I've been having weird lower stomach pain and pain near belly button and im worried it may be something serious (like appendicitis) because its slowly getting worse. I know its common sense if you have something requiring medical attention to go to the doctor/hospital but with this covid-19 outbreak, I don't know if it makes sense going to the hospital until it gets absolutely unbearable but at the same time, I may be putting myself at risk not getting it checked out soon. I just dont know what to do at this point.",8.33537356321839,7.759562939655173,8.124137931034483,71.25132183908049,61.8448275862069,11.1816091954023,39.16091954022989,10.504223727775694,4.201154022988505,495,23,85,10,6,159,78,116,0.251,0.7490000000000001,0.0,-0.9836,1,0,2,0,0,0,10.0,0,1,0,1,4,8,0,2,4,0,10,6,2,1,1,21,20,9,0,2,7,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,0,0,9,4,0,1,4,0,1,4,3,7,0,0,1,0,6,1,15,15,3,16,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,4,7,58,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10154332565168996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10742788990358862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17049783311565184,0.0,0.0,0.19522610471086732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610876199935548,0.0,0.2840073362285602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17993091647700016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2746378242593151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08138073344910965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119092914409603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678080302366016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5317465698552425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15901586307941368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574683825671719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16745512302648524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16677186888820505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564770449857039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09713194114727232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33833250122698794,0.16975541263263572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,glamatovic,2020/03/30,"""Home-College"" is driving me nuts Hey guys,

So since we're on a ""lockdown"" my college has been doing classes in video conference and in every single subject we're getting a huge shitload of homework of all kinds.

I'm getting sick of it, I can't find motivation to do anything, I enjoy working but the amount of homework is far too much, the fact that I'm isolated at home and not interacting with people (except my parents) isn't really helping either. 

It's also worth to point out that I'm in an art college, honestly I kind of feel willing to work on autonomous art projects, hell I'm home and creativity ultimately flourishes but that plan also gets fucked up as I just end up getting prompted to the homework and free time is short as well. 

I honestly don't know how to be dealing with this",4.802832167832165,6.009230961538464,6.0524475524475525,76.92891608391609,69.51282051282051,8.493240093240093,34.6946386946387,8.841846274778883,3.1105589743589754,634,32,115,11,11,213,101,156,0.13699999999999998,0.7190000000000001,0.14400000000000002,0.0451,1,1,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,4,7,9,2,0,6,0,12,2,0,2,2,20,23,12,0,0,6,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,5,1,6,7,0,0,4,3,2,1,4,2,1,0,1,1,8,8,24,20,5,16,1,0,0,1,6,13,2,0,2,74,14,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27135295229374096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13961514308548315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17491128243973195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15026777697226595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14294527257331038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578483675758522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15506552111449087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15684728348572524,0.3545599148252556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16798937489494115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371904852999193,0.0,0.5105463152835951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3533480937323463,0.09324031103004816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12471910236732325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18838656820665445,0.0,0.0,0.11762039238939638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16038287159708733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10868808813597136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14034392123993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892969871811266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15254408060327593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470279733858397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,friendswithphilip,2020/03/31,"(Australia) Psychologists can offer online sessions - some are covered by gov mental health plan scheme Like many others, I lost my job recently &amp; can't afford my usual expenses. I reached out to my psychologist and she's offered me free online sessions under a gov mental health scheme (My country offers ""bulk billing"" with Drs referral). 
It's on Friday and I can't wait. I'm racked with anxiety in isolation and I know she will be able to help guide me through some of it. I feel so lucky to live in this country and have access to this kind of support. 

So I'm spreading the word - if you live somewhere with access to mental health care, please seek it out. Someone unbiased &amp; compassionate to talk to is an absolute gift in times of crisis. We're not alone!

COVID19_support,beccaafly,2020/03/31,"Housemate ignoring house rules, worried for my and my families safety. I’m not sure if this is the right place, but I’m not sure where else would be a good place to vent about this.
To get an idea of my concerns, I recently moved in with my mom, my brother, and his girlfriend. My mom got a place and we all moved in with her to help out and because my brother and his gf were living on friends couches due to recently moving back to Ohio. My mom has a huge heart, and was tired of seeing my brother struggle so that’s why she did all of this. 
Due to the rules and regulations of where we are living, anyone over 18 has to be on the lease, so we all are. My mom has mild health concerns, and my brother is diabetic, and his girlfriend has zero regard for anyone but herself. Since my mom got this place for herself and us, and she’s very concerned about the virus, she told us the rules, no one comes here, and no one goes out to friends houses. (We live in Ohio, where there is also a stay at home order in place.) 
His girlfriend refuses to respect that myself and my mom are concerned about it, and ignores her wishes. (I feel like my brother is but won’t admit it, and I feel like he acts like he doesn’t care about it because of her influence on him, but that’s another story.) You’d think with her having been with my brother for slightly over a year now, she’d show a little more concern and caution with my brother being diabetic. 
I’m a night owl and stay up all night, and my bedroom window is a double wide window with the driveway right in front of it. She sneaks out at night when my mom and brother are asleep to go hang out with her friends, and comes back before they wake up. She usually leaves my brother a text if he wakes up and sees that she’s gone, and she lets me know because I would hear her anyway, but I just bite my tongue and say okay because it’s not like I can tie her down and keep her here. 
Two days ago she was off work and complaining all day about being stuck in the house and kept asking my mom multiple times all day if she could go to her friends house, and my mom would say no, she’d gave up and say “yeah I know” or just “okay.” My mom went to work at 2:30am like she always does, and almost immediately after she left, the girlfriend texted me saying she was going out, and came back before my brother woke up for work 2 hours later. The next afternoon when the girlfriend was at work, I brought it up to my mom and brother and they had no idea she even snuck out. My brother was visibly irritated she left, but tried to justify it, but stopped when I told him she’s deliberately going against our moms wishes and disrespecting her by sneaking out the MOMENT my mom pulled out of the driveway. He didn’t say anything after that, but I know he texted her going off on her for it. 
He’s stubborn and will defend her in front of everyone else, but in private he knows it’s fucked up, because he’s shown me texts from last week to her saying if she can’t respect our mom then she can get out, even when he’s still defending her in front of us saying “Shes an adult and can do whatever she wants.” It pisses me off to no end to live with this girl, even before all of this started, but other circumstances left no choice. Now it’s infuriating and I wish there was a way to kick her out during this stay at home order at the very least. But her names on the lease and she pays my mom to go towards rent and food. Disrespecting the rest of the people who live here is one thing, but disrespecting my mom when she’s a worrywort to begin with even without the virus going around, especially when that girl only has a permanent place to live because of my moms generosity and love for her son. 
I guess I just needed to vent about this, but I’m open to anyone who has any suggestions on how to handle her behavior? I’m just worried about my mom and brother, they’re the only family I have that I talk to, aside from my father who lives out of state.",8.58147675346341,5.535679963008633,8.262585406542396,78.3086050264742,63.18002466091246,11.218118517443967,35.07365634293176,8.841846274778883,2.67424752302894,3114,91,671,34,34,1000,295,811,0.075,0.826,0.099,0.9755,1,0,0,0,0,0,74.0,9,1,2,4,41,25,3,1,32,3,50,12,5,2,9,135,102,69,0,13,26,33,2,5,10,5,4,8,9,3,31,69,1,7,10,1,2,22,14,7,0,5,23,12,114,18,115,65,11,134,0,0,2,2,140,65,2,7,45,455,145,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03083937153781207,0.0,0.03483731282606405,0.0,0.0,0.027821672803733426,0.028948194296786786,0.0,0.0,0.023658497061311276,0.036480508854693915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07297825171660323,0.0,0.028629331625372807,0.030970612131879287,0.03252409675173512,0.0,0.0,0.08025444062176386,0.0,0.12724652623640634,0.0,0.08881157342201594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0397906668566196,0.03547087964983728,0.0,0.0,0.059937272598522114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02777710628892464,0.0,0.0,0.06731031174825056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03044509735776208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0581254173527754,0.0,0.030813749314517438,0.0,0.0,0.09191427183367977,0.0,0.0,0.03324348211341938,0.0,0.0,0.06559412005287167,0.0,0.03518189339186005,0.04970818454309479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04206839113192945,0.0,0.10751514370168294,0.03216293586937269,0.03635283808856273,0.0,0.13840431991940105,0.02918032974866673,0.05564972702806329,0.0,0.03832527583216168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03698030580331633,0.03921103092903856,0.041226498841165006,0.023319106226848258,0.0,0.06979472019696684,0.0,0.03426129278570796,0.16057266229606484,0.0,0.07854769618360084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030923086518456527,0.0,0.0,0.07647903304293394,0.02835861809420167,0.0,0.03683774875058205,0.11339880916465965,0.03557528857173725,0.0,0.08498355724441269,0.034868873030906224,0.21504239753567211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031399471402169116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7334245214316373,0.0,0.11092928059577907,0.0,0.02579645764266066,0.0,0.0,0.03699972242640788,0.09794460558948882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07072412419533095,0.05291895815775241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02411911161786173,0.0,0.2180898312190457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870215799118118,0.0,0.0,0.05942120118418191,0.0,0.1936656824127078,0.0,0.0,0.05544649532721838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028778774092743344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02462464937412448,0.1112450224384004,0.02778346114501614,0.029086125727761845,0.0,0.03637022169245534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06557861500061563,0.0,0.0,0.02796300717289233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023113031785091536,0.022292125292790774,0.0,0.0,0.02028641800313107,0.039986163062510516,0.0,0.06648696422683878,0.0,0.023620230217484564,0.0,0.03398492429722545,0.0,0.12554481146692978,0.0,0.038316438439831166,0.057411039528287015,0.020520133635174,0.027614804121900368,0.02790656224594817,0.0,0.0,0.03225082040061737,0.03139270184176418,0.0,0.12002087709261687,0.03353646602536104,0.0,0.1013105829999658,0.07066217829960743,0.0,0.07414177958939154,0.0,0.0,0.02240371790730416
COVID19_support,cardsgirl88,2020/03/31,"Fiance is an ""essential worker"" in grocery and I am terrified every day... I finally broke down in tears today because it all built up. My amazing fiance is a grocery worker and manages the nonperishable department (basically the busiest part of the store right now!) So he is definitely essential. I am a stay at home mom to our 14 month old son, so besides a few day trips here and there, my life is no different. Except I am beyond worried my fiance will get covid19 and that he will die. As I type this out I can tell myself the odds are so low (he is healthy and 26 years old) but I can't help but go to worst case scenario situations.
I try and stay happy and positive for my son, and I am extremely happy when my fiance is home. But I still find whenever I'm alone my anxiety skyrockets and I have panic attacks. Bawling my eyes out and hardly being able to eat. I just started my family. We are the happiest little family you could ever meet and my life is literally my dream come true. We just started planning our wedding. The thought of it all being taken away is something I cannot cope with.
Then I will see people going out, still in groups, not social distancing, saying it's a hoax, etc. It makes me want to scream!!

I'll never go back to college, see my friends again, see my relatives, get to travel or go to a fair or do any fun outside activities. I'll be living this way until i'm 80 or 90 years old at this rate. I feel like I watched my degree burn up in front of my eyes.

COVID19_support,MrZoro777,2020/03/31,"Coronavirus and Hypertension Good day, I have been working from home for the last 2 weeks and trying to cope with this outbreak in the safest way that I can. 

I'm 38 years old, male, did some exercise daily (before this confinement) but I have been diagnosed with hypertension since like 4-5 years ago, I was overweight and lost like 50 pounds because of my hypertension but it never got controlled and my doctor said that it maybe is a genetic thing (Most members of my family suffers of hypertension) so I have been always on meds to control my blood pressure.

Reading at news now I see that people with hypertension are more likely to get the virus because of the ACE2 (and even some people stopped taking their blood pressure meds because of it) and get the worst from it, I know that doctors have said that this hasn't been proved and recommends people to take their blood pressure meds.

I have been looking for info about it but I don't know if getting the virus with hypertension is kind of a death sentence, normally the reports of deaths show that people that died had hypertension and other problems so this freaked me out, now I have been taking natural sedatives to keep myself together in the middle of all of this. Do you guys know about studies or news about people with hypertension surviving this virus?

COVID19_support,c-lyin,2020/03/31,"Creating a just-in-case plan for my dog - what makes the most sense? Hi everyone -

I live alone in an apartment building with my dog.  I'm very fortunate in that my job was able to switch to completely work-from-home a few weeks back.  We don't have a balcony where I could put one of those sod-boxes, so we're still going on short potty walks (this is now the only reason I have to go outside my building).  I have a plan for the scenario in which I get sick to the degree I have to go to the hospital, but my anxiety has me spiraling around what course of action would be best in the case I get sick, but am well enough I can stay at home.

Here are my current thoughts, in no particular order:

\- complete quarantine where I utilize the pottypads I got about a month ago as a just-in-case (this seems cruel to my dog, though would limit the spread most efficiently)

&amp;#x200B;

\- reduce walks and utilize pottypads; wear dentist-style mask while out (seems too irresponsible, though I probably don't have to interact with anyone about half the time I go out)

&amp;#x200B;

\- reduce walks and utilize pottypads; have a friend in the building walk my dog for me (this seems risky for the friend, and of my friends in my building there is only one couple not over 60 that I would be comfortable asking)

&amp;#x200B;

\- go straight to the going-to-the-hospital plan where either my SO takes my dog, or I arrange a foster home through the rescue from which I adopted my pup. (this is the biggest ask time-wise for others, but might balance the safety of others with the well-being of my dog the best.)

&amp;#x200B;

This is really the only thing I can make solid plan for about which I'm getting anxiety spirals - so it would be ideal to decide on one plan instead of going back and forth on all of them.

What are people's thoughts on the above scenarios?",11.455515685431886,6.9891090251396655,10.312011173184356,70.17955092393639,59.3072625698324,13.361753330468414,41.78427159432746,10.389873798559362,4.145492221744737,1453,51,281,21,13,460,174,358,0.071,0.8029999999999999,0.126,0.9734,2,2,0,0,0,0,75.0,1,0,1,9,21,9,1,0,28,0,28,3,1,3,1,37,50,15,0,6,6,0,0,0,3,5,2,0,2,0,18,11,0,1,7,0,0,12,4,1,1,4,4,0,34,8,48,37,8,47,0,0,0,0,9,23,0,7,10,196,52,1,0.07032602306906409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06233977622130209,0.0,0.0,0.07283655068070129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38099108306714413,0.4272690779786308,0.0,0.0,0.10759843031408824,0.0,0.0,0.049173590491371655,0.0,0.0,0.06260507051419226,0.1314906765085779,0.0,0.0,0.10815274154754456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14760564488030786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474709943586657,0.0,0.0,0.05614960694006855,0.07781440690358267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726655811612891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06719952879799998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16300113291574791,0.0,0.11022733336207642,0.0,0.2398073974439204,0.0,0.056246145052801184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14108547034340738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06978772641266974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062099166802453885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09388633297823812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0746047969470056,0.0,0.0,0.05613356066433034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429641998501408,0.1604583286679769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048755209523986966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582334741650372,0.0,0.0,0.0706970773623183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04505265117878119,0.07230686449760015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920665104241048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07495818341650963,0.05616245286678197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052876417166377115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04672148482376863,0.0,0.13818992120126694,0.11166201364766193,0.08201533919693532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05802633416892996,0.0,0.0,0.0564112937056846,0.0,0.12646308110985618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05119818237317095,0.0,0.0,0.19983035614435365,0.0,0.4272690779786308,0.0
COVID19_support,yuhngmacint0sh,2020/03/31,"Uncertainty is Making Me Crack I am naturally an anxious person, so much so that I’ve been on meds since I was around 12 because coping didn’t work.


I studied abroad in the Yucatán peninsula of Mexico for 10 weeks and came home 2 weeks ago because of the virus.  However my problems started when I realized I didn’t wear a mask in the international terminal of the Atlanta airport and if you read any articles, you would know the lines were extremely long.  So amongst that waiting I’m not sure if I got infected and I’m literally freaking out especially since my small town in NC does no drive thru testing at all. Right now i don’t know if i’m having symptoms or not.  My family thinks i’m over exaggerating or making things up.  I can’t drive so I rely on them to take me places which they refuse to do.  Currently, I’m having severe acid reflux like i’ve never had before, and I think it may have led to chest pain when I drink or eat but it seems to respond to strong acid reflux medicine.  My stomach is a bit queasy and i’m nauseous but my aunt who is taking me more serious and also has acid reflux says it’s likely due to the heavy meal I ate a few hours ago.  My back and shoulders are somewhat stiff which I can’t seem to reason out.  I have to keep cracking them my back.  I had a bit of a cough a day or two ago, so far no fever.  I don’t know if i’m stressing myself out or if I should be worried.  Even if I sound like I’m being rational, I’m literally cracking at the foundation and I can barely eat and drink and I don’t know what to do.  I’m so tense and I can’t sleep fully through the night.  For the past two weeks, I’ve been struggling more than i’ve ever struggled.  Due to my town being so rural, getting to a doctor for a regular visit is difficult at times.  I’m asking more for reassurance at this point since my family isn’t help.",3.2412768319763146,4.247121044041453,4.949122871946706,84.13369170984456,73.01554404145077,8.001332346410067,26.480014803849002,8.418075326091056,1.6533652109548491,1457,49,310,24,28,496,201,386,0.12,0.835,0.045,-0.9603,2,0,2,0,0,0,26.0,0,2,3,2,16,14,0,3,18,0,35,18,5,4,4,57,66,34,0,9,15,1,0,3,0,3,7,2,1,1,11,16,6,4,10,3,0,5,14,8,0,2,11,5,39,6,37,49,9,50,0,0,0,0,15,22,0,15,26,193,50,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2670740513149665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803134272796065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06829549742326893,0.0,0.0,0.11345673816249258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08940353884561551,0.09388801664560016,0.0,0.0,0.1544481581250475,0.0,0.12244177052860722,0.0,0.0854580994456398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21928598526186446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148645824260908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476871305686238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279383910262926,0.08788652393090639,0.0,0.0,0.19676533359408116,0.0,0.2055288820905546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06633273131119594,0.09084422386645573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1893519713210471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247026371903319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032263797233928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06731577052850966,0.0,0.1007389675053503,0.0,0.0989028181756568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08926634562490322,0.0,0.0,0.22077368611293768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471943285264037,0.0,0.0,0.08887693877283616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13407492953129854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155452375270426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382723109282976,0.0,0.07745741436584422,0.0,0.0,0.09424627356681403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686405871210836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958713125290178,0.0,0.0876911573705053,0.10492744225934328,0.0,0.09493833021550104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09609745912262643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045666816009508,0.0,0.0,0.1032582427560781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857662361612609,0.0,0.07986556180106144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828544725915408,0.0,0.11345673816249258,0.0,0.2492289370878814,0.0,0.10050201949064057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108451029332663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504164206758012,0.209981418130128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465360627493416,0.10438469440882696,0.15102095652394493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672089096073637,0.1287023247121344,0.0,0.0,0.0585612435510899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19621003851226956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24167543842974945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311386520341105,0.10199102258011168,0.0,0.07134222859806089,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,kimkimedunedunea,2020/03/31,"How should I buy my books? Hello, my college has started to give distance education till the end of semester, so no more school for me. I need to buy some books for studying but I am having a contradiction about how to buy my books. Plan A is that my mum can drive to the bookstore with me, I can enter and buy them in a minute and pay with contactless payment. I am sure the bookstore will be empty so the only person I will have an interaction would be cashier. Plan B is buying them online. With this way I won't have to leave the house but I will have an interaction with the delivery person. They usually encounter with 100-150 people during a day. I want to choose the healthier way for the society and me at the same time but I don't know which one is safer.

COVID19_support,Connect-Version,2020/03/31,"Show your support for Adults with Disabilities at home I just started working in a Day Service for adults with disabilities a few weeks ago - just when the situation got really concerning worldwide. Most of them fall in a risk group and, given they had essential supports at home, the service is now closed until considered safe to reopen by the organisation and authorities.

All staff is trying their best to keep the clients safe, mentally healthy and supported at home. But soon after closing, many clients were showing signs of worrying, anxiety and were feeling quite low, especially the elderly.

So, I would love to share with them your thoughts and advices on how to look after their wellbeing during this strange time, your positive personal stories or even of someone you're helping or just sending love and support!

Thank you.",12.8509324009324,10.876784454545458,10.951153846153849,58.99801282051285,54.10489510489511,14.568298368298366,50.4067599067599,13.023866798666859,6.659723543123543,679,38,102,18,6,209,100,143,0.062,0.6809999999999999,0.257,0.9868,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,4,5,3,9,13,0,1,8,0,6,2,0,1,1,27,20,13,0,1,6,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,3,1,11,0,3,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,0,6,2,11,11,22,13,4,22,0,1,1,2,18,9,0,3,11,70,12,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13570077093585567,0.12309861891989025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10623408498125388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1457340090943155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08955874695347042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172138858180562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702161274949256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11106589075630507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09308068316021488,0.0,0.417889530609238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12343277613472202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11661463377065255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2506686337419333,0.0,0.0,0.14079094566508735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13994686822101576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12125468922174212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14770383042185592,0.0,0.0,0.08896276943792487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15609410431497858,0.0,0.0,0.11766289871829627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09829189695466534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6303456838633483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12785153254421452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024614218252657,0.08097538680239269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428265147288058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11139199990071808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010979814712972,0.14102778566495114,0.0,0.09864825618043396,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,WildTomorrow,2020/03/31,"Never really had anxiety issues until now I can’t stop thinking about this.

I’m 25 and relatively healthy other than being obese. My BMI is around 37. I was at the doctor last year for my normal check up where they did a blood test and the results came back in normal ranges. Blood pressure was normal. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I don’t really get sick often at all. I actually can’t remember the last time I was sick. People around me would get colds and stuff and i somehow wouldn’t.

But I cannot stop thinking that if I get this virus, I’ll be severe or fatal because of my weight. I’m taking all the precautions recommended. No one in my family is leaving the house right now except to go grocery shopping and that’s only once every two weeks or so. She’s wearing gloves and a mask, bringing her hand sanitizer along, and washing her hands often. We all are.

I just can’t shake these thoughts...",2.9774371508379893,5.041078597765363,4.330666899441344,83.94002269553074,75.87150837988827,6.933100558659219,24.03666201117318,7.865858978985527,1.3484550279329608,715,23,137,11,16,236,119,179,0.134,0.813,0.053,-0.9236,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,1,0,12,3,0,2,8,0,17,11,5,1,4,38,29,13,1,6,6,0,3,0,0,2,5,1,0,0,7,13,2,2,4,1,2,4,8,3,0,2,7,5,19,0,17,18,3,26,0,0,0,0,5,10,0,6,12,95,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.1414040961181366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11085014017961356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2579881815076685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11142120313798946,0.0,0.08833131810867842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16573004336504596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14831401509773542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12208674273827108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13660133417751405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2271169815236854,0.0,0.08235152236939376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16719821749569752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512407327333854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362300196405452,0.0,0.15343099727138598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11175786626879204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4259215304401982,0.1390380126940241,0.0,0.0,0.1543166064277208,0.09818979420544832,0.11020500437853724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045726121550587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18565671205622533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16414646950164805,0.12374608202148403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636987636970291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422902282865972,0.0,0.0,0.1658788808790072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894876882457978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1856955504056167,0.0,0.11503652822303845,0.0844939077672443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415488460606179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11623217544595975,0.17645240589360564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102934693963855,0.0,0.0,0.09331256381540344
COVID19_support,Bajileh,2020/03/31,"My job isnt taking this seriously If you've seen my posts and comments, you know my very nonessential job in an ""essential"" industry is still full steam ahead. 

Well, today I learned one of my coworkers, who mind you has been sick and has cancer, is allegedly in the hospital with pneumonia and coughing up blood. The word came from a manager I trust, but I went to my direct supervisor, who I also trust, to look into it. Until he gets test results, they won't do anything. 

Guys I'm terrified. We're in Bucks county, bordering Philly. We have people on two shifts coming in from the city and suburbs and NJ. 

We sanitize our workstations at the beginning of every shift and I never directly worked with that man. However, we are a completely open floorplan and he was probably 300' from where my desk is. I walk through his dept to get to the bathroom, and we all share the break room. 

We've gone to everyone we can. From the state to the media to the attorney general and the cops. We're helpless. I'm helpless.

COVID19_support,melyncora,2020/03/31,"Could use an outside opinion - Should I self-quarantine? I hope this is the appropriate place for a question like this! I could really use a outside opinion!

I’m a 26 y.o. pharmacy technician from Indiana. Last night I noticed that I had a tickle at the back of my throat, and sometimes it’d give me the urge to cough, but I never coughed involuntarily.

During work today, I noticed some soreness in my chest, and my breathing is a bit labored, and I’d sometimes find myself breathless after talking with patients. I found myself dry coughing every once and awhile.

My cough tonight has been a bit worse, it’s harder to resist the urge, but still doable.

However, despite the above I have no fever. I check my temps three times a day, and it’s always in my regular 97.6 - 99.5 range. No sore throat, can still taste/smell, no runny nose, nothing else. The symptoms are mild enough for me to wonder if It’s all just me feeling “sympathetically ill”, as it were. Or perhaps I’m just exhausted. I've been working long hours, and haven’t had time off in awhile, with no end in sight...

I guess my biggest fear is taking the time away from work to isolate, only to get *actually* sick when I get back, then be out of work again. I’m not sure I can afford to be out for that long...

I should mention that one of my coworkers, another tech, is currently in quarantine waiting on their Covid-19 test results. Not to mention the constant influx of sick people fresh from the hospital I see in a day who couldn’t care less about social distancing...

I'm going to try to get a hold of a doctor in the morning and run all of this by them before work, but any external thoughts or opinions would be appreciated! 

tl;dr - dry mild cough, a bit out of breath, no fever.

Do you guys think I should get him checked?",3.4715999999999987,5.116423560000001,4.2316666666666665,86.98750000000004,73.4,5.533333333333334,28.5,5.46131890053228,1.1065999999999994,297,12,56,1,6,95,53,75,0.0,0.973,0.027000000000000003,0.2023,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,7,0,9,8,5,0,0,8,13,6,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,2,1,3,0,1,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,5,6,0,5,9,0,8,0,0,0,0,12,2,0,2,5,33,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22911600967256615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1948315789556113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14968577306406053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5673651960366819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335378416462372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2688632630626205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30063626273226923,0.0,0.0,0.21789812234990255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3209484587355972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20278800070671385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977858804428529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18357928476247945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1844982681293892

COVID19_support,miabear17,2020/03/31,"Broken over daughter's canceled birthday party I dont think it really hit home today until I had to hit cancel on the event page for my caught up rs 3rd birthday. Shes been talking about her birthday for MONTHS and it breaks my heart that she doesnt get the big family party. 

I know that sounds stupid and like ""first world problems"" but we've never been able to really afford to do much for her birthday, and until this point it was always what we chose for her as a theme since she was really too young to understand. 

This is the first year where she knew what birthdays are, and she was so excited because she got to pick out a theme and where we'd have it. She was so, SO excited when we said we could have it at the arcade (she adores the place because of all the games and stuff our local one has for the kiddos), and she talks about it non stop!

Her Birthday is April 7th, and she's still so excited for her birthday even though we cant have it at the arcade. She thinks she'll be able to see grandma and papa, and her cousin (5), and all the other family. We've tried to explain that we have to all stay away from each other for now because we dont want to get them sick. Her response? A very sad ""Oh, I'm sorry"". She is apologising because she thinks SHES THE GOSH-DANG REASON. 

This whole thing just breaks my heart for her in so many ways and I'm just a mess. I cant even describe fully how broken looking at her birthday invite picture is. 
Looking at it makes me bawl like a freaking baby.

COVID19_support,mccartski,2020/03/31,"I want to go home, but I don’t want to endanger my parents. I live near a big city in my state that has been impacted by COVID-19 pretty intensely. 

I’m a college student who recently moved out of the dorms into my boyfriend’s parents’ house. They offered for me to live with them since I’ve been in contact with the family &amp; we figured it’d be reasonably safe. I opted to do this because I didn’t want to risk bringing anything to my family. My dad is 84 years old, and my mom is immunocompromised, and I’d never forgive myself if I was responsible for infecting either of them.

Having said that, I’m so deeply unhappy being away from them at this moment in time. I deal with depression, anxiety, and OCD among other things, and I’m having a very hard time being in a new(ish) place in such a time of uncertainty. I just want to be somewhere comfortable. I may be 22 but I feel like an absolute child right now. I cry multiple hours a day on a good day, and I just feel paralyzed. I still have to do online classes and I can barely concentrate. 

My mom’s said I can come back if I stay mostly to my room for a few weeks and wipe down surfaces after I use them outside of my room but I’m so scared. 

I just don’t want either of my parents to die, especially not because of me.",4.2709586888190385,4.744032225190843,5.778603502469692,81.0828985181859,70.25954198473282,9.218140996856759,29.915581499775485,9.325443323948027,2.4640607992815453,1001,38,208,20,17,341,148,262,0.135,0.755,0.11,-0.8929,3,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,1,0,5,0,9,8,0,2,11,0,23,1,0,2,1,40,40,14,1,7,11,6,3,1,0,1,1,2,4,1,8,14,0,1,5,0,0,4,5,3,0,0,6,5,37,5,38,27,4,41,0,1,0,0,20,19,0,4,17,143,45,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12728063250554653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898655957819854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666927173726328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103686111423083,0.09032855336508197,0.0,0.1432194224595907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10119154313197327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290372423446881,0.15151916927381426,0.12110825458042855,0.10117827830431712,0.0,0.12191716885731965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22148389276884325,0.0,0.11879453062449408,0.08392186834888933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06676192388469443,0.09852976181102444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523164764764824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11783378076782094,0.0,0.11568604764200158,0.13554667052825384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05739078156598371,0.0,0.20745948081128185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27516307513178506,0.0,0.12485391916529888,0.0,0.0,0.09060148430390066,0.1134549842276616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12326687993352152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3913155539826205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12273301517666432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11951103959639488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078056228582977,0.11598921809791647,0.0,0.0,0.10032026453487757,0.22348514106117534,0.0,0.11760975224804347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971738764090163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520929518760807,0.09381312111558203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780430357069477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20549623164611872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145790724642753,0.0,0.09692652719772447,0.3464395188160039,0.0,0.09422878201653746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756479795842239

COVID19_support,KaleMunoz,2020/03/31,"It feels like I have snapped. A contact was exposed. Fortunately, her test came back negative. But after nearly a week of waiting, the fear feels permanent. Afraid of everything. Last Tuesday my wife got sent home from work after her boss told her she had been exposed to a COVID19 patient and was waiting on test results. My wife told me and we were really concerned. She stayed in one room to isolate herself. That night my son had a stuffy nose for about ten minutes with sneezing. It went away, but I went into a state of panic, trembling and all. 

He got better but throughout the week I had a mild stuffy nose and a throat tickle. Not too bad, and I knew these were rare symptoms, but while waiting on my wife’s boss COVID19 test, it was really scary. 

On Saturday I order carry out and I’m afraid of my own food. 

Sunday, my wife runs in the room screaming happily that her boss’s test was negative. We hug and I expect things to go back to normal. I still have this feeling of dread but it’s definitely better. Surely I thought we are going back to social distancing normal. We will be bored, but at least we can know we’re healthy. 

Today might as well be last week. I had diarrhea in the afternoon which really scared me. My son has a stuffy nose which is scary. He was coughing for a little bit and sneezing for a bit. Every cough, every sneeze made me feel trapped. All I could do was fall to my knees and pray. 

I’m supposed to be better now, but I’m not. I’m afraid of everything.",2.3347818437719923,4.620131363945582,3.214133239502697,90.07561224489798,78.89795918367345,6.095988740323715,23.74337321135351,7.237678284180719,0.9581573070607552,1167,40,235,15,29,370,154,294,0.149,0.7170000000000001,0.134,-0.5727,0,1,0,0,0,0,37.0,5,0,0,4,8,18,0,8,14,0,26,10,5,5,3,50,51,18,0,4,9,6,4,1,0,2,3,1,3,0,11,18,1,3,7,0,0,8,4,11,1,2,24,8,33,7,33,21,6,44,1,0,0,1,25,14,0,1,20,151,44,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10682203681397914,0.26227783297400104,0.09493221266936412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30166716552189,0.2482552666398478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13003903329075653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09077777114020501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19158918541199715,0.0,0.2043669932702296,0.0,0.0,0.12794068989865034,0.2299543972209068,0.08122513110819124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748281562120793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12923320529579596,0.0,0.1818676910266445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404732139720992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06248487591167661,0.1853563950420825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05554659171455738,0.11395422341666148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10758281284996678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12061450742558788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10669689513537003,0.2227977617559088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704400275434807,0.0,0.0,0.13339888545484613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2185115523069711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11383049178832595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589973276173145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12118583174646733,0.09079853931043493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10715803947136003,0.11817467547064905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553520830857399,0.0,0.0,0.09026268635131364,0.0,0.0,0.10777142406428084,0.21728463575766607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2736025302120096,0.0,0.10222722170547836,0.2107964424342086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277274117389424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,MWlfrd,2020/03/31,"I think I had a mild case of the vrius I'll start off by saying that I am 29 years old, work at a bank and am considered ""essential"" and have to report to work. Luckily our company switched to a drivethru only model a week or so ago. I've been extra cautious, wearing rubber gloves since then and even wiping down my station and computer with lysol wipes. 

At the end of last week I began to notice a feeling of being extra tired at work and at home. When Friday rolled around and I came home from work, I found myself passed out, face down in bed by 9 pm, early for me. 

Saturday I worked from 9-12pm and felt normal, but after work I couldn't shake this feeling that something was off. My partner made chili for dinner and I noticed I couldn't really smell it that well. Another night of passing out early while watching tv, but I woke up at 3 am Sunday freezing cold in a puddle of sweat and with this weird feeling of needing to breath deeply. I decided to take my temperature; 98.6. Odd for me, someone that always has a low body temperature around 97.5. Not wanting to disturb my partner, I decided to sleep on the sofa. 

Sunday morning, I slept in past my usual time of getting up to make coffee. When I finally woke up I had a tightness in my throat and that same weight in my chest. I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy my day off. I cleaned out my car and my partner and I decided to just drive around town for the heck of it, as nothing was open anyway. On the way back home my partner stoped at a Burger King, and the smell of the food made me feel sick. I also can't fight the urge to fall asleep right in the car. 

As the day progressed I could no longer ignore the tightness in my throat. I decide to have a look in the mirror and I immediately noticed my tonsils are huge and swollen, as are the lymph nodes in my neck. I take my temperature, 98.9. Anxiety sets in. Google tells me that swollen lymph nodes are a sign of viral or bacterial infection.

I lay low for the rest of the evening wondering how this is possibly happening. I take my temperature throughout the evening. 99.1, 99.2, and then around dinner time, 99.6. I go into complete panic mode, calling my parents and my boss to tell them I might have it. I call a hospital and after asking a few questions, they tell me that I don't meet the requirements to be tested. Great, now what? I decide to take some acetaminophen and lay down. I can't sleep that night, I kept having the worst thoughts and I was up all night. But the good news was that my temperature was dropping. 

Now, cut to today, Monday. I woke up this morning at my usual time; craving coffee. I hop out of bed and immediately take my temperature; 96.9! Also, upon checking my tonsils, they seem to have reduced in size. I made it through today feeling completely fine with none of the symptoms that I had just developed a few days before. 

I should also note that my partner has been working from home for two weeks and has shown no signs of anything and he's a smoker.

So does this sound like Covid 19??? If so, I can only think that my tonsils that I never had removed might have saved me from a worse case. As I type this I still do feel a slight weight in my chest, but not like the days before. 

Any feedback is appreciated, I just want to put my situation out there.",4.092762094827311,5.178940606656582,4.908206778897224,84.92239128335534,71.07261724659605,7.5619918241220585,27.22570573277111,7.8428983058341695,1.513234821514791,2595,87,527,32,47,841,305,661,0.07200000000000001,0.843,0.084,0.7857,1,0,2,0,1,0,84.0,1,0,3,10,27,18,2,3,39,0,41,27,14,6,2,100,79,47,0,9,12,1,12,2,5,3,8,2,8,5,25,39,5,5,19,1,2,12,11,10,1,1,24,19,82,8,100,47,10,109,0,2,2,0,21,49,1,9,47,360,107,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05827724523233379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15772407489909127,0.05470348239744893,0.0,0.0,0.0447075269799192,0.06893731793848842,0.050293251677454666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05410092673010513,0.23410100377591164,0.06146087510366598,0.0,0.0,0.10110469147885276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11188498307406246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07302570547947769,0.0,0.0,0.1342620047868036,0.07519253262078092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13786066976543546,0.0,0.0,0.052490474167396335,0.0,0.0,0.1695953083699333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05753218422966784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05822882684648866,0.0,0.0,0.1302679892512193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19944996217786534,0.0,0.06312363584629453,0.07201829545186145,0.0,0.0,0.07949675444972193,0.07208385864783404,0.0,0.0,0.03434802907025772,0.0,0.03736328915628346,0.05514214939945769,0.0,0.07248194237512404,0.0,0.0,0.05813636011578303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2637825495149066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05358935862553375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06423746476385016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05520760240497728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18662298449810555,0.04388399495944684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394859690145452,0.06638173711711244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04874763697190125,0.05070509145125443,0.0,0.0,0.18508619062241136,0.06441422834638592,0.06308222753551115,0.2245466872417515,0.06898626957341046,0.0,0.0,0.1000011008077029,0.0,0.07713530154989498,0.07299987449960141,0.0,0.06275917817725697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741154084041834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321798429313336,0.07364725962290898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04211667991543817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05614420367102091,0.0,0.05228151040262904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05985000164886359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054383328571802836,0.07389794033680787,0.13158105343510695,0.0,0.055703871119917515,0.05061221016860293,0.0,0.0,0.046533267663271545,0.0,0.052502482956434296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833219930518049,0.24715295089230435,0.0,0.17238696475367027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08425098098027238,0.0,0.052192636442744966,0.1150058997218439,0.07556196233885178,0.1246334445046582,0.0,0.0,0.04463521401987,0.0,0.06422140493503127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14481335825211716,0.0,0.07755390596018208,0.052183771315886696,0.15820532233652873,0.16011464206215908,0.059110895461934924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07129553100936976,0.3350320529405485,0.0,0.06699778236995654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04233636736076697
COVID19_support,aminoanic,2020/03/31,"Coworker is being tested for COVID - what to do while waiting for the results? Hi all,

My dad's (super low contact) job decided to hire a new employee during this pandemic, and now that coworker is out because he exhibited COVID 19 symptoms. They met on Tuesday/Wednesday of last week, and while the rest of us have been able to stay at home (high schooler sibling, myself in college, working from home mother), my dad has continued to work because we truly is at such a low risk of coming into contact with other people.

The coworker won't know his status until Thursday since he was tested today, Monday. What should my family do in the meantime? Should we isolate my dad? Continue as normal? I'm looking for advice or some links to resources that might be able to help because I've seen nothing that talks about this weird waiting period.

Thanks!",7.542222222222222,7.782724057324843,7.673205944798305,71.11997169143667,63.20382165605095,9.780325548478416,36.55272469922153,9.444778638647367,3.6471888181174816,675,30,107,11,9,219,113,157,0.069,0.878,0.053,0.41700000000000004,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,3,0,1,3,3,6,0,1,6,0,15,1,0,1,1,21,24,7,0,3,1,4,0,0,0,4,1,0,2,0,8,8,0,2,3,0,0,1,1,4,0,0,4,2,10,2,24,14,3,25,0,2,2,0,17,10,0,3,13,73,18,7,0.3530058979975998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17247663899326168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3227836784055752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520416619232893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16639127195587933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183062061914094,0.1864850563015784,0.3540936980332155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17515194202949508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700140481884847,0.14387346096881293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14821802375536694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18724173635798333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704676480025319,0.0,0.0,0.17293541489437178,0.16935933987520727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12236492104191718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14600506334295532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18812865916808566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18345414578189706,0.0,0.14186638459235604,0.0,0.16250020151902606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16730415770273702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21231131541064585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14158001919307558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569924980222064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Nebula982,2020/03/31,"Some people think that lockdowns could last for months or over a year. I really hope the lockdowns don’t need to last that long. I’ve seen posts on social media by people who claim that lockdowns could last 3 to 18 months or even longer. If a lockdown lasted more than 3 months, wouldn’t people have to find a more effective way to slow the spread of the virus? We definitely need to flatten the curve and I’m personally trying to social distance as much as I can. It’s really discouraging to see people be so certain that these lockdowns could last over a year.

I want people to be safe. I want the world to recover. This pandemic has to end eventually. I really hope it ends soon. :-/",3.239378109452737,5.376149231343284,4.263507462686569,84.38441542288558,75.34328358208955,7.451741293532338,22.360696517412933,8.344100000000001,1.3012457711442789,543,15,106,10,12,176,80,134,0.04,0.807,0.153,0.9235,0,5,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,9,0,10,0,0,1,1,22,20,7,0,11,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,9,2,0,2,3,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,6,4,19,13,4,21,0,1,2,0,5,4,0,6,15,64,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29329993956416045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21690934296004954,0.0,0.0,0.08087730621725177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11191740830407623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2432416683440585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4990669226326661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083647130262125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932161211376261,0.0,0.09001510202036264,0.18159077692405448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4244582994762071,0.10691892896625706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727359400056282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23533450344622475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757708116030953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24964543769947006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846124470423074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08313575483373342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14444878676808667,0.0971953941228084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577080309680499
COVID19_support,rubbishaccount88,2020/03/31,"I don't have any special reason to worry but I am basically incapacitated. And ashamed about it. I'm a 45 yo guy, mildly overweight and a former smoker plus an alcoholic who quit 3.5 years ago but with a long history of taking very good care of myself (diet and exercise). Though I've had a tough couple years due to divorce/custody that have taken an extreme toll on me stress-wise. Blood pressure basically normal. Went for a run today, etc. And, ironically, the current social distancing has allowed me to catch up on a multi-year backlog of sleep, which is probably good for my health. 

The problem is that I have a long, old history of complex PTSD mostly involving avoidance. So when I can't meet responsibilities or give a good answer for why I'm failing to deliver on a work obligation, I freeze up and I just stop reading my email or turn off my phone. Under normal circumstances, I have pretty much had this under control for a few years now, but now its gone bananas. 

I havent read email in a few days and have my phone on airplane mode. Bear with me, I realize how totally bizarre this probably sounds to a normal person. 

I understand that my ""odds"" of surviving the pandemic are approximately 99.6. I understand that even the pretty smart calculator I used to do this didnt factor in many ofthe proactive things that I am doing. I understand that this will probably all be OK. 

But.

The thing is. I am the sole custodian of a 6 yo boy. And he is the most precious, beautiful, forever wonderful thingt that ever came into my life. And he needs me so much. And I can do some CBT and walk through a worse case scenario where I get unlucky and die but he ends up OK. But I simply cannot bear the thought of the loss, for him mostly, and just slightly less for me. 

And so I simply freeze. I can't stand it. 

And I feel guilty posting this here where there are other very real people already dealing with horrific losses of loved ones. And I am truly so f-cking sorry for you that it makes my heart hurt. Please forgive me if I seem selfish in the light of your own real loss.

That's my rant. Thank you for reading. Seriously, truly.

COVID19_support,RWJTP,2020/03/31,"Worried I may have Coronavirus Hello,

I am in Sweden. This area has one of the highest rates of Coronavirus in the country, but it isn't drastically high.

Over the past few weeks, I have been the only one going out to do the shopping. My girlfriend stays at home. This is so only one of us is potentially exposed.

Over the past couple of days, I have developed an intense cough. No breathing issues, unless I overexert myself. If breathing issues do pop up, it isn't so much as rapid, shallow breathing, it is more like I have just walked intensely and am a bit out of breath.The coughing is something I have regularly pop up. Just seems to be more intense right now. There could be a little tightness in the chest, but nothing too crazy.

I do not have a fever. It has been like this for about 6 days now. I haven't even come close to a fever. Take the temperature several times, and it is relatively stable at normal rates.

The problem is:

1. I am staying with my girlfriend. I am currently 300-miles from where I normally live in Sweden.
2. I am British. I know that Swedish people are good at English, but I can't seem to shake the fear of going to a hospital completely alone, no family in the country, can't have my girlfriend by my side, with everybody speaking a language I do not speak around me. It is terrifying.

Do my symptoms potentially indicate coronavirus? It doesn't seem to match up with the typical symptoms. Just the coughing. I haven't been out since it started.

Note: I have lived in Sweden for 7-years. I am not just visiting. I am a resident.",2.6403868824348957,5.140230378737545,3.8778373164719753,84.55442824991964,79.09966777408637,6.9403493730575505,27.98210266852427,8.049812674583475,2.0765643768084883,1228,55,232,23,31,400,150,301,0.084,0.8440000000000001,0.07200000000000001,-0.6856,1,1,1,0,0,0,47.0,1,0,0,0,14,6,0,2,21,0,44,11,4,0,0,33,53,10,0,5,12,0,1,2,3,1,7,2,1,0,12,11,0,1,4,1,1,6,12,3,0,3,3,3,28,3,40,46,5,43,0,0,0,0,8,25,0,5,12,175,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272842679247365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10940441981812343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341717358260724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10586491649243547,0.12885520649764368,0.0,0.0,0.098123284900722,0.1359832353970104,0.0,0.15851684543693095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08117233476165424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11585639020156666,0.1382933355560226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13969043811714196,0.10308020495882574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12984746853408125,0.12327574987866535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2565451567721845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06754099824282002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008257033880045,0.12317511863872305,0.21704067288515205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034346390289084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2408260081452453,0.11792302284980792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24983464136217504,0.18693747123806506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2346382583926892,0.08520133221275808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11759586809490573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10495339925425194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3356425440759981,0.0,0.1388386720861104,0.0,0.10166170010739067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461214432910847,0.0,0.0,0.08698715629284308,0.26198378182306004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25547415856570177,0.09240327811526287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07166225137461675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14783000522374776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858059113057144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480790801024835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914166336074882
COVID19_support,quoral,2020/03/31,"I work in a supermarket and does anyone want some questions answered? So I work in a major supermarket in Australia, and I have seen some shit over the past few weeks, yet I remain pretty positive, even as a browser of the other doomer coronavirus subs. Here, we had been very complacent in regards to COVID until a week or so ago, when the government enacted policies which subsequently caused the staggered closure of businesses as well as advocating social distancing en masse, and beforehand supermarkets experienced unprecedented demand from people who were stocking up in the eventuality of a lockdown type measure.

However, working in one of the only few areas that remain for people to congregate puts me in a precarious position, as that increases the risk of myself and others here to be exposed to COVID, and the company itself has lax measures and little regard for PPE asides from sanitisers and a soft limit on proximity for people. I'm most likely going to catch it within the next few months or already have it within me, I suspect the latter as I have some symptoms that I'd associate with a cold/flu but obviously cannot rule out allergies as I am prone to them.

If anyone has any questions for me just to pass the time or if they would like to know if we are truly going to run of of food ask away!",19.404444444444444,9.165772469135804,17.44368312757202,42.13490740740744,52.7037037037037,20.64444444444445,59.01851851851853,15.247664890283005,8.160797530864198,1062,45,170,27,6,355,154,243,0.039,0.9,0.062,0.8098,1,1,0,0,0,0,17.0,2,0,2,4,9,5,1,1,19,0,13,3,1,1,1,33,20,24,0,5,8,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,10,11,1,1,5,0,0,7,1,2,1,1,4,3,15,3,44,14,9,34,0,0,1,0,9,17,1,12,12,132,25,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13717691915588848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17077094770229495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523559907017384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21641019767198527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14467076234873216,0.0,0.14539312312923555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15897131965608652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354231442044224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022111995792601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871248343127682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17589647127472258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08504678929649956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15120648677815046,0.15510058533303409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235203168815958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645788379913839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10486289639223767,0.11769467539439465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14772679588387638,0.32185338995562424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15743682117134755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15556692458216478,0.34671179597004226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15884909264977742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15774857528148845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16084494973056954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09023622024742148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276853115889741,0.09127581310432882,0.0,0.2482629212101508,0.0,0.13913922141802135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33798046849258706,0.0,0.0,0.10993026551938208,0.0,0.0,0.0

He works by himself But I’m still worried because he’s definitely been in contact with the virus, as it can live on metallic surfaces for up to 3 days long. 

Im sure me and him would be okay if we contracted the virus, but I’m worried for my mom who is a long term smoker. Extra worried because ventilators are in high demand. I’m quarantined at home studying and my mom is also working from home. But I’m still worried my dad will bring the virus home and my mother will get sick.

COVID19_support,prismpossessive,2020/04/01,"I am pretty sure I had this I live in europe and I'm male in my mid-to-late 30s. In late february, I traveled by train to another city, a train that was jam-packed full with all kinds of people, and you heard also a lot of coughs, which really wasn't all that unusual considering time of year. About six days later I started getting pretty ill in one evening. Following were two weeks of something I'd call a bad flu, with pretty much all the symptoms already mentioned. It was pretty bad and I haven't been sick like that since I was a kid but it also wasn't terrible and I never had the feeling I couldn't get past it. I wasn't grasping for air but I was exhausted, basically ended up only drinking and light eating and sleeping a few days and having a bit more energy every following day. I did follow the news but somehow was in denial about having this, just couldn't imagine. I live with my 70 year old mother who's also a chain-smoker. She ended up getting a slight itch in her throat and light coughing that was very persistent didn't want to go away until about a week ago. I had a slight cough and the feeling I didn't get as much air as I always wanted too for a while, but I'm over that now now. My mother has been perfectly fine since, as am I.

Could that already have been it? Seems insane. Neither me or my mother ever saw a doctors office. There's no statistic we're factored in. There must be a huge number of cases like ours.",4.078040540540542,4.805698831081084,5.211054054054056,84.06232432432434,70.82432432432431,7.676756756756758,25.94864864864865,7.734863291789972,1.3544924324324317,1138,33,230,13,20,377,163,296,0.095,0.7959999999999999,0.109,0.7062,0,0,3,0,0,0,29.0,1,1,0,2,15,10,0,0,17,0,31,14,3,0,8,39,49,22,0,6,6,3,2,2,0,1,10,1,0,2,14,12,2,0,5,2,0,5,11,4,0,3,21,6,26,6,31,23,11,42,0,0,1,0,13,15,0,4,24,161,40,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729915871517653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24225459569542246,0.26333468124015685,0.09133243678287534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11509711917155005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10312688643612412,0.0,0.1832967018243998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11983385382606256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120813111626025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763761836523311,0.0,0.0,0.212366088521974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11234809989826096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10752692743128142,0.0,0.11231596941346704,0.0,0.0,0.19443663963689195,0.0,0.0,0.07249808343508134,0.09928781751150197,0.09248089980150496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11099994774011117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293886280133401,0.0,0.062381407824699836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11430230976947772,0.0,0.0,0.12381856725167985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072502870477242,0.0,0.19384723696609954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933174232824954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613783317451188,0.0,0.08465675961714593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151788483760905,0.0,0.0743789236716027,0.08348046429091137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10478215320505516,0.07609653350095084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4466777748042534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031762581280815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999250185268778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18159582173357766,0.0,0.10984326516337542,0.0,0.0,0.08450168587221599,0.0,0.0,0.07769152055582043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10345126620759673,0.11408681860382397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06400426813590966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10722347370356287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056679122363173,0.12948329618049526,0.0,0.1760921117237594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14136882794774894

COVID19_support,switchonthesky,2020/04/01,"I just want to have a normal conversation again. In the grand scheme of things, I have it a lot better than most people. I'm housing and food secure, I'm able to work from home, I don't have any close friends or family members in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

But everyone I know can only talk about the virus and it's driving me insane. For the past three weeks, I haven't had a single conversation with friends or family that hasn't been about the latest news or the latest ways in which they're suffering. My group chats are a constant stream of bad news. I play D&amp;D with a group of friends every week, and last time we played no one could get into it, everyone was in a bad mood and kept interrupting the game to talk about the latest news alert or statistic. I cancelled our games until further notice, saying I have too much work to do, and have started avoiding calls and group hangouts, but now I just feel even more isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm talking about this here because I can't talk about it to anyone in my personal life - I'd feel too much like an asshole. My friends are cancelling their weddings, filing for unemployment, having to fire their employees, recovering from illness themselves, and the worst things that have happened to me are my struggling to focus on my classwork and the disappointment at some summer vacations that will likely be canceled. Those are so minor, they're not worth talking about, and I'm running out of ways to respond to their latest painful updates.

COVID19_support,Daituc,2020/04/01,"Never had serious anxiety... can't breathe... Yesterday I started having a mild asthma attack, I used my inhaler but it didn't work... again I used it, tried to remain calm, wasn't really thinking about it.  An hour later I realized I was still having troubles breathing... and shit hit the fan right then and there.  Tight chest, dry lungs, labored breathing, hard to take a deep breath, acid reflux set in a while later... and it's been like this ever since!

&amp;#x200B;

The acid reflux died down a couple of hours ago, and my breathing got easier when I put my head down on my desk, in my arms, tried to shallow breathe only and ended up dozing off for a few minutes... until some jackass telemarketer call woke my right back up.  Now, it's worse, the breathing, the chest pressure, the dryness, no cough though, and my temp only went up from 98.2° to 99° today, despite having serious chills.

&amp;#x200B;

I sent a message to my primary care provider, he responded quickly with ""it's definitely not the virus, it's anxiety""... and prescribed a medication for me that I wont get for who knows how long in the mail.  He said it's not the virus because aside from the tightness in the chest, dryness, shortness of breath... I didn't have enough ""key"" symptoms, like excessive &amp; uncontrollable dry coughing, no wheezing, no fever, fingertips &amp; lips aren't turning blue, and given the time time frame for possible exposure, it's just too unlikely for me to be infected... or so he says.  (That time frame for possible exposure is just below 2 paragraphs...)

&amp;#x200B;

The funny thing is though... I've never had any real anxiety in the past, and have only had two or three somewhat-worrying asthma attacks... and NOTHING that's lasted for 2 days straight.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been out of the house in a few weeks, but the person I live with went out on the 17th for groceries, although he's said he's been fine this entire time.  It's possible for someone to have the virus and not feel it, passing it on to others... and we do keep apart in the house, normally/most of the time...  it's not unreasonable to think I could have gotten it from him at any point since then.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do?  If it's anxiety, I'm screwed like this for a few days until I get meds, that aren't said to work quickly... this is bad, really bad for me.. .because I'm 44 and am just now getting anxiety issues?  HA!  That's why my mind thinks I'm sick....  I have several underlying health issues, including asthma, a history of smoking (not anymore, quit last July), high blood pressure, a history of having cancer (not serious/life threatening in any way), I'm pre-diabetic (not oeverweight)... and FFS I am tired!

&amp;#x200B;

I slept Monday night, about 6 hours... slept for 2 hours Tuesday night, woke up gasping for air, and slept for only a few minutes a few hours ago.  (To be fair, when I rested my head on my arms on my desk, it made breathing a noticeably easier.... when I woke up form the phone call, for a few minutes there I felt like normal... but then the tightness quickly set right back in, and is now at the worst it's ever been yet!)

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if it IS anxiety, then why when I am distracted, and truly calm, why is it still so hard to breath?  Why does leaning forward make it easier to breath, but breathing exercises don't help at all?  Why does it make zero difference if I use my inhaler... actually kinda makes it a bit worse, makes it ""dryer"" I think.  I tried talking to the person I live with... but every word came out like I was in distress, couldn't breathe.  So, distracting myself doesn't seem to help... which suggests it might not be anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I mention that I don't have any history of panic attacks or anxiety?  I mean, yeah, I DO have some mild anxiety, like hating being around people in a busy store kind of anxiety... but not bad enough where I can't do what I need to, not bad enough to freak out, never bad enough for any reason to have problems breathing.... NEVER.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that if the symptoms get worse, or some of the ""key"" symptoms develop... to go to the local ER....

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, never having issues like this before makes me worry even more that it's the virus.... what are YOUR thoughts on the matter?  Have YOU had tightness in your chest and difficulties breathing, lasting more than 2 days... from anxiety?  Without something like Xanax, which I've heard works wonders at times like this if it is anxiety... what else can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Thanks in advance... ask questions if you need/want to.

COVID19_support,-gunstreetgirl-,2020/04/01,"Feeling like every little thing is a symptom of the virus and man does it take a toll Venting but could also could use some advice on symptoms or just support. 

About 13 days ago I had a low grade fever (99) that only lasted a couple hours. And since then off and on I’ve had chest tightness and over the past few weeks I’ve had terrible diarrhea maybe 3 times. I’m not prone to stomach issues but I am prone to anxiety and have been super stressed. The chest tightness I’m willing to write off as anxiety but with the diarrhea I’m a bit scared. I know it’s not necessarily a common symptom but I have seen that those who get it tend to end up in more severe condition.

I’ve been self isolating with my husband except for picking up groceries. About 10 days ago I ran into the grocery store at a non-busy time and was in there for maybe 15 minutes. Then about 4 days ago I was in a vet office with just one person working because I needed to get my dog meds. Aside from that I’ve been very careful to wash hands, clean surfaces, and leave groceries for at least three days before using them. 

Of course I can’t get tested where I am and it just really sucks that stress and anxiety can manifest this way too. Any time I leave the house I feel like I have to reset the potential infection clock and keep track of how I feel for two weeks.  I have a grocery pickup tomorrow and being ultra careful and trying to sanitize everything is just so stressful.",4.841296798697776,5.503905037800688,5.46769397721107,83.14102007596314,69.06872852233677,8.325628504250316,28.717851329354314,8.371475516178862,1.9259030927835057,1150,39,228,16,19,372,170,291,0.134,0.7879999999999999,0.078,-0.9486,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,2,13,13,1,4,16,0,22,10,4,4,0,44,44,23,0,3,12,1,6,2,0,1,6,0,1,3,12,16,0,3,4,0,1,1,3,7,0,3,10,7,17,6,37,30,5,40,0,1,1,0,7,17,1,2,23,142,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703114272869916,0.26406039360898564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07940717233711687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0675248525362795,0.0,0.2278840700324678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06053007014491879,0.0,0.0844937921358701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10840578351974337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024782818181797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15855994581426214,0.10986940794946508,0.0,0.2561514573075876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08689481433279238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879470015851189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08366137016793992,0.0,0.08924106356693623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15062149702975164,0.14187451647584107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15563457126063465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977868009561974,0.1145745365269901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10363948322221747,0.0,0.0882590661492196,0.0,0.0,0.054570620176740144,0.08093969367458632,0.0,0.2102807752923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970222606459918,0.09952092490983012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995128515768967,0.0,0.11029574496648707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07362690849570376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672857063387011,0.07551926981488746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947895027524295,0.0,0.08670165228435096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361171804213238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994128649738019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10358764065722884,0.11217649483081968,0.0,0.08213888108578307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412305441455694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11268020365240815,0.0,0.3096204594564881,0.07465841969029145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06596801389834966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737013193104534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741563329975188,0.0,0.09699800438209157,0.0,0.0,0.1715201510218539,0.0,0.08192980238887645,0.0,0.07881673849852809,0.15929891874101262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228884996063685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Growlitheusedroar,2020/04/01,"Torn about if I should go stay with my parents please help. We live 10 minutes away from each other in neighboring suburbs in the DFW area of Texas.  I have been self quarantined for almost 3 weeks now, only going out to walk my dog outside.  They have also been home for 2 week, except to go to the grocery store.  Everyone seems healthy.

This isolation has definitely been rough.  I have panic disorder and have been having multiple panic attacks daily, which is making it nearly impossible to work from home.  My poor dog (a herding breed) is definitely getting frustrated being cooped up in my tiny apartment and would appreciate the freedom of my parents back yard. It would be much easier for us if she had access to a yard so I'm not forced to take the elevator multiple times daily.

Do yall think that I'm putting myself or my family at risk by temporarily moving back in with them?  I feel like I need to make a decision now, because the longer I wait the more risky it will be to go.  But I'm not sure how I'm going to survive mentally if I'm isolated for months.  I haven't been able to sleep for a few days because Ive been torn about what I should do.",5.063901018922851,5.80624476419214,6.080157205240173,78.66247743813683,68.60698689956331,9.425443959243085,29.677147016011645,9.558583805096642,2.6103377583697243,917,33,178,19,15,305,144,229,0.13699999999999998,0.7490000000000001,0.114,-0.5874,2,2,0,0,0,0,19.0,2,1,2,2,9,7,2,3,10,0,27,1,1,3,1,30,46,10,0,8,8,2,2,1,1,5,0,0,5,1,8,7,0,1,4,2,2,8,3,5,0,0,7,2,22,2,34,31,4,29,0,0,0,0,11,11,0,6,10,120,30,1,0.13071859508325426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13089579071394064,0.0,0.0,0.1045356132607508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14871127305630388,0.12281442307373633,0.2010290616833748,0.0,0.15936968455323516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843026797491424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498148348933818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12490721942437492,0.0,0.0,0.12322985778745325,0.0,0.06609524932841067,0.09338539044628713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06829507071995211,0.0,0.371451949985096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761791885457948,0.0,0.2622428180225516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06386250270639854,0.0,0.11542691433419433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17451135452919636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13173359850223493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433833546731136,0.13893317938928984,0.09609320806051326,0.09692618192492897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09941738196630516,0.0,0.30674021287099035,0.29029506067437943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143489763344036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13140829277689695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11900129951670965,0.1363680033381084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13081299848930458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393286296962423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320072887493855,0.0,0.09828411537272598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375919754381804,0.0,0.0,0.07622306400414099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15723837492905565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20970914430336055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951646940715626,0.0,0.0,0.1857174788948568,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,bubblegiraffe92,2020/04/01,"Stubborn grandma My grandma works in a nursing home and the director told her it was inevitable that an outbreak would occur there, they just need to be prepared. Which is heartbreaking in itself. But my grandmother is in her late 60s with severe asthma and lung issues, so contracting covid19 would be a death sentence. She seems to think she's invincible and I think she secretly has a death wish, she refuses to quit working. Asking her to quit seems to make her want to work even more. I don't know how to go about taking to her about my concerns. Or do I just let it go, seeming as she is an adult who can make her own choices. 

I feel like our entire family is just awaiting her death because of this. I want to visit her, but hesitant due to social distancing and not wanting to get her sick. But I also feel like I'll regret not seeing her if she does get sick.

COVID19_support,WrortomX,2020/04/01,"I am worried about my girlfriend! The past few days have been tough. There have been multiple cases in the area where my girlfriend lives, two deaths too. We don't stay together.

Since yesterday, she has changed a lot. By lot, I mean, A LOT. There's literally nothing I could do to make her feel at ease. The worst thing about her is she never speaks up, until somehow she reaches an emotional state where the only thing she can do is burst out, crying/being angry.

We are talking like usual over texts and calls, but things aren't normal. Nor do I expect it to be. But I am so worried about her mental health that I can't focus on my activities at a stretch.

Is there anything at all I can do to make her feel better? The last thing I would want to look at is her smile fading away.

Also, I wouldn't say I am fine. There's so much going on. I am constantly afraid I would end up losing a few I love when this ends, and that I'd end up being a completely different person than I was a month ago. I wouldn't even be surprised if I end up with depression.

I don't fear changes, but I don't know if I'd be able to handle such a blow.

Thanks for reading. I had to pour my heart out, somewhere. Can't even talk to anyone about this. Everyone is just so panicked and tensed all around.",2.3217045454545437,3.894391397727276,3.4824242424242438,91.46863636363638,76.31060606060606,6.466666666666668,22.227272727272727,7.1686216300943375,0.5515136363636359,995,27,219,11,22,322,147,264,0.11900000000000001,0.777,0.105,-0.5621,1,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,2,0,0,2,22,12,0,2,13,0,38,3,1,2,3,36,49,15,1,10,6,0,2,1,2,4,1,2,0,1,9,9,0,0,4,1,0,1,10,6,0,1,4,5,34,6,32,36,9,39,0,2,1,1,20,20,0,6,17,163,43,1,0.11036469430215264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783164247425104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825860615976568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07716956036302276,0.0,0.09082073972928148,0.09824797660288756,0.0,0.0,0.10369126328044924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760860341850268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11269469239506075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335024254708919,0.0,0.11571528219962812,0.11926502676467465,0.0,0.08811722794335973,0.0,0.0,0.07117609758153128,0.0,0.09505694948347332,0.0,0.0,0.1153076156179735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241454264081798,0.3910014446997305,0.0,0.0,0.1457896794247001,0.0,0.0,0.10545819498077684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12419096430135833,0.11160741105439068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06272279912729163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173125091574154,0.0,0.1307826941333359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060653549702358575,0.08996195603578097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053918614899992764,0.0,0.0974540470437328,0.0,0.09267854715527443,0.12346986272861883,0.0,0.2814843492506207,0.09960844553304464,0.0,0.1473385808851662,0.0,0.0,0.120219506613849,0.0,0.0,0.11122165380343936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809204605137648,0.0,0.08113074903656378,0.0,0.08512005601340733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081339677727597,0.10589790073518096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08393732324038118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535558873686564,0.0,0.09636619409993356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11039456055582172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877664346235436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129481560402293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763407963626042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17741392147950402,0.0,0.10160898254911,0.0,0.0,0.2932855955670357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10781026971590907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155111856725463,0.0,0.06509595615003969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22416140858716813,0.0,0.1567998246289528,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Fluxling,2020/04/01,"Essential Worker Girlfriend with Anxiety Hello,

My girlfriend has been suffering from anxiety and hypochondria for many years.  
This disease is boosting her anxiety even though she has no risk factors (some older family members who live with her do so it adds to that), and since she's an essential worker she has to keep going to work.

Yesterday she told me she cried all the way to work because she didn't want to be there.  
She spent her 9-hour shift in a constant state of heightened anxiety with her brain working overdrive against her. It's affecting her physically (e.g. panic-induced hyperventilation and heart rate changes) and she's at the point where she says she doesn't care about losing her job, but she's a single mom with two dependents and can't afford losing her paycheck.

I'd love to help her myself but I'm located on the other side of the planet and don't have the means to aid her financially - and even if I did, I'm afraid that if she quit her job now it's going to have lasting effects after this crisis is over (e.g. lose benefits from her 15 years of working there or even being unable to come back).

Every shift of hers is a non-stop nerve-wracking experience for her.  
I do my best to support and help her but it's not enough.  
I don't know what to do.  
I don't think she can take this much longer and I'm terrified for her every time she goes to work.  
She knows all of the advice about not watching stuff about it and all that, but for one, it's what **everyone** talks about, online and at work, and for another, she's already heard enough to see her place of work as a virus hub (which may actually be true) so she's in an unending state of duress every second she's there.

I know there are anxiety help lines available, but they're not going to tell her anything new, it's not going to help her, and besides she has a huge aversion to talking on the phone in general so doing that would only stress her out more. Text is better, but like I said, saying the same things to her over and over never helps her.

I'm looking for any information that can give her some concrete help.  
A way for her to be able to stay home for a while without repercussions, even without pay, would be best, but I don't know much about how things are over there (Massachusetts).  
I called the SAMHSA disaster distress helpline but they couldn't help me either.

If anyone has any idea or suggestion how an essential worker with acute anxiety verging on panic is supposed to get through this, I'd very much appreciate any help I can get.

COVID19_support,xxlilly1,2020/04/01,"I (F24) live in the UK - anyone else managing symptoms at home? I think I have covid-19 but I live in the UK so testing is not available unless I need to be admitted to the hospital.

I started off with a scratchy throat Wednesday night which didn't ease the next day. I felt extremely lethargic and woke up to a fever on Friday and severe pain in my legs. I spent most of the weekend in bed. I've had no cough maybe except a cough to clear my throat here and there. 

I also noticed I couldnt smell anything on sunday night. My taste has been a bit off since then too

I'm currently on Day 7 today. My energy levels are back and I'm not feeling the need to nap in between. I was getting tired talking before but I'm feeling better today and have been doing some work on my laptop to keep myself busy. 

I feel like I'm over the worst but the feeling in my chest is still there. I feel tired walking up and down still and need to sit down to catch my breath. That makes me anxious and scared that it could get worse.

Anybody else going through the same at home? Any tips or advice?",2.061199095022623,3.9501860135746623,3.0290022624434383,93.02739479638012,78.00452488687783,5.5059728506787335,22.814705882352943,6.2581,0.36043330316742095,843,26,180,6,20,268,133,221,0.192,0.746,0.062,-0.9847,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,2,9,5,0,1,13,0,15,13,5,1,1,36,38,16,0,5,8,0,6,1,0,0,7,0,3,0,4,9,1,1,8,2,1,3,5,3,0,0,8,8,22,2,33,27,5,40,0,0,0,0,2,20,0,3,17,116,26,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12270044817833105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100414107886791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538835508248255,0.0,0.0,0.1418524589502208,0.0,0.0877978125537324,0.12865595398575155,0.10332911377532734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655156390532173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10684637809889057,0.0,0.0,0.1110518425432898,0.13708421697337633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002532582190619,0.0,0.0,0.16195778865066138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2097865203936666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3174466236837625,0.08970350274727251,0.12056187840946113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13120482839285422,0.0,0.07136135718173799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519034212366323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11160774435677304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06134460818329088,0.0,0.2217519994852312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381546457978324,0.0,0.12614669691291525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793140763785665,0.0,0.0,0.1335395662840259,0.23566807699337544,0.0,0.0,0.14295633239719616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336097771469751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571224808805193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418524589502208,0.0,0.10386848220753032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887539639945467,0.0,0.20055238838907935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050988260787635,0.0,0.10092421253409062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804568398876352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886364827925765,0.23804145595654844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141265411319127,0.0,0.12796123644491236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’ve have shortness of breath, slight chest tightness, diarrhea and exhaustion. I went to the er finally on Monday to get checked but the xrays showed nothing and my bloodwork showed I wasn’t even fighting anything since my white blood cell count wasn’t high. I can talk but not for long and I feel short of breath but my pulse ox is 95-97 sitting so I’m not in a danger zone. I’ve just had this for about the whole month of march and I want this to end, it sucks. I can talk but I have to breathe constantly and it’s hard.

COVID19_support,tbessie,2020/04/01,"How to deal with those who shame others/me for not being 100% compliant with social distancing? I live in San Francisco, where we've been under a ""Stay at Home"" order for awhile now.

I generally follow social distancing rules pretty well, but I'm not 100% - eg. I go out more than once per week for groceries (maybe 2 or 3 times), I get a beer at the liquor store few times per week, I do a few other errands (eg. I dropped my bicycle off at my local bike shop to be fixed recently), and I visit my girlfriend in a nearby city several times per week.  She is as close to 100% social distancing as her work allows.

Other than that, I work from home, talk to friends and family online or on the phone, wash my hands after venturing out, wear a mask when I go out, use hand sanitizer, disinfect objects brought into my apartment, and meet up with nobody socially (aside from my girlfriend, as mentioned).

For some people, I'm ""social distancing"".  However, a couple of friends of mine seem to be meeting the guidelines 100% - at least, their rage at anyone who isn't 100% is frightening to behold, so I presume they are close to perfect in their habits. A friend just described my behavior above as ""the opposite of social distancing"". I disagreed, and told her the opposite would be not changing my habits at all, and that I'm 90% there, and I feel that's sufficient.

I haven't found many articles or discussions about small differences in degree of social distancing like this, and the righteous anger displayed by the 100 percenters at those who are close but not perfect.  Most articles have been about people who are social distancing vs those who have been mostly ignoring the rules.

Are you on one side or the other of a situation like this? How have you dealt with it? Do you believe that those couple extra errands, or visiting my girlfriend, are terrible things like these friends of mine do? Or that a small amount of wiggle room is allowed?",9.085561497326204,7.580210928374657,8.535994166261549,71.89564900340304,60.92837465564738,12.067347269486305,37.330902608977475,10.966923227221727,3.9960657591962403,1529,58,275,32,17,486,189,363,0.059000000000000004,0.813,0.128,0.9805,2,0,1,0,0,0,61.0,0,3,3,4,11,15,2,1,18,0,24,6,3,5,3,50,37,23,0,1,14,0,3,3,7,1,1,0,3,0,22,18,2,1,4,4,2,6,6,5,1,1,6,3,33,10,54,26,11,49,0,0,0,0,39,30,0,10,13,189,55,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06280592935717262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10119911622146904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09502021762119868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19877361380858455,0.0,0.0,0.0926029780344066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938453183713691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467659008093137,0.0,0.04541691789770628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09848565487434924,0.2775863368052384,0.0,0.046928510766247135,0.0,0.10209631032083538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18019843568808203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13164810201775626,0.0,0.07931484856731286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09106584267943003,0.09023870076608663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565795315132064,0.06086600108357059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12454312221496112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138169989283723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08868881029588485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177096394653569,0.0,0.10147377544874901,0.0,0.0,0.10096417123689587,0.0,0.7325012208780097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09573875581091357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07219586432139312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059674029209209625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571285383577322,0.0,0.0,0.08582917814925549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07757773727899223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21615039853847665,0.0,0.08076114901422228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13078359311221086,0.0,0.0,0.0638072749315668,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,DavidSmithies,2020/04/01,"Some support needed to calm my anxious mind Hi guys

Thanks for all being here in this difficult time. I know everyone just wants to be told ""you're going to be ok"" and I know that's impossible to say. We're all doing whatever we can to avoid catching it.

My own personal story is (based in UK):

- I last went into work on Tuesday March 17 and only for an hour between 9-10am. Since then, I've been at home.

- My wife was in London with family and travelled back to our house in Bristol on March 24, as she was afraid she'd get stuck there with the lockdown. She has no symptoms and neither do her family. She's the only person I've been anywhere near since the 17th.

- We only leave the house for a 30 min walk in a deserted park once a day. We've been to a supermarket once a week, and we wash our hands before going in, and after we leave.


The number of cases in our area is 66 out of a population of 300,000. Number of deaths is 1. 
That's confirmed cases so there could be a lot more out there.


Looking at our actions and the numbers, I should be feeling safe. I can't think how I'd catch it. I think I'm doing the right things. I can't do anymore.


But I'm pretty anxious every day. I wake up with a sore throat or runny nose and assume that's the start. I have a heavy chest and assume that's the start. I feel a bit dizzy or get a bit hot out of nowhere and think the worst.

I assume if I get it, I'll die alone. I assume there won't be enough ventilators for me.

I see the 13 year old and 19 year old with no underlying conditions die and can think of no reason why that wouldn't be me as well.

My wife is 7 months pregnant and I want to be around to see the baby and to raise it. We've also got a 6 year old daughter. I can't die now, it's very bad timing!


How do other people on here manage anxiety? How do you quieten that voice that says ""it happened to them, why not you?"". And do you take any reassurance at all in numbers or probability?

COVID19_support,fennekii,2020/04/01,"My uncle has it. Hey... I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. I hope it is.

Basically, my uncle (60s, diabetic) contracted coronavirus, has had it for probably weeks but the test finally came back positive on Friday. He's been in the hospital ever since. The treatments they're trying aren't working that well, and today they called my aunt (also 60s, probably has corona too, all alone in her house) to tell her to prepare herself, and that they're trying a last resort, prone ventilation.

My cousin (same uncle's daughter) is a nurse and has connections, so she had a doctor call the hospital to ask about him. As of right now (Wednesday 4/1 12 am EST) the prone ventilation made his ""numbers improve a little"". He is apparently ""stable"" right now, but still in ""critical condition"".

My entire family are going out of their minds with worry, me included. I feel sick, this is my closest uncle, he's like a second father to me. He has three young grandchildren that need him. I don't want him to give up, and I don't want to give up ON him, either. I'm not religious, so I'm not praying, but I want to hope for the best.

I'm just a mess right now and need someone to give me even the slightest ounce of hope. I'm so scared.",3.541503451251081,5.053206209016392,5.038912855910269,81.80927955133734,72.97540983606558,8.415530629853322,25.547023295944786,8.99025400887824,1.9597819672131145,961,31,190,20,19,323,135,244,0.122,0.767,0.11199999999999999,0.5255,1,1,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,0,2,2,15,8,0,1,14,0,18,3,0,1,2,30,39,14,0,9,8,4,1,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,9,8,0,0,1,0,0,2,6,2,1,2,5,1,25,6,25,34,4,30,1,0,0,0,27,15,0,4,13,122,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12247210329432955,0.0,0.09456507344641536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11054847851181064,0.0,0.0,0.09092751929207826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240968553402201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2414944519760225,0.13524734333275396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210346423237184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810349801791341,0.10696456362403756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11147627290801183,0.0,0.05979112679627858,0.0,0.0,0.12953790478558372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34031065260576937,0.06720462019873844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3523489972023517,0.0,0.1364454764333598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096390135195507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057771338116499635,0.11851830630108265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11189170865096808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11939953713464214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17536284959171802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123546854117616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11325152066727405,0.0,0.25498859432881843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4039419407953315,0.0,0.0,0.11838961898624235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781823346771848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10019346761884236,0.0,0.0,0.13237202124716946,0.0,0.0,0.0944351931067751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10335635820698273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120878741023192,0.0,0.0,0.1605689795214565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2092420493220765,0.0,0.0948536102426926,0.0,0.10632161591851183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608794652531923,0.12008936572443238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Louugrant,2020/04/01,"Anxious about walking my dog in NYC Hi friends. I live in NYC, which feels like a not so great place to live right now. I’m lucky enough to to share my home with my girlfriend and our dog, who we love very much. 

We take turns taking the dog out and for the most part we have been good about keeping our distance from others. We also wear gloves and masks (not surgical grade...just bandanas to try to keep from touching our faces). And of course, we are aggressively hand washing and disinfecting high-touch surfaces. 

But I live in a big apartment building in a big city and there are tons of people out and about (still). And sometimes, despite my best effort, people get a bit too close. I am now finding myself more and more anxious when either of us takes the dog out. 

Is what we are doing enough? It doesn’t always feel like it to me, but that may be my anxiety speaking. I don’t want our pup to suffer with fewer trips outside. Her daycare already closed and she’s clearly bored, so she’s feeling the social distance in her world too. If anyone (city dweller with a pup or otherwise) has some advice or encouragement for me, I’d truly appreciate it!

Thanks!",4.660066371681413,5.8580786681415935,4.642643805309736,86.93529314159296,69.84070796460179,6.888938053097348,27.841814159292035,6.9077264865688965,1.2462132743362828,913,31,181,7,16,282,143,226,0.077,0.759,0.16399999999999998,0.9586,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,11,0,0,2,13,14,1,0,9,0,13,5,3,0,1,44,27,19,0,2,8,0,5,2,2,1,1,1,1,0,8,24,0,2,4,0,0,2,4,3,0,0,1,6,27,11,28,24,12,23,0,1,0,1,24,17,0,7,6,123,35,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13006041494128534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14687536012724348,0.10643726841758523,0.11074699743280858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018185016804417,0.3007224495984447,0.0,0.09306420719082778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396766249973863,0.0,0.1453069683620534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2750486443336989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20189285472542334,0.19016841359928088,0.0,0.0,0.12164784170329808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102830069653429,0.0,0.06953745759051093,0.0,0.0,0.11163507715307858,0.0,0.14673942378697966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14062381980831512,0.13350669853931182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23660467027155144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13004850940941207,0.0,0.3525800943920541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1201248389836031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09784128356267947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14413060089171925,0.0,0.18454478818538586,0.0,0.13905757373853564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136637323131662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13567517845259827,0.0,0.0,0.13163589798379155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062910822193554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3002161400158782,0.0,0.0,0.12253742745087184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036382540614868,0.14477083420227846,0.0,0.0,0.16009877013035664,0.0,0.0,0.1098185983911234,0.07850379763644716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,fluffernuttersndwch,2020/04/01,"today really got to me. I was doing so good up until now. I’ve been working from home and I’m very grateful I can do that. It took some getting used to but I’ve been doing okay. But yesterday my grandfather died (not from coronavirus) and we can’t even have much of a service for him. and today my job announced we would all be getting a slight pay cut for a while so that we hopefully can keep our jobs. Which again I’m grateful for but I’m the only one in my house working now, I live with my mom and sister. What will they tell us in a couple of weeks? I am so nervous. I know I am not the only one feeling like this but it still gets to me. I worry about my family, the older and vulnerable ones especially, constantly. I’ve got a pressure in my chest that I’m sure is from stress (I am fine when I talk, walk etc) but I feel it and then that worries me too. Or the fact that I can’t find simple household items in store (seriously we will need toilet paper and other stuff very soon) and everything’s out of stock. I can’t sleep peacefully anymore.",0.6501847662141778,2.8027394389140285,2.791295248868781,91.4514375942685,84.47511312217193,5.8552790346908,20.068061840120663,7.1686216300943375,0.4604704374057321,820,24,180,12,24,277,131,221,0.125,0.747,0.128,-0.0412,2,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,6,0,1,2,12,11,1,3,9,1,20,2,2,1,3,35,37,21,1,3,8,2,2,1,0,3,0,0,1,0,13,14,0,1,4,0,2,2,5,5,0,3,6,2,29,6,21,27,5,23,0,0,0,0,12,6,0,3,16,129,42,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298779768609903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415221583956816,0.0,0.0,0.14490569395118796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13591669032033907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1460559700631121,0.08649840889529416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11769917110190388,0.0,0.12345823786162627,0.0,0.1324354853542846,0.09355846021022036,0.0,0.0,0.1196958479302394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20526492289546985,0.0,0.0,0.10984375087546798,0.20948271676873964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13136441438069948,0.13007367748055573,0.0,0.15111124228698514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25991687985577794,0.11640402425504046,0.0,0.0,0.0719726603941869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06398085813881428,0.0,0.11564083332858832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15337976931718114,0.0,0.0,0.09627129618281098,0.09710581378537872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2662273917364673,0.1992032614619463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389687646776267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13105543228606606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045855071124012,0.0,0.15001521569892087,0.0,0.14991884563270916,0.0,0.0,0.12342905496492852,0.0,0.0,0.10526137367479377,0.11446555866250208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24827115333766406,0.0,0.1455023273838296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15752978248542146,0.11310812979836075,0.0,0.2161128396342039,0.0,0.0,0.1050488975805604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19068212278521496,0.2659942083010429,0.0,0.09303083317684904,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,ScaredThrowaway2562,2020/04/01,"My brother might be Covid positive and at this point I don't know what to do. So my brother lives on the east coast with our parents. Sunday night he was starting to get a scratchy throat and went to our barn house an hour away from where they live to isolate himself, however the thing that terrifies me the most is taht our folks are part of the high at risk category, and my brother works in a high risk environment (A group home for kids with behavioral issues), which his girlfriend also works at. NOT TO MENTION his son, my nephew he's still been picking up for visits. So basically my brother has been putting himself at risk the past month or so, and now he's sick. I want to be angry, but I'm more terrified and am going completely numb to all this. With the news reports of the deaths coming from NY and other areas, I just got this feeling my parents will die while mybrother and I will be the only ones left. I can't blame him, because he wouldn't have known he had it, if it IS turned out he's positive (still getting test results back). Damn this virus! Damn it all to hell! At this point, I don't care whether or not I do get infected, because if I lose either of them, I'll probably end up living a reckless life intentionally...to the point I may put myself at risk of dying. I'm too scared to kill myself, so that's not an option. I jsut don't know what the fuck to do.

COVID19_support,AmbersAmbers,2020/04/01,"My long distance significant other is working as COVID-19 nurse and I am so afraid of losing her My long distance girlfriend of four years is an oncology nurse but will be asked to volunteer to be a COVID nurse (her hospital is setting up floors just for COVID patients and she will be pulled to those floors if she volunteers) and she will volunteer because she feels like that's something she has to do, especially because she lives alone, doesn't interact with anyone with compromised immune system, and is in her 20s and generally healthy. While I feel so lucky to be with someone like her and have immense respect for her selflessness in stepping up to do this (she's kind of a hypochondriac and struggles with anxiety too, so this won't be easy for her mental health), I am so afraid of losing her. I know that the statistics show that it is very unlikely that she will die or even be really ill if she catches the virus (she likely will just stay at home and she is allowed to do that for two weeks), I am still just overwhelmed by anxiety and the worst case scenario that I will never get to see her again. I am currently living in Canada and she is in the US and with the travel ban in place I can't even visit her if she gets really sick. Somehow, understanding and respecting her decision and knowing that the risk is really low, don't really reassure me that everything will be okay. I had a breakdown earlier because I really can't imagine not having her in this world - she is planning to move to where I live soon and we were going to get married and start our life together. I know that many people here already are dealing with the fear of losing their loved ones or the pain of having lost them and I really cannot imagine what they're going through right now, and it makes me feel kind of silly and privileged to be in a place where I can just worry instead of having to deal with it. But I'm wondering if anyone here has a significant other/ family member or a loved one on the frontlines, and how they're coping with the anxiety.",7.904371859296483,6.911382778894472,7.884567839195981,73.97820854271356,62.91959798994975,11.477587939698491,35.22663316582914,10.686352973137794,3.6194408040200994,1638,61,307,35,20,530,194,398,0.165,0.7290000000000001,0.106,-0.9796,2,1,1,0,0,0,27.0,3,0,2,6,22,27,0,6,17,1,47,8,0,3,1,61,68,35,1,4,14,0,3,3,1,8,6,0,1,0,19,28,0,1,11,2,0,8,8,13,0,4,3,4,48,14,47,49,1,43,0,6,1,2,39,20,0,10,15,236,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927538368949183,0.10577679068641074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21998314075810066,0.0,0.0,0.13404608037580582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896101424352502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17529432757924104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19764162975834448,0.0,0.0,0.09948086541236432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266207491282436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614700204911617,0.0,0.09036220876048084,0.10786190762507944,0.1453993250935482,0.06847780479663577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15023859189269753,0.0,0.10895157797531242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10188785550693263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09614893944356767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996334717325288,0.15803583485962375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06770420650784445,0.14048762788014624,0.0,0.25392135762181894,0.16965477442570062,0.0,0.3217068569287982,0.10463548741410764,0.0,0.17302316655971894,0.0,0.06398299783904758,0.09718046840670856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09659784683968292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187716828648788,0.0,0.0,0.07392817722616966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12990571044659532,0.0,0.10199494956366972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06645279172504563,0.0,0.20029314458134045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3684374828464304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818584193503257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638287977270893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08121641315440514,0.07379275603416856,0.0,0.0,0.06784564548178171,0.10216714478920257,0.07654877949581533,0.0,0.0,0.10020695643419146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363500330760452,0.09978693988580382,0.1153000345501066,0.0,0.0,0.07908922834592047,0.0,0.0,0.07688794670690376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039491005940029,0.0697825357159292,0.0973439464060606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06172655210311378

COVID19_support,FarcicalTeeth,2020/04/02,"Asthmatic friend wants to return to student nursing and I'm v worried about her safety A dear, dear friend of mine is selfless to a fault and I'm getting increasingly concerned for her wellbeing. In the past she's struggled with undervaluing herself to detrimental ends and I think is still very much undervaluing herself now. She feels helpless and has an incredibly strong drive to try to contribute, and I'd like to find other ways for her to help that don't put her at such high personal risk.

&amp;#x200B;

She started nursing school last year (she's a CNA, I think?). She took a break to go traveling in South America until mid-March when her trip got cut short and she had to return to the states. She's got hella asthma and is planning on returning to school once she's out of quarantine, and I'm so scared of losing her. Any advice for convincing her to take care of herself would be greatly, greatly appreciated.",6.510125391849531,7.334998643678162,6.583688610240332,76.03471786833856,65.43678160919539,9.775548589341692,34.20898641588297,9.800150414767053,3.3237080459770105,740,32,133,15,11,236,109,174,0.11,0.718,0.172,0.9163,0,1,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,3,6,17,1,3,7,0,8,1,0,0,0,16,23,11,0,2,0,0,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,2,10,0,0,4,1,0,7,1,7,0,0,4,1,21,10,28,17,2,30,0,2,0,0,22,8,0,0,13,80,23,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15116888076421087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16761498061115052,0.1879747359034934,0.10519979559777576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15772469735359287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13701631684750273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821984600236648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14139096885067748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23903824304162385,0.0,0.08082320543027502,0.0,0.08791831370737822,0.0,0.2474518940595713,0.3411096984101889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10369066142409007,0.16344669866544542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260993383989731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557752149779694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17306724629351486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137206684707342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647480875133487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14767653596892727,0.0,0.1350761350186238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15551399728247206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15487946559252824,0.31312482570614625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094958853096822,0.0,0.12354184739123265,0.0,0.0,0.16172370873672176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631347860925464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19824818272810596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1718749262782968,0.1050296383752646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12764187022911574,0.09124475905908208,0.12279189762426615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15710310537368255,0.0,0.1098928648178893,0.0,0.1879747359034934,0.09962029871850182

COVID19_support,Physical-Shower,2020/04/02,"I’m beside myself - did I get my mom sick? I’ve been panicking for three days straight. I’m at home self-quarantining (I’ve had a dry/sore throat and cough for about 3 weeks) and on Friday I mentioned to my mom that I was out of some supplies. She immediately came over to bring them to me, and she sat on the porch of my building while taking to me on the phone through a window. She touched her face while we were taking. On Sunday night/Monday she was having GI issues. 

My mom has immunodeficiency and angioedema. She took one of the shots she takes when she has a flare-up and has been feeling better, but I’m terrified it’s just a band-aid and soon she will feel worse. In addition, my parents cat was sick too and I’ve heard covid can be transferred to cats. 

I feel like I just seriously hurt or killed my mom just by telling her I needed something. I didn’t even ask for her to come over, but I should have told her to stay home. I don’t know what to do - I don’t know if I could live with myself if anything happened to her.",1.6020232558139542,3.4894950976744217,2.9271511627907003,93.22328488372095,79.41860465116278,5.7883720930232565,20.51744186046513,6.742157984588678,0.09551627906976767,806,21,185,8,20,261,127,215,0.147,0.815,0.037000000000000005,-0.9803,1,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,1,1,8,5,1,0,7,0,22,5,2,0,0,30,44,15,1,5,8,5,4,1,0,2,3,1,4,0,3,13,0,0,5,0,0,4,3,3,0,2,14,5,36,2,28,26,1,22,0,1,0,0,26,10,0,4,8,120,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898069588123267,0.0,0.1238065471906202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712581901724012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15146754455732908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407890625048815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057366065176016,0.0,0.0,0.08540803199431471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08747044322346079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20088561310664144,0.09460983255540224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06919053584608018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11710965716035275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2656812696654187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14177177238286384,0.0,0.0,0.13822516400191012,0.0,0.0,0.14651698325055496,0.0,0.14556292040635785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469984928848696,0.0,0.1169403585010022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.620413557892203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09819704986323773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427896693072465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08973971602800825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470506625865659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13815602098010954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195303884124113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411554662109272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987183644196824,0.0,0.11575187657093215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12654496659729755,0.14713742401568122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10622939483927843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13496007160103335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If a hospital has a high score of 5 then your probably going to get good service when they are packed but if you start with a hospital that has a low score in normal times than who knows...gobluehealth.com,8.462653721682848,9.07770945631068,8.404029126213594,65.38559061488677,61.23300970873787,12.69190938511327,39.4967637540453,12.161744961471696,5.296625889967638,466,23,76,15,6,151,72,103,0.026000000000000002,0.8220000000000001,0.152,0.8705,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,3,1,3,1,7,0,0,9,0,6,1,0,0,0,11,15,9,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,4,8,15,14,1,16,0,1,2,1,7,9,0,4,5,53,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845792715009982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14167666940341275,0.0,0.30822766306568583,0.22744699716774594,0.0,0.2989691247376312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28650910055628004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277169737595757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447441665186868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010712997051104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2656919066779625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18375380280822826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976664574728649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2923702950256806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21608972506946206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19193760333394214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20388830371619449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581231225912614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Rtstevie,2020/04/02,"Telling my Dad to wash his hands....am I doing the right thing? To be upfront, part of the reason for this post is to gripe, other is to look for affirmation, other part is to make sure I am not crazy.

My Dad is your typical stubborn 70 year old man. But we love each other.

I am living with my parents. We have ample hand soap, and my mother and I wash our hands frequently. He does not. It especially bugs me after he leaves the house to get the mail, walk the dog, etc. and does not wash his hands when he comes back in. My firm, personal rule is if you leave the house, wash your hands first thing when you come back inside.

He told me I am getting on his nerves. 

Am I being unreasonable? I may be bugging him, but I love him, and one of the few things we can do during this time to help stop COVID's spread is washing our hands.",1.7467635658914735,3.394869761627909,2.945953488372094,94.36493798449614,78.12790697674419,5.98201550387597,19.024806201550387,6.742157984588678,-0.1162035658914724,637,13,148,6,15,205,101,172,0.039,0.861,0.1,0.9123,1,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,5,4,0,1,4,4,1,0,7,0,18,12,5,2,1,23,27,9,0,1,6,4,5,0,0,1,5,0,0,2,9,11,0,2,1,0,0,3,3,1,0,2,1,6,29,3,15,22,5,18,0,0,1,2,30,3,0,2,11,99,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2271297889496865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544446133457385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584899408873052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16471397145676495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562548195562048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15432440333784314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09899384323344924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34083006450334785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3127658744218678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13041343610871192,0.0,0.1240228410694813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2665929233617645,0.0,0.09858456979212543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15497635786675856,0.0,0.1000789194821248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16399284589000568,0.3198688844266092,0.0,0.0,0.12895766649538667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14144669395830545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.151850453700555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612689820842224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347588893640088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13919656846374526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12908802532461364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2943570593475948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08611953065585418,0.0,0.0,0.14112462222419406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09510785348233487
COVID19_support,Temporary_Definition,2020/04/02,"My boyfriend won’t be hearing back from unemployment until May 15th and I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend had a new job lined up to start on March 25th, so he put in two weeks notice at his old job. A week later we went into a stay at home order, and the job he was supposed to be starting shut down. His boss that he put the two weeks into let him go early, and now he’s out of work. He filed for unemployment, but didn’t hear back after a week. He called 18 times before getting ahold of someone, and they told him that because this was a special case he wouldn’t get an answer until May 15th, and even then he might not get unemployment at all. 

I’m so scared, and I don’t know what to do. This leaves us with just my income for a month and a half, and no guarantee he’ll get unemployment. If we cut out every non-essential, cut our food shopping in half, and don’t use the heat, we’re still in the negatives by about $200. Our landlord is only providing us a discount of 5% off our rent, which really isn’t much help. 

I really just don’t know what to do, and I don’t want to upset my boyfriend further by bringing up these worries to him. He feels so defeated right now, and like he’s a burden because of this. I want to cheer him up, but I’m just so overwhelmed. If you could provide any advice I would really appreciate it.",5.335172004744958,4.339680476868331,6.203544483985766,83.95233926453145,68.07473309608541,9.343867141162516,29.053618030842234,8.447377352677275,1.7562524792408059,1038,29,235,13,15,345,152,281,0.139,0.7709999999999999,0.09,-0.9497,13,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,7,1,1,2,14,10,2,3,14,0,24,1,0,2,1,42,46,22,0,7,8,0,1,1,0,7,0,2,3,0,11,18,1,0,5,1,3,5,12,7,0,4,6,3,25,3,38,29,2,48,0,2,0,0,31,19,0,5,23,150,36,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10782000112873262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07503291697837315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1696846243645772,0.0,0.1345207744197182,0.0,0.09388862696312336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11266637341675187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809508502062102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728765220139672,0.0,0.0929636482913503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05578968264916273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13341989100303575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305860321692124,0.0,0.06270703755458391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2487155477975155,0.0,0.0739565390394242,0.0,0.11067696803597253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3284772250471149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819149243301087,0.0,0.0,0.11683091011696732,0.0,0.11282701800402875,0.0,0.05390506572519716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11705007903274565,0.0,0.0,0.08806990945657958,0.0,0.08111036174171146,0.0,0.0,0.1065641243204156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561936121067244,0.11578007971396705,0.0,0.0,0.08391623068326398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22183824180961395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2120540473365386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094227161675857,0.0,0.0,0.11046654622687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09348814885225222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1561941375499889,0.11760451944244114,0.08811523944498227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433836916490683,0.0,0.0,0.10543169445734772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2155663562822009,0.0,0.2654435568878735,0.0952957079382456,0.0,0.0,0.13015919645639534,0.0,0.3540226182120762,0.0,0.0,0.10228346810589097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032662158935229,0.11205253960395872,0.0,0.0783802112498649,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,tastill11,2020/04/02,"Partner will not stop meeting large group of friends for 6-7 hours at a time 2-3 times a week to socialise.. Based in UK.

Partner is refusing to stop meeting with 7-10 friends to drink and play card games. He has a child that he sees 3-4 times a week, who stays at our house then goes back to their mothers who also has other children.

He is putting us all at risk and there is nothing I can do about it. 


He is calling me controlling and horrible for being upset that he is still meeting with other people..saying he can't stand to be stuck at home with me. But I have been giving him space, doing y own things around the house, watching films together.  I have been going on walks.

He has said he is wearing gloves but they are playing card games so are sitting in close distance to each other. They are also betting with money so handling cash around 7-10 people.

I feel so upset. I am feeling like he can't care for me or his loved ones if this is how he is continuing to behave. He is aware of the risks and what is going on as we have spoken about it a lot.

No one wants to be stuck at home.

I am so angry and I don't know how to deal with this anger, I feel disappointed and let down as we are all meant to be doing our bit to keep ourselves and others safe.

I don't have anywhere else to go and I am at a lose of what else I can say to him?

I don't feel I am over reacting?",2.3103759630200287,3.2598090745762747,3.719545454545458,92.27833204930666,75.20338983050847,6.312788906009245,23.57858243451464,6.351523495107088,0.4072033898305079,1067,30,247,7,22,352,155,295,0.141,0.7709999999999999,0.08800000000000001,-0.9615,0,0,1,0,0,0,29.0,5,0,3,2,15,15,1,4,8,0,43,3,1,4,2,44,61,23,0,2,5,1,4,1,4,1,0,2,2,4,15,19,1,6,6,6,3,5,7,7,0,2,6,8,27,8,42,49,6,36,0,2,2,1,44,16,0,4,13,168,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20194781336874465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22480486500025415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708982939924746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13784844803058588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12893046750731868,0.0,0.12873536818011344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416166981327815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13017345388595405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12369142437340075,0.0,0.0,0.2109560596579854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25537308596717473,0.0902035909722595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951037265781122,0.0,0.0,0.12112469162794395,0.21527756923547325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533077580901138,0.0,0.12434538372422377,0.2913852292980807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11222994657921498,0.0,0.0,0.06939182629550551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911430214326206,0.0,0.06168659835401291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14125800236323285,0.0,0.1073458089095316,0.11395890238763015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12115447107275587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17112057848357234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875361069405259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12693098819164828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010672932621128,0.20082165729324009,0.0,0.0,0.10061668981303568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13458146572802526,0.10083522413682053,0.21112603586157003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388471574389253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2208780427609784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15188099540474995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07447424435783262,0.0,0.2025639962041297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My mom only has 3 months worth of money saved up for us to live, that is if we can get a 6 month rent freeze + Emergency Benefit $2000 from the government. However, I think with the current economy and COVID19 my mom won't be getting a job anytime soon. Honestly, it'll be a miracle if she can get one before 3 months. Moreover, I don't know if our house will even sell because of social distancing.

COVID19_support,suraaura,2020/04/02,"When, if ever, is it acceptable to break social distancing? Struggling. I live in an area with very few cases (that we know of anyway). However, I have been taking this very seriously for a little over three weeks. My husband and I do not leave the house, we order takeout about once a week and purchase food only from local places and have it dropped off on the porch so we don't have contact with anyone else.

It is really important to me morally to stay away from others.

However. My best friend has a history of depression (once sending her to the hospital). Her mental health is taking a steep dive, but she is at least proactive enough to tell me that she just had a breakdown and is feeling like it was a precursor to a bigger one. I am really really lucky that our friendship is close enough that we reach out to each other when we feel ourselves slipping.

She and her husband work from home and have also been practicing self quarantine.

If I believe her mental health would be improved by a visit from me, at what point if at all do I go see her? I'm doing all of this in the name of public health, and I feel like supporting my friend is a facet of that right now.

I just feel so helpless.

I don't know how to handle this anymore.. When it first started i was able to stay strong and avoid crippling myself under depression and negative thoughts and wanting to just avoid the world. But lately it's been awful.. I can't hang out and talk to my friends via discord like i normally would because my mind is racing and i just feel like im being crushed. My sisters constantly reminds me that i would be at severe risk of covid-19 and that it'd probably end up killing me. Im pleading for hope at this point. I'm trapped in my own mind and i don't know how to escape this pressure anymore.",3.5619074675324685,5.198025142045456,4.398084415584417,85.92159090909092,73.14772727272727,7.301298701298702,30.185064935064936,7.957251820313856,2.065465584415584,699,31,137,10,14,225,110,176,0.182,0.711,0.107,-0.9348,0,3,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,0,2,9,12,1,4,2,1,15,0,0,4,0,36,28,19,1,8,5,1,1,2,1,2,0,1,0,0,12,10,0,2,6,0,0,1,5,6,0,1,4,3,16,6,19,19,1,20,0,1,1,0,6,10,0,5,9,86,28,1,0.1291764154597716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399625921813262,0.15696348384687828,0.0,0.0,0.09881960425532788,0.0,0.25621658679562553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07874474389213633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13959381434968454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125945735144548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144119625059256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531547697346485,0.09228365701512907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098773930002793,0.0,0.14163527207307555,0.09980137814826637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566026549034812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4185980864422164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14291456462802468,0.0,0.14198395936315214,0.0,0.1457166231672391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621814328173322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847565507463426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309646102360874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2608627111153714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12475938700024147,0.0,0.0,0.12656546040063746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12211346611685972,0.0,0.12371529835115284,0.0,0.1392740240381011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10272627033528256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11759735710770702,0.0,0.1459325808647186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09143173172978793,0.13768487141113794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382710963091346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255164472943244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3197522136088417,0.07619159668369223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18352643858040268,0.0,0.15696348384687828,0.0
COVID19_support,Lady-DarkElf,2020/04/02,"Having trouble with lost appetite Hi, I've been experiencing a lot of trouble motivating myself to eat throughout the day. Even though I suffer from very severe contamination OCD, I wouldn't personally rate my anxiety as being very high at this time, it was a lot worse in Jan/Feb. However I've been steadily losing weight over the last 21 days (the time I've been isolated in my home), I am 5'5"" and was 120lbs, I'm not sure what I weigh now, but I can tell from the fit of my clothes that I've certainly lost weight.

There is enough nutritious food in my home for me to eat, but I just can't seem to find the initiative to actually eat anything other than one small to medium sized meal a day and occasionally chewing on ice-shards for entertainment.

I'm not sure if this is how my anxiety is manifesting, or if it's just a brutal combination of not eating enough leading to being too fatigued to find the motivation to make and eat food. I also think it's possible that I'm experiencing hesitancy to actually consume the food I have in my home because I am worried about running out and having to leave my safe home for a grocery store.

I'd really appreciate some advice in this matter, I want to get back to eating properly and I want to go back to my healthy weight. :)",13.285149402390438,7.009836135458169,12.959397410358564,58.03240288844623,58.16334661354581,16.374701195219124,46.912848605577686,13.023866798666859,5.669864143426294,1014,39,197,24,8,347,140,251,0.152,0.718,0.13,0.0532,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,6,12,13,1,0,12,0,18,16,0,5,3,37,30,14,0,5,10,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,4,1,10,7,15,1,6,1,1,3,5,8,0,1,7,5,21,5,35,20,5,24,0,5,0,0,3,12,0,7,9,126,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.16838513422265086,0.0,0.0,0.08430754475673381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689945882069579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13200123790720822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099749034026341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13268126426808094,0.0,0.052592821792684166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16692192715778462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5296890345037594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17829157244278054,0.0,0.05698423833321895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577087211906986,0.0,0.3129744940017291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04507545451648811,0.0,0.04903242737758088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09115493740124178,0.34616595579855874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07032615153411162,0.0,0.09135343239234434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09652035881362137,0.18836007823264567,0.14669690664949167,0.0,0.0,0.05758965135234461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05846259808048888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075332550198687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09726280694767804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055270376242859534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07854209106487306,0.0,0.09746690178683873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16262751593221778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07540870125905791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055281938497516205,0.0847653660542221,0.0,0.10061602450679558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14237285653995638,0.10177520094482537,0.0,0.0,0.3151814148171649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761708772834513,0.08792223523933003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,nomorevirusplz,2020/04/02,"I just want to be tested already While, no, I'm not experiencing symptoms now, back a at the end Februar, beginning of March, I ended up in a week of hell. Why would I think it was this virus? I'm never sick. But this had me at a full week of bed ridden, no eating, no drinking, no nothing. Full of dread, shortness of breath, everything that you would get from the virus. My entire house contracted this as well, along with some friends. So for all I know, we already survived.


Now, while confirming that I've fought the virus and can breathe a sigh of relief, I would much rather donate my plasma so they can use any antibodies they can to help everyone else. But you can't do that without being tested. Can't get tested without showing symptoms. And I'm not going through that hell again if I don't have to. But I can't even try to help. I just feel lost, much like everyone else...



Aside from that, this whole debacle has sent my anxiety into overdrive. I fear for my family's safety. And there's no peace of mind at the moment. Good luck everyone. I hope this all goes better soon. Not just for me, but for everyone's mental health as well..",2.753017621145375,4.697352352422911,3.755442731277533,88.3535165198238,76.13656387665198,6.830748898678412,23.68480176211454,7.734863291789972,1.0945261674008813,892,28,183,13,20,287,129,227,0.09,0.772,0.138,0.7711,0,0,1,0,0,0,39.0,1,2,2,3,15,16,3,2,8,0,17,8,2,1,3,36,33,14,0,7,14,0,1,1,1,3,4,0,1,0,11,7,2,0,3,2,1,3,15,6,3,0,5,2,21,9,30,23,8,27,2,1,0,0,10,9,2,4,16,129,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26135918507496825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08052977038519737,0.0,0.09059109915271107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091057794287249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047330092285485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11600667490489218,0.0,0.1211733884863654,0.19784969860225496,0.0,0.20977022763318245,0.0,0.0,0.07821539959519518,0.0,0.0,0.4526221550693383,0.10642840506930404,0.0,0.11163598881170976,0.1332556040629807,0.059876791607276186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0914911227538068,0.0,0.12373929318230152,0.0,0.06730090657760378,0.09932521276963288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258750937305055,0.0,0.0,0.1587490756635608,0.0,0.0,0.11761793992388335,0.0,0.1366409665767379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0650806236155734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057854109106544566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12926959469562835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11933966972425646,0.0,0.11957060497246184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17410488809339486,0.0,0.09133292865346794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136273384368412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2461677794181437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07587885767106266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08039951612015489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10227699772319497,0.0,0.0,0.06984727920931334,0.0,0.18997902056774754,0.0,0.21294789313446508,0.0,0.106855776363848,0.13221188090087924,0.0,0.2283056190386433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523668545305596,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,haggynaggytwit,2020/04/02,"Anyone else live with people who are not doing their part in preventing the spread? TLDR:  I have to chase after my father like he's a child to get him to wash his hands to prevent the spread of COVID19.  Then he gets mad.


FULL TEXT:  Many adults in Hawaii still live with family due to the cost of living.  I'm curious if anyone is having difficulties with getting your family, or even roommates, to comply with good hygiene?

I am having a hard time getting my father to wash his hands.  Prior to COVID19, he didn't always wash after using the bathroom.  I know this because my bedroom shares a wall with the bathroom and I can hear everything that goes on in there.  I usually heard the faucet go on after #2 but never after #1.  The few times I brought it up, he got mad and defensive.

Ever since COVID19, he has gotten better about washing after using the bathroom.  But now he gets annoyed when I ask him to wash his hands when he comes home from the store.  He is an extrovert and simply can't stay home, he will find any reason to get out for a few hours, even if it's just to buy one thing.  I've tried not saying anything but then he just doesn't think to wash on his own!  The other day he got mad because he came home from the store and sat down on the couch.  I asked him to wash his hands.  He snapped and said he was going back out to do yardwork, he'd wash after that.  In my head, I'm thinking is it really that hard to wash your hands twice?!?!  He'd still be touching the doorknob and the TV remote and the refrigerator door handle even before going back outside.

He also sneezes directly into his hands and won't wash them unless I say something.  And of course he gets irritated.

I feel like all I can do is clean the best I can, hoping I kill germs before anyone else at home contracts them.  I also watch my father like a hawk when he comes home, watching what he touches before he washes his hands, then going and disinfecting everything he touched.  I feel like a mother chasing after her son, only the son is my diabetic, almost 70 year old father.  I also know it's impossible to catch him not washing every single time.

Anyone else pulling their hair out due to family or even roommates being non-compliant?",4.6024657534246565,5.557830799086761,5.2985205479452055,83.07901369863015,69.77625570776256,7.575159817351599,25.787214611872145,7.675431598112923,1.3330606392694064,1742,49,338,19,30,564,215,438,0.067,0.8490000000000001,0.084,0.7605,0,0,1,0,0,0,48.0,0,2,4,2,20,15,6,0,24,0,27,22,9,3,3,53,62,27,1,3,13,7,15,4,0,2,13,5,9,2,12,22,0,3,8,1,4,10,8,6,0,2,10,22,42,9,52,46,8,59,0,0,2,0,58,17,0,6,35,208,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692875222961569,0.0,0.0,0.18430984482797644,0.06392423197710476,0.0,0.0,0.05224337099826575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148702215729568,0.2361476829734243,0.06322011029105648,0.0,0.14364128444684993,0.0,0.0,0.11814676998276788,0.0,0.09366314156504127,0.0,0.1961162607752284,0.0,0.0806226912249169,0.06794512676143946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08786689050752225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13235520248280827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04954551958731336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19253131773251608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20296772829644127,0.06949226039149901,0.06472804953640775,0.0,0.13809001625593625,0.0,0.2172702226400655,0.0,0.07768966490682508,0.10976703718774712,0.0,0.0,0.0702163041239441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809638248628428,0.0,0.1746447910647304,0.06443684013234746,0.12288732152109873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13763952600109355,0.0,0.0788442164319605,0.0,0.0865869218463658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3853067516842713,0.07630417474311676,0.0756567682742202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499505133191286,0.0,0.08444159589884724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15013050062702946,0.0,0.20351262126182207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788809907970304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05925187732657865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08061450763601526,0.0,0.052058345736400856,0.058428579734217674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319356894521368,0.0,0.05326051325809336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04921581404012207,0.07898849687705471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307779924472929,0.1221880309121574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06355011342885099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05914334009278049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818848151948447,0.12270446972632253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05103885894839338,0.0984522194282229,0.0,0.0,0.13439114824795206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052158869057428565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13270359796341447,0.08461145708269946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04947253172247405
COVID19_support,messedup122,2020/04/02,"Looking for some support! I live in Manitoba, Canada. In a small town up north. The virus has just hit the province a couple/few weeks ago (can’t remember the exact time off hand). Of all the break outs of illnesses, this is gonna be the first one to make it to our town (in my 30 years, if it haven’t already). I am a single mother to a 3yr old. I also have mental health issues. 
My emotions have been a rollercoaster, my thoughts are scattered, I worry for my friends, I worry for my family (the majority of my family have pre existing health issues. Cancer, diabetes, even asthma), I worry for my aunt and cousin who are working as nurses. Some days I feel like I’m just bracing myself for something to happen. I’ve been noticing I go off to cry alone more often these last few days. I am more overwhelmed than usual (lol).  
I don’t like reaching out to my friends and family because I don’t want to scare them as they have bigger things to worry about. I don’t want to call a hotline (As I re read this I know I’m going to) because wait times are long and i don’t want to hold up the lines for people who need it more than me. I’m feeling very uneasy and I really just wanted to get this all off my chest in hopes I can feel some relief. If you read this all, bless your heart. I hope everyone is safe and healthy ❤️",2.1543430482560915,3.739782567765573,3.7783245739767497,89.11486383182037,76.8021978021978,6.506067845198281,22.12597547380156,7.255503002510835,0.6672103519668737,1023,28,219,12,23,341,151,273,0.109,0.748,0.14300000000000002,0.5707,0,1,1,0,0,0,37.0,1,2,2,2,7,12,0,2,13,1,22,9,3,1,4,37,47,11,0,9,5,3,4,2,2,1,6,0,0,0,11,7,0,3,6,2,0,2,6,2,0,2,3,5,34,10,38,41,12,31,1,1,1,0,13,16,0,8,14,144,45,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09432241000065518,0.0,0.0,0.11020442184377016,0.11742155637036608,0.08509275961996465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12972809777823113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10865232058004463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688188448496305,0.13724600525027073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11969231542300285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07028009327442256,0.0,0.0,0.10167539717554988,0.0,0.0,0.30093003732290563,0.0,0.16140606022261025,0.07601639607203642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09050880400527167,0.0,0.0,0.16441786845551534,0.0,0.05559269089956485,0.0,0.12094584995299965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09409438577484776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262089914285897,0.0,0.12609150357750062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2113701350725759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2221202285235715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058477899770789675,0.08673501013643091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039690957371609,0.0,0.0939583589624536,0.09416587291718824,0.08935415681430091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07102676436625845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723212005522703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889862643122457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12114382216631304,0.1116550924323498,0.0,0.072103391505132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07376845316326182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21286938947854125,0.0,0.0681663440852939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12053714187340472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065308683507124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08191646018150538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207481541165676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069135172610742,0.0,0.0,0.08447439878020094,0.12409227172414385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11719106570817706,0.08779601105540384,0.2510438263155909,0.0,0.08535239450790293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07746476233644846,0.4322414252147129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685219108113409
COVID19_support,solway-firth,2020/04/02,"Life is really difficult right now Hey everyone. 

Life just feels a bit hard right now. Before COVID hit I was finally on my way to crawling out of a decades long depression. I got my drivers license, I graduated high school much later than I should have, but I finally did it. I was gonna enroll in college and probably get a part time job. I was really hoping I’d finally make some friends too, I haven’t had any real life friends in literally a decade, and I was looking forward to trying some local gatherings out, socializing. 

Now I can’t do any of that shit, obviously. 

I’m stuck in my house, which is normally fine because I’ve been doing that for ages, but my parents are toxic as fuck. They constantly fight with each other and bitch about each other to me. I can’t even escape it. 

I can’t even go for a walk, because about over a week ago I got the sickest I’ve been in my entire life. I’m leaning towards it being the flu, and thankfully I can at least leave my room now, but I can’t get rid of the constant cough. I’m so fucking tired of coughing.

I’ve distanced myself from my (online) friends because talking just seems too exhausting and yet I’m seriously lonely. None of my hobbies give me any enjoyment so I basically just waste time each day until it’s over so I can wake up and do it again.

I’m terrified for my parents, if they got coronavirus they would die. I worry about it alll the fucking time. 

Life is really shit right now. Thanks for reading this if you did, it’s basically just me talking shit.",3.1605882352941173,4.840173777777778,4.839809150326797,82.16434117647061,74.29411764705883,8.163973856209154,28.25307189542484,8.841846274778883,2.285972444444445,1200,49,238,25,25,406,163,306,0.213,0.69,0.09699999999999999,-0.9909,3,2,0,0,1,0,34.0,0,1,3,0,21,21,8,0,10,0,27,18,4,1,1,32,52,16,1,6,9,2,2,0,3,3,11,0,1,0,13,12,0,0,2,1,0,3,6,13,0,0,13,3,35,8,32,34,10,44,0,2,1,3,16,19,7,6,23,155,48,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090179720517507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18619201715119266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16690470893705978,0.0,0.07766063902708396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996388280080631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19725223383681828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05885901602758385,0.0,0.07860726709232739,0.0,0.09471969296297847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205606568705916,0.0,0.0,0.08720856859992053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046146828916285416,0.0,0.0,0.2999323068796788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21153564222865268,0.2531218230601769,0.0953654302347732,0.08755065790779577,0.051868567743535945,0.0,0.21898125866610016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08175640435711405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642753374914308,0.0,0.09064772519464473,0.0,0.1053087037283132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056741669404282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966375101146506,0.0,0.0,0.32231935388491617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076753291547294,0.0766404492207077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060920759837019466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06709100695501008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942129673479875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2026801719685019,0.09883217793909424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984001779911971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912906920988488,0.10388068209660106,0.1754019986989834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23382198119681524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923660586142426,0.0,0.08308513343110631,0.0,0.0,0.2810496946321026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09303418771437283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14671229812672704,0.0,0.16805093101806687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15965380552224706,0.10489683459113047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061963619221342185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244269813317722,0.0732080754871138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926850472919258,0.0,0.06483274374789992,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,yubyuns,2020/04/02,"My whole family may have Covid-19 now 
I was feeling sick four days ago, had chest pain and couldn’t breathe easily when laying down. 

I went yesterday with my dad and grandma since she was feeling sick too (was coughing, having body pain) 

So i wasn’t coughing so i went inside and got a check up and was told it was sinus infection like allergies. 

My grandma got tested and it took a long time. Fast forward to today, She tested positive. 

She didn’t have a fever and didn’t feel too bad but she still got it. 

I was stuck in a car with her for 4 hours just waiting for the test to be done for some reason. 

My dad doesn’t listen and still goes out and visits her before all this. 

We have to self quarantine now. 


I’m so fuckjng scared. 

I’m overweight, and probably have a chronic illness for several things. My mom is 50 and doesn’t go the doctor. My dad doesn’t take things seriously, he doesn’t wash his clothes nor does he take responsibility for going out all the time to her house. My older sister has had bronchitis when she was younger and gets sick often. My younger sister is healthy but fuck she’s young, she has to live her life. 

My aunt and uncle are old man. They have knee problems and my aunt has cancer. I have been visiting them.... If i gave it to them and it killed them...

holy fuck holy fuck i’m having a mental breakdown. 

WE CANT EVEN GET TESTED IM SO FUCKED 

IS MY FAMILY GOING TO DIE?

AM I GOING TO DIE?

COVID19_support,SSR223,2020/04/03,"This pandemic has me so upset and overwhelmed with anxiety. This virus has me so upset

I’ve been having a slight tickle in the back of my throat for the last few days. I’ve always had seasonal allergies, but as I live in NY (Long Island) which is where the majority of the virus cases are, I’m absolutely scared. I’m only 28, but I’m overweight and not very active. I’ve gone outside to grab food several times this week; I’m seriously scared of dying and knowing that even young people are part of the growing fatality list is making it worse.

I’m legitimately frightened. I finally found a combination of meds that work well for managing my depression and have been coming out of a dark period over the last few months and I genuinely *want* to be alive. I’m scared that breath is too shallow and that every cough I have to “scratch” the tickle is another step toward my impending doom.

This is like something out of a horror movie for me :(",3.947540983606558,5.839628781420764,5.352699453551914,78.41593442622951,72.66120218579235,8.814426229508197,26.40765027322405,9.3871,2.409211584699454,749,26,140,18,15,251,111,183,0.271,0.6709999999999999,0.057999999999999996,-0.9940000000000001,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,1,7,12,0,6,11,0,16,5,2,1,0,17,28,11,2,1,3,0,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,10,10,2,0,2,0,0,4,1,10,1,0,5,2,10,2,21,22,4,23,1,3,0,0,0,7,0,0,13,87,20,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956565689724598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17588061383214829,0.12831378186975925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12897481168673752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14448543382497894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10817264085386896,0.0,0.14446649376023446,0.0,0.17407833192235592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078476601322464,0.0,0.1413206302808894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18374114906124736,0.0,0.0,0.20282103203893856,0.1839084212368598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09218058971201563,0.2734463588600898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194491076493637,0.0,0.14810957595058086,0.14843668685565586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11196176761273707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18631136646071025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13388131104943649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12756700956688669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18163636449513668,0.0,0.1162835796324095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5037840776905094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18948832561993326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12912754452963224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780531475199383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13839566922156046,0.09893210958343683,0.0,0.13454371805263027,0.0,0.15081034320612302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221101903807058,0.0,0.1709322532555582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Lindseyturtles,2020/04/03,"Ways to cope? I'm nervous all the time and I don't know what to do. I graduate from college in May and just feel so overwhelmed. So many jobs won't be looking to hire people. I think the only job I would be able to get is maybe a food service job. But I am scared about that because people aren't taking things seriously. I have asthma and Lyme disease so I'm scared I'm more at risk. I'm also scared because I live with my parents. They're older and I don't want to spread anything to them. I'm not getting a stimulus check because I'm a student and I don't think I can apply for unemployment because I'm just looking for a job not laid off from one. All my usual ways of coping (podcasts, youtube channels) are changed now and mention the virus all the time. I just feel like I need escape. Is anything working for you guys?

COVID19_support,Sleepy2077,2020/04/03,"A couple of questions to help me (literally) sleep Hi all,

I’ve been freaking out so much over COVID-19 that I can barely sleep anymore. 

I’m an overweight+ person and I’m freaking out that contracting COVID is basically a death sentence. 

I don’t go outside at all (anxiety, social anxiety, introvert to begin with) and my only contact with the outside world is the garden, groceries and my family members who work in healthcare (although not in hospital or GP buildings). 

For the past two days I’ve had a few coughing fits and they mostly occur at night, it feels as if dust is stuck in my throat or whatever else it’s called. Is this a sign or not?

I don’t have a fever and do not exhibit other symptoms. 

I wash my hands / groceries as much as possible although I do slip every now and then too. 

Truth is I’m not afraid of death as much as I am afraid of the suffering that comes before it!

I don’t know what to do, not getting good sleep, I’m freaking out and ugh. 

Thank you for reading my word vomiting.

Edit: hit me with the truth!

COVID19_support,AsianBibleGirl11,2020/04/03,"People whose birthdays are coming up, are you planning to celebrate in quarantine? With social distancing rules in place in many countries around the world, many of us aren't able to gather in-person to celebrate events such as birthdays. However, I have seen several people finding creative ways to celebrate their birthdays while in quarantine, including having virtual gatherings, having relatives present behind a window or door, making coronavirus and toilet paper-shaped cakes, and simply throwing themselves an extravagant party without anyone else being there.

&amp;#x200B;

My birthday isn't until June but I'm pretty sure social distancing won't be over by then. I'm an only child who lives with her mom and suddenly I'm wondering whether it's selfish and wasteful to just treat myself with balloons, cakes, and fancy take-out food for no reason, even though pre-pandemic I've typically done at least something for my birthday, like dinners out with family and friends. Heck, I might not even want people to acknowledge my birthday this year in light of our current circumstances.

What are you guys planning to do for your birthdays if they fall during the quarantine period?",11.543811881188116,11.289597143564356,9.871168316831683,60.26962376237627,55.28712871287129,12.832475247524753,43.96237623762376,11.979248473330829,5.7951627722772265,981,48,129,24,10,301,143,202,0.039,0.8220000000000001,0.139,0.9644,2,3,1,0,0,0,31.0,2,3,2,2,7,5,0,0,5,0,14,2,0,2,1,28,22,15,0,2,7,1,0,1,1,2,0,0,2,2,5,13,2,0,4,0,0,3,6,1,0,0,2,2,14,4,31,16,1,26,0,0,1,0,18,12,1,4,11,90,19,0,0.13002744533692592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817693653953328,0.3159951565949655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09091821306826954,0.13322848368026655,0.0,0.1157519937691375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200713074091637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306322114444707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10862124582163876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717638026539924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12257830331736712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884272939216133,0.0,0.15722970303090544,0.0,0.1004588817202849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287476137693911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635248418516647,0.0,0.11481661644573607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0867943294420583,0.2636548419142017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379385714356779,0.0,0.15228657246170718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0988917314398221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270433975843259,0.11353494987583455,0.1358510054460856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13228465761805994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13368986984679973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468940023898792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26509321155737664,0.0,0.10010147998658388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12254932841844535,0.0,0.0977644567781343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277513048581304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15640700688324646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669355615466165,0.10320973382905506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12534181726458918,0.14100921786843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159951565949655,0.08373341167972667
COVID19_support,yinsled,2020/04/03,"Anxiety About Chest Pain I've had soreness in my chest for about a week. Normally, I would have already gone to an Urgent Care to get it checked out, but I'm too anxious to leave my house, let alone arrange a trip to a medical facility (I don't have a car). I spoke on the phone to a doctor who said it might be costochondritis, but that she wouldn't be able to diagnose without seeing me in person. I keep seeing horror stories about people who seemed otherwise okay, but actually had COVID lung damage. Or people who have inflammation in their heart (my pain is on the left side). 

Would appreciate any support or methods to calm down my health anxiety.

Anyone else feel this way?",0.821318681318683,3.0457481098901127,2.352406593406595,94.40509340659342,84.38461538461539,5.837802197802197,20.089010989010987,7.1686216300943375,0.3680584615384612,342,10,77,5,10,111,62,91,0.125,0.8059999999999999,0.068,-0.4847,0,1,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,6,3,0,0,2,0,1,7,6,0,0,18,10,8,0,2,6,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,6,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,5,8,2,10,9,1,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,4,39,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995275005173572,0.2063705705016616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15243136338473762,0.2251041423520293,0.0,0.139325405012737,0.20416275047165594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12146545982765534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22133004880571386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.166453987120536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13160763153872004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022515809554933,0.14234952429681694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784954896539935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2361209749422782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074959165180749,0.21901330882249093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20375418862937605,0.0,0.09734709933979244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14774683516321835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21872478613487945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3988025968045432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19576938095890167,0.0,0.116188590630524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16440822052457524,0.0,0.15816124714409294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,abstract_dna,2020/04/03,"NEW YORK CITY to NEW YORK SHITTY ...but the lights still shine bright. Since many of us are home quarantining with milk and cookies while binge watching *Netflix*, I thought I’d open up a window into my world as a New Yorker during these COVID days. I find myself here on Reddit with a fire in my belly to share and internalize my experiences. **In the process I hope I can crack a smile on your face.**

If you didn’t know, New York City has a mostly aggressive and no nonsense approach to the everyday experience. We are ASSHOLES..(at least it looks like it) for good reasons. We want our food fast. We HATE looking for parking. We want to own apartments and choose to live on pennies to have a decent place. We want to spend less money. We want work to end quickly without having to endure a painful rush hour via public transportation. Or is that just me? Amid all the hectic obstacles that are sometimes unavoidable, **we want joy.** Joy in business, love, friendship, spirituality, family, freedom. I’ve found that it can get lost in distractions that the city presents. This is not the New York City I currently live in. **There’s a new asshole in town.** His name is COVID-19, and he is dictating our lives. Maybe not everyone’s. Since his arrival, paranoia and real change has been present. Life feels like a movie -a sort of sci-fi drama with twists and turns. For some, it’s a joke and another way to capitalize on being funny on an Instagram feed. Others completely disregard science or make ignorant statements like “tobacco kills people, but people are worried about COVID.” Here’s a shout-out to the bonehead for not pointing out that COVID-19 can take your life within days/weeks. I’m positive but realistic. Sorry people, I’m with science on this one. Don’t get me started on the almighty saving us. God may take care of us.. **in the ER**, and now I sound like an asshole.

4 weeks ago, I began to repair a relationship. We were easing back into a promising one, but the timing wasn't exactly convenient. COVID-19 was present in New York and New Jersey, but the spread wasn’t as significant as it is now. (I feel like Rick from *The Walking Dead* narrating the outbreak’s beginnings). She had concerns about a case in Westchester, Bronx, only a few miles away from where I live. She was heading to Miami, Florida for a personal vacation. I told her not to worry, and I agreed to take care of her 10 percent headache / 90 percent sweet and perfect couch potato of a puppy at my place. We enjoyed one last lunch date before her departure. It was memorable because of the genuine nature of enjoying our time together, but it was also a notable moment of fear and preparation for the unknown becoming real. I vividly remember doing some grocery shopping with her and seeing hordes of masked customers stacking their carts with water, chicken, and tissue (the outbreak essentials!). Our day ended with a sweet kiss and a 30 min Uber ride to the Bronx with initial puppy cries back home.

A few days later, I received a notice on my door about someone possibly being infected in my building’s management office less than half a mile away. **SHIT.** Back to my boo..

While in Miami, she texted me every day with some sort of update on how her day was. On one particular night, she didn’t respond. I intuitively felt something was wrong and followed it up with a call. No answer. The next day, I found out she was in the emergency room. SHIT. (It was a knee and hernia issue that required surgery). The hospital eventually released her early due to the rising demand of patients with **REAL emergencies.** She flew back home on her own while being assisted on a wheelchair. **Talk about a SHIT end of a vacation.**

I spent a few more days with my step daughter pup while she was home recovering. This was a time of rapid thoughts, questions, and furry bonding. Dog walks were spent with surgical gloves and occasional masks. Workouts were taken outdoors, a perfect way to also compliment dog playing time. I began to receive a lot of phone texts / COVID-19 updates about the urgency to stay home. The NEWS presented important to misleading information, and so I began to focus on getting FACTS from respectable scientists. When I wanted to take a BREAK from the news and escape in the world of sports, repeat playoff games reminded me of the impact of this virus. Businesses were preparing to shut down, and I hated not being able to sit down at my local coffee spot or bar that allowed dogs. “Where do I go from here? I’m not part of the demographic,” I told myself. “I’m fit!... or am I? I’m a type 1 diabetic. **Am I considered HIGH RISK?** Ugh. Should I go to work? Should I take public transportation to work?” My train rides aren’t packed, and my 6am Monday morning commute is now quiet and peaceful, but homeless people are swarming them as temporary shelters. FUCK. I guess this is all an illusion. As for the pup, I wondered if I should be concerned about her licking me like a damn ice cream? Could I infect her? When I see my boo again, should I not kiss her? When will we have sex again! Can I bend the rules for social distancing? UGH. **Everything is in slow motion these days.**

When I returned my step daughter pup, **SHE** asked if I’d be offended if she sprayed me down with Lysol disinfectant. I warmly laughed and told her I understood. In fact, I wasn’t sure if she was comfortable with me staying. I didn’t know if I should lay down next to her, especially since she was already recovering from her operation and experiencing pain from another condition due to a past pregnancy. If I had this virus, would I be endangering her? Her dad was also there, and I wondered how me possibly being infected could endanger him. She wanted me there, and I wanted to be there, but I would have easily left. I probably should have. It was all so confusing to try to make the best decision. The next few hours felt like earlier times as we Netflixed and quaran-chilled. I even baked her some surgical masked cupcakes with a box that read “Will you be my Quarentine?” (A play on Valentine). A few hours later she felt a pain in her stomach and needed to head to the emergency room. I JINXED IT. SHIT.

I haven’t been to an emergency room in years. I helped her inside, and even though my priority was to get her in quickly and tended to, I couldn’t help notice a containment area outside by the ER entrance. As we entered, the air felt thick, or maybe that was my paranoia talking. The nurses probably mistook me for a patient, and so likely bought me extra time inside. **Five minutes inside that area was a lifetime of fear.** My boo trembled and cried, and then she reached her hand out to firmly grab mine. It was the first time I experienced this flush of emotion to want to protect her, where nothing mattered, The NBA didn’t matter. Netflix didn’t matter. Going to work didn’t matter. I saw an overweight man on a respirator being pushed on a stretcher right by me, and all I could think about was whether he had the infection. I’m sure she thought the same. EVERYTHING was in slow motion. She reached out her hand again, and I told her everything would be okay. The nurse then requested that I wait outside.  **“Everything is infected,”** she said. Those very words ping ponged around in my head as I proceeded to the exit in a trance-like state.

For the next few hours, I patiently waited for the outcome at the ER. I sat on the one lone chair outside the entrance in protective gear messaging / receiving messages from my boo while drinking coffee to prepare for what would end up being a 5 hour process of broken sleep and seeing different walks of life drop in. I looked like Kenny from *South Park* with my eyes peeking through a hoodie tightly secured around my face. “I appreciate you bringing me,” she told me. **Those words alone made me feel a sense of value in her life**, and I was happy to be by her side. I wish I could have physically been inside, but I tried my best to send her some good “juju” / energy. I needed some myself while hearing intense radio chatter echo from within the hospital’s walls.The next few hours gave me time to internalize the reality of real fear, love, and what the future held. I thought about my newborn nephew and wondered when was the next time I was going to hold him. I wondered when I’d be able to be in the physical presence of my grandmother that I never built a strong relationship with. I thought about my brother who is asthmatic. When will I have a reunion with friends to kick the shit. My parents are relatively healthy, but are they truly safe? Despite these rational fears, I was happy to be in a space that made me seek important answers and find real purpose. My heart guided my actions. “I can afford to call out of work tonight,” I told myself. “I want to be here. \*\*This is genuine love..\*\*Love for my family.. Love for my boo.. Love for my friends and everyone that have had an impact in my life.”

I decided to go back to her place and pick her up after her results. As the night progressed, her mood was more upbeat, but her observations were telling of the world we live in, especially for nurses and doctors putting their lives on the line for us. With limited supplies available, they still provided her with extra treatment. They cautioned her against bringing shoes inside her apartment. They revealed alarming information about deaths from the night before and the high risk exposure from doctors and nurses themselves that lived in New York City. **Has she been exposed? Have I?** SHIT. SHIT. SHIT.

After a couple of hours at my boo’s place zoned in on CNN updates, she was released from the hospital. I immediately Uber’ed my way back to her. Her spirits were higher and she was mostly pain free. She was cleared of COVID-19 systems in the process. She expressed gratitude for my presence, and I reminded her that she was a priority. **She is a priority**.. but *where do we go from here?*

I don’t know when’s the next time ill be cuddling with my boo again or when we will have a worry free night and can dance the night away. I know relationships can be complicated, but COVID-19 threw me a curveball. **Physical touch is therapeutic**, and there lies the dilemma. I hate that I can’t touch her. Maybe I can, but I shouldn’t. I won't ask for it. Is COVID-19 affecting relationships for everyone else? Is it making it worse? Stronger? I believe this separation from the people I love made me realize what I’ve taken for granted or never properly expressed. **I’m not religious, but this feels like a test.** I hope I’m passing.

There’s still so much I don’t know, but these days I’m trying to be vigilant about my health and how I affect others. That’s not always easy. **Humans are bound to fuck up.** I’m trying my best to embrace the challenge and this new dynamic. The escalating death toll is real. The infected are real. The confusion is real. LOVE is real, and that doesn’t have to die with COVID-19. I see light at the end of this dark tunnel. **There’s still beauty behind the madness.**",2.2179712887320133,5.055163208293156,3.2108071905532998,85.98241336584124,85.43201542912246,6.216390531467768,25.232393879296232,7.5680677535414835,1.6801580888266219,8690,361,1588,160,265,2768,776,2074,0.102,0.747,0.151,0.9986,8,2,3,0,0,0,384.0,23,5,7,17,72,101,18,11,134,1,156,62,21,15,14,293,283,123,5,38,42,6,17,10,2,17,21,4,12,4,58,103,9,15,42,16,8,35,33,39,3,8,89,42,256,63,257,151,37,290,1,2,14,12,165,115,11,36,140,1069,314,13,0.056297074432313465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02495197985657341,0.0,0.0,0.02915339540128344,0.031062610775748012,0.06753112512592245,0.02342183789614419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05903239117462573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05011633191765266,0.05263016504778716,0.0,0.07933943192328766,0.12986692568229222,0.0,0.01715908702169253,0.031087847836992845,0.04790466386644035,0.03171376222866994,0.08862045954485083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574856073856552,0.0,0.05739861938707145,0.0,0.02977742001185456,0.0,0.029513205722808574,0.0,0.0,0.08989726599912658,0.031145821035942867,0.06183969275693613,0.16338130050634428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029213737549477745,0.029409230280136013,0.0,0.057622441192771615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027574850211794014,0.0,0.0,0.023514490902694158,0.03166331567864575,0.12465624522514016,0.0,0.0,0.03718368671218878,0.0,0.02371635664106728,0.08069140076729799,0.10119236088689704,0.05506934135643402,0.05307187146346853,0.1266997205094054,0.05693098474159669,0.060327961834698136,0.10810804003045298,0.0,0.051454506123637465,0.023943131376376013,0.03403732293426712,0.06172683632502617,0.04349498005547418,0.05204573815370208,0.0588257956296502,0.0,0.09598477429941944,0.04721931503721937,0.0,0.0,0.03100878723774288,0.0,0.0,0.05992928257304305,0.0,0.08337255867388528,0.08666556011088081,0.029920578775832537,0.031725447215979814,0.033356152131068274,0.03773474230058152,0.059480950061607814,0.14117638959622,0.05591569757998634,0.19404447346817102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029379759634105725,0.0,0.0,0.031142185876922624,0.0,0.07734849953077573,0.02294481476638353,0.0,0.0,0.030583468046862614,0.0,0.09941072143457556,0.13751953446279472,0.0,0.1739897184688226,0.0,0.07091304561395488,0.0,0.030727453515874806,0.02393087973995989,0.17783607680894173,0.07990447955125249,0.05636810150627479,0.028538198649567057,0.08483696716254456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020692413666078026,0.04174356735392047,0.0434197744067508,0.2718603264800182,0.20955402067302464,0.1320774767157884,0.0,0.027009280629149267,0.06409459237568585,0.0,0.0,0.09537088653768402,0.02140823097455326,0.11980811286971095,0.0,0.03125561942375115,0.030482122750170638,0.026870963846197343,0.0975732573715781,0.02457821695745371,0.11763692112054405,0.0,0.026609466080553812,0.06346649263156452,0.0,0.0,0.060697768008608086,0.0,0.0,0.028297054580385093,0.0315328037774696,0.0,0.028156154610090783,0.2883527806593796,0.0,0.02894138439046225,0.0,0.1208839786966942,0.03188680543651539,0.02403869698160349,0.026775704842727784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972295903151199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23115255157628706,0.06985428259248705,0.0,0.02816886575309402,0.0286938888629931,0.02385016423779374,0.02167011916210073,0.027839623063011926,0.031509982858802583,0.019923679521321683,0.06000519078074475,0.0899178327270824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053059326403946366,0.0,0.1058209842893511,0.04524945593341548,0.024603062223920863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01803644605999609,0.02765579489694436,0.11173397163755053,0.16413638415280965,0.0,0.0,0.16138280153459594,0.0,0.07644403620504064,0.03061752543523872,0.0,0.0,0.1354368977322501,0.0,0.0,0.02322549115662668,0.16602736553540734,0.06702899590687607,0.04515811732242014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032369428625908546,0.027134185393482082,0.1221035514988606,0.1024623517041116,0.08575861771655735,0.02868576422007548,0.07998365286948181,0.03077600661446615,0.0,0.018126735081160687
COVID19_support,gghhhhhh2,2020/04/03,Where do you draw the line between cleaning chemical toxicity and coronavirus toxicity? I have 1 pair of gloves and a mask.  I have been cleaning a lot and i try to air out the house but now they say the virus can live in the air for hours and im afraid with the windows open it will blow in.  I cant obviously clean and have the chemicals sit on surfaces for a minute without the windows open.  Even with a mask i can still smell the chemicals.  So  its either cancer and weakened lungs or coronavirus?

COVID19_support,Throwaway29912111,2020/04/03,"I guess me being fat means I'm a goner by the end of his pandemic Maybe this is more of an r/offmychest post, and I'm sorry if so, but it's COVID-related and wanted to weed out those 'guess you're getting what you deserved, LOLZ' type comments as much as possible. According to the news, my 5'6ish 273 pound self is pretty much a goner if I get COVID. Despite finally making the effort (starting right before COVID spread to America), using the stationary bike for 12 miles each day (4 times/week) and losing 23 pounds so far, along with having no major underlying conditions as per my doctor's visit a week ago, guess I started too late. My doctor did not seem worried about me when asking about my risk in COVID complications, but considering my 129/89 blood pressure at that same visit, I keep having doubts and am preparing that if I catch COVID, this could be the end for me. 

I'm doing all I can to avoid it (only going out for groceries or walks, and luckily having to work from home), but if I catch it, I'll likely become a statistic as a 27 year old guy. I get that fat is unhealthy (especially at my size), I get it increases chances of complications for many diseases in general, but reddit and my news feed in general is getting filled with all these 'obesity=COVID death' type articles and discussions more and more, it's hard to shake out of my head and is effectively stamping out what's left of the 'We Can Do It' mindset that I had when we initially got into this mess. I accepted my fate, drafted my final statement in case I end up in ICU, but I'll still keep on my diet in the meantime in hopes for the best, even if my time feels limited now.

COVID19_support,electronicake,2020/04/03,"For those like me who sometimes feel this isolation has put a halt to the newfound transformation you had going pre-quarantine. Think of it not as an interruption, but as another (BIG) stepping stone in your journey of mental health I've been going between waves of depression and calm. If you're like me and you just recently, before isolation, began to find mental strength and inner peace, or you were struggling with that battle, you know how much work it takes to get there. You probably feel the irony of this situation as hopelessness, as though it was all for nothing and that you will never be allowed the happiness you've had to fight for, maybe even make sacrifices for. I'm sure you've fallen back into those feelings of anxiety, self-worthlessness or whatever it may be, as those tools you were using to find that happiness (social activity and many hobbies) are put on pause. You feel that, just as you began to feel ""normal"" or ""like everyone else,"" that same ""normal"" has been flipped upside down on you.

Only 3 months ago, I (26 F) ended a 5-year relationship and left all my friends and everything else I know to move across the country and do some serious soul-searching. Nothing was really wrong in my relationship, friendships or life in general, but I had also never been single since age 16 and knew deep down that my depression/anxiety/anger were coming from a serious codependency issue, an inability to cope with anything on my own. I am also an outdoor adventurist as well as songwriter/musician, so I knew my serious relationship was stifling my dreams and only making me resentful of those I loved. I'm genuinely a very calm, kind and caring person, and also a very independent individual, but I couldn't figure out how to become that person fully, other than to leave everything behind and go some place where I didn't know anyone. As gut-wrenchingly difficult as it was to make those sacrifices, I put myself in that difficult situation, knowing that I would have to force myself out of an even deeper depression than before, but I would be doing it all on my own, and I would come out stronger as that person I knew I could become. Sure enough, just a couple of months into my new life, I was transforming from the most depressed, unsure state I've ever experienced into a blossoming, happy, peaceful, passionate social butterfly. I had the perfect balance of introspective alone time and social activity. All my mental issues were truly becoming healed, I was thriving in my hobbies, and even meeting really cool people when I'd go out to concerts every weekend. My ""plan"" was going so well and I truly felt ""born-again"" as they say. 

Fast forward a week or two, and now I am not allowed to go out and meet people or try to get to know any of those people I did already meet. I can still go hiking, but not allowed to enjoy it with other people (which is fine, I do enjoy solo outdoors, but still.. I now live in a beautiful state where the weather is about to get nice and pretty for some group activity) writing music can be nice, but I'm so distracted that its hard to fully focus and be pumped about it for extended periods of time. I've been reaching out to my ex A LOT because I have no close friends here yet, and with the stress and loneliness of all of this, it almost feels necessary. 

Needless to say, my weaknesses of anxiety and depression have had their place in my head the past couple weeks. However, I have begun to find a sense of calm in knowing that if I can get through this alone, it's mentally like everything else I've been through the last few months...I'll come out stronger on the other side. It's just another challenge... a really weird, crazy, huge challenge.

I say all of this, not to just say that you are not alone. But if the uneasiness of this virus and quarantine has made you feel like you've just been robbed of your self-love, mental strength, spiritual awareness, social acceptance or whatever beautiful path you were on, its just a reminder that you still have work to do on your mental/emotional/spiritual health. It is always a work in progress after all. You and I WILL make it through and come out STRONGER on the other side because we've already made it this far in life. Getting through this mental challenge will show us that we can handle a level of stress so great that requires us to let go of control and stop expecting life to go as planned. We will find that we are much more flexible than we ever thought we could be.

Sorry for the long post... Hope this helps at least someone out there.",10.10125611025261,7.8271187187864655,9.580466113721661,67.62972279163645,59.59509918319721,12.998820524141411,39.61490428584944,11.52928918705873,4.488296944085276,3630,141,642,80,37,1172,348,857,0.12300000000000001,0.6829999999999999,0.19399999999999998,0.9978,4,8,0,1,1,1,118.0,7,18,2,14,39,56,3,4,33,1,67,11,1,14,14,160,120,70,0,13,30,1,9,5,2,8,8,5,0,3,54,54,0,4,25,4,0,21,10,20,2,1,34,16,74,36,118,68,22,106,2,5,0,2,53,49,0,18,40,460,128,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04225331720469011,0.0,0.0477309347109716,0.14810379824344888,0.10520194019535792,0.11435621812525268,0.039662197221672434,0.0,0.0,0.03241473256652283,0.09996458653743667,0.07292920960525312,0.0,0.0,0.033329399671721535,0.0,0.039225320433068915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03665245828716754,0.0,0.05811389324919264,0.15793111850259242,0.08112105610727795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048598990661542316,0.0,0.0,0.16424125818414845,0.0,0.0,0.053461831720124565,0.07611535673580674,0.10548375426693926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16421972840096288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11945728339748428,0.0,0.04221821195207399,0.049252051206785226,0.0,0.09444946564486924,0.08623383189068651,0.04016093095035825,0.04554721204368633,0.12851824628214226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16871066741221324,0.03405282897210539,0.04576714286843135,0.0,0.17426461397851506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07365376213268561,0.0,0.1245184258346074,0.0,0.2438088162907153,0.0,0.0,0.05255228675580862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15222505394143326,0.04269966065222435,0.0,0.048919396685636614,0.10133413967389968,0.0,0.0,0.0319497299458518,0.0,0.0,0.04734341162804103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950250924800937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049637137830310686,0.1571769793707829,0.03885441324093787,0.0,0.050471751058758736,0.05178959681883345,0.04874204232167844,0.134672527646038,0.11643678267011355,0.0,0.04209023439122382,0.042183193773344584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04052420122379328,0.04302071537316335,0.09020605018016377,0.12727055658435582,0.04832616757956176,0.04788722584751162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3362550795972465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07609360470460556,0.05066175526690669,0.0700804604195066,0.0,0.07352640998871307,0.046036429478379284,0.0,0.0,0.0934057473706772,0.0914742403972635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250476950996491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045502896584377735,0.13218329986203606,0.1248611777580524,0.09960231956864143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045651158961918265,0.04849378441785383,0.05139235563723741,0.0,0.0,0.1437534532349092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09160879665712424,0.0,0.0470647411003315,0.15352736915656487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15162468535880216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09945273608104786,0.0,0.0,0.03943007298355188,0.10715788302539728,0.0,0.19435924442601246,0.04038751877470642,0.0,0.047143209913683766,0.0533585434302355,0.0,0.0,0.11419915565061185,0.039851178391354825,0.10920321843541422,0.04983118777540575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08984988614530784,0.0,0.03583914095628411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030542653568932276,0.04683191798989028,0.03784173418926133,0.055589229746933165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032362302798664234,0.0,0.0465630690543548,0.0,0.11467342940308498,0.04116839664444928,0.0,0.0786594130579295,0.0,0.0,0.07647009441970835,0.0,0.08571549345714989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041049473343128,0.0,0.0,0.1015823596557323,0.05211563880900223,0.0,0.03069554767486285
COVID19_support,blessedbiscuit,2020/04/03,"I can't smell/taste anything as of yesterday I don't have any other symptoms besides a sort of runny nose (clear snot which makes me think it's allergies). I left Brooklyn last week and I'm self-isolating in another state just in case I was exposed to it. Right when i got here I started having a runny nose/facial redness/ sneezing/phlegmy cough... typical allergy symptoms. Also the pollen here is so bad. But i literally cannot smell/taste anything. I took a sip of bourbon and all I could taste was the mild burn of alcohol...

&amp;#x200B;

I had a call with my doctor today and she said that the lack of smell/taste is most likely a sign of the virus and I probably have a mild case of it. She said it's in my nose area now and will move to my lungs soon. That's what scares me the most. I'm so worried I might have shortness of breath or trouble breathing. I already have anxiety and it's been exacerbated during all of this and I convince myself I have shortness of breath.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I've noticed is my heart rate has been pretty low. I wear a fitbit and my resting heart rate is usually around 65 but recently it's been like 58 and even got to 50 last night. It's done this before in the past, but I wonder if this is something to be worried about?

&amp;#x200B;

I was around someone before I left Brooklyn who probably had the virus and had more severe symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, headache) so I'm really worried I'm displaying the symptoms now. My worry is that it might get worse and I'm so scared because I'm here all alone and I can't calm down. Has anyone else had these symptoms? is there a chance it could just be pollen allergies?",2.4822677492447127,4.7338510060423005,3.4881712613293065,88.4774834780967,78.21450151057401,6.31272658610272,26.05371978851964,7.413659706084162,1.3658647280966765,1317,52,261,18,32,422,164,331,0.151,0.82,0.03,-0.9885,0,1,2,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,0,0,19,10,0,2,16,0,37,21,9,1,4,38,53,24,0,4,7,0,0,2,0,3,11,2,0,0,21,15,2,0,2,0,0,2,4,6,0,0,16,6,31,4,24,30,8,31,0,2,1,0,6,14,0,8,16,170,52,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08422978139448281,0.0,0.08162907028737426,0.08697484472807777,0.06302871282072241,0.0,0.25618962683902313,0.28730831379564803,0.053597230747649084,0.16528981074407395,0.06029362832833207,0.0,0.0,0.05510961786341538,0.08075577572811078,0.1297168530443435,0.14032497842331426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06580763570070502,0.048045186547953464,0.0,0.13413234101968605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047941965602863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258554988857735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067098596082861,0.0,0.08065560267269321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06584022218500638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0520568828157721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041177836578445634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260718824546278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18679345231282748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12849027507879576,0.0,0.0,0.17126650453340392,0.0,0.0,0.0770105271789801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05260994653152234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1672215434928877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08376838468584659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396299114948028,0.0,0.0,0.08973194912735846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523829613322405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018368030451635,0.16995284092511856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050491216227784665,0.0,0.07782078052490399,0.0,0.0,0.06730799135121728,0.1499431447017518,0.0,0.15781609476075487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08222173718820174,0.08903906120608875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06678010249353587,0.060676008947521176,0.0,0.0,0.05578600412209581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095973207485971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0523615043953531,0.05050177870880315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07470786168725982,0.0,0.08756690097283629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08680411892461515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06322102592542353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854720286474738,0.0,0.320163792792142,0.08031970998700555,0.0,0.0,0.28730831379564803,0.0
COVID19_support,throwaway030816,2020/04/03,"Grandmother in ICU for two weeks on ventilator. Dads birthday is next week. My heart is breaking and I don't know what to do I just wanted to post because I'm losing my mind and I have almost no one to talk to about this. I don't know what to do and I keep thinking about my grandmother being in the ICU for so long, heavily sedated and intubated on a ventilator. No one can see her and shes all alone in there and not getting better. Also my dads birthday is next week and Im just dying thinking about him suffering for the rest of his life around his birthday if she doesnt make it. This virus is absolutely miserable because you cant even grief properly. Cant even hold a funeral or say your final goodbyes. A week ago I was on the phone with her and she was in perfect health. She had also pulled me aside to tell me she had some things she wanted to tell me. I told her as soon as she got out of the rehab center she was in we would have lunch. Im just losing my mind and trying to keep my cool so as to not freak out the rest of my family but Im crying all the time now. This couldnt have happened to a better person, and now my dad could potentially lose his only living parent in the most horrible way (his father died when he was very young).


I just cant handle any of this and dont know what to do.",1.996427901157336,3.4517847985611536,3.85269002189553,88.96889740381609,76.9136690647482,6.9930559899906175,21.43947450735064,7.7425588080867325,0.7093923678448553,1026,26,229,15,23,347,139,278,0.126,0.8420000000000001,0.033,-0.9776,1,1,0,0,0,0,18.0,1,2,0,6,19,11,0,1,11,1,29,5,1,1,3,47,45,22,4,6,9,5,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,1,9,16,1,3,5,0,0,1,12,7,0,3,8,3,38,4,37,33,6,32,0,6,1,0,32,13,0,5,15,165,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913408486014579,0.0,0.10318205455729268,0.10672082499559847,0.0,0.16480590081346422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07007234876903018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172956038886776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562735132016056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18226521484387365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822709521499955,0.0,0.11318721091753214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2138834348158229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12076489658958894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13611703431731187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09713918102301694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11287788561690232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05383538824728426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241240073505425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112003229399933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10952922660809757,0.0,0.12210571101949864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3339103428887702,0.0,0.0,0.1831775955945769,0.0,0.0,0.16988818424352686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727818770944154,0.0,0.0,0.09098830533243686,0.09118925970501886,0.0,0.3458341826768118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878158573964313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20808685021891965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191734705295656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964836070401845,0.0783683697851561,0.0,0.0,0.11441636367695028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997262769964676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09868611212278534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194343276357448,0.0,0.0,0.08211143227992326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282155819838889,0.18012715581247785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684567755997958,0.13205078701924752,0.0,0.0,0.06008483776065127,0.0,0.0,0.0984614055115904,0.0,0.06995900904081473,0.0,0.1006574281566929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0850207512039595,0.12155412553423832,0.08179024139207115,0.3306175126129247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07319834707844085,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Kaitybg7,2020/04/03,"This is the first time I've been happy my mom's dead This sounds so weird and awful, but I just needed to vent because I know how awful this would sound if I told anybody else this.

My mom died of lung cancer January of 2019. It was about as terrible as you'd expect, and I can't really say I've gotten over it. I just can't help remembering just how much I wished she'd just come back and...give us just a few more months with her. That's all I wanted, just a few more months.

I don't feel that way anymore.

Idk, I'm rambling, but in some perverse, selfish way, I know I'm glad she's not alive because...well, I'm an anxious mess now; my brother has Type 1 Diabetes and I'm the oldest person under 60 on one side of my family. But if my mom were still alive, I'd be catatonic, and I know she'd be terrified. So, if there were one silver lining around the shitshow that was late 2018 and all of 2019 for me, it was that, I guess.

COVID19_support,shundei,2020/04/04,"I'm on mandatory quarantine. Backstory: I work for a popular hardware retailer. I took PTO because I'm adjusting to Lexapro and the side effects were too annoying to deal with while I was at work. Further that, we had a confirmed case in our store. Mix it with my terrible anxiety (picked a great time to get my mental health BS together), and I'm off for two weeks. I was due back later in the next, but I got a call today.  


Another confirmed case, and I was apparently exposed to them. So now I'm off an additional two weeks. It's paid. I texted my coworker and he gave me the deets. We work in the same department, and he and another were sent home as well. He also told me who he thinks it is, but it doesn't matter at this point. I hope we're all going to be okay.  


I'm not sure how to feel anymore. I don't care about me, I just don't want it to affect my dad and his job. He's a state worker, but we're all fine? I had a sore throat in the beginning of March. It turned into a less than mild cough that hasn't gone away in it's entirety. I had a physical last month as well and my temp turned out fine. I expressed to my doctor about the sore throat concern but she said I was OK.  


My anxiety is terrible, thus the Lexapro (I've been on it two weeks!). I'm two hours away from NYC, working in the capital Region. I just want this to all go away. 2020 was supposed to be the year I get my shit together. At least the Lexapro is working, I think. I've been playing FFXIV and Animal Crossing with friends to keep me happy. I love being a hermit, so staying inside is no problem for me.  


If anyone has any words of encouragement or good news, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much.",1.7627318548387123,3.4591939517045454,3.6889552785923776,88.83881598240471,78.23295454545455,7.496480938416423,24.70711143695015,8.360895534625662,1.4812563049853384,1309,47,291,26,31,443,188,352,0.109,0.735,0.156,0.9711,2,1,0,0,0,0,48.0,3,1,1,7,14,24,2,0,20,2,25,9,3,5,4,49,56,23,0,6,9,1,1,0,1,1,5,1,1,0,14,17,0,1,5,1,3,7,6,5,2,4,20,2,39,19,43,32,7,47,0,0,0,1,24,21,1,3,17,182,53,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000498826006139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06803321256035001,0.20980928812082053,0.1530664616390122,0.0,0.0992165639843594,0.06995294894756954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2819833213683272,0.07692750450409536,0.0,0.06098577003555281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10215590223254896,0.0,0.10200131853964108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314076172640793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10239906537646623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050585149707547114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772935893387194,0.0,0.10453750948092133,0.0,0.11371439061100345,0.08391199031905526,0.08001416357966748,0.220597278601822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064984821387881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063418778776948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035208539335723,0.09936606387273286,0.09852298768775912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927803144187818,0.08892352344615265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08154904716562232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029343269990474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008206167532388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985400423599749,0.0,0.07354370193033087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106397713007144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457372511171218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572840245207287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516456067936913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269351988061223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066333762765955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942900946367842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092106886905089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12820805096250115,0.0,0.0,0.058336342520763335,0.0,0.09482982167546994,0.0955961352493074,0.1111523394778638,0.0,0.21763784552063856,0.3909130106732815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801684694938135,0.0,0.2407472980452295,0.0,0.17990277643407754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3641653784044112,0.0,0.0,0.0710682429422833,0.0,0.0,0.06442492515816918

COVID19_support,greengreen87,2020/04/04,"I’m not sure why it’s making me SO mad that Joann fabrics is still open. Have I gone to Joann fabrics in the last two weeks? You bet. I made an pick up order a couple weeks ago. I have a 4 year old at home and I realize people need to have something to keep their kids and themselves busy. 

But the fact that JoAnns is keeping their doors open, appeal after appeal, is really making me mad. They are only supposed to be selling supplies for masks, but even the news reporter tried to order non essentials and has no problem.

COVID19_support,vanhalengal,2020/04/04,"Advice for immunocompromised essential worker I'm writing on behalf of my mother [50] who works for an in-home care company for the elderly. My mom has dealt with aortic stenosis her whole life, and had a valve replacement 10 years ago. She is also overweight. I live in a small town which has had few to no cases, though things could change quickly. My mom cares for 3-4 clients 6 days a week, all within my hometown. All her clients are disabled in some way and rarely leave their homes except for a doctor's appointment or hospital stay once in awhile. She often does their grocery shopping for them, as well as helps them with certain physical needs, like getting in and out of wheelchairs, to the bathroom, etc. My mom says that her company supplies her with gloves and has given her several reusable masks that she sterilizes after every use. She also says that she made her own hand sanitizer with alcohol and a few other ingredients. She takes off her outer shirt after work which gets the majority of any germs from working. And she is trying to increase her immune system with various supplements. 

She has said she doesn't want me to worry about her, but I'm stuck at college with my online classes for another month and I am praying to God day and night to protect her and my family from the virus. As far as I know, she cannot take off work because there are so few people in the area who work for the same company that could take over for her, and most of her clients' families aren't near enough to care for them regularly. All her clients have various, special needs and cannot be neglected. I love my mom dearly and I think a part of me would die if she got the virus and didn't make it. 

Does anyone know at all if it is possible for a person in my mom's situation to be able to stay home for at least a month or so? Or should I be so concerned? I've been worrying myself nearly sick over her and praying like crazy for her safety.",6.779882205513783,6.485819068421055,6.869248120300753,78.0430701754386,64.89473684210526,10.185463659147867,32.30576441102757,9.725611199111238,2.846444862155388,1546,54,299,28,21,496,207,380,0.073,0.7979999999999999,0.129,0.9571,0,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,5,6,11,11,0,0,16,0,26,9,2,3,5,52,50,30,1,9,7,6,1,2,0,2,6,3,2,1,12,21,2,2,3,1,1,1,6,1,1,0,9,4,49,10,61,34,20,39,2,1,0,1,46,23,0,8,13,213,61,9,0.08652190163955058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454820091531008,0.07669644537064356,0.09246559986216336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13838306696329306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588378600773239,0.09072575785264564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06049812536078927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05274294817221325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2646445353119631,0.0,0.09152869953989867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381613962159368,0.0,0.0,0.11159893755835258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897960738552605,0.0,0.0,0.08855883257496823,0.15143179837115356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08940025315584088,0.0964947913598976,0.0,0.0,0.07289843379034007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631302972274326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904082450937361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06919946866728352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05799380686557884,0.0,0.1735770438182475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09510034879577793,0.0,0.0,0.0916142010599142,0.0,0.0,0.06111297788463538,0.08454046150204371,0.0,0.07640042430244398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808939427027001,0.08186911534340449,0.057754041197976974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5066670274654044,0.13812191284319614,0.0,0.0,0.12830978750138372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08119494353436066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214300147672597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936947879778694,0.0,0.05998339247347146,0.0755475872063342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09754044394398616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230214177532458,0.13761137783723595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09774512137252388,0.0,0.0,0.09725424256842644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18444167008487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19516110674827652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748130688985456,0.05543974096935725,0.08500732906516947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058742691766469575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07472714317179127,0.0,0.0,0.051032859292180134,0.06867705825845165,0.06940265057459329,0.0,0.07779358043661873,0.0,0.0,0.09659861330531816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31494487432233964,0.17573438197602814,0.0,0.06146267649010478,0.0,0.0,0.05571726792389649
COVID19_support,bychelsea13,2020/04/04,"Mom Has Covid Symptoms Refuses Test and Does Not Stay Home My mom (57) for the past week has had possible symptoms of Covid-19 (cough, fever, body aches, loss of appetite). She refuses to get a test because she is convinced it's just allergies (my mother has never suffered from allergies before, also fever and body aches is not a symptom of allergies). I've tried to talk to her gently a few times this week asking her to get a test, asking her to keep taking her temp to monitor, and asking her to please stay home so she doesn't potentially expose others. She refuses to do any of these things. She keeps saying she's fine it's just allergies. She goes out to stores regularly and visits family. I am having a lot of guilt because I almost feel in some way responsible that I am unable to convince my mom she needs to get a test and stay home for the sake of other's lives. I know a lot of people are dealing with stubborn parents now. What can we do? Do we just have to sit back and let them infect everyone by their stubbornness? Or is there some sort of convincing argument that works?",4.3094894366197165,5.7997355915493,5.169011150234745,81.71436179577466,71.01877934272302,8.517488262910799,26.927523474178404,9.017664075816787,2.127986150234742,863,29,165,17,16,281,122,213,0.07400000000000001,0.8290000000000001,0.09699999999999999,0.6281,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,2,0,2,2,8,9,2,1,9,0,18,9,2,0,1,33,30,9,0,1,6,5,1,0,0,0,7,1,3,0,10,10,0,7,2,0,1,1,4,5,0,0,1,2,24,4,27,28,5,15,0,2,0,0,32,2,0,7,7,111,34,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757793470629674,0.0,0.0,0.08591357534501716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305765128378901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3013041081160861,0.0,0.0,0.08260881100105136,0.0,0.13097947172723792,0.0,0.09141697863302686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23866614353635196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11075798892589464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940147339156932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265617115943967,0.0,0.0,0.1012776157477538,0.0,0.05432100129321345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168386835480351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32329008366753464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19098153746868815,0.0,0.0,0.05904198512792558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985681043299934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09486469340125836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18267020747347615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3774702508988161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07965969274931113,0.08285841646356866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11929086073912558,0.0,0.10255629116302124,0.07448003316888899,0.0,0.0,0.1179284093694136,0.0,0.1211137816766402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08543448080455564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3435256278241152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349898993877162,0.08077572310434261,0.08635001714559591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137324961473099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06264464088437682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0729394829265693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08527476299866524,0.17235142940908638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821199741669721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,maamo,2020/04/04,"Worried for my family. I live with my parents and brother. My father is the only one working (the rest of us are off). My mother has recently finished her chemotherapy (breast cancer) and is immunocompromised. My father works in a condo in our city so he is around a lot of people everyday. He has his own office and stays in there all day, and has limited all socializing with the residents to phone and email only, no in person contact. However he refuses to take any extra steps/actions to stay healthy/safe: he refuses to change his clothes or shower when he gets home, there are times when he will wear the same pair of pants to work two days in a row, etc. My poor mom has been crying to him about this and they get into screaming matches everyday about his lack of care and how he is putting us all at risk. He knows if she contracts this my mother can die. He can die too, he smokes a pack a day, and has sleep apnia and other breathing problems. I feel like there is a giant clock over our heads, counting down. Hopeless. My brother and I are in our 20's and I'm worried about our own lives too. I've been trying to limit contact with my family as much as possible: I only leave my room to use the bathroom and to bring food back up/down. I don't stay in the same room as any family member for more than a minute or two (literally) and I use tissues/elbows to open doors, etc. I wash my hands everytime I leave my room and again before returning to my room. And even with all these precautions I am still absolutely terrified.

I've never had this much anxiety and absolute fear in my entire left. I feel like I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. My life and the lives of my family are all in jeopardy because my father is too lazy and selfish to take the minimum amount of care and preventative action.",4.631025641025642,5.315494098901098,5.626098901098904,81.73973443223444,69.54945054945054,8.923809523809524,28.07875457875457,9.075114841892004,2.1304545787545783,1428,47,288,26,24,472,189,364,0.147,0.823,0.03,-0.9899,3,0,1,0,0,1,40.0,6,0,1,5,18,10,0,2,15,0,25,10,6,3,6,53,40,30,2,3,3,9,3,2,0,1,3,1,8,1,6,27,1,5,4,0,1,3,4,6,0,3,3,4,41,4,48,36,19,46,0,1,0,1,40,23,0,4,19,195,47,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479988569840147,0.0,0.07019614463987764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168584935998965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055777176961946,0.0,0.055936040966127434,0.0,0.07808099688270778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871108597663429,0.0,0.0970699072475702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10079404524878736,0.17753281602664606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904647745273919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08127211932408847,0.0,0.20467329906934384,0.060606610962903165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3460126255641318,0.10325550461763357,0.09279322060439722,0.13110671682095099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109565495892378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958816197518354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417222712346927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204275614338836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085778649999988,0.0,0.0,0.19432117017175665,0.09969750251822054,0.0,0.06481279778588375,0.08965859667975401,0.0,0.2430772688127321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780110659615869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10746819655190164,0.0,0.0,0.13490830800619452,0.0,0.07077096458819812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062178947045419035,0.20936283205937356,0.0,0.0,0.10188861483704878,0.0,0.0,0.0636148265305171,0.08012128785572713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10344560661437363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08780192228546885,0.0,0.0922441387603056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09060192456766436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182626247786184,0.09353775879152657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934118352668297,0.07327965014468706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379841923944323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053505990711491744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06229901298617446,0.0,0.17927236276975445,0.0,0.2207519505641243,0.1585023471987529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20040710657256,0.1863734571164323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Noahontheblock,2020/04/04,"Anxiety from a friendly hug :( I know I’m probably doing some more harm to myself for freaking out, but my anxiety has been my worst enemy these past few weeks.

I asked my friend to help bring me some green nuggets (which has been helping my anxiety). I told him before that I couldn’t really hang with him (even though I miss him), because I have high anxiety and any trying not to have prolonged contact with anyone. He came by and called that he was outside my house. I thought “ok, I’ll go outside, say hi real quick, keep my distance and go back inside”. I go out, he hands me what he brought really quick, and then says “I’m going to give you a hug, I’m not sick and I miss I you”, and before I could say anything, I get a quick hug.  Then I back away say thanks and bye and start walking inside. I wipe down what he gave me, threw my clothes in the wash and took a shower.

I feel so bad and stupid, but my anxiety is controlling me and I’m so worried about getting it, even though he hasn’t shown symptoms and it was so brief.

COVID19_support,hushpuppylife,2020/04/04,"I feel guilty for seeing a friend during this crisis Background info: I normally live right outside a major US. city but when this virus stuff got bad, I left to head back to my parents in NC. I felt it’d be easier to social distance, more space, and it gave my parents peace of mind that I was safe.
Anyways, while at home, I’ve been pretty isolated at home outside of getting my car fixed, going to our (very rural and isolated) family property land, and a few supply runs for food/beer, though I’ve been Mostly eating what my mom already has in the house.

I feel bad. Today, I was walking around the neighborhood alone and my good friend (whom I’m know for like 15 years drives) by with his girlfriend. I hop in his car so he can drive home and park so we can walk around. This is like just down the street  from me, so we didn’t leave the community. We walk around the area and it’s fairly easy to not be all up in somebody’s business and avoid close contact. 

However, at the end of our walk, he invited me in for a quick bit to his house. I felt hesitant but went inside for a short bit. I touched a few things but didn’t touch any person. When I left I went home and washed hands.

I made a mistake and I’m pretty certain everybody will be okay, but I still feel guilty. Do y’all feel bad when you leave the house, get supplies, etc? Have you made mistakes?

I’m currently in a low-spread area but still feel bad.",3.0981126140295667,4.367623826989622,3.864669707455175,90.75210994023277,73.70588235294117,7.053853413022964,23.51698647373388,7.520522993642371,0.8112961937716263,1102,30,241,13,22,351,163,289,0.15,0.705,0.145,0.3002,4,2,1,0,0,0,39.0,6,3,0,0,16,15,0,1,15,1,17,4,2,2,2,44,38,22,0,3,7,3,10,2,3,1,1,0,4,1,11,17,1,2,9,0,0,12,3,7,0,0,14,11,33,8,31,19,9,48,0,0,1,0,25,24,0,1,14,141,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09504457628377387,0.10126891357974674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062405783484488414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2450804854689708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07056437597777734,0.306491735328652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2003750500947684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09390217071017402,0.0,0.0,0.08127972639528684,0.0,0.10234622824611303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08651125308735418,0.0,0.23200476512698254,0.0,0.1762244622990179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096693512341199,0.0,0.14180035954445802,0.0,0.09589059427242293,0.0,0.052154200665195764,0.07697113369382992,0.07339571923956603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09418104164488936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3682054853852119,0.0,0.0,0.31766587193199863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050433613394922916,0.0,0.0,0.1943393586352684,0.19941366841094796,0.0,0.0,0.08966698872531847,0.0,0.08103334028252476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17366730467331046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266010879365874,0.10747825557619596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08991372726365507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037963032248752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08012878720908831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18672328111998848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07836986867505509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312767952666195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935465139267043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14657301824137725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10505307237279594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060966969013820226,0.0,0.09016216710233743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698588669618422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11038630647447527,0.0,0.0,0.07571869195952867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17014079211390948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05909595885772164
COVID19_support,b3len,2020/04/04,"Is it possible I already had the coronavirus or am I just paranoid? F20, CA USA little background about this situation: first of all i work at a movie theatre which means i was already exposed to different people. i had co workers that were also getting sick but not sure how bad. around the same time i became sick, my whole family did too, only one of my brothers that i know of tested positive for the flu. we all had flu symptoms and a cough but they didn’t come down with it as bad as i did. 


feb 12, i began developing a slight minor cough that started out with wheezing, later that night i felt a bit hot but it went away, i also had head congestion that night. 
- days went by and my cough kept progressing and getting worse and worse. (i don’t recall between this time if i kept feeling getting hot flashes)

feb 22 i developed a high fever along with my cough, although i didn’t check how high it was i know it was pretty high enough to give me hallucinating and or confusion symptoms during the night when i went to sleep. my cough at this point was already terribly bad. i would cough constantly day and night to the point where my chest was in pain and my throat became sore and irritated. i was also coughing up a bit of phlegm. 

feb 24 i visited my doctor, got tested for the flu and came out negative. they checked my temperature and although i was still getting chills and feeling internally hot, my temp was normal. he ordered an x ray to check my lungs to make sure my cough wasn’t developing into pneumonia but i never got my x ray done to this day. 

march 12: i was still coughing a bit but it was nearly gone by then.


TLDR: feb 12 began having a minor cough. feb 22 i developed a high fever along with my cough that worsened each day since then, along with chest pain and a sore throat. feb 24 got tested negative for the flu. took about a month to fully recover.",3.130702493261456,5.07150548247979,4.230214791105123,85.38378579851755,75.0377358490566,7.225101078167117,25.340380727762803,8.07648339933343,1.5156582884097038,1478,51,293,24,32,481,171,371,0.191,0.7490000000000001,0.06,-0.9949,1,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,1,0,2,4,14,9,0,1,19,0,26,35,7,3,5,58,53,32,0,3,10,1,6,0,0,1,28,0,0,0,17,28,0,2,6,0,3,8,8,7,0,2,35,6,42,2,41,17,9,52,0,0,0,0,7,19,0,4,24,192,59,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742397251392239,0.19873535772181666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07374293803626265,0.0,0.0,0.07782855858598141,0.0,0.20749755843826712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27131128754272216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474403243741177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135717176777671,0.0,0.0895179095051421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21369333944994776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08654755698424735,0.0,0.08478769191166635,0.0,0.08477152360183997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08559328190088365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07809182314519167,0.0,0.083770258506573,0.0,0.07953699115776086,0.0,0.0,0.07046153562808037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17311670012797406,0.0794652787373689,0.0,0.0,0.1987581495559733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501517415701054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500894695915425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105064780029164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830249377171868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05529467484344278,0.0,0.0,0.09023432271596094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0661201026023301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06388938717395852,0.0,0.0,0.3109495307020306,0.08116316244672135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056132834206364834,0.06300165194916857,0.17628988207097154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05742909264924995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15661642688300087,0.09338683527754067,0.0,0.08427551865182446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06852403645248832,0.09311282134409014,0.08289732477609894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05863280923309822,0.0,0.13230826984791108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15614672780446842,0.17219976191360445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660642543404853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203551106899074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303735786972045,0.0,0.09248511103725383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060306686971275475,0.0,0.16883698007904369,0.058845383648185375,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,DinosaurRetard,2020/04/04,"Struggling with school and my future surrounding the pandemic Well, I was kinda expecting another recession to happen soon, but this is unprecedented. I lost my summer internship, and I'm supposed to graduate in December. My major is Communications, and I'm minoring in Broadcasting. What a great time to be that major, huh? My capstone, which I'm scheduled to take in the Fall and is required to graduate, is to take part in the production of a public-access show. Guess what? It's no longer running for the forseeable future. All but 1 of my classes for next semester are hands on, practicum style courses that I don't see being able to be taught online.

My school has been completely uncommunicative with me, and now I'm wondering if I'll even be able to graduate. My motivation for every class has just dropped, and I've started drinking a lot more. If I do graduate, I'm going to be competing with every other person who lost their jobs recently. As a result of losing the internship, my resumé is going to be pretty barren as far as experience goes. I feel like how I felt when I first dropped out of college, but worse. I feel that I'm going to be living with my parents until I'm 30 while working for the grocery store I worked at in high school, or god forbid, the Amazon warehouse. I've had really bad ankles as a result of a dozen corrective surgeries for club feet, and I had to quit my last grocery store job because I ruptured my achilles tendon. Amazon sucks as a company regardless and I'd rather start selling drugs again than work for them, thats besides the point though. However, the thought of doing that kind of work and not being able to walk when I'm older because of it is much more tangible now, especially with this worthless degree which I only took because it was easy and my dad found success with it.

Luckily, I have money saved and I won't graduate with debt, but I really feel fucked in terms of my future college career and the future job market. As a result of my ""cushy"" financial situation, I am ineligible for a stimulus check and have to resort to mooching off my parents. I know I wasn't going to be making 50k a year out of college with this degree, but I expected to be in something better than wageslave retail or unreliable gig/contract work. This pandemic is making me rethink every decision I've ever made about college and how they were all wrong. I now think that I should've just fucking learned a trade like everyone else in my neighborhood.

This pandemic has also made me lose faith in the US government completely. These old pricks in DC have really shown all of us that in times of crisis, they really don't give a fuck about the average citizen. I'm just worried that this pandemic is going to happen again due to the complete lack of food safety and the practice of illegal animal poaching in China, and it's going to be much worse. 

So what's the point of all of this? In the past week, I've had 2 neighbors taken from their homes in ambulances, and I saw the aftermath of a woman's suicide when she jumped from the parking garage at the hospital after losing a loved one. People are giving their lives for soulless corporations who won't even pay them a living wage. All day, all I can hear are sirens. A good friend of mine who lives in another city was just diagnosed with the virus today. I haven't slept for more than 4 hours in the past two weeks. I can't take it much more of this, and I don't know if I want to live in the aftermath of this.",6.849147832817337,6.679118795588237,7.440417956656347,73.59095975232202,64.72058823529412,10.804953560371516,33.63003095975232,10.426177893888326,3.469632352941176,2791,107,510,62,38,925,314,680,0.122,0.7659999999999999,0.11199999999999999,-0.8696,9,0,3,0,0,1,65.0,2,0,7,17,25,28,5,1,38,1,48,13,5,10,8,87,102,44,1,9,16,3,5,2,2,2,2,1,2,3,33,29,2,2,14,3,10,11,10,16,1,4,21,8,57,12,98,68,19,82,1,6,2,4,25,28,5,9,43,348,90,34,0.19727528735173336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05258699200719432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13790689302497566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05490554158147992,0.12025718412659933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058157986752142364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20683938546888453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04240874672151298,0.0,0.0,0.06674342134994453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06441822603947257,0.07625890085647656,0.0,0.05493272959013197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686564449884898,0.059482263877663324,0.1662129380072113,0.06283499703709773,0.0,0.06432436172992077,0.0,0.0,0.0997483127441984,0.04697783490051485,0.06313840425130803,0.0,0.0,0.05593408621441905,0.0795153535093488,0.07210072338645647,0.05080479921514682,0.1823778243050476,0.0,0.12616295436449393,0.2242321840255423,0.05515505045600691,0.0,0.0724989002494101,0.0724403233434962,0.0,0.11629992339566422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411452879219034,0.0,0.0,0.06947739075065577,0.0659610660191816,0.0,0.06475880665365301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19576528262039253,0.0,0.0,0.06847728474590416,0.07227822582269437,0.053601896391173895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06425249376026257,0.0,0.2903294883039836,0.0,0.0,0.22070058548236526,0.1435661866519513,0.05590546489180279,0.05934954965879756,0.12444443120607165,0.0877885241166623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450200349890092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06993483537930269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06900240960013375,0.0,0.04455961341136669,0.05001224853196719,0.0,0.0,0.14603390709856098,0.07120997062183823,0.125547722627518,0.04558861499150837,0.0574177238843265,0.0,0.0,0.12432594103692668,0.0,0.0,0.06689996299424185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06994218373122363,0.0,0.0,0.16850613413327195,0.0,0.06492851559727987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996531228248924,0.05240095423392551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391522949795845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050624051400629186,0.0,0.0,0.09308830917192568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874498779902193,0.0,0.07192904842933602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832646487606932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04213534616933795,0.06460732273391186,0.05220484743128159,0.07668853766708816,0.0,0.06233130187184874,0.0,0.07306003431565143,0.0,0.0,0.06423643017408634,0.0,0.15819858721244154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03878602523550093,0.0,0.10549489070110972,0.0,0.059124725046260776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07131221131086828,0.23936459788232425,0.06678087675867128,0.13402691434047964,0.0,0.07189651930856307,0.0,0.04234627237671861
COVID19_support,matry_oshka,2020/04/04,"Should I do an in-store pickup? Hey! Like everyone, I am very nervous about the coronavirus. I was in Ireland for study abroad, but came home 3 weeks ago, did my quarantine, and am fine. I'm home with my family, and my dad is going to work but we're staying home. My parents are going on walks with friends (across the street but still make me nervous). I turned 21 recently and haven't had a chance to really enjoy being able to buy alcohol/drink legally in America. That, and the fact I wanted to help support small businesses, I ordered some wine for pickup at a local winery. However, I am now second guessing myself. It's definitely an unnecessary trip, while I live in a rural area that is not a hotspot, but still have cases. 

Should I cancel my order? Is taking a trip to this store (even with gloves/mask/sanitizing) too risky? Honestly, even if they can't refund me it's fine, it wasn't a big amount and if any bit helps them stay in business that's fine by me. I want to buy some but I'm seriously reconsidering the idea of going into a store. What are peoples thoughts? How are you handling in-store pickups, if at all?",3.109452442766109,4.986774313901347,4.491404295492097,83.7660514514987,74.91928251121075,7.5646919990559365,25.189756903469444,8.371475516178862,1.6544403587443948,884,30,175,16,19,293,138,223,0.047,0.775,0.177,0.9835,2,1,4,0,0,0,38.0,0,1,2,1,8,11,0,2,13,0,20,1,0,2,2,32,34,15,0,7,9,2,0,1,1,2,0,0,3,0,8,10,1,0,2,1,5,7,4,3,0,1,6,0,22,8,23,25,5,32,0,0,0,0,9,14,0,6,8,112,30,2,0.14774479801435547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13096684902872,0.1578942570151132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047152903476432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16129905386447782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689806892651325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14473365502201627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951680913482114,0.0,0.0,0.1411764859669392,0.0,0.0,0.13928064661763942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141472644490734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519003204752937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16275755190862334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19806044756468424,0.0,0.4446002363487081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1667858933995847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218064543180515,0.0,0.13046136345685472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09862079993174076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16405311377690765,0.0,0.0,0.10242764013820264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946491008297652,0.0,0.14588016397393566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31495259322482283,0.23597837308800035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16765904593162195,0.0,0.0,0.11108570103981501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172928663693137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16070391425286162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12190493144881515,0.17428741960917776,0.0,0.11851196513828074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075599725865025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Candleboss,2020/04/04,"Upending my life Hey, I’m glad this sub exists. Just looking to get things off my chest in a sense of community honestly. 

When a new coronavirus first started to make appearances on the news here and there, I shrugged it off from my comfy apartment in suburban Japan. I was planning to see my long distance boyfriend in the US soon (where I’m also from), teaching English in public schools, traveling and enjoying a foreign culture and new places every weekend. It was a life I’d worked very hard for and spent my college years dreaming of while saving pennies from my myriad of miserable retail jobs. However, I had decided back in January that since teaching isn’t my passion, I would move back to the states later this year and start a new career (and be closer to loved ones again). 

My work contract would be up this summer, and I’d leave Japan fulfilled with the time I spent there with all the closure I needed.

This month and last, life has gotten darker and darker. Japan has avoided taking a stance on the virus and now it’s catching up. My fellow foreign coworkers find out at work about their friends and family back home being sick or dying. Some of them hop on a plane and leave, others can’t because their home countries are shut down. I don’t want to end up in that situation. 

So today, I sit in my apartment wondering how I’m going to even begin to pack up my life here so abruptly and painfully. The US embassy has made it very clear that staying means risking not coming back this summer - staying indefinitely. I have family. No job waiting for me, but I won’t have one here soon, either. It’s valid and arguable that there will be available and affordable flights in a few months, but I can’t risk it. Not looking for opinions here - I know the US is a shitshow but this is my choice and my work agrees that the risk is high, Japan is rapidly worsening, and the best anyone can hope for right now is to be near to those they love. My family is okay with the risk of me catching it and spreading it to them during travel. 

I can’t say goodbye to my students or most of my friends here because of the virus. No farewell parties or goodbye hugs. I can’t go to my favorite places or eat most of my favorite foods one last time. I just.... leave. Never in a million years did I think I’d leave early or like this 

My bf, who is in the military, might be doing disaster relief soon too. I’m proud of him but damn is that hard to process. We’re in a solid LDR, but I don’t know when I’ll get to see him. My emotions 

I know I don’t have it nearly as bad as others. I’m grateful that I’m healthy, my family is healthy, and that I have a home waiting for me. I’m glad to have the love and support of an amazing partner. I’m glad I’ve had the experiences I’ve had abroad before this started. 

But I’m sad, too. Sad to see my hopes, dreams, and expectations for the year taken away from me. Sad to see the world crumbling. Wondering when I can travel again. I know it’ll happen, I just wish it didn’t have to be like this now. 

2020 might have taken what I had from me - but I’ll make what comes next even better.

COVID19_support,ninebubblewaters,2020/04/05,"Has anyone had to have a Dr visit or imaging/blood work? Nervous. Ugh I've done everything I could to keep family safe and avoid this. We havnt left the house in a probably two months. 

My husband is having medical issues that most likely will require an in person urology exam and visit and then to an imaging lab for an ultrasound and blood work.

I'm beyond nervous and just angry about it.

Has anyone been in this situation? Are the offices taking good precautions?

COVID19_support,KurdtC,2020/04/05,"I'm overwhelmed For the past few weeks my anxiety is going higher and higher, but today...I woke up in the morning worried because my nose was weird, that made my respiration goes weird too. I stayed like this all day and then i decided to go bed and lay down a bit to see if i relax. Then i suffocate. I suffocate while sleeping, i coudnt breath, i was out of air. I tried to wake up and fall asleep again and keep suffocating until i woke up and while my breath was still heavy, i wasnt suffocating.

That never happened to me before. I dont have a cough, i dont have a fever or a sore throat, but i'm scared in a way i never was before. I'm having some chest and back pain for the past month because of Acid reflux, so it doenst help too.

My breath is starting to come back to normal as i write this, but i'm still worried. I'm only 24, i dont want to die. I finally got a job i like, i'm about to move in with my girlfriend. All of this is scaring me so much. I dont fear death, i fear dying now, at 24 before i could do these things.

I'm hopeless.

COVID19_support,JakeNBake_89,2020/04/05,"Nervous but optimistic. Hello everyone,

I  am from a part of Upstate New York that gets a lot of tourism during the summer season and I usually work there during the summer. The news and some of the projections floating around have got me scared that our area won't even have a summer, which would effectively cripple the local economy. We're probably not going to have foreign workers as usual here during the summer and I've accepted that it will be a slower summer this year as well. I've also read through the local newspaper and the UW models and they have said that we would be out of this around mid-may hopefully and that's about as long as I could mentally handle it. I also plan to transfer out of community college this fall and I would be devastated if I'm not able to go away for school in August. I'm just nervously hoping that these lockdowns and restrictions are somewhat eased around then so I could just have a taste of normalcy.",7.415769230769229,7.223665851648357,7.587120879120878,73.08287912087914,63.560439560439555,10.796483516483518,33.58461538461537,10.355215969177356,3.438974065934066,763,28,135,16,10,248,112,182,0.069,0.815,0.11599999999999999,0.8364,2,1,0,0,0,0,10.0,2,0,1,4,13,7,0,3,13,0,17,1,0,1,0,34,26,18,0,8,6,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,13,14,1,1,2,1,0,3,3,3,1,0,2,2,10,4,24,14,4,26,0,0,0,0,5,10,0,6,13,103,23,7,0.15340919105140674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24536254931719165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40970011401895945,0.0,0.0,0.1441329849145596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24496951207012144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101325323852915,0.0,0.0,0.14658905625607244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014997059350006,0.0,0.17437195718141912,0.0,0.12269534428011765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3047398828205256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1357623065747835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130423008267319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15460038235300438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14816355267062525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16612720429213942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1654010547212706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534507057572108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14592727104115366,0.0,0.15358936269221785,0.15525829146985032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.337917100911726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13793328645840672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168371818007128,0.0,0.0,0.3269324633946036,0.0,0.0,0.09879048931920643
COVID19_support,ItsColdInHere,2020/04/05,"Guilt about how self-isolation is impacting my family I’m currently in self-isolation from my wife and 15 month old daughter. Five days ago I felt nauseous and fatigued, like I had a cold coming. Then yesterday morning I woke up with a sore throat that I still have. I also have the dry feeling in my windpipe that I associate with having a dry cough, but I haven’t had any coughing. (Or sneezing or fever.)

So I’m isolated in our bedroom, and I feel terrible because I’ve left my wife to handle all the child care duties, and most of the other household tasks. And she thinks I’m overreacting to my symptoms.    

And I also miss spending time with my little girl. Spending more time with her while working from home has been one of the good parts of the pandemic.

We also recently moved to a new town for my work, so she has fewer friends nearby and had to change jobs to one she is less fond of. So there are underlying stresses.

Is anyone else in a similar situation? How have you dealt with it?",3.624519230769231,5.441691153846153,4.654407051282053,83.40007211538463,73.35897435897436,7.951923076923077,28.08493589743589,8.660442795831766,2.1641858974358974,785,31,152,15,16,256,122,195,0.09300000000000001,0.8109999999999999,0.096,0.3925,2,2,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,1,0,2,11,10,0,2,10,0,15,7,1,2,1,26,26,20,0,0,3,3,3,1,1,0,6,0,2,2,4,14,0,1,4,0,2,2,1,5,0,3,6,4,23,5,24,20,5,24,0,2,0,0,13,9,0,3,14,106,27,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13710838858663385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3710761149487836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10518302568133768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815104195043844,0.15848089003551355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428729843024043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15769955443406708,0.0,0.1636236522136017,0.13323719733045178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09975136672020253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292095446788408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14581205213894405,0.0,0.15641475392811774,0.0,0.1485104513453051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11950006895831147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12973247478019634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15514975080357984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534892053124883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1680527976296622,0.0,0.0,0.07556547367286616,0.15502310049469534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12345860885022655,0.1643930485733547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14938426328719498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16230342079665688,0.0,0.2096210183949108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16749591635610622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15272104626136404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3227155945779963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17385906761820336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12352215356535033,0.0,0.17717753656619253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607645951342235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910828997660984,0.0,0.0,0.18038228043615387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22520774726013126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,cruciger,2020/04/05,"COVID-19 related eating difficulties Ever since this event began I've had a bit of psychological difficulty and stress related to eating.

Previously, I tended to eat out quite a bit and purchase groceries multiple times a week at different stores, as most stores in the area are small and limited in selection, and as I walk there isn't so much I can carry at once. Physical distancing has thrown that routine into disarray, and stress and lack of activity have tanked my appetite, and cooking and eating have become intensely stressful.

The following is, essentially, my anxiety monologue.

&gt;There are so many competing priorities: eat nourishing foods? Try to drop weight to minimize social risks? Buy the things you enjoy, given that so many other stresses occur? Get delivery to minimize social contacts (despite 2-3 week waits and high costs) or go to the store to preserve delivery spots for others? Is it responsible to go to a grocery store when other shoppers' actions make it impossible to maintain 6' physical distance? Is it responsible to shop at the store with good social distancing/PPE if it requires taking public transit? We should shop when we *have* to -- when do you *have* to? When your normal staple foods are gone? When you're out of proteins? When you're out of vegetables? When you're out of your 2-week food stockpile? How much food is it responsible to keep on hand, balancing the competing priorities of ""go to the store less"" and ""don't hoard things so others can have them?"" It feels more responsible to buy foods such as rice and flour that allow you to get a lot of food in one shop and less responsible to buy bulky unnecessary foods such as soda, but where do you draw the line -- is meat a luxury or necessity? How about ice cream or baked goods? If one store doesn't have meat, is it okay to go to another just for meat? Should we be eating half as much food so we can reduce grocery store workers' and farmers' exposures to half?

As a result of all this I have been shopping and eating rather bizarrely; collecting different kinds of tinned meats and ramen, not eating them so I can still have them, and eating plain rice or cucumber sandwiches for most meals.

I may be predisposed to this because I had some food insecurity/malnutrition issues early in my life, and some years ago, I went through a very similar ""restrictive eating due to guilt"" thing about climate change. I thought I had beat that, but I guess when I'm stressed it comes back. I dealt with that by saying I won't think about climate impacts unduly when I buy groceries, but I can't repeat that strategy in this situation.

Would appreciate any reassurance about what's ""reasonable"", or failing that, commiseration.",6.672902761104442,8.233539987755108,6.839567827130853,71.69522208883555,65.44897959183673,10.499399759903962,33.18727490996399,10.59048541779884,3.8244225690276115,2174,92,365,58,34,698,248,490,0.062,0.8859999999999999,0.052000000000000005,-0.6415,2,0,0,0,0,0,71.0,4,6,3,8,30,14,0,7,16,1,39,28,1,6,2,70,61,50,0,8,13,0,3,0,0,5,1,1,1,0,27,29,26,5,4,5,18,10,6,8,0,4,9,5,31,6,63,45,15,51,0,1,1,0,20,18,0,14,22,247,58,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04858094789064744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03726898946359464,0.05746737405206935,0.04192534889480391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042141334311980784,0.0,0.03340835946660653,0.06052734590531721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196648005005075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057975972176521666,0.047209287537623316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145182299725968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5607876090003762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04957387455756111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02771083916980374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.596429172827356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05726625559448429,0.0,0.12458680888488592,0.09193495251443516,0.0,0.0,0.060373416683089424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0579040411229716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057201736296217276,0.0,0.04871282324703622,0.0,0.05707052998214164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038710091187513514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04659288875299681,0.0,0.0,0.03658247852757927,0.11112647168335403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12086300275430407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05369684614014352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058365082391967874,0.0742739950225071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05829141018749301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05634822948070967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04358279672260944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04533490972220599,0.06160263709130834,0.0,0.16759908363734885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043767003372715815,0.0,0.3138922701974848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04120621892970678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922917070826328,0.03511655793286912,0.0,0.04350870980932535,0.03195698766719817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03720870809425463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045219512924443435,0.0,0.0,0.13188276984976144,0.06673720636194111,0.0,0.05080438890889859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03893159675596119,0.0,0.0,0.03529234864196346
COVID19_support,NevrDrinksNDraws,2020/04/05,"I lost my job today. 17 years with the same company and today, I was laid off along with 57 other employees. This was round one. If the situation doesn't improve soon, there will be additional layoffs. It's hard enough starting over after so many years - but now, with a pandemic - I just don't know what's going to happen next. I will lose my healthcare in two weeks. Even if I wanted to sell my house and move, I can't due to the virus. I'm literally stuck and I have no idea what it's going to be like or how long it will take before we come out on the other side of this thing. I suspect it will be an employee's nightmare with few openings and a massive number of employees competing for the limited number of jobs. Everyone says the same thing, ""it will be okay - everything will work out."" How? Just how is it going to work out?

COVID19_support,rose_tyger,2020/04/05,"Travel between states I’m in a tourist heavy suburb in Fl, and the place is a ghost town since the parks closed and such. Myself and the people I’m sheltering-in-place with have been doing all the things (social distancing, curb-side grocery pick up, washing hands, in general our absolute best, etc.) to keep to ourselves to keep our house “clean” and each other as safe as we can. I happened to be visiting said friends when all this hit the fan or I’d be with my Mom now 

My elderly mother (71) is in N GA. She lives alone except for one tiny little goblin dog she likes to call a Chihuahua. Now that we are going to be sheltering in place for quite some time (at least another month) what are the odds of me getting to her without being told to turn around or arrested? 

I understand that I may be bringing the virus with me but I’m hoping I can maybe quarantine myself and luggage in her basement away from her for the recommended amount of time.

The place I’m staying is starting to unravel all the progress I’ve made on my mental health since January. It’s not a mentally healthy place to be. But I’d I have to stay, I’ll stay. 

My mom is really active. Socially and in her church, which of course they’ve canceled. She’s bored and has taken into haunting whatever stores are still open on a regular basis. While that’s her prerogative as a grown adult, she is elderly, maybe weighs 110 pounds soaking wet and carrying A 10 pound bowling ball, and it’s going to get worse to be outside the longer the quarantine goes on.  

Have I also mentioned she loves to garden with really sharp shears and shovels and all that stuff that I’m having nightmares over her getting hurt doing? I’m hoping that by being there with her, as well as being company and and safety in numbers and all that, I can introduce her to the joys of shopping online which she is not comfortable doing hardly at all. And this is the time to be doing it. 

I don’t want her falling and hurting herself outside and no one finding her (its N Ga, of *course* she lives on a damn mountain). I’m worried something will happen inside and there’s no one coming to check on her or no one is expecting her because all that’s been put on hold. 

I can make the trip (in a perfect world) in one day with one stop for gas. I haven’t made the choice for or against, I’m just gathering information since all anyone in my “shelter” ever does is play video games and I don’t know which news source to reuse.

COVID19_support,Shadow6553,2020/04/05,"I'm losing my mind Hello everyone

I have chronic depression and a couple of anxiety disorders. I can only afford to see a psychiatrist so I do counselling instead of therapy. I haven't seen my counsellor since the virus started spreading and she's been calling me to check up on me once a month.

My depression prevents me from going out but when I do, I shouldn't. It's like even god doesn't want me to go out, even for a short walk at a park.

I've been at home alone like 99.5% of the time in my room because I don't have any friends. Everything I know is from the Internet and I just absorb all this information with no outlets as if my depression wasn't bad enough. I don't feel like I can function most of the time.

Can all this be over already? I feel like we're in WW3 against this virus and it's almost like the apocalypse. Just looking at the death toll makes me feel hopeless.",2.4246428571428567,4.277541725274728,3.82317307692308,87.91245192307693,76.80219780219781,7.4071428571428575,26.759615384615394,8.278499904357787,1.7453065934065943,702,28,148,13,16,231,108,182,0.243,0.716,0.04,-0.9882,1,1,0,0,0,1,15.0,0,0,0,1,7,12,0,0,11,0,17,1,0,1,2,25,30,9,1,3,4,0,3,5,1,1,1,0,2,0,5,7,0,1,5,0,1,3,7,6,0,0,4,6,23,6,23,24,4,20,0,5,3,0,5,12,0,3,10,97,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15042411560343552,0.15558311748404025,0.1657720397628696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10215508052307788,0.0,0.11491825922703022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542782957744075,0.09157301286070203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15339191000596225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16621610850716428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38815404871496784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17216568936400162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15521791662573076,0.0,0.19843842607703696,0.0,0.0,0.14354211019250745,0.13500848490927755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22786797126752525,0.21463508782896534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11605997344033067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707475259851234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15068339386330534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255724950090121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3669507032058023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12614737271644802,0.16805829688698712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10027333967209157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15167986597662314,0.0,0.1199045572863737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15997991298668504,0.0,0.1142494474140312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197062767807221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242639368502946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10632683188400398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717902155061527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17518954473431886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860393364857873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,shaikspear,2020/04/05,"Lockdown and its psychological effects Ever since the first few cases hit India, I’ve kept myself indoors (since March 8th) for the sake of my grandparents and the day before we were give a 21 day lockdown by the Indian government. 

Now the thing is, I’ve lived a very hectic life for the past 2 years. For one year, I slept for as little as 5 hours, with studies and assignments, all of a sudden the lockdown (even though voluntary for 2 weeks before the mandatory one) is starting to get on my nerves.

I’m snappier than usual, I feel mentally suffocated, I started talking to more people than usual but it felt like a waste of time so I quit social media for a while and put my head into learning music, new languages and reading books and watching something on prime/netflix. 

I thought doing all this would be liberating, I usually revel in the joy of learning new things, but I feel nothing. It all feels like a to-do list to me. Do you guys have any suggestions to cope for the next 2-3 weeks!",5.817728842832468,6.335959611398966,6.456593264248706,77.41818868739206,66.87564766839378,9.127633851468048,31.627374784110536,9.075114841892004,2.6768276338514667,787,30,145,13,12,258,126,193,0.027000000000000003,0.9009999999999999,0.07200000000000001,0.8497,1,3,1,0,0,0,24.0,1,1,0,3,5,3,0,0,16,0,8,3,2,1,4,25,21,13,0,1,2,0,4,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,6,9,0,1,8,2,0,1,0,0,0,3,5,5,14,3,25,13,5,29,0,0,1,0,7,5,0,0,25,91,20,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08899227884113155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22271192983531574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16879342240719114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643470131793145,0.11837434101000285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198506916485876,0.09348955278269767,0.12565034530365882,0.0,0.0,0.11131319092437747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06837124724068537,0.12553705599947912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295763294664699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134304627738445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12887507237428805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243339512303926,0.12786747025572667,0.1311605070939545,0.11555566185052693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13188053454156815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527793040144459,0.13917577294459216,0.0,0.0,0.1255679202582916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773542070987573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1249248764464047,0.0907248968915763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131554865969277,0.0,0.13919039673762632,0.13089981274971002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21650476631125445,0.0,0.0,0.13339977462265667,0.0,0.10074580779458728,0.0,0.0,0.18525299031363934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051838468486667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1738809835766296,0.0,0.12857360756773914,0.10389171509873033,0.07630808343166709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4323859412962449,0.10797683439104667,0.0,0.0,0.20994305449351885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929623143557814,0.0,0.0,0.1685447647767326
COVID19_support,applepiehobbit,2020/04/05,"I don't know what I (22F) should do if my partner (21M) were to get it... My partner (21M) and I (22F) are in a kind of studio appartment. We only have a one double bed, no couch and no other rooms except for the toilet and the bathroom. I'm generally pretty worried about this, I have a history of having quite some health anxiety at times. 
We're social distancing. I'm only going out to get some fresh air, while making sure I keep a distance from other people and once every 6 days I go and buy groceries. However my SO is mailman and has to deliver mail for about 2.5 hours 5 days a week, so he has to go outside. He desinfects his hand while he's doing the job and washes his hand when he gets home. But still, you know there's a chance he could get it.

One of the thing that confuses me is the fact that they say that if one person in the household has it, he or she has to stay in a seperate room and if that's not possible he or she should sleep in seperate beds. However, I see nowhere mentioned that some people maybe don't have a seperate room or bed pr couch... like us. What are we supposed to do then?",2.8277051249684426,3.7681571630901294,4.340701842968952,88.35357233021965,73.93562231759655,7.1990911386013625,24.86468063620297,7.510576382923642,1.0419024993688462,861,26,189,10,17,288,130,233,0.049,0.868,0.084,0.8332,3,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,3,1,1,1,7,4,0,1,14,0,21,5,3,1,2,34,35,21,0,6,9,0,2,1,2,2,2,1,10,3,14,11,0,1,2,0,1,3,5,1,0,3,1,4,20,3,21,31,4,24,0,0,1,0,23,10,0,10,11,123,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11623858142898345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12131683779134092,0.0,0.0,0.1959857178092263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12802139685333278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3175428941929417,0.0,0.259063925130588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16151191970647835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1524146298889951,0.0,0.14963659843367672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15078335800407294,0.13505694337437146,0.0,0.15822879526105946,0.1670115372998311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423333677678555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10142540303890177,0.0,0.15265058352375602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16181795884992403,0.3088884426510859,0.2311241709677509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106810062488087,0.13267373714598915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1712967375858495,0.0,0.15458411627837654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16161370169370115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208338773388654,0.0,0.0,0.12108160961303124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15205613560560866,0.15489022150365814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16195464713369154,0.12134459269992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14320768542010867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094643764444518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886011687702142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827728126159638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218822382033201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15430894661216638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Deathstroke317,2020/04/05,"I've been exposed, and I'm pretty concerned I have penumonia or even a heart condition First off I'm obese, BMI of 50, but I've been about as healthy as one can be at that size. And second, my good friend who I work with closely tested positive.

Beginning on Friday night after work, I sweating and breathing heavily just for climbing up steps that I take every day, I don't ever do that. Second, I started feeling weak, tired, chest tightness and a general malaise. A hot shower helped out a little, but the symptoms just came back later. I wasn't in a tremendous amount of pain, just a lot of discomfort.

I slept fine, and yesterday I woke up with significantly less discomfort, though I do still feel a little tightness in my chest and slightly heavier breathing. And now it feels like my lungs are hot, and the heat is coming up the back of my throat. And I even have a little mucus.

I was wondering if anyone had a cute image/text/gif/meme or something I could send to friends I want to check in on and tell them I love and appreciate them. Just something simple to let them know I hope they are doing ok and I care about them.

COVID19_support,FlyingTaiga,2020/04/05,"If you have a Samsung phone (S5+), it has a pulse oximeter! Samsung phones from the S5 upwards come with a pulse oximeter next to the camera. The oxygen reading used to be available through the S Health app as SpO2, however an update last year removed that option for many. It was either put under the Stress Management option or taken out altogether due to local regulations.

COVID19_support,julsboo25,2020/04/05,"24F nurse positive for COVID, suffering from anxiety and panic I’m not normally a particularly anxious or panicky person.

But over the past several days, I’ve been getting terrible anxiety. I’ve had (I think) two full on panic attacks so far.

I’m not sure if it’s due to:

A) The COVID patients who I worked with in the hospital were all seriously ill. I never really interacted with someone who I knew was COVID positive but had a mild version of the illness. So even though logically I know that I’m young, fit, and healthy and therefore at comparatively low risk of serious complications, I probably associate the disease with fear subconsciously

B) My symptoms are pretty intense. They’re not bad enough that I feel I need to go to the hospital, but this is worse than any other viral infection I can ever remember having. It feels very similar to a flu, but with the symptom intensity ramped up several times. I’ve been getting high fevers more and more frequently over the past few days, and it’s exhausting. I’m not sure if my anxiety is just down to me being tired, sore and unwell.

I guess I could just use a bit of support. I’m feeling distinctly shite",4.908224598930482,6.715186763636368,6.4597860962566855,71.79879679144388,70.0,10.63101604278075,33.850267379679146,10.718039707386858,4.21653743315508,928,46,163,30,17,317,139,220,0.231,0.657,0.11199999999999999,-0.9731,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,1,7,15,1,4,13,0,13,10,0,2,6,43,31,16,0,5,13,0,3,0,0,0,10,0,0,1,9,10,0,0,8,0,0,1,5,12,0,1,7,3,14,3,22,22,8,23,0,2,0,0,4,12,0,4,10,103,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756803601234542,0.0,0.2955261611348421,0.1454734808018454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14649449880259222,0.0,0.0,0.10751759619930384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14058352145386924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10281239072472527,0.0,0.0,0.16609203275249004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13305386323661714,0.0,0.08505139025866416,0.1164798642251488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449020837836496,0.19532998860009648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13455405162215264,0.0,0.07318297547181883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14185470554433416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13605260650465853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07076864077985738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09548134549668852,0.09931538544297132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12616728878958802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021677699586564,0.0,0.0,0.24585112825407165,0.0,0.11243702317582607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310054140216239,0.13883587161995284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249337846873184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14587134160605802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2909469616036908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10910642841969158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146126703883005,0.2427284584110163,0.2676827323616648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251063562372482,0.12651590052917214,0.0,0.07508683994828598,0.1480022064791028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12578960814898554,0.0,0.0,0.11121596121557546,0.0,0.10624876051700853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09374611537645372,0.0,0.13122766155137125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,alanasofly,2020/04/05,"My dad is Day 5 on the vent and is stable Hi all,

My dad (60 years old- no underlying health conditions- never chain smoked only casual cigars for special occasions) got admitted to the hospital last Thursday. We thought he was doing okay with the noninvasive nostril oxygen but he needed more. The doctor and their team decided to intubate my dad. 

It was very surreal to talk to my dad on the phone and not knowing if it would be the last time that I would ever speak to him. I told him to be strong and we are rooting for him. My dad is now on day 5 and his doctors and nurses have been wonderful. They call me twice in a day to give me updates. The day after he got intubated they called and said his eyes are open and he is writing things down. 

I asked what he was saying and it was things like “how much longer of this? And how is my wife?”... 
:( they said he became super anxious so they needed to sedate him. That was on Tuesday. So every day after they have called saying he is the same... his vitals are stable and he is one of the more stable patients. 

He has been sedated since and isn’t awake... same thing though chest x rays are the same... nothing worsened over night but his lungs still aren’t strong enough to be weened off. I asked the doctor how long they have been having COVID19 patients on these vents for...

She said since it’s so new they aren’t really sure but other hospitals are saying two weeks. I see all the bad news articles and it’s been breaking me down. So I said fuck this I am going to dig for good news and anything I can hang on to for hope...

I found a twitter thread of a nurse asking if anyone had good outcomes of patients coming off the vents and surviving. They said yes actually. They have had patients coming off and recovering! Which made me have more hope. 

I know we can only take this day by day but I was wondering if anyone else is going through something similar like my dads situation? I have found some threads on Reddit and spoke with people whose parents or spouses are going through it as well. I just like to connect and compare notes even though I know every single case is different. 

Stay well to everyone and make sure your mentally okay. I’m here to talk if anyone needs to vent. 🙏🏻♥️",2.255132788559756,4.528853168539328,3.3628575076608804,88.96606358529114,79.1123595505618,6.292645556690501,22.023748723186927,7.435244526350478,0.8318202247191011,1760,53,356,25,44,566,220,445,0.037000000000000005,0.795,0.168,0.9959,4,0,2,0,0,0,50.0,3,1,10,5,17,21,1,0,16,3,47,10,4,6,6,74,85,38,0,11,11,9,0,3,0,2,4,10,0,0,19,27,1,0,10,2,0,6,6,2,2,3,25,13,48,19,47,55,12,49,0,0,2,1,67,16,1,10,28,240,67,4,0.0,0.0,0.07340251363710676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497561997503922,0.0,0.15778380458298172,0.07707035559570988,0.061898507572653826,0.0,0.2109577417410058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06280439805868633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304198344367113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12958834562996985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3395684685890469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858743872587763,0.0,0.2309683060388218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06283549740619522,0.0,0.0,0.07772093206463096,0.0,0.04968118296979195,0.06803953973317485,0.1267498473491035,0.07187460595535564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16494664842390558,0.0,0.06953839354407983,0.0,0.07215654538630617,0.12824540963875125,0.1261796038800723,0.1203183886699569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995386580303454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494181049801198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401454392743733,0.12262641404441672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024404126114502,0.0,0.0,0.0665661034859724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07117366816293473,0.050209006730453545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07580266798879262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05529433363551122,0.16732094024787578,0.058013229659171085,0.07264660293974451,0.0,0.07058757070212276,0.0,0.07217428563259512,0.0,0.07892927880702474,0.0,0.050970077289477486,0.11441428584946695,0.0,0.0,0.08352136567009923,0.0,0.0,0.05214711375939976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048186968102897784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3577506183647597,0.17945057486969732,0.0,0.0,0.05993949414884831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12444322413259767,0.08454886997335054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05790696137274703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017303086136,0.060069679676181424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14178530083539448,0.0,0.05655503418169011,0.12091574011539015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14991570795615952,0.0,0.14780380623202102,0.05971517490273018,0.04386057679655935,0.0,0.0,0.07187460595535564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347765297124655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062063231365243714,0.0,0.0,0.06033583239423826,0.0,0.13526112883907032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631427494059592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068662858408411,0.0,0.0,0.048438319157679904

We’ve rescheduled the wedding. I still don’t feel very optimistic.

Unfortunately, knowing that this is happening to other people’s weddings isn’t helpful. This was supposed to work out. 

For once in my life, something was supposed to work out for me.

We can’t even get legally married because court houses aren’t open. I’m very afraid of what would happen if one of us got sick.

COVID19_support,voguv,2020/04/05,"Boss is not receptive towards COVID19 ; Not receiving benefits Hi friends, I hope everyone is holding together.

I was sent home from work on March 18th. I have just recently started this job and did sales in an office location. I was there for a little over fifty days. I was told it was a mandatory leave for 50% of our staff, that I had no option to work remotely (although we have other workers currently working from home...such as my co-worker) and that I would be notified when I could return to work, but without a set date. In the early stages of this, my boss was very dismissive and did not care about any news regarding the COVID19, his idea was that we would all 'be fine' because most of our staff are in their late 20's- early 30's... Since then, I have been unpaid, have not successfully been able to claim unemployment benefits from NYS due to the volume of inquiries. I personally don't think my employer will even accept the application. When I had initially asked if I could work remotely due to my fear of getting sick (as 20% of our staff does work from home remotely.. ) I was told a simple no, and that if I pleased, I could go on an unpaid sick leave. Following-up, here we are.  I would just like to know what benefits I am eligible for here from my employer. I work in a private business that has less than 500 employees. Thank you, any advice is appreciated.

Sending lots of love and light everyone's way.",6.424326923076923,6.587608600732603,6.8409317765567765,76.40667239010992,65.55677655677654,11.074084249084251,33.912316849816854,10.820120047756994,3.6195349816849816,1120,46,217,29,16,365,156,273,0.131,0.7609999999999999,0.10800000000000001,-0.6734,7,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,6,1,1,9,9,13,0,1,11,0,34,3,0,2,1,37,47,14,0,9,10,0,0,1,1,4,2,0,2,1,10,8,0,1,4,0,1,4,8,1,0,0,16,1,32,12,34,22,4,31,0,0,0,1,19,9,0,6,16,149,42,18,0.10515421654374038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275548339737538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430169462829516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830499769258404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06410103439891288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721173192750252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518712563011045,0.0,0.0,0.06781577047942543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09202116351918767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945336829410485,0.0,0.0,0.2009587203849901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183277282240997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124188685538151,0.0,0.054938738063869376,0.0,0.05976156454167885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3164347588323728,0.10444186364585414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1187063110626544,0.0,0.0,0.10434933435787193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057790007392100676,0.0,0.11861853645662053,0.22268626449912196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05137303865863013,0.10539214998071772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939835455511938,0.09490578592544377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09181660589878407,0.0,0.11542775254644508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382710293773656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698465455867281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07442869569544174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09681187467892843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737857602006063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009587203849901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676324128903007,0.0,0.08346652256652606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10136491231119768,0.0,0.6124281761961407,0.0,0.0,0.22409561523243154,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Agertudici,2020/04/05,"Everything just changed so suddenly The pizza delivery driver just set the boxes on the welcome mat and was most of the way down the hall before the door was answered. I'm not even mad. I think that was completely appropriate. That's a polite interaction these days.

My home care company just offered to fit-test me for an N-95 for sitting with people in the hospital. It's so expensive they usually just don't allow me to sit in rooms that require one. I have less than a year left of nursing school and I was just completely knocking it out of the park. And now all my clinical assignments are just cancelled. A security officer in a mask screens me every time I walk into work.

I used to go to a support group twice a week. That's gone. I got to try a zoom one today but it wasn't the same. I had to try to maintain confidentiality from anyone else in the home so I had to wear headphones and leave early when my boyfriend woke up.

Other than that I sit at home and scroll through reddit like I have been for the years since tumblr took a shit. I used to scroll through tumblr for the years before that. Everything is so normal for me 80% of the time that I keep forgetting that the world is never going to be the same after this.

I'm only in my 20s. The world I grew up in just vanished in under four months and it might never completely come back. I'll probably be fine in the end but this is all so completely surreal. It's not even just my area or my country. The whole world is different now. I blinked and it was gone.

Sometimes I cry because it all stresses me out even though there isn't any reason for it at all. I will almost certainly be completely ok. But Everything just... changed.",3.046420506560878,4.927364351032448,4.249791475943447,85.41424778761062,75.10619469026548,7.743708676635134,26.14393245854949,8.53829466247534,1.8242301088393853,1341,49,271,26,29,439,175,339,0.053,0.884,0.064,0.1608,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,1,2,23,11,2,1,27,1,23,4,2,4,7,49,39,18,0,1,15,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,5,0,20,12,1,3,3,0,1,8,7,3,0,4,14,1,28,8,45,20,9,58,0,0,1,0,5,25,1,4,21,194,48,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975957517292735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06627861388195225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814883964338883,0.09986301164367067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494351914377463,0.0,0.05941292719191185,0.0,0.16586874947668934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09937067136057802,0.0,0.2062072049510228,0.08395629142036852,0.510943834188966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070592263648198,0.0628559815257184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10182875436175401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08141836067329639,0.0,0.0863238517552297,0.0,0.0,0.193121434890324,0.0,0.08211731594995775,0.0,0.26278209158871635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078165949377326,0.0,0.0779505722779125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29329191742055244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663015685584667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10319991668925033,0.10589452446084634,0.0,0.0,0.047615808919055896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1033935145464146,0.0,0.0,0.07779454349580442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15033992730826928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954936686833876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320877627330221,0.07412548619811739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06756901260266973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10508228284080576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10020884919167808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863840182342548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004502060384064,0.08062292592575819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09639402702497904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116442644481722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11060057785398604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062450761815513726,0.09575752640973142,0.0,0.11366365854880613,0.0,0.09238412973292236,0.0,0.10828568449261412,0.13234282079123008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16835457517576616,0.10734242425052874,0.0,0.0,0.07736209680090876,0.07817944897677075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10881466770513447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095468697154472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882901561561948

My university classes have been moved online. My graduation has been cancelled. I had to move home with my parents. I have lost all form of alone time or privacy or control. I feel like I'm five years old.

I cant get any work done because my siblings never stop screaming or yelling. I feel like I'm constantly on call to help with siblings or when my parents need me or whatever. Im never alone. I am losing my mind. I can't do this. I would rather have the virus than this situation. 

My dad is toxic and mean. Everything is changed. I was supposed to move out, but I dont have the money to do it early. Im trapped here indefinitely and I dont see a way out.",0.7761111111111099,3.0156047592592614,2.8520987654321,90.64444444444445,84.74074074074073,5.822222222222222,23.19753086419753,7.1686216300943375,0.8615901234567902,609,23,133,9,18,205,94,162,0.10400000000000001,0.767,0.129,0.486,2,3,0,0,1,0,18.0,0,0,0,5,4,7,0,0,5,0,22,0,0,2,3,30,34,10,0,3,9,3,3,3,0,1,0,2,1,0,5,6,0,2,4,0,1,4,7,4,0,1,6,6,21,3,13,27,2,17,0,3,1,0,5,3,0,6,12,84,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366793401204693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770122311193456,0.0,0.0,0.12908211607098674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06965228813768136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11667299327561582,0.0,0.0,0.11737725718422938,0.1208727151998482,0.0,0.0,0.12347527084018113,0.1281531385746586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11692841012636405,0.2678254786328673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102690187842103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17332099377594826,0.24488369195617996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0596965220519145,0.0,0.0649370131394674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658656722815567,0.0,0.11461284104407493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3702636276358116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16746608185248732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25565708832812306,0.12472909795953782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446344533764585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307415558284527,0.0,0.0,0.3643232602173291,0.0,0.08472289281924701,0.17624985723475986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989742859611235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2537460655421385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910510184360005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12843386198037285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09552709704161322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06662635785013335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069485904821148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08318318142610917,0.0,0.0,0.08116755321723282,0.0,0.0,0.07358017202618536

I feel weak, physically and mentally. As of today, I started feeling a continuous tingle in my throat and a slight disconfort in my chest and I haven't even got the nerves to tell them about it.
I see lots of people still roaming in the streets, due to an increase of pandemic deniers on media.
I don't think my mom and dad would be able to handle it if me or my sister were to start developing symptoms.
I wish we could just be home, respecting quarantine.

COVID19_support,MyConfusedFace,2020/04/06,"Thoughts on the natural worlds’s ongoing recovery I’m not sure wether or not this is the right place to post this but it’s been one my mind lately and didn’t know where else to post it. Ever since lockdowns and quarantines have gotten enforced in countries, we’ve come across data that show a definite trend; that climate change/the animal kingdom are on a steady incline ever since the virus’ begun leaving its mark worldwide. The fact that this epidemic has somewhat major repercussions on the Earths environment/non-human inhabitants is something that’s been stuck in my head, as of late. 


Didn’t mean for that to sound like an essay opening but I had to kinda explain where exactly my minds been at. This also doesn’t mean to disregard all the ongoing tragedy happening to everyone across the globe, in case there’re any misconceptions made here. It’s been dark days for us all and silver linings have been kinda hard to find lately. People are losing loved ones out of nowhere, lives are being uprooted and damaged (possibly beyond repair) and there’s a general air of uncertainty clouding everything. It’s unprecedented times we’re living in. 


But watching the Earth and the wildlife slowly climbing back out of the shadows and almost resetting itself to pre-humanity life is incredibly fascinating to me. Smog is clearing up in major metropolitan areas, animals are returning to places that they’ve long abandoned. Almost every human around the world has slowed down for once and we’ve all come to a standstill. It almost feels like the planet itself has taken notice of that shift and taken its first breath again, after a long time.  Will it last? If a vaccine or some alternative manages to return our life to its status quo, definitely not. Nonetheless, it’s a highly rare moment and it feels surreal knowing it’s taking place as we speak.",6.68089800995025,8.45985669552239,6.655541044776123,72.20699315920399,65.6268656716418,9.52363184079602,31.868781094527364,9.827888789773867,3.3647736318407966,1503,60,238,33,24,477,202,335,0.09,0.838,0.07200000000000001,-0.6189,1,2,1,1,0,0,30.0,3,0,0,3,11,7,0,0,20,0,24,5,2,1,9,57,43,19,0,1,9,0,3,2,0,1,2,2,0,1,25,17,0,2,9,1,0,3,6,3,0,3,14,6,8,4,41,27,7,54,0,3,1,1,7,29,0,10,22,154,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3131326643941827,0.0,0.0,0.08335769730990178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07088422938319312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279236837423853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015124774988082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1795806119241768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06722376271342044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08707601767666141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18857532474736824,0.0878235424551322,0.0996022108047252,0.0936808268760029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10540996728832076,0.07446640304841777,0.0,0.0,0.0952700507807378,0.08866330721729855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921757780921778,0.0,0.09337521246072887,0.0,0.10697647215924748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11013132881383694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11457104200598928,0.08496646193417783,0.3527491153665632,0.110371145962049,0.0,0.0,0.14725030233837594,0.10184914028818352,0.0,0.18408504979992932,0.1844916151881857,0.0,0.11661370932593773,0.0,0.0,0.09407729187591124,0.09863086699234908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2270876842292875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21049781092913966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11867366981872818,0.0,0.11100821212988643,0.14126637121525362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07226429624877408,0.0,0.3267141099920716,0.0,0.0,0.11751071832962008,0.1996590418769789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08901719420402958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.172450618386327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802461633986831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982414389276109,0.0,0.07837269313353923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08275194499984005,0.12156199976445847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12538338326999865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

It progressively got worse and worse as this has gone on. Today I felt a sharp pain in my chest and i started sweating profusely. my Girlfriend has been trying to calm me down and saying its anxiety (I think its either covid or a heart attack). but it slowly has been going away. it has been really hard to keep it all together this past month.

COVID19_support,lethal_penguin,2020/04/06,"Help reassuring GF she didn't inhale the virus from plastic bags Hi all. For some context, my GF has moderate to severe asthma and has been isolating since two weeks before the California shelter-in-place order. She's been handling the disinfecting of our grocery deliveries and was doing so today when she squeezed together the bundle of plastic bags they'd arrived in. As you can imagine, in doing so there was a gust of air—in this case, right in her face. She's now worried that this could have sent any coronavirus on the bags airborne and she could've inhaled it. I've tried to reassure her that this is very unlikely, but would appreciate any informed input on the topic since the web is turning up nothing and I'd hate for her to have to worry.

Now, with COVID 19, it's pushed the procrastination and time spent on work deeper and deeper. I don't know what's going to happen, it can't come across as a good thing. I worked hard on being a good co-worker and employee but I'm scared this is the downfall. What I really want, is somebody to metaphorically hold my hand through all of this and ensure me things will be okay and I can fix my mistakes without repercussion.

COVID19_support,Accoutremont,2020/04/06,"Everywhere School - Live Educational Streams for Kids in Lockdown My friend and I made an online directory of live educational streams for kids who are in lockdown due to Covid-19: [Everywhere School](https://everywhereschool.live)

[Everywhere School](https://everywhereschool.live/) is a website that shows when kids and families can catch live video streams of story readings, science classes, cooking workshops, concerts, and more. Every time you visit, it’ll show what’s on right now, and what’s coming up.

It's a personal project we, a couple of web developers, did in our spare time over the last week and a bit. I hope it will be useful for the many kids out there who are stuck at home.",11.29376811594203,11.54347543478261,8.405000000000005,68.94083333333334,55.52173913043478,11.492753623188404,40.90579710144928,10.864195022040775,4.497840579710147,565,25,88,11,6,161,82,115,0.018000000000000002,0.902,0.08,0.7906,0,2,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,1,0,0,3,2,0,0,7,0,8,1,0,2,0,11,13,6,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,5,8,8,1,0,0,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,1,6,2,15,7,2,19,0,0,0,0,12,9,0,1,7,52,14,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19479387739605053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15369733004351088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19742385772053347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503307494688349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16820320114012793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785070465986235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17897481283911829,0.17721627422562208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14544018090372252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.472657605161553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16883003965930707,0.0,0.18089493493494888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557938190819586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784732743209776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15237396654935978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5417268465603546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20808209303168976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15410190390357772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14312176453624734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,milkshakedog111,2020/04/06,"Are there risks of contracting COVID-19 in my own home if I keep forgetting not to touch my face? Or am I overreacting in my anxiety? Located in NY.  I've been staying home the past 3 weeks - not even visits to the grocery store, etc - with the exception of very limited walks around my neighborhood and avoiding other people while doing so.  I do get food and packages delivered, but always wash my hands immediately after opening them, and treat the boxes or bags as radioactive.

One thing I've been struggling with is breaking the habit of touching my face - rubbing my eyes, scratching my nose, picking food out of my teeth - before realizing ""oh shit"" and catching myself.  I'm working on it!  But still feel very anxious about contracting the virus, even if no one has been in my apartment for the past month except for me, and if I haven't had any interaction with other folks in about 3 weeks.

Does anyone know of any people who have been ""staying the fuck home"" but are still contracting the virus?  I ask because I experience a lot of ""phantom symptoms"" as a result of anxiety, have to remind myself I've been staying home, but then remembering like - oh, ""well I forgot to wash my hands after cooking dinner that involved handling a can of tomatoes that was delivered 2 days ago, so maybe I have COVID!""  Is my anxiety getting the best of me here?",8.246037388905915,7.662010250996019,8.018087649402393,71.96597916028199,62.027888446215144,10.910327919092861,37.634385534783945,10.214889679676881,3.8358357952804174,1067,46,187,20,13,342,145,251,0.11800000000000001,0.825,0.057999999999999996,-0.9132,0,1,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,1,3,12,9,2,3,13,0,20,16,8,2,0,36,29,20,0,3,13,0,7,1,0,0,3,0,4,0,7,11,4,4,4,1,1,3,4,5,1,2,8,9,25,4,34,21,4,30,0,0,1,1,6,10,2,6,14,133,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09975283957617503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363564942193328,0.0,0.0,0.1530512552161966,0.0,0.2582600453922188,0.12712914352819787,0.0,0.07868499986681325,0.0,0.0,0.10017734958636826,0.10520224128620503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0685984705336958,0.0,0.09575645453963286,0.0,0.1180954047862932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0725738387309338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09847752276294712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12550294079397667,0.14865266631235133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100779017430717,0.0,0.0,0.056899566892946035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721483131824459,0.0,0.0,0.10403403253994972,0.11758666422695642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4515151366515817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002362353245996,0.0,0.0,0.061844651282200125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497745725473382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09567069312089373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130535322131976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898219790188313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15250920848310834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21484907900811545,0.15603105718198518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12747683372578025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551249403631192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3598324584319021,0.17973642161102954,0.0,0.0,0.11764289312410592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11696384906325333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07476126901452555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18570139177268594,0.0,0.0,0.1805327857235646,0.0,0.10117979408105104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08192464558635211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,_helpmehomexx,2020/04/06,"I'm falling apart thinking my husband is going to die, be stranded, get sick, etc. What do we do? My husband’s lease has ended and he is supposed to move back to Pennsylvania at the end of April from Hawaii. He is 50 and in good health, although overweight.

In order to move, he needs to fly from Hawaii to California where his car will be shipped. He can then drive his car from California to PA.

What is the safest way of going about this, if at all possible? From what I’ve read, this virus is going to be a real risk to all of us for many more months.

I am so afraid of him falling ill, but financially it’s not possible for him to stay any longer.

COVID19_support,jessjurassic,2020/04/06,"Mother in Law guilt-trip over Easter dinner This is mostly a vent session but thought some might appreciate this grade-A insanity and family drama. We are in a COVID-19 hot-spot in a suburb of NYC in Connecticut. My MIL is a classic anti-vaxxer, thinks this is a 5G conspiracy, being blown out of proportion, attempt to attack Trump, etc, etc. Her already unbalanced beliefs and actions have lead to a generally toxic relationship between her, my husband and me and our two toddlers. We have established strong boundaries and know how to stand up to her but she loves to lay on the guilt trip, set herself up as a victim, and pits my husband’s brother against him as her defender and peacekeeper, which generally sucks. 

today she has texted the group chat we are all in stating that Easter dinner will be at the usual time next Sunday. Like what?? We said we will be happy to FaceTime in and waited for her response. She immediately shot back- “if we are all healthy why is Easter on FaceTime?” We didn’t respond, though I think we probably need to write one calm one-liner about how we aren’t attending any gatherings. 

The most frustrating part is that my husband’s brother has been allowing her to pick up his 6 month old and babysit him at her house. I’m not sure if they are planning to go to her house for Easter or not but if they’re letting her babysit I think they might. There is no legitimate childcare related need to do this as he is not working right now and his wife is working from home so they’re just increasing their risk of infection. My MIL is a cancer survivor so she should not be taking any risks as is. I can’t imagine what is possessing them to do this other than she doesn’t take the virus seriously and he can’t help but try to keep her happy. 

I’m so frustrated that during this stressful time of a global crisis, she somehow finds a way to make this all about her and how enlightened she is and how we are sheep listening to the government. We are need to make sacrifices for the common good. This situation really has the potential to bring out the best and worst in people. I wish I could go off on her but she knows the guidelines and statistics and either thinks they are lies or don’t apply to her. Also, her birthday is in two days so she’s going to guilt us about this too. I’m so grateful my husband and I are on the same team and support each other in dealing with her and keeping her at a distance because this type of toxic relationship is so stressful and can be damaging. 

As much as I know she is unhinged and manipulative, I can’t help but get a little heated, which is why I’m posting here. Thank you for reading and stay safe and well, everyone.",5.437058823529411,6.155616814041751,6.061451612903228,79.21217741935486,67.76660341555977,9.0842504743833,31.43927893738141,9.168548406835145,2.6413628083491463,2139,84,409,38,34,697,261,527,0.136,0.7240000000000001,0.139,0.2004,1,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,13,1,5,8,23,27,5,6,23,0,52,5,0,10,4,102,86,52,0,9,17,8,0,1,0,5,2,2,1,0,19,38,2,4,12,4,0,9,12,14,1,3,4,2,65,13,65,70,16,53,2,1,0,1,74,26,1,11,13,301,84,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10588311158443303,0.07673110832775419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13049845806825291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10915687435609857,0.0,0.07377955812330507,0.0,0.05849017453559861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069351086201707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766081955863203,0.0,0.0,0.0618797541849802,0.09892014402040508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2140190256330809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168425080803357,0.0,0.0,0.09045303578520286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876964794225318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050129867766623,0.0,0.16359163498721258,0.08047823216021993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042809266634714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12862640421524854,0.0,0.09624558296545176,0.0,0.0,0.22142662722030654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1705693772056581,0.0,0.0,0.1581946836181552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09811528373746027,0.0,0.04687627938837585,0.09616701672381613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659853987179196,0.0,0.1280946199206017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20357538325403424,0.0,0.0,0.07658630271302741,0.0,0.07053422395734944,0.21343692737113573,0.0,0.0,0.10204381776844727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10068328998889267,0.0,0.1300362843816077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10390440223416736,0.0,0.06651958634460674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189349073500773,0.0,0.10345023136302547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09597587536641952,0.0,0.0614679692570279,0.0,0.0,0.20602859008724253,0.0,0.0819406988428262,0.09127033667845708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785171893655264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10226983747359836,0.0,0.0,0.2198205953522213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10888282076258927,0.09043165461497853,0.0,0.14428478234974226,0.0,0.0,0.08833778581247136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459233120544016,0.09427029936954287,0.07617351079779447,0.11189832821062223,0.0,0.09094929551179604,0.0,0.0,0.06514369054405282,0.0,0.1874582399237332,0.0,0.11541592767879595,0.0,0.10567527011768606,0.0,0.0,0.07616057242406038,0.0,0.0,0.08627049217328613,0.0,0.17315973936679008,0.0,0.11033766117937913,0.0,0.0,0.13970535441483498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I eat clean and try to get as many nutrients in my body as I can. I have accepted that If I get this illness I probably will not die, but I'm scared of the long term effects. I suffer from anxiety, so reading Reddit has not been good for my mental health when I see people saying things like even asymptomatic people will end up getting lung damage or people saying that in 6 months all of these ""recovered"" will drop dead. Reading things like this really makes my anxiety go through the roof. Now I know reddit is full of doomsayers for some reason, but if anyone is knowledgeable on viruses or knows the similarities to SARS, can anyone shed some light on what we know could happen or if we have any clues?

COVID19_support,allexgrace,2020/04/07,"Grandpa (78) on vent. Looking for personal experiences/info (Cross posted)

Hi all. Bear with me, this will be a long story...this happened in NJ.

My grandpa went to the hospital about 2 weeks ago with mild COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) after acquiring it in Queens, NY. They hooked him up to oxygen and gave him the anti-malaria drug. Within 4 days he was doing very well. They transitioned him to a normal floor and his fever broke. We talked to him and the doctors were very optimistic for his being discharged within 24 hours.

Overnight his condition worsened. They transferred him to the ICU. They tell us it is because he required more oxygen and that's all (2 liters to 4 liters to 6 liters and then automatic ICU transfer). He's lucid still, speaking to us, mild fever. Doctors say do not panic.

Day 2 in the ICU he's doing ok. Then, overnight they have him sign a waiver to be intubated without telling the family. The doctors called us after it was already done the next morning (my mom broke down crying). They told us at the time it was ""preventative"" because of suspected pneumonia, and he still had a very good chance of survival. Now we are on day 10 of the ventilator. I keep picturing him signing that waiver and that being his last lucid moment on this earth...and I am also pissed seeing the stats that people intubated too early are dying because of it.

A break to explain more details. My grandpa has no comorbidities other than that he is mildly overweight. He is 78 and that's a daunting number, but he fixes cars and wires houses even now and is completely healthy and lucid. He is an Italian immigrant and he can work all day at difficult labor. However, his wife just passed away 4 months ago from metastatic breast cancer, so he has been depressed. This may have contributed to his sickness. Everyone hears his age and assumes a death sentence but he's the healthiest 78 year old I've ever met; for context, his older brother (82) was admitted to the same hospital for COVID-19 and all they did was give him morphine and he died in his sleep within 3 days. No, grandpa doesn't even know that happened.

Ok. With all that said. Third day on the vent his PEEP is at 18 and oxygen is at 70%. Viral pneumonia, lower left lung very bad. They have the palliative care doctors call us. The palliative care doctor says on the phone ""We have no idea if he will die or not, this call is premature."" Over the next few days his PEEP drops: 18 to 15 to 12 and now its at 10. They take the paralytic off and he does fine. We wonder if he's getting better? But the doctors call us and pressure us to sign a DNR because they need more ventilators. (???) We ask if he is getting better because his numbers have been dropping. They say: we don't know and we expected better from him by now. When they do breathing trials they evidently are not going well.

He has no fever and no other symptoms. The only medicine he is receiving is related to his being comatose on the vent. There has been no organ failure, no worsening of anything, kidneys good, blood good, heart good. He's just sedated and on a ventilator and the settings are mildly and slowly improving. One doctor tells us he may recover on the vent; one says they might try a trach; the next doctor says absolutely no trach for another week; another doctor says we should let him die instead of putting him on a trach. No continuity of care. No more meds available for him. Only confusing mixed messages and doctors who are frankly implying that we give up on his life to free up resources for the hospital.

So, my family calls a lawyer and the lawyer says hospitals do have a right to take the vent off and refuse care. Mom calls chief medical officer of the hospital who says that they won't be doing that anytime soon because they still have 77 spare vents. So...super weird that they were pressuring us in the first place.

Ok, reddit. There's my story. What chance do we have of his recovery based on your own experience? What is going on? What should we advocate for? Is all hope lost? What should we ask them? What would be an indicator that he is getting better or worse? I have seen studies on vent recovery which look terrible and some which look great. And no I am not looking for contradiction from the doctors but just personal accounts.",4.4583780275212375,6.400775421052632,5.009575497941473,81.19439811208784,71.41126070991432,7.987010867549424,29.147453729461073,8.666027191798058,2.3565325989392085,3417,137,620,62,66,1092,353,817,0.127,0.767,0.106,-0.9672,2,0,1,0,0,0,123.0,21,1,18,11,25,34,1,4,46,3,75,33,9,0,7,97,113,44,5,11,17,8,0,0,0,10,24,11,0,2,34,44,1,4,8,0,2,8,19,13,2,4,20,17,77,22,83,75,14,93,0,4,6,1,136,39,1,13,41,412,111,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07475519931167249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04653121060993103,0.03372012125923473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884294190976031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03469901111944888,0.0,0.07883900397020131,0.0,0.03961632891653254,0.0,0.03520683441407274,0.15422395068682682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14916954103074873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25833709763927426,0.0,0.17196411896609334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04421023078763275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046317352210024115,0.1903549944811763,0.0,0.0363174992511595,0.0,0.17504653223537875,0.0,0.0,0.4747453720151957,0.036899735752595794,0.04315044018264785,0.0,0.0,0.04889915330438661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055700468004749856,0.038141545545221575,0.0,0.04029140360651777,0.0,0.04124642225512853,0.07950067192864202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03586636348047186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660899571232378,0.08089890593118579,0.04792779954993368,0.14146730348686398,0.0,0.04648814496248085,0.0,0.0,0.07457447877613907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04752412721385163,0.04996689271075161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04188033516047721,0.04152499942696421,0.04865388290756256,0.0,0.047600262188208994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03747906297612109,0.0,0.0,0.04634664288860964,0.034370903849911115,0.0,0.0,0.045813463753720536,0.043117574307403664,0.029783080690493124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03731556794526948,0.14163522331401635,0.0,0.046029151296269485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046836901317403215,0.04247779164537089,0.0,0.04473144437976433,0.0,0.09876857901246726,0.03365648523215236,0.0,0.0,0.03126554200768626,0.0,0.0,0.13453200340373622,0.0,0.04131371051723981,0.0,0.0,0.044246105930104765,0.0,0.05714552250071064,0.06413826007443825,0.0,0.049472695718028536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029232583322961688,0.07363541963167884,0.044054477517046914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04038335582594493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04238845909721848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03600951897168308,0.040109505613064964,0.2682566559131298,0.0,0.0,0.033600829091457486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04219643462884449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10102142514077682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08765320251667517,0.06340714297926782,0.03389141980406904,0.11056478268249477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024587323695694788,0.0,0.0,0.04029140360651777,0.0,0.02862793451433803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4564843705837002,0.0,0.0,0.13916540735485713,0.0,0.0,0.0676460160753151,0.0,0.07582456504475757,0.03908828855440662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040646502780725284,0.04572720973159431,0.03069733771673307,0.0,0.04297073887534534,0.029953504422809182,0.0,0.0,0.02715351049598316
COVID19_support,QuartzFeathers,2020/04/07,"My mom has extreme germophobia and I'm slowly going crazy My mom has extreme, extreme germophobia. She hasn't left her room in over a year at this point, and she's honestly crazy (she's made my dad wear plastic bags on his feet, all the clothing has to washed in a specific order to prevent the laundry machine from getting dirty). My mom is always yelling and screaming at my dad because he does one thing in her insane list of demands incorrectly. She does nothing for herself anymore, she doesn't bathe herself anymore, nor does she even go the bathroom alone (she needs someone to watch her wipe to make sure she doesn't get herself dirty). This post has more, pre-corona info on her condition: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/d7wcm1/my\_17f\_mother\_50f\_hasnt\_left\_her\_room\_in\_9\_months/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d7wcm1/my_17f_mother_50f_hasnt_left_her_room_in_9_months/)

I escaped this by not being in the house, I tried to stay out of the house as much as possible just to avoid this whole toxic mess. But with this situation, I can't escape anymore, and I've slowly been losing myself. I honestly don't know how I'm going to last these months. 

Now that this pandemic has occurred my dad is actually believing all the nonsense my mom has been saying. When my dad went shopping my mom only let him go to one store and do curbside pick up and when he came back he had to wear gloves to take everything inside and the food (including raw meat) was all unpackaged and put into plastic grocery bags bc they swore the food packaging could be contaminated). I told my dad that this was unreasonable but kept saying that we are living in special times.

I know a lot of people have it worse out there and I'm relatively lucky, but being around my family is making me feel like I'm losing my mind constantly. Previously, I had my dad at least to say that my mom was being crazy even if he still let her do what she was doing, but now my dad is believing what she is telling him to do. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do....",9.148466042154569,9.796283346994537,7.714246682279469,70.79745901639345,59.79234972677595,9.703669008587044,32.45589383294301,9.362217197678863,2.7635106947697103,1699,55,285,25,21,512,188,366,0.075,0.868,0.057999999999999996,-0.3091,0,2,0,0,1,0,74.0,1,0,1,2,12,12,0,1,11,0,39,6,3,5,4,45,64,20,0,3,7,13,1,1,0,0,1,5,2,0,17,16,2,3,5,2,2,8,8,5,0,2,13,7,48,7,38,44,8,41,0,2,1,0,45,19,0,3,12,190,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.07975950928294431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08465062336774412,0.0,0.0,0.06800831090294114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431711899933196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275959934236863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284754635803971,0.0,0.04982361034844317,0.0,0.0,0.18416995379379675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934806508093914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0883242165691538,0.0,0.06525706097982469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21457500512978325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10796760432094007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07345625021736284,0.0,0.07705049344745661,0.0,0.04132660433699885,0.058389992034888386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976634669475296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540412191463274,0.0,0.2322534209828947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18861755983784956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347547744277824,0.06662321305278493,0.0,0.0,0.08880302274500868,0.16715483258429753,0.0,0.03993056094250025,0.0,0.07217163815856074,0.0,0.0,0.18287639203609868,0.0,0.0694863791967416,0.0,0.07733763552850649,0.10911467577809424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08252691818297153,0.5743474286742196,0.06523841200164991,0.0,0.060083077518292075,0.06060390135461235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842491107815074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11076864132531113,0.062161544899048085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05666329391026476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726399824778421,0.0921415514432628,0.07827751433965592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08216412794220276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877505348090413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949918208920001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187119139872156,0.0,0.0,0.06925201138195511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08711638447209548,0.06527199051305856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703228035265035,0.0,0.06145296053637358,0.0,0.07143814726701138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054299699505766484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04765910469300321,0.0,0.0,0.07809927776105667,0.0,0.05549126635536091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576720669321882,0.0,0.09125185140977203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329279624501709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263330061975068
COVID19_support,searchingformytruth,2020/04/07,"My therapist has started using Zoom to do our biweekly sessions. It's surprisingly helpful. Given the risk involved in meeting in-person, my therapist has stated that he will be conducting our biweekly sessions over Zoom from now on, until it is safe to resume in-person counseling.  The first Zoom session was Tuesday two weeks ago and it went actually really well.  There I was, lounging in bed, and he was probably on his couch in his living room, and we were having a pretty normal therapy session.  I do get in-home service, which is nice, but this means that neither of us have to be at risk by him coming to my house.  He's doing it with all his clients now.  We ""met"" again this morning and it was again really helpful.   I suppose doing a talk session over the phone would be okay, but being able to actually see each other while talking is good.

Has anyone else been receiving or conducting therapy sessions over mobile platforms like this?  It's amazing that we have the technology to do this now so easily.  My first time using Zoom was actually when my family hosted my grandfather's birthday online using it (because we didn't want to get them sick by hosting a party), with the sixteen of us there talking.  That's pretty incredible.

Now we're meeting online and I barely got the chance to get to know them in-person so I feel lonely as fuck. Also it's a game group so most of our time spent together is playing the game and not getting to know each other much/socialize. I also feel disconnected from my best friend and I’m bored with conversations in general. I wanted to also maybe improve my love life with my fresh start but sounds like that isn’t happening either.

I feel like the universe wants me to be unhappy and have no friends and fuck my life over.",3.6737445887445896,5.222193409090913,4.663051948051951,84.48838744588747,72.70129870129871,7.470995670995673,25.82034632034632,8.07648339933343,1.5167073593073597,611,20,121,9,12,199,99,154,0.11199999999999999,0.715,0.17300000000000001,0.7979999999999999,0,2,0,0,0,0,9.0,1,0,2,1,8,14,2,0,5,0,9,6,0,0,0,27,29,15,0,2,5,0,3,2,3,0,3,1,1,0,4,13,0,0,5,3,1,1,4,5,0,0,6,4,19,9,17,22,4,11,0,2,0,3,15,3,2,1,9,78,23,0,0.144325407300368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3462509282243125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109773295382543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12281029154408064,0.0,0.1514606107917046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21892578727303666,0.10310609981296284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33451635499683624,0.2668530268411206,0.15080813700586082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308604251899479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552529620674764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1447701510966959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15863493883360974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3058239101568664,0.14102020769809465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302593149286944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14499427028644185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533950673974392,0.10609578065997158,0.0,0.0,0.13939037771923266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15370184850315272,0.0,0.10976597580386148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005706515856652,0.12601937876421007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16222780480313356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20430853225199025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841573056310253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17025372913624107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294083040708648

COVID19_support,chaoticidealism,2020/04/07,"Worried about India I live in the United States, where things are getting pretty bad. But I keep thinking about India.

When I was a college student, I had Indian classmates--international students. They were the ones you could always count on to do their part in a group project; they were the ones setting the curve. Once you got past their accents, they were just as nice and personable as anybody else. And they had a passion for learning. I guess it stands to reason that if you are willing to go to a whole different country to go to college, you would have to be somebody who really cares about learning.

Now I can't stop thinking about them--the laughing fellow who could make magic with circuit diagrams, the tiny short girl who's probably a top-notch medical resident by now judging by how well she could explain anything in anatomy. I graduated years ago, so they must be home now.

I keep hearing about how India has a shortage of doctors, India has a shortage of hospitals, India has huge areas where you have to travel for ages to get medical care. About how they're crowded in the cities, and isolated in the countryside, and have so many languages that sometimes it's hard for doctors to even communicate with patients. They love technology, they love science, but they're just getting started putting it in place. There are lots of places where you can't even get Internet.

And here I am, in the United States, looking at New York City on the news and seeing Mumbai or New Delhi, and I just... feel so helpless.

I know none of you can do anything about it, any more than I can, but you're good listeners. So thanks for listening.

COVID19_support,mizuki01,2020/04/07,"COVID19 Nightmares? I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I don't know where else to post it. Sorry in advance.

I've been having trouble sleeping these last few days and last night I remember having nightmares. I can't remember the specifics but I do remember it had something to do with the virus (or end of the world kind of stuff, sorry I can't be more specific).When I'm saying I'm having trouble sleeping, I mean I'll toss and turn and maybe get 2 hours of sleep before being up for another 24. I've tried sleeping pills but they've bearly helped.No one I know personally has the virus so I don't know so I'm not sure why I'm panicking so much.

If anyone has some advice, I'd greatly appreciate it. I hope you all are doing well.

COVID19_support,Leticia_the_bookworm,2020/04/07,"Feeling terribly lonely. Social distancing began here in March 18th. These last few days, I've done basically nothing except for studying, working out, reading a bit and lying on the floor of my room. I miss everything. School, friends, relatives, teachers. It's just me and my mother here, and she's always too busy to talk to me. So, I'm always alone.

I have ARFID, an eating disorder. I struggle with it since I was 4, and I've been on therapy for three years because of it. My therapy and the treatment program I applied for a few months ago were canceled. I was determined to get rid of my disorder this year. And now I have to lock myself at home with no treatment.

I live in Brazil, and I'm not sure you've noticed this by now, but our president is the dumbest person alive. Not only do we have the pandemic and an economic crisis due to it, we also have to deal with a political convulsion caused by that shitty human being. It's going to be so much worse than it had to, and the thought of that kills me.

Put all of this together and the result is that it's getting harder and harder for me to push myself out of bed. I feel like I don't have a reason to wake up. And I feel like such a snowflake for saying this, while my aunt, who is a nurse and has barely any PPE, is enduring all of it with like a lion. All I have to do is just to stay home, and yet my crybaby ass can't be asked to withstand even this. So I don't cry. I pretend it's everything ok with me. I don't talk to anyone about it, because I have no one now.",3.4259019214224224,4.181350031545744,5.030807284198453,84.65835316891312,72.34384858044163,8.161112704330371,27.34284485230857,8.438071523408619,1.7719917981072544,1188,41,252,19,22,403,167,317,0.15,0.769,0.081,-0.9717,0,3,0,0,0,0,41.0,3,0,0,1,17,11,1,1,15,1,28,3,2,3,4,40,40,20,1,0,6,2,3,3,1,0,0,1,4,2,20,23,1,0,5,2,0,3,8,5,0,2,8,4,33,6,44,29,7,28,0,2,0,1,16,10,1,0,17,183,53,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898510700308653,0.0,0.0,0.127336024458802,0.0,0.09832068023182773,0.20460352436904924,0.0,0.0,0.08360818347409639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859674087119487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11493885860548472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14989471343627864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13422629295343094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12630044755161526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350515183743462,0.07929065090598847,0.1267529696974111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2818158523410468,0.0,0.0,0.12581747848545588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12580548594992952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08120534118717533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2209936915336211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18649710863182584,0.17566673836773994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09498855567154868,0.0,0.12846947753426793,0.0,0.06987361963405808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466517529253313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13602265149361645,0.0,0.0,0.10021822343774993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18019709776048853,0.0,0.10856446315659546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09813513115203977,0.0,0.09038019950771713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117970972899321,0.13997598684625215,0.0,0.0,0.0833120765088346,0.09350674202687853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735258766840884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12359570419030315,0.0,0.0,0.12298028215054815,0.0,0.0,0.12641000404547226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777239783379732,0.0,0.12442893890227028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10170303795165496,0.0,0.0,0.1253289945745182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13104515504522699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12853091049596144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11587610279595482,0.0,0.0,0.19764030049245024,0.0,0.0,0.2812012439038352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760619337459307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950688825855764,0.0,0.12529350780822435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583476881427874
COVID19_support,throwaway5151d,2020/04/07,"Can’t get rid of this anxiety/fear Everyday I feel anxious and scared. Sometimes about the virus. But also being Asian, mostly about all the attacks and assaults that have been going on. To be completely honest I’m terrified of stepping out of my apartment to even walk my dog at this point. I carry pepper spray with me because it’s all I have but I feel like if something were to happen, maybe I won’t be fast enough of something like that and it scares the living crap out of me. Going to grocery runs sends my fears shooting straight through the roof. I also get overwhelming scared when my mom leaves the apartment alone, I always go with her but I know that eventually I’ll have to go back to my own place more than 3,000 miles away and I won’t be there for her and it eats me up everyday and I just always feel like it’s hard to breathe. Sometimes I think about transferring to a school near home so at least that fear will get better. I feel like I’m losing my mind though and I’m not all too sure how to fix it.",2.111826923076922,4.251761913461543,2.818884615384615,93.3761153846154,78.90384615384616,5.6984615384615385,21.93846153846154,6.742157984588678,0.4006107692307692,810,24,172,8,20,253,118,208,0.172,0.732,0.096,-0.9334,0,1,2,1,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,2,14,17,3,6,6,0,13,3,2,1,4,30,30,17,0,1,6,1,5,4,0,3,0,0,1,0,11,11,1,0,6,0,0,8,4,10,0,0,2,5,23,7,30,21,8,27,0,2,0,0,4,14,1,2,9,114,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818543202679326,0.0,0.1825103637364819,0.18990035242999226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12891387686831612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12981866988009466,0.10721181197532492,0.08774494649473699,0.0,0.06956150681353554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009226323009962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196440730431078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11676488072818365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11790801490137608,0.0,0.07536978142579404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38522257013205796,0.2307934610971651,0.2445645227456357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17885614973266514,0.0,0.2594095098798618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10090870627551668,0.0,0.10222177759314464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446346037400232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06271287243108914,0.0,0.0,0.12082794178356625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22299708653343855,0.0,0.10076282839402093,0.0,0.0,0.12766193880459498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464066166722615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11522040938697732,0.1336463853637841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11922256527554626,0.0,0.10787255485836504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3427375187739833,0.11548725479142095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756977093057379,0.2257190172106192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10754904064836604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311824713682402,0.11211428456103134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,stevep98,2020/04/07,"On the bright side Of course, there are still some very challenging times ahead with regards to COVID, but there are also some potential upsides.  As a result of the downtime that we are all experiencing, I expect there will be several upsides which we will proportionally recognize in the coming months:

* Less traffic accidents and deaths due to less cars on the road (in a normal year \~[35,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year) road accident deaths per year in the US)
* Less work deaths per year (\~[5000](https://www.arnolditkin.com/personal-injury-blog/2019/august/the-latest-workplace-fatality-statistics-in-2019/) / yr)
* Less cases of Influenza due to handwashing, social distancing, etc. ([estimate](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) was up to 63,000 deaths)
* Less instances of e-coli and other communicable diseases due to handwashing awareness
* Less STD's due to isolation

In the longer term, the increased education, awareness of best practices, and fear will lead to ongoing reduction in communicable diseases for the next year (or until we all forget....)

&amp;#x200B;

Possibly more importantly, indirect benefits will come from researchers seeing COVID-10 as a goldmine - a unique worldwide event which will be used to draw many conclusions.  I bet thousands of PhD's will come from COVID-19:

* comparing each administrative region's (country, state, county, etc) response  to infections and deaths

1. when to start social distancing
2. when to close businesses
3. importance of contact tracing
4. citizen compliance

* correlating different types of public health systems capacity to handle epidemics
* refining epidemiological models
* economic impacts, and how to mitigate

Once they get back to school in the fall, there are many students and researchers who will have a lot of work to do.  The world is relying on you all.  This is a huge learning experience.",9.99979661016949,13.562584979661017,7.932000000000002,59.211220338983075,60.22033898305085,11.36406779661017,39.25762711864407,11.126944784690435,5.7228413559322036,1599,81,194,49,25,473,190,295,0.05,0.8640000000000001,0.086,0.8657,1,1,0,0,0,0,116.0,4,1,1,7,10,5,0,1,16,0,18,3,0,4,3,34,25,15,5,2,2,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,1,6,15,0,0,2,0,1,7,0,1,0,1,1,3,8,4,42,15,19,45,0,0,2,1,12,16,0,6,20,126,14,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985014745726822,0.0,0.14883411610269898,0.16691260868107366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056246353768049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14415531402120646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35498143549355193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14351641306969426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063949164403124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343686024133072,0.0,0.1545729797349064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176715528016235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14601178276253926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116782179919922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785315947845552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096428401672128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14608844669733478,0.0,0.13458780760116051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146288451636334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15485756148382607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13901996257691798,0.10946152897870216,0.0,0.0,0.1551825123061981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28005112458986625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972271287896144,0.0,0.10969927384250423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800982034669277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523228910336554,0.11863861492040925,0.0,0.11333989876070807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20000563158148132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16691260868107366,0.35383231383242364

COVID19_support,IamGumpOtaku,2020/04/07,"My Messed up Monday my hands are literally trembling as I type this. Now then...

Im 32, 490 lbs, and living with an essential roommate. Last Saturday he went to the house of his fave barber to get a line up and a 360 wave improvement. there was about 7 other people in the house with him... Then he went with a co-worker to tag along as the co-worker did some business.

My roommate is a fabricator for a commercial plumbing and drainage firm. He can get a mask if he wants to, but is reluctant to do so - he's a bit of an oddball. So I was giving him a massage on the living room couch. As I was finished with his feet, he took a deep exhale - this from a man who in his late 50s, overweight, and with apnea. He sneezed once today, and that was before he ate his food (he washed his hands) After the message I went to check up on the news. While I was being informed I suddenly remembered the talk about asymptomatic, respiratory droplets and aerosols and my anxiety meter went through the roof. 

Now I have just broke my isolation to get some flip-flops on the behest of my roommate, who called me a coward. I can see where he's coming from, but no one calls me a coward. So I grabbed the mask he got from work, the vial of rubbing alcohol i use daily and took off. I was in and out of the local Walmart in an hour (looking for cleaning products, alcohol and peroxide - none to be found btw.) I got my shoes and drink mix (as if often calms me down.)

Now I stand here typing this wondering if the 'Rona has come to this place that we share. My roommate tells me I'm getting paranoid with this. Am I really?",4.327627893262567,4.83016352012384,5.277302078726232,84.62209494324048,70.14551083591331,8.381483119563615,28.693645879404393,8.418075326091056,1.8593577767949283,1239,43,261,18,21,407,176,323,0.1,0.858,0.042,-0.9557,0,1,3,0,0,0,48.0,1,0,0,1,13,5,0,1,28,0,18,11,4,1,0,38,41,26,0,4,6,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,3,1,10,22,6,0,4,1,1,8,2,3,0,1,17,6,34,2,47,22,4,43,0,1,2,0,30,19,0,7,15,172,44,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25114222852801915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08988671188341267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998332681049407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827890200942696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23996002920150755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20243064107888467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151046698986509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14208072901541613,0.12883201657504012,0.0,0.0,0.24555432705778815,0.11271612172822985,0.0,0.0,0.18794999221291825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157132308848708,0.2711570410123829,0.0,0.0,0.12691950439901614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577768543745936,0.132544430044621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20750822844824726,0.0,0.09866989477983464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12513301578436384,0.07962062769912401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08145928260301441,0.0,0.12276185427548066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07527311809790899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13310390394515295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363180128205363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09444155903486373,0.10269964601907927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11137568305460673,0.0,0.26109229172297205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10148174724260596,0.0,0.0,0.06930418463677443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4356924475190701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12742307646985832,0.2566228664023033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,dreamykedr,2020/04/07,"Depression and COVID-19  

I've been in quarantine since the end of february because I underwent a small surgery. After that I went out 2 or 3 times. I'm extremely worried about everything, especially because my dad is 66.

Today we had a huge problem in our building(I don't even know how to explain this, but we had to call a plumber for us and our neighbor. Because of that everyone got in touch with a lot of people(I would say 6 or 7) and now I'm freaking out about that.

I have depression and severe anxiety, I believe this is the reason why sometimes I have breathing problems. I can't stop thinking that I'm sick and that I shouldn't leave my room or share the bathroom. My sistser is a medical student and she says that I'm ""obssessed"" because I keep reading articles everyday and this is making me sick. I know it's somehow true, but I can't stop doing this, I want to know what's happening, but at the same time I'm freaking out.I know I'm not being rational :( I'm starting to believe that I have COVID 19, even tough it's probably hay fever. :(

Sorry, I just wanted to get it off my chest. 2019 was a horrible year for me, I'm trying to cope with grief and I'm really afraid of death :(",3.233462374945628,4.715318396694219,4.639351892127014,84.48644410613312,73.71074380165291,8.069943453675513,31.33188342757721,8.6894789155246,2.5382776859504133,940,45,190,18,19,313,136,242,0.21,0.6940000000000001,0.096,-0.9867,0,1,0,0,0,0,32.0,5,0,0,0,8,11,0,1,10,0,18,6,2,3,1,44,42,15,2,6,8,1,1,0,1,2,4,2,2,0,15,14,0,3,7,1,0,1,5,9,0,0,6,3,25,2,24,33,2,22,0,3,0,0,13,10,0,5,11,115,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097795238125024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.321858524285081,0.0,0.0,0.2974326284826085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13478450760075406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.227379015956589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691086792776599,0.0,0.0,0.1743665982568601,0.0,0.0,0.12612955038840235,0.11863110746657693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896340022097013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10557069541240324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11672521476718045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732570570939525,0.0,0.0,0.29017014580284056,0.0,0.0,0.13976660662019708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11221980557896097,0.0,0.0,0.08810955357854716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13297389224872197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14231594907956974,0.2526081274978626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13203351613185824,0.0,0.08456116789250939,0.135715718133858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20993989021485748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14911993740994986,0.0,0.10918994059235022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305491950764361,0.14776072541565266,0.09342871915263708,0.0,0.0,0.22071213527311165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08457885761752486,0.0,0.0,0.1539379522876899,0.0,0.1251184761826033,0.0,0.0,0.0896178386860162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15877709571152815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15571143964306033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12236327900033506,0.11910747963374566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13405016881184156,0.0,0.09376744683063827,0.0,0.0,0.08500225268327695
COVID19_support,Leniea,2020/04/07,"My 31 year old brother was given 2 more days to live. And the Doctor wants me family to make a difficult choice.. I can't bear it. His ICU doctor has changed about 4 times now. This current doctor I've met before on a pharmacy rotation at one of the network hospitals almost 3  years ago. He's a hard military man who got out of active duty and now works in critical care. He was cold and unforgiving when I was a student, and when I talked to him today, he's about the same.

My older brother (I'm 26) went to the hospital March 25th with COVID like symptoms and then intubated the day after he was admitted with a fever of 102F. Everyday I asked the hospital staff information about his labs, his breathing progression, his kidneys, organs, medications, any information that would help me understand how he was progressing. 

I could tell by the labs and his breathing that he really didn't improve much. It's been about 10 days and he's still on a ventilator. They now found blood in his endotracheal tube. The doctor told me that bleeding in patients is easy to treat if it's caused by cancer/tumors, or other external factors, but the fact that he's bleeding means he is bleeding in his lungs. The infection is getting more severe even with antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.

So today he asked me...  to try and decide. I asked him how much time does my brother have left? He said give or take one or two days. I can't even leave my military base (in Oklahoma) right now to go back to my family (in Pennsylvania) because I still need permission from the General Commander.. My mom tested positive for COVID March 19th and she's technically still on quarantine with my dad who was negative.  My mom has been begging me not to come because she doesn't want to see me get sick and end up like my brother. But I told her that I need to come home, I don't think the hospital staff will let me see him but if he... passes... I want to see his body at least.

The doctor said we can either

1. continue to let him stay sedated... see if he can try to continue to fight his infections. He would need to significantly improve in a matter of a day or two, if he doesn't then he's probably going to... pass away... sedated, while trying to fight.
2. wake him up. say our last good byes. 

I'm scared to have to make a decision. I talked to his boyfriend and he told me that my brother would want to keep fighting. I want him to fight too  but I know my mom wants to say bye, but we can't go into the hospital to say goodbye. It would have to be over video call... He would die alone in the hospital without anyone. he would be woken up after 10-14 days of being asleep and being suddenly told ""we can't save you. Say good bye forever."" I can't bear it. I'm falling apart at the seems. For anyone who's reading this thank you for reading it all. I would like for anyone to tell me if they had to make a hard decision like this before or if they lost anyone and what it was like. I've never lost a family member before... I am just totally lost. Thank you.  


tldr; older brother,31 relatively healthy ended up on a ventilator for 10-12 days. doctor told my family either we let him keep fighting for 1-2 more days to see if he gets better, if not he will die regardless or we wake him up and say good bye remotely from phone call.",3.5554904927175137,5.017685813918309,5.049274717451278,81.94636973094838,72.85779122541605,8.815176055293525,26.4252321200795,9.325443323948027,2.197610459493933,2597,89,525,60,51,873,276,661,0.113,0.8009999999999999,0.086,-0.9579,1,2,0,0,7,0,95.0,6,3,3,7,21,24,5,1,28,0,47,24,9,6,4,100,107,41,2,26,25,9,2,5,0,9,15,7,1,1,21,27,0,3,12,3,0,9,14,10,0,4,27,15,72,14,80,63,11,81,0,3,5,0,104,27,0,16,53,320,93,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047222272194044006,0.0,0.053344052966981116,0.055173560612558716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03622667817862065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14899563750108727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494059385541702,0.0,0.05005064757102903,0.04096275692232158,0.0,0.06494803880071165,0.0,0.1359912373367807,0.0,0.0,0.047114613662161305,0.0,0.05917300530534856,0.0,0.0,0.10879301020637104,0.0,0.05431419157595546,0.05472485439999655,0.056354543451818624,0.09177794682831693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04253322971676714,0.0,0.0,0.27484743943368106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11057551940138914,0.0,0.0,0.327155915257784,0.046618546446047626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09436607718578773,0.0,0.0,0.07037109620936383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2008797998796873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058409823255962716,0.0,0.0,0.08349701354027221,0.05110320340603138,0.09082684349107834,0.1340456765547883,0.04260635716946085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544221052016393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03570699163619142,0.0,0.05343599934919649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09470091871775713,0.0,0.0,0.02927681025424468,0.0434236599487572,0.0,0.05640718703955811,0.057880010365843775,0.16342219797732865,0.0,0.13012965154926406,0.0,0.047040010977241344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17445751985578986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10667810120444496,0.0,0.0,0.05802865127044175,0.0,0.0536657746283712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871740065690953,0.0,0.0,0.07832186432563759,0.11850118374983,0.0410865273502418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05589983511505845,0.0,0.07219675535740472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05743605395141273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10657251284891699,0.0,0.034127305004677574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04549386055056365,0.10134743852300558,0.2118195279397752,0.053334405495897165,0.0,0.21225379798493893,0.048496682665922185,0.0,0.060182016321448976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05678069372433753,0.12762888145181173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05536983950326775,0.040053794149220126,0.08563577467610155,0.09312387296104056,0.09809110651611133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03413444424667361,0.0,0.0,0.06212647696866616,0.0,0.10099095139821104,0.25451763164384783,0.0,0.10850424814089836,0.0,0.1040776945593631,0.05545786449288646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885266698363643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04938352967316106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05135215304676935,0.0,0.038782534208713366,0.0,0.0,0.2648995083767974,0.0,0.0,0.06861063714480302
COVID19_support,localinda,2020/04/07,"COVID-19 Impact Local Initiatives I've been putting together directories for small businesses, freelancers, etc and Mutual Aid for people who want to volunteer in my area. Even a GFM for those small businesses.

I think the most depressing part about all of this is all the people who want to help or are overcome with anxiety without the direction on what to do and nowhere to put that energy. [Locally, I've shared these efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/venturacounty/comments/fuzpap/vc_small_business_freelancer_volunteer_info/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and it seems like no one cares enough about these things to contribute or trust the effort. I've seen so many communities come together to support each other and make things happen. 

I have a strong want to put these things to good use but some days I just start to feel like it's pointless.",9.419014084507037,11.763284140845075,7.481802816901411,66.71354929577465,59.70422535211267,11.032112676056338,32.50985915492957,11.00357731598739,3.976070985915493,716,26,108,19,10,211,100,142,0.036000000000000004,0.782,0.182,0.9178,0,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,2,5,9,0,0,6,0,5,0,0,2,2,24,19,8,0,3,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,7,0,0,3,0,0,4,2,1,0,1,2,2,4,8,19,17,8,13,0,1,1,0,4,7,0,5,4,69,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1780508332237543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257115390782988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16754477243845753,0.0,0.0,0.1415552249794184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597886657028542,0.0,0.14153666902498718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16979619533740767,0.18327071640643453,0.10853801703146547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308988077661479,0.117396954203247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13783170182648535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14531594324893307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014653103657757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605660857592075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096911486780918,0.16660421625479666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135385242948426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17795272339838902,0.0,0.2278506260529649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.495589296848186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14959931144181973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631319314584344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864790525653968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3275194488288165,0.10529564240359478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14192783746244814,0.0,0.0,0.29077720831158504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15840767480473106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Rora06,2020/04/07,"Anxiety gnawing away at me over 56 y/o Dad Hi, 

My dad is 56 years old. No underlying health issues other than being overweight. Tomorrow he will get results back of whether he is positive/negative for Covid. I'm certain he has it. He works for the NHS and his job is transferring patients to and from the hospital (non-emergency) On the 1st he self isolated due to a cough. On the 3rd he had aches and pains and on the 4th I heard him trying to throw up in the bathroom but he said nothing would come up.

On the 4th he also got tested. He still has aches and pains and a cough today, his temperature is normal as of last check. I'm certain he has it because of apparent symptoms. 

My anxiety is overwhelming due to two reasons one being he is not a spring chicken and overweight. I know from combing over covid news that a majority percentage of people in ICU are the overweight. Second reason his disregard for the severity of the situation. I was taking a nap today and woke up to find him burning rubbish in the garden. I told him to at least move away from the smoke owing to what type of virus this is. But all he said was he had to keep the fire going.

So on top of panicking that he will end up in ICU because I've read and read that 10th day is most important so these few days are agonizing I am now terrified he has caused more damage.

COVID19_support,Majestic_Dependent,2020/04/07,"I got the BCG vaccine as a kid, can I get it again since it might help with Covid-19? I  was vaccinated with BCG at 1 I  think but I was told I should've received a second dose to reinforce it  at 16 which I didn't, but doctors now tell me I don't need it but I feel I should get it anyway since even if the effect against Covid-19 is not as expected tuberculosis is becoming more common (again) worldwide.

But somebody told me it could be dangerous to get it (the vaccine) again, is he right?

Also is it possible new strains of the disease have showed up and thus the BCG been updated since I was born?

Frankly I just want to be sure since my allergies and sinusitis already give  me  enough problems and last thing I need is my lungs being compromised as well.

COVID19_support,canadiancitizeninfo,2020/04/07,"Having to keep working, very exposed, and its starting to weigh on my mental health Has anyone else had to keep working outside the home while all this is going on? I've had to continue working in public spaces, surrounded by humans not taking any precautions, while all this has been happening.

For the most part I've been able to keep things in perspective. I am not in a high risk category, I wash and sanitize my hands like someone with OCD having a manic episode, I dont touch my face, I dont go out when I dont have to.

Still, its virtually impossible to avoid the onslaught of warnings. It spreads through breathing and talking, theres a massive surge of cases comparable to NYC about to happen in my province, people who have been perfectly healthy have been hospitalized and died, our healthcare system is about to be completely overwhelmed, there's a study saying people with type A blood could be more at risk (which I have), and the whole time I'm out in public spaces and situations every healthcare professional and politician is warning are a major risk.

Has anyone in a similar situation managed to find ways to cope? I try not to dwell on it, but as this situation seems to encroach, it just kind feels like its morbidly hanging over my head.",8.564560283687946,7.909163863829793,8.316436170212768,70.31791666666669,61.42553191489362,11.067375886524825,38.306737588652474,10.317481424215053,3.971035460992909,1008,44,174,19,12,324,141,235,0.043,0.87,0.087,0.8806,0,1,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,0,4,7,10,0,6,11,0,26,8,5,0,3,28,38,12,1,1,5,0,3,2,0,0,2,1,1,1,12,11,1,4,3,0,0,3,6,6,0,0,6,4,13,4,37,29,7,29,0,1,0,0,7,17,0,2,9,123,25,6,0.12029088639179275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180192769667757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16822036933512174,0.12325222842767455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612270575190826,0.0,0.0,0.09604248462533584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484294859296713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42294006891422026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10048760019093554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10135025988847386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060822686496418636,0.08593583327355232,0.0,0.0,0.10994369090894744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13672816568204108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21274566713901866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12345315335954354,0.12786358717903462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270939259008798,0.12066156697034253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3207602005721852,0.0,0.1252644473167301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175361019273234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122492076450095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302633077010065,0.0,0.16678910917793255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956601409814032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950830516135207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4056359888848325,0.0,0.0,0.10192207768108524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514250852190534,0.0,0.0960644572585582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904437761811057,0.09668525794393104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07991591985050114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07014258320873785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08166961575886597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925257915398067,0.0,0.09548130653792283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13430047882122695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2627195938523025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,atallplant,2020/04/08,"Is it weird I don't feel afraid of getting the virus? I am writing this from a hard hit area. I deal with anxiety and OCD (not the cleaning type) very often and yet I don't feel afraid. I know people who have died from the virus. My family had all likely gotten it after being exposed to someone who later tested positive. It was mild cases so everyone has recovered just fine. 

I don't know if I had it myself, I was exposed yet had no symptoms. All of this was nearly a month ago so a 14 day quarantine has been done for over 10 days now. Either way, I am not afraid to go to the grocery store, or anywhere for that matter. I am still staying home and keeping my distance unless I have to go out for something necessary. But I don't feel the need to wear a mask when I go out as they should be saved for essential workers and medical staff. 

My own mental health isn't doing well being stuck at home and getting worried over pointless things. But thankfully Netflix and other streaming services have been helpful to me.",3.99105090311987,5.300629517241379,4.917556650246309,83.91048932676522,71.5615763546798,7.383776683087027,28.31165845648605,7.793537801064563,1.7770344170771764,804,30,154,10,15,262,125,203,0.096,0.8290000000000001,0.075,-0.0808,0,1,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,1,10,9,0,3,9,0,28,4,1,0,2,32,44,15,1,3,9,0,4,1,0,1,3,0,3,0,11,9,0,1,5,1,1,3,8,4,1,0,11,4,19,5,24,28,4,23,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,3,12,118,30,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492634919012427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12881436544429964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2171892977820372,0.17359794733561318,0.0,0.0,0.17475745424556954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17231672012228938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16089945987133816,0.0,0.0,0.15873876345496327,0.0,0.2554221437162359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17594883692640695,0.0,0.2870918993930988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15084023867460147,0.0,0.0,0.17898579966232328,0.0,0.0,0.11286518012105785,0.0,0.3378085587800069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14966867494202274,0.0,0.0,0.18508041766062414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822645979859688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16963056931483525,0.1696928723863744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344036149225879,0.0,0.0,0.12485563597510345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167372304336292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426723978223071,0.12963130279215368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17947642551047252,0.13447279308279395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17501689788047756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550266474142491,0.0,0.0,0.11186777358407657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13893558471458328,0.0,0.13365648798484275,0.0,0.0,0.15139869139117154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1710035411294881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,OldLadiesAreReal,2020/04/08,"I have near-constant anxiety over circumstantial symptoms and it's ruining my life even though I am taking all the necessary steps to keep safe. This pandemic has been very hard on everyone and I fully realize this. So many people are also in much worse positions than me, objectively, and my heart truly goes out to them. Sometimes I feel like I am not ""allowed"" to complain - I have savings, I can comfortably isolate at home albeit in a crowded neighbourhood of a large city and I have emotional support from friends and family online.

I am very grateful for this and yet I live in near-constant fear due to health and general anxiety. I am healthy, no pre-existing conditions (although I did vape for 3 years - quit a week ago) and young (20s). I have been self-isolating to the point that I am afraid to go for a walk and am terrified of buying groceries. I have been taking all the necessary/government recommended steps to protect myself when shopping.

I have also been having nasal congestion and a sore throat coming and going for almost three weeks and I am terrified. I have just gotten into a really good place in my life and now I am unable to even work out/focus on anything or go on walks out of fear.

I really don't know what to do. The other day I went out for groceries and sat down on my couch in the same clothes I went out in - now I am worried I spread Covid-19 all over my house by not changing my clothes right away (even though doctors only recommend changing clothes right away for workers in high-risk environments). 

I keep resetting the 14 day counter on my phone since I go out for groceries or to the bank and never feel safe as a result.

Today I have a moderate sore throat again and I am scared that I will be the unlikely under 30 statistic of a rare death or ICU case that leaves me with lung damage. I am afraid that all the opportunities I look forward to next year that I put in place before the pandemic will be cut short by this disease.

At the same time I feel terrible for ""complaining"" or worrying about myself when other people are so much worse off.

Any support would really be appreciated",7.375374331550804,6.98789142156863,7.520668449197862,74.17459893048131,63.70588235294117,11.143672014260249,35.21212121212122,10.637119530657019,3.6810696078431375,1692,68,313,38,22,549,212,408,0.134,0.7509999999999999,0.115,-0.7917,1,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,1,4,17,21,1,5,20,0,37,13,5,2,5,53,57,30,1,1,7,0,4,1,1,3,8,0,2,0,13,24,0,5,5,1,3,13,5,11,0,1,9,6,45,10,58,42,8,66,0,2,1,0,6,35,0,5,21,223,58,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268818641485197,0.0,0.09340768224223243,0.0,0.0,0.14919393959422686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06343443843861561,0.0,0.1427197786558072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07676250819407568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1752815815186163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07937546035821898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973583556132052,0.08035352412658164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031735901096365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09547729651944876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10492883388002673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18483412755955672,0.0,0.0,0.0891342173657096,0.0,0.0,0.08793724638648771,0.2099346458359572,0.14149738536241085,0.06664013280561965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206885064052024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21205550169778065,0.07823987408258933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08356166411166725,0.0,0.0,0.09915359060393464,0.0,0.11053871241280756,0.0,0.09855674609986947,0.09356868422793856,0.0,0.0,0.10763402082291644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658252950729317,0.0,0.0,0.05126492715106089,0.0,0.0,0.09877135894474567,0.0,0.0,0.13177458963764888,0.04557249952391078,0.0,0.08236903935201585,0.0,0.0783327437832802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457253105539894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13714488136244107,0.0,0.07194423891157459,0.0,0.09920565150108272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07094458250653486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293389260655384,0.0,0.19491807301059175,0.0,0.08818091808008834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377340546055757,0.0,0.09921607546270103,0.0,0.0,0.17927504291624555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15932332974061136,0.0,0.0,0.09339078911425792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09731267181578758,0.0,0.0,0.07716320139838043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225752644823074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21170887971947835,0.0,0.09695491974196238,0.14027175920817084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832966792241943,0.0,0.05439303818094339,0.0,0.08841970353643618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539335758825333,0.0,0.0,0.14964915989687794,0.0,0.0,0.17294527847614866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06790984993506803,0.1894632439105787,0.1901230950743344,0.06626431285842625,0.0,0.0,0.12014011377848932

COVID19_support,cozyplaidblanket,2020/04/08,"I'm in the south, and I'm concerned people here aren't taking this seriously. First, I want to say that my concern is trivial compared to what many of you are going through. I read the posts here, and I'm so sorry to those of your who are suffering right now. 

Our neighbors hosted a pool party last night. There are always cars at their house. On fb, one of the parents of this family posted a video of some guy talking about how the encouragement to stay home is most likely due to the gov't wanting to control us and not so much about stopping the spread of a pandemic. Of course, plenty of facts, in the form of soundbites out of context, were used to back up his point. And the next day they throw a party at their house with multiple families. I'm so frustrated by this for several reasons. Selfishly, it bummed my daughter out, because she is in a family who is following the rules but she deeply misses her friends and it's been hard for her. But more than that, I am scared of what is going to happen to our community. Our governor is one of a few states not to declare shelter in place. We have great local leadership, but that can only go so far, and I worry for our rural communities. My father is still working, and he's over 66. I feel sad and discouraged, and I don't know what to expect in the near future. Everything seems uncertain to me, but so many people around me are acting as if this is summer vacation.

COVID19_support,VirusSignal,2020/04/08,"I created open source symbols to aid in social distancing  I think every community could benefit from easily recognizable universal signals for outbreaks or viruses.

I searched for it but there seems to not be a set of universally, recognizable signs outside of the bio-hazard sign which isn’t at all easy to draw. 

So I set out to create 3 symbols for : 

\- Immunocompromised 

o To hopefully create more awareness around that person or household

\- Recovered

o To give people a safe person to approach for help

\- Possibly infectious

o To warn people to stay away

All linking to a website/set of websites with guidelines how to behave

I’m not an artist but I think I succeeded in creating easy to [draw](https://virussignal.com/draw) 

Set of symbols, you can see them on the website I made – [www.virussignal.com](http://www.virussignal.com/) or on the github [https://github.com/windows-user0/VirusSignal/tree/master/public](https://github.com/windows-user0/VirusSignal/tree/master/public)

I need your help to possibly improve the signs, improve the copy, translate, improve the website. 

Or spread awareness. Universal signs work when everyone knows what they mean.

COVID19_support,accnt4dmbqs,2020/04/08,"Please Help Me (F19) Help My Mother (F48) \*Never used Reddit before, LMK if I'm doing it wrong\*

My mother is absolutely losing her mind with the stay at home order. She's always been a busybody: prior to this, she would work as a hostess at a fairly busy restaurant for 8 hours, and then either go to the gym or a greenway at a local park in the afternoon. For reference, she was easily hitting 17-21K steps a day on her Fitbit.

Since the stay at home order, she's been laid off, and most of the places she usually frequents have been (rightfully) closed. She still walks in the park every day (as of today, you're only allowed in by foot or bike, no cars) but due to prior health issues that worsen with the warmer weather, she's not sure how much longer she can do that anyway.

She's really not handling any of this well. She's already prone to anxiety and depression, and the added stress of the virus, losing her job, and having the whole family under one roof again is really, really hard for her; without her usual energy-expending outlets, she's been on the edge of a breakdown for a few weeks now. I think she also feels isolated because the rest of our family is handling it better (it still sucks, of course, but we're not as stir-crazy as she is).

I know that she understands and agrees with the fact that by staying inside, she's helping, but that knowledge isn't helping her stay sane in the same way it helps me. I have no idea what to say to her, or how to talk to her about all of this. I want to support her without coming across as condescending, or like I don't sympathize with her hopelessness.

Does anyone have any advice on how to console/support stir-crazy and anxious famly members? Or how I can broach this conversation with her without making her feel even worse than she already does?",7.350716744913927,6.317777650704231,7.458286384976527,76.71778951486702,64.04225352112675,10.36776212832551,31.553208137715178,9.444778638647367,2.6415133020344284,1426,42,273,22,18,462,194,355,0.13,0.774,0.096,-0.9507,2,0,0,0,0,1,54.0,1,0,0,4,13,12,1,1,22,0,20,2,1,7,4,54,34,27,0,3,16,2,3,1,0,1,1,1,2,0,14,14,0,0,8,2,0,5,11,7,1,1,5,4,39,5,53,27,8,48,0,4,0,0,39,18,1,7,19,192,53,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09063366881396127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047026030589461,0.07417168505557271,0.07717495513140638,0.0,0.0,0.12614558479634588,0.0,0.07095305950396126,0.10478045496830413,0.0,0.064852557457818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05653919119699069,0.0,0.07892293296689287,0.0,0.0,0.08202933296234034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798954206964691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11963141778481184,0.0,0.07988494749927047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16233130111451474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061260123273798574,0.0,0.0781453943866682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17487181480353525,0.0,0.093793796466818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052711638049800086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308527075653371,0.0,0.0,0.09858830612565736,0.0,0.0,0.3108399367350648,0.0,0.18607047971236887,0.0,0.09133950485383062,0.0,0.0,0.1047028161151592,0.0,0.09680630707067099,0.0920394970512128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050972660704409783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04531268617312584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20752577387374924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061910964230315835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09365048364447222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818150237915216,0.0,0.07153407765255737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284941362863662,0.0705401203880726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09690341284841424,0.10181102117711023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782529780723424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920750579860056,0.0,0.07375806882293134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672328631533594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39543420347195,0.1481396280043481,0.0,0.10624415782937416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21050190634725893,0.08741523941640206,0.0,0.0,0.07454847793897461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05943008920061652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791561401553642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655542682547492,0.0,0.08010572752966967,0.2043007855393243,0.0,0.054706016421922334,0.0736201798019158,0.07439799757879564,0.0,0.08339287564743447,0.0,0.0,0.1035514254758878,0.0,0.26822142005525257,0.0,0.06752268912872088,0.0,0.09451959220326074,0.06588653342255887,0.10140694082706024,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,sevenliveslater,2020/04/08,"Silver linings? I’ve been trying to calm my anxiety and not just lose my mind. I had one day last week that was really hard and I cried most of day. After that I had some just “anxiety fatigue” I was just totally burnt up from being stressed and worried.
Since then I’ve been trying to do more for my mental health. I have a toddler and a baby and I need to be able to be a functional adult and mother. 
So along with playing more music in the house (dancing and singing helps!) I started to try to make lists of things to be grateful for. 
One list was of things my family are blessed to have specifically.
The other list was about good things that could come out of this. 

New science and technology- the sterilizing masks, the research on the virus and vaccine/treatment protocols
The reverence for doctors and nurses
The appreciation of essential retail workers and grocery workers
The focus on communication with loved ones
The technology for communication- FaceTime,zoom, etc
The availability for education resources
The push for internet as a necessity and for it to be available to all
Everyone is (hopefully) washing their hands and cleaning better - and apparently using toilet paper more 
Connections between neighbors and other helping each other 

I’m looking for more things, things I can focus on and add to things to remind myself about.
Hopefully this helps you too.",5.636417967996921,8.131105234817817,6.099976865240028,72.2780431848853,69.52631578947367,8.753344900713321,32.40967804125699,9.362217197678863,3.4113070753807597,1111,51,175,25,21,358,146,247,0.055999999999999994,0.8109999999999999,0.133,0.9689,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,1,4,8,11,0,1,15,0,20,6,1,2,2,38,30,19,0,4,4,1,2,0,1,0,4,0,2,1,15,23,0,0,0,3,1,3,1,3,0,3,8,3,15,8,40,16,10,17,1,2,1,1,9,6,0,4,8,141,30,5,0.12770155112305578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19538267414924296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11294164441186585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100035788244156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195929740197204,0.0,0.14027415750579747,0.16471387197726758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13070794875249098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424209858827436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202430462782682,0.0,0.0,0.1203856572518144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10711000232296354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11439550666535495,0.0,0.0,0.13574077725006148,0.0,0.0,0.256786973653847,0.0,0.0,0.2536729087646312,0.0,0.14735044445755258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10409380826427302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723714048586797,0.14286537091497978,0.0,0.0,0.11525563568999175,0.0,0.08524177699343542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286931278066675,0.0,0.12894216301416414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094689082057267,0.0,0.12333495383337995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2596016279493064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180888363452984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10563604272040904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038781516117536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14628169535295682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5090354172515815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601029119877544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11029313865277153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10243448147209536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12968712394626775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,baddmenwearpants,2020/04/08,"Group Therapy Video Conference for Social &amp; Mental Health Support Hi -

I am interested in either joining or starting some kind of group therapy option - whether formal or informal - for individuals looking to provide each other social support and comfort through shared dialogue. We are all struggling and impacted by COVID-19 in some way, shape, or form, but all of us have the power and tools to help each other get through this together.

I was thinking we could organize a regular hourly meeting every week and conduct a video conference through Google Hangouts or Zoom or another easily accessible platform.

Is anybody else interested in this idea? If so, please reply with a comment and feel free to send me a direct message.",8.882419354838708,10.456722241935488,8.440483870967743,62.15572580645164,60.45161290322582,11.361290322580645,44.532258064516135,11.20814326018867,5.86918064516129,594,36,80,16,8,189,91,124,0.013999999999999999,0.784,0.20199999999999999,0.9743,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,3,0,0,1,1,9,0,1,5,0,6,1,0,0,2,29,13,14,0,2,9,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,10,0,0,4,3,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,6,9,15,11,8,10,0,0,1,0,15,5,0,9,3,58,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19170451216596568,0.0,0.0,0.18552743289607054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14126489418204488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14780302970041476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14907187995312593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08946155865607087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243907144937948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880692298105968,0.0,0.0,0.11859302546820885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17424125643508365,0.0,0.0,0.1997334040883161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842462631407411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14857736066380758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1783046916250488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942169522073408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3607174593221964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252325728937664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849665499825944,0.0,0.0,0.4015580848902367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4046717146482887,0.0,0.0,0.11337015050536745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21282603885502624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14043948068462306,0.14192326305171568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,itsmelilvenicebih,2020/04/08,"I’m terrified of catching the Rona. I’ve developed a cough and chest pains, my asthma came back out of complete nowhere after not using an inhaler since I was a kid. Can’t get tested of course bcuz I’m not near death. My fiancé has also had a little cough and said his chest hurt the other day. No fever for either of us though, and my 4 year old is sneezing so I’m hoping it’s just a cold. I have a history of anxiety and have chest pains before a panic attack, which at this point is about three times a day. I’m trying to stay away from news, read recovery stories and generally just stay positive, but the thought of fucking dying and not seeing my toddlers grow up has me a nervous wreck. I just read about Pink’s son and how much he struggled with covid, so now as opposed to thinking kids were more or less safe I’m having horrible intrusive thoughts of them getting critically ill.

COVID19_support,rebeccaelder93,2020/04/08,"I have a throat infection (probably bacterial) and started a week course of antibiotics. I'm freaking out if this was the right thing to do. I've had a persistent sore throat for 3 weeks and woke up one night from a larynspasm. It was incredibly frightning, but I realized I needed to speak with a doctor. I consulted virtually a ENT who perscribed me an antibiotic. I waited another week to see if it would get better. It did not. There was a white coating around the tonsils so I did not think it was viral. On Monday I began my rounds.

I'm now freaking out. I realize antibiotics are going to decrease my immune response, but holy shit...reading the academic articles it sounds like I have no fighting chance of this thing. Now I'm worried I just put myself in the at-risk category for a mild infection.

I'm trying to weigh my options here. I took the antibiotics with the idea that a throat bacterial infection would do me more harm if I got COVID than if I was cured, but now reading the horrifying effects of antibiotics I'm wondering if I made the wrong choice. Do I stop my course of treatment (which has been helping, the white stuff is gone) in hopes I only did minimal damage, or continue and potentially screw myself out of a healthy immune system system? I know this is a doctor question, but any advice would be greatly appreciated/if anyone else is going through strep during the worst time to have a throat infection.",5.532243154010488,6.880936483394837,6.4316721693532735,74.35494270732184,67.92988929889299,9.83810448630802,32.713342396581865,10.064110947511567,3.4646339483394843,1141,50,202,28,19,378,153,271,0.16,0.75,0.09,-0.9670000000000001,0,0,0,0,2,0,31.0,0,0,0,3,8,12,2,0,23,0,25,15,4,2,0,39,47,14,0,10,13,0,1,1,0,3,9,2,0,0,14,9,1,2,8,1,0,5,3,8,0,1,16,6,25,4,26,27,2,29,0,1,4,1,6,9,1,10,14,139,39,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13702424179366587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09535641301147066,0.14703598712132224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09804714550702154,0.14367498088936612,0.0,0.12482815260885645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401580230716015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870482578304007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11713827994211892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07326070278109162,0.0,0.1593838654441274,0.0,0.1121491010335863,0.15459629507354236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398848619433206,0.0,0.0,0.13927302664955532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582946401661202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07706286501061999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06850584940185568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326823437376868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397353909809692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315897376269379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501869848519078,0.10664587055446054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15118405434071072,0.0,0.0,0.14096279246236162,0.15708179316023102,0.0,0.2805217884119712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11974963132849342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11173953473796387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393684094589454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925052423645046,0.0,0.0,0.11723266319970947,0.0,0.0,0.16052172728180228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1863157916696744,0.08984920305013626,0.0,0.0,0.08176512855473346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15579285457143854,0.0952021771377747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3374351720261969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206580547063542,0.0,0.14240321016093502,0.0,0.2988310769534401,0.1533117809449488,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,EveOfJesusEve,2020/04/08,"Screwed because of COVID19 I am mentally kicking myself. I quit my job right before this entire pandemic blew up because of the mental toll having a manager of his caliber took. I've been slowly job hunting since December 2019 and applied to a few, but when the interviews hit I just didn't have the energy to really nail it. At these interviews, they rate you on a numerical scale depending on how many points you touch up on, so my actual personality and passion mattered little next to how thorough the answers were for them. I felt that I should take the time to really study for the interviews and give them my best self, something I couldn't do while employed at the current position because of the sheer number of responsibilities I had, from HR to contract-writing to accounting to executive assistant. That job bled so much into my life if I wasn't thinking about it, I was dreaming about it, or complaining about it. 

To give you a bit of background on my previous job, half the company has quit since the beginning of this year. The manager (who owns the company) is absolutely insufferable. Everyone agrees on this part. On a day I had taken off, he called me while I was driving to an interview. I started hyperventilating while driving, that's how much anxiety he gave me. He has no concept of boundaries, personal or work-wise. People were regularly verbally abused, intimidated, and threatened with their performance. Few people have lasted in other positions; no one has lasted in my position. 

Anyhow, I wanted to go out as professionally as possible before I hit my breaking point, so I put in my notice and left the mess of a company behind. Social distancing started almost right after, and I had one interview before the hiring process to, well, everywhere, stopped completely. Literally right after my interview that day, a bit after I'd left my job, I received an email from the prospective workplace and everyone else that the hiring process has been delayed. Now there are very few job postings in my field, and if there are it's by a recruiter who may just be baiting.

Now I am unemployed without any job prospects. Had I known this would happen so fast maybe I would've kept my position, but at the same time, even thinking about it now absolutely terrifies me. If anything, I was afraid I'd lose it at him altogether after the culmination of mistreatment and work overload. He doesn't listen to suggestions, and people who stood up to him before either left or were forced to leave. There just was no winning. 

Almost everyone qualifies for some kind of unemployment under the COVID-19 stimulus package, but nowhere does it mention someone in my position. Sure, I have some savings to get me through, but that was meant to be until my next job (which doesn't take me very long normally), and I was also open to a part-time job if I felt the need to. 

Now if I were to be a part-timer it'd be at the risk of getting coronavirus, I just don't want to burden the healthcare system any more than it currently is or risk my loved ones. I'm taking this time to try to learn more skills, and be positive, but... I'm really at a loss here. I know it's my fault for lack of foresight, but god knows how long the impact will last will be on the job market. *insert curse word of choice* I know that I'm still very fortunate compared to many, many others out there, but I am nonetheless furious at myself for the poor timing. 

Anyone else on the same boat? What are you doing for income, any suggestions for me on what to do? Thanks for reading.

COVID19_support,TharosTheDragon,2020/04/08,"How do I give things away during quarantine? While this is not a request for emotional support, I am looking for covid-related advice/recommendations and this seems to be the best sub I've found for this question so far.

I live in the Seattle area and I am moving out of my apartment to be quarantined with my family in response to the pandemic. I will not have space for all my things and so I want to give away about a dozen pieces of furniture, appliances, etc. Ordinarily Goodwill would take everything, and other places like The Salvation Army would at least take some things, but nowadays even the few places that are still open are not accepting donations.

I also have some electronics like an old tower computer and a monitor that I've needed to get rid of for a long time. I could have recycled them at Best Buy, but I procrastinated and now its too late. While getting rid of them was not originally related to the move I still need to get rid of them so they also fit into this post.

Do I just have to throw my things away? It feels wrong to waste things like that, especially in a time when so many people are in need. Are there any options available to put my extra stuff to good use?",6.845134865134868,6.7407702900432875,6.971168831168832,76.73169830169832,64.71428571428572,10.917216117216118,32.05494505494506,10.560738912317856,3.1587426573426582,951,33,186,22,13,306,132,231,0.05,0.833,0.11699999999999999,0.9438,1,2,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,4,2,16,9,0,0,12,0,20,0,0,3,1,36,37,18,0,7,7,0,1,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,16,10,0,0,5,0,2,4,4,1,0,1,2,2,20,8,34,29,10,36,0,0,1,0,8,19,0,5,15,142,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17971460052727858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07641124562213238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3167085019145109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358377778535372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971336115792386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639416531147,0.0,0.0,0.1253153529745589,0.07421523843063474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10098534941827224,0.0,0.10592660230568804,0.0,0.05681451975690495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320112071966527,0.0,0.0,0.1761163631642469,0.21557921531102608,0.0,0.09424543486350304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675127472785575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646858492223796,0.0,0.0992193050416374,0.09943843818319682,0.09435730295416507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391926968146325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2388499005755164,0.0,0.24994902964538024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11790691959535515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07789891966695843,0.0,0.2347925372968763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076134721523737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11295666665992875,0.12587318567118874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022917948141136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17946777162413155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128629682510638,0.0,0.12750912285828525,0.0,0.0,0.16896720630822795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3732476209764983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13104048535402454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09704625701947693,0.0,0.0,0.06627508786094276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15964005705534026,0.1228521898064878,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Duude_Hella,2020/04/09,"Mom is sick, 2000 miles away. My mom has a shattered disc in her lower back and can't walk. She went to the ER and they told her they can't do surgery because of her lungs. She's 70 with severe COPD, and was on a ventilator with the 2010 H1N1 flu and almost died then.  Now that she's been in the hospital I fear she'll get this Coronavirus bs, too. 

My dilemma is that my mom is very unpleasant with a lifelong borderline personality disorder and has alienated all of her family and doesn't have anyone near her who cares enough to go help her.

I haven’t been turning this anger outward, but I do notice an increase in my drinking.

Reading about how nurses are being treated by their hospital administrations, reading about our for-profit healthcare systems and the struggle many are facing as far as rent, shelter, potentially losing jobs ect... these things haven’t helped.

I just wish I could make our system better, but I feel powerless to help my community.

I could stop reading the news, but if I do that how will I stay informed?

Guys, if you’re feeling angry and helpless, what are you doing to facilitate positive change?

What can *I* do to stop feeling angry and start being constructive?

Please help. And more importantly stay safe!

COVID19_support,redwine789,2020/04/09,"Dad on vent for over two weeks, just got a scary phone call from the hospital My dad started showing covid-19 symptoms on March 12, was admitted to the hospital on March 19, and was intubated and put on a vent on March 23. They told us when they intubated him that it wasn't an emergency but just precautionary to help him bc his breathing was a little labored, so they wanted his body to rest while his lungs got stronger. He got the positive test result on March 21, I believe. That day was also the last day I spoke with him over FaceTime. They are now trying to wean him off the vent but today they called my mom and told her that he's just not responding well to coming off the vent and that we should prepare for the worst. I can't believe I just typed those words. They're going to try again but we don't know how many times. 

I don't know what to do, I'm separated from my mom and siblings right now and I don't know whether I should go home to be with them or stay away. Apparently he did better on Monday when they played his favorite music but for some reason they can't play music anymore? But they said we could bring a radio or something so my mom is going to try to do that. 

I just can't believe this is happening. My dad is in his late 60s and has an underlying lung condition, but he was so healthy and vibrant even after he started feeling sick. This isn't supposed to happen. And we can't even go be with him.

COVID19_support,adirtyiphonescreen,2020/04/09,"Obesity and COVID Alright, I'm gonna make a post here outlining my concerns with sources and I would really appreciate some assistance in subduing my panic. It's pretty bad right now. 

**TRIGGER WARNING FOR OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS!**


[This](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france-confinement/obesity-is-major-covid-19-risk-factor-says-french-chief-epidemiologist-idUSKBN21Q0S7?utm_source=reddit.com) reuters article came out a little while ago from the French chief epidemiologist who says that obesity is a major risk factor. In this article he says the following:

*“This virus is terrible, it can hit young people, in particular obese young people. Those who are overweight really need to be careful,”*

In addition, he says that: *The mortality rate for young people entering hospital with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease was about 2%, he said, but that rose to 14% for people who are more fragile.*

Then, there's a chinese study that this guy in /r/covid19 keeps spamming in any comment section that involves overweight people whatsoever, it's this one: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3556658

In this study, the researchers claim that patients with a BMI of over 28, especially men, have a significantly increased risk of developing severe pneumonia from COVID19 infection. The risk for men is 4.4 times as high, whereas the risk for women was difficult to ascertain because of the low sample size. This was adjusted for comorbidities, so we're talking about purely obesity here.

*""Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese persons were more likely to progress to severe pneumonia due to 2019-nCov infection. The association remained after adjusting for comorbidities and other risk factors. In addition, further sub-analysis demonstrated that men with BMI ≥28 had 4·4-fold increased odds of progression to severity, with almost half of the obese male patients developed severe pneumonia.""*

Add to this the following reports of a high percentage of overweight or obese patients in ICUs in the Netherlands (and i've seen similair reports coming out of Spain as well)

https://nos.nl/artikel/2328804-veel-patienten-op-ic-met-overgewicht-maar-ga-nu-niet-te-streng-dieten.html (translation is that 80-90% of patients in the ICU in the Netherlands are overweight or obese)

So, I think with all of this information it's fair to conclude that being overweight/obese/morbidly obese is a definite increased risk factor.
I was morbidly obese, I'm now just barely below that line. All of this information keeps running around my head and I am unable to deal with it. I can't sleep anymore, I'm having trouble seeing the point in even staying alive if I have a large chance of ending up in the ICU because of this disease. I'm in my early 20s, so that ups my chances of survival by a bit, but I'm so worried and scared that I have the same chances of dying as someone who is in their late 60s, or early 70s. I'm in the process of losing weight and have been for a while now (went from BMI of 44 to 39.5) but I feel like it's not enough. I'm having trouble keeping my diet healthy and am just not eating for days at a time which I know is bad but every time I try to eat I feel like I'm making myself more likely to die, even though I know that when I don't I'm just weakening my immune system.

I feel like I'm fucked and my life is over. Please help me.",8.223520972233942,10.31966000346021,7.2201595071314095,68.40694446788761,62.28719723183391,10.06809013418854,35.723858553464424,10.266548611578706,4.076108734914339,2774,125,416,64,41,848,282,578,0.152,0.752,0.096,-0.9891,0,0,0,0,0,0,141.0,0,0,1,5,21,25,1,8,29,1,32,26,2,4,3,64,66,29,3,4,13,0,6,5,0,2,18,4,0,7,36,25,19,3,11,0,0,10,4,17,1,2,11,13,25,8,84,50,14,68,0,2,2,1,26,34,1,6,26,257,61,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375366979531357,0.0,0.08331491656953062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05658030281109749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251415775981406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406753726264204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13894060955347398,0.10143849469753104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09083517886582436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516107358673677,0.08483011859809805,0.0,0.0,0.07167126940707949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05365849193147221,0.08577774459012541,0.0,0.0,0.1727013539683919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17027310472663545,0.0,0.0,0.07369239315762408,0.08597004357906138,0.0,0.1099084468369626,0.0,0.0701013845998422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12620849349097635,0.17831885895052305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691903023539544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823831915963349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538939113963609,0.08843997549701726,0.0,0.0,0.05576863518337525,0.17581524092163986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2218616332052493,0.0,0.0,0.09145143153124068,0.0,0.09385562880704357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05876812633662056,0.20324179470877185,0.08339039414285758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09308190330910583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107613822976284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061693326549564574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08152042377156515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05637991785997393,0.0,0.0,0.09761977487769917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2884094106520643,0.07264889231465402,0.0,0.09133095568914153,0.07865290794621034,0.0,0.07968464316162517,0.08464647984330359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066028324082383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710541660293829,0.07914428052838764,0.19849702431523136,0.08329984875589892,0.0,0.06630132690377755,0.0,0.0,0.4699736324788869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832622194793451,0.0,0.07049689635329003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08868240220388665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06687472197625087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053312566563309835,0.0817456721462848,0.0,0.14554749660493074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05648878602515251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10008192026107407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20263556372591424,0.07480870874771545,0.0771292098329138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844958036667008,0.0,0.05910440731223855,0.0,0.0,0.0

I've been sick a couple of times between January and now but I'm scared that I've got covid. I have no fever yet and my blood oxygen is staying around 99. I just have a bit of a tickle in the throat with some dryness there, strange feeling in the chest with a cough that dislodges mucus. Mucus from my throat and nose is clear. Fatigue, headaches, sneezing. Breathing gets labored when I focus on it (I know this is probably anxiety but I just needed to write it out) I have a history of anxiety and panic issues, the grass pollen count in our area is very high but I'm still worried.

COVID19_support,Desolias,2020/04/09,"My incarcerated dad just tested positive and I am beyond stressed out My dad has fought hard to keep himself sane ever since he was thrown in prison for something he didn't even do. For years it has seemed like the world has been against him as he's dealt with being attacked several times in prison, having his family cut him off so I'm one of the only people he has to talk to, and dealing with several health issues. Despite all this, he has always been an outstanding father and done everything in his power to be a part of my life despite being locked away. He's a damn hero. 

I was a kid when he was put in, I'm now 22. We had plans to reintroduce him to the world and get him caught up with the things he has been missing. He is eligible for parole March next year. It might not seem that close to many, but relative to how long he has been in and dealing with the hell that is US correctional facilities, it is just around the corner. 

Just last night, he called to inform me he has tested positive for COVID-19. As he is a 48-year-old guy with type 2 diabetes and congestive heart failure, I've been hearing from a lot of sources that the odds are stacked against him. He called sounding like he was at death's door already. 

I feel like everything is falling apart. My dad is my best friend. He has been my only motivation to do anything for the past several years. He has faced several serious health issues in the past and always come out on top without any lasting conditions apart from what I mentioned above. I guess it's easy to tell that I'm fearing the worst at this moment.

What I don't know is how his body is going to deal with this or what kind of treatment he is going to receive. The facility he is at is home to the largest number of cases in my state. They refused to test him even when he stated that he had a seriously high fever, was waking up in the middle of the night sweating profusely, had trouble breathing, and was having a severe cough. 

I do know that he has maintained a pretty decent diet and he has kept his diabetes in check quite well, since the only food available to him has made it really easy to do so. As for his heart, I'm not sure. I won't be able to check on him at all until he either recovers or we are hit with grim news since he is currently quarantined and unable to use the phone. 

I'm just so afraid at this point. For years we've told each other to stay strong for the day he gets out, and now it seems like that day might never come. If there is *anything* anyone is able to say that might make me see this situation differently, I'm open. Thanks. I just need something.

COVID19_support,metaSeta,2020/04/09,"Is my father putting himselt in high risk by going to work? In Bangladesh, we had 54 new infected people (Coronavirus) on April 8 alone. Within the next day we have 112 more. The number seems to be going up exponentially.  

My father lives far away from the center of infection, but still there is Little  coverage whether or not it is spreading without news coverage, into these areas. 

He lives alone. He goes to his chicken egg production  factory/farm everyday, where he has 2-3 workers WHO GOES TO SHOP TO DELIVER THE EGGS AND HAVE LITTLE TO NO IDEA ABOUT HYGIENE AND GERMS. 


He says he is taking precaution so no need to worry. But HE HAS ASTHMA/COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and had to be hospitalized and calmed by some injection several times previously. He sometimes has these breathing difficulties which are hard to go through. Now isn’t that even more dangerous to go out?


He says he sprays dettol-water before entering home, then goes in and washes hand with soap, changes cloth. But there are still other ways of infection - such as him being casual about external objects (raw food, packaging, letting people in to fix things etc.).


Am i panicking?

A) Should i let him be and the chances are too low this way?

B) Should I replace him, make him rest at home, and me doing the outside work (as a 23 year old guy with no medical issues and intense germophobia) is somehow better?

C) Should i stop this altogether even if it likely means the business being doomed?


Thank you so much for your support, for reading all that. I pray for all of your safety.",5.175452898550724,7.2340126805555585,5.559450483091791,77.5066847826087,69.7638888888889,8.758695652173913,30.57729468599034,9.318704503766252,2.9560653381642514,1244,52,213,27,23,397,191,288,0.147,0.7559999999999999,0.09699999999999999,-0.9554,0,2,0,0,0,0,47.0,2,3,0,4,15,10,1,1,9,0,28,11,2,1,2,36,39,19,0,5,8,2,2,1,0,3,6,2,2,1,12,14,3,1,3,3,1,6,6,4,0,0,2,4,18,6,39,27,8,40,2,2,0,0,25,19,0,5,14,146,30,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495921239490375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11320863918862582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253202617492699,0.0,0.0,0.1065676780909122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274673053375142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770904601835696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13438332561897784,0.1591710882215495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14570254352481046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2739194223566199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11930859397007768,0.0,0.0,0.10793949028140372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12730915606943125,0.24173180822173546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360237319995625,0.0,0.12576505253082498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24642777591734835,0.0,0.0588675730881432,0.2415344801047393,0.2127978713000306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08043107834880586,0.0,0.0,0.13125393902157195,0.0,0.12138562858871067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08857739219496089,0.08934521600026081,0.0,0.11637443146783398,0.1281473696090061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264388089137808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16707156207901694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211303496043077,0.0,0.0,0.12052720334353688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19164427774971973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096937545509322,0.0,0.13612459582486136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11917223627975518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19245427970166007,0.10073887747517853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13673583938221764,0.0,0.0,0.0905969403001138,0.0,0.0,0.11093523484822314,0.0,0.0,0.08005125532603584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702613677997373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1912860031600531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615249048637392,0.0,0.1754430016444441,0.12236811097634505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07759456912125663
COVID19_support,JT99-FirstBallot,2020/04/09,"[Support] The restaurant my sister works at is ignoring government orders and reopening. How do I report this? Where do I go? I don't know if this is the right place to post this. I tried /r/coronavirus because I don't venture far on reddit besides my normal subs, but they don't allow text posts. Tried AskReddit but they are removing all pandemic posts right now. I did try NoStupidQuestions and got a little response but I'm looking for more in depth answers. Unless I'm wrong and their answers are that simple to do. *Mods, anyone, if this is the wrong place tell me where to go*.

My sister works at a restaurant in The Villages, Florida. You may have seen the news reports about seniors here refusing our stay at home order so they can still go to country clubs and golf. I thought that was quite damn selfish but now I've found out something that really hits home.

The [restaurant](https://www.legacyrestaurant.com/) my sister works at is (against government orders for restaurants) opening back up on Easter Sunday and indefinitely after. It's on a country club that remained open for golf. My sister has told me the owner, is a man who is known to only care about his money. She's none too thrilled about it but says she has to go back to work starting Sunday. 

Being honest, if she has to go back to work, I don't and she doesn't want to come back into contact with our family, but she has kids and has family who watches them. But she'd be facing a public everyday who are, honestly, quite self centered during this pandemic and an owner who doesn't seem to care.

Who do I call? Do I call the local mayor's office? The governor? Who? I want to report this. I just don't know where to go. Can someone help me find out the right avenue here?

COVID19_support,throwaway2462452,2020/04/09,"I can't do anything productive and I'm becoming addicted to Ativan For me it's the usual: anxiety, fear, uncertainty, etc. and I have a compromised immune system. But the biggest problem right now is I find it hard to do anything productive. I've been furloughed from my job so what am I supposed to do all day? Read a book, exercise or learn something new right? But I'm crippled by the anxiety and can't focus. I miss being around people, going to the gym, meeting friends on the weekend, all the things we take for granted but can't do now, especially me, not now. Empty roads, no planes flying over anymore, lots of people walking outside for their moment of respite. It's like 9/11 every single day.

In the evening I take Ativan and then watch something on Netflix or whatever and escape. Then I take a sleeping pill. Then I wake up, remind myself it's not a dream, and go through the day with all the anxiety, checking the news, fearing for the future, scared for my parents and friends, scared for me, until it's time to take Ativan again.",4.183339552238806,5.977706422885571,5.042708333333334,81.28406250000002,71.83582089552239,7.4130597014925375,30.970460199004968,8.07648339933343,2.360425124378109,825,37,148,12,16,268,117,201,0.14400000000000002,0.7709999999999999,0.086,-0.8981,2,0,2,0,0,0,32.0,1,0,1,0,7,9,0,4,15,0,12,6,2,0,3,25,21,17,0,1,7,1,1,1,2,0,4,0,0,0,7,10,0,0,2,7,1,3,6,6,0,0,1,2,16,3,24,19,6,31,0,1,1,0,6,10,0,3,18,104,23,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14318744430955646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30143992176425444,0.0,0.13026077241182227,0.0,0.0,0.2161745174811348,0.11692653571714676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450622665862343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541235393491892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14648644778430764,0.08675334977810913,0.0,0.11066537856077907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2956034256425162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12004863320722133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20295648721177165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14929487336070255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11766097046744528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034147263135265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06416943197115971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111666387286878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268555975982924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458451231793166,0.0,0.0,0.1821187230037892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125681188144376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13138238541016053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2243389692471155,0.0,0.0,0.2630022031447278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13144169820738666,0.0,0.0,0.20223443059364876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.395025912733223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726100488563593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765893993026524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446599889182402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I know it’s probably silly, but I’m having a lot of anxiety about the actual test process. I’m really afraid of the deep swab (I have a low pain tolerance), and also having people covered in suits and protection coming up to me like I’m dying. I don’t want to do it alone but I have to.

I was wondering if anyone who has had the test could explain in detail what it’s like so I know exactly what to expect.

COVID19_support,anybloodythingwilldo,2020/04/10,"Loss of taste and smell Hi, I fell ill after coming back from a trip to Italy at the beginning of March- shivery, horrible aching and a cough.  Once the other symptoms went I lost my smell and taste, it's been three weeks and it's still not properly back.  I couldn't get tested of course (just phone us back if you can't breathe basically say the ever helpful 111), but it seems likely I might have had it.  

I was just wondering for others who have had it, if you got your smell and taste back?  I'm not sure how long this sort of thing takes, but I'm starting to wonder now if it's permanently impaired.  I know I can't complained compared to the people who've suffered lung problems, but it's a bit annoying even so.  What's strange is I lost the senses *after* the other symptoms, whereas doctors are saying that the loss happens at the beginning of the infection.",3.888466010733453,5.31142619186047,4.52581395348837,86.1801878354204,71.96511627906976,7.385330948121648,27.18425760286225,7.882392219407189,1.5548590339892667,683,24,137,9,13,218,105,172,0.185,0.7879999999999999,0.027999999999999997,-0.9754,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,3,0,4,12,10,1,0,12,0,12,11,2,1,2,27,29,13,0,5,10,0,0,1,0,1,6,2,0,0,15,6,3,0,4,0,0,4,5,8,0,1,8,8,13,2,14,19,1,21,0,5,0,0,11,2,0,8,16,92,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4639319235088348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16467300448267408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12993119423240795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15438624868912082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09962524643344102,0.13643910043883226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07880518184774375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206367119821542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333830951848505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110167477195098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289509737596247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369047408511553,0.0,0.0,0.1334844314785387,0.0,0.0,0.3293089415781531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16001234206067225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1606345965424211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10457015611387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14432894375786526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2399004569447905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13731472783719376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10676195168791187,0.0,0.12045720901123096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14216041861316508,0.31355111417230513,0.11340932080519163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10020822409735727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18143620907193686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12099092275434906,0.0,0.0,0.13982576877315053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3271487440884876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,overheadSPIDERS,2020/04/10,"A few suggestions and tips for managing anxiety and being housebound Hi, I wanted to throw down some links and personal advice for dealing with two things I'm very familiar with: sudden lifestyle changes (being mostly homebound due to shelter in place orders, based on my adjustment to being disabled), and managing anxiety (based on my experience managing anxiety).

First, a few awesome resources:

7cups is a website for emotional support. 

NAMI has this guide (nami.org/getattachment/About-NAMI/NAMI-News/2020/NAMI-Updates-on-the-Coronavirus/COVID-19-Updated-Guide-1.pdf), and there are some free resources on the headspace and calm apps.

I find that being distracted helps dealing with anxiety sometimes, so maybe watch movies or find free stuff via aidtable (https://aidtable.com/). Videogames can also be a good distraction tool, but if possible I encourage you to exercise as well, even if it's just a short Yoga with Adriene video or something.

Talkspace is probably the most popular online therapy provider, but https://moodgym.com.au/ offers FREE cognitive behavioral therapy and has been proven to be effective for some people.

I ""went"" to a lovely seminar today about anxiety and COVID-19, and the top recommendations were: CBT, getting exercise (including yoga), meditation and mindfulness, and setting a routine. I really recommend trying to implement one change at a time, and I think setting a routine is a good place to start. Try to wake up and go to sleep around the same time every day (even weekends), get dressed in the morning, eat at reasonable times, and set aside part of the day to not look at the computer and part of the day to walk/do yoga/move/exercise. Don't be hard on yourself if it's hard to start a routine--because it is hard! Try to make your routine reasonable (not planning on being hyper-productive 12 hours a day) and somewhat flexible.

In terms of help for the newly housebound, I found this resource really good: https://howtogeton.wordpress.com/newest-news-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/ Really, that entire blog is pretty great (though some might find some of the material stressful). https://howtogeton.wordpress.com/homebound-housebound-bedridden/ is good too!

In terms of self-care, California released this helpful tip sheet: https://covid19.ca.gov/img/wp/california-surgeon-general_stress-busting-playbook_draft-v2clean_ada-04072020.pdf

But generally: TRY TO BE NICE TO YOURSELF. Do things that will make you feel good (and not just in the moment, but afterwards too). This is a challenging and stressful time for many people and a perfect time to practice being kind to ourselves about our imperfections.",14.957293233082707,15.107353701754384,11.40902255639098,50.668872180451146,48.32330827067669,13.913784461152881,45.561403508771924,12.848724342968257,6.210761403508773,2193,98,278,55,19,636,219,399,0.031,0.736,0.23199999999999998,0.9982,0,0,1,0,0,0,137.0,1,3,0,6,14,23,0,4,25,0,27,6,2,5,1,65,43,32,0,4,14,0,4,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,13,24,1,0,11,7,3,3,4,4,1,3,4,6,13,22,52,27,15,48,1,0,2,1,15,20,0,14,21,188,26,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07725657521228821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06322430108043155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3024036458990478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0703802147298793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048194278509438436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16727012008617806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2039487918075164,0.1630148998174595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089817831318806,0.0,0.08893192583147129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10443684743538112,0.0,0.06661151002636644,0.0,0.0,0.07733590870272099,0.0,0.0,0.039975141611328924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2167783864799924,0.06724844628868369,0.0,0.08668527461845688,0.0,0.0,0.08261123609113277,0.0,0.044931653797622616,0.3315591349720008,0.0,0.08716399479060889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21246685320919195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15897687426059204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07785823324748968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232888596010941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06639053826020222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135479047941154,0.0,0.10554640735867242,0.08015449144445509,0.07942645623975357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838702294540023,0.07982812268360731,0.0,0.0,0.08402833149177223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05357314246006808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17122868035151534,0.0,0.10962058144221967,0.06903219453432713,0.16520187036492812,0.0,0.0,0.08912833818127983,0.0,0.08043250319468773,0.08524011599830436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519436958414173,0.16257381735978527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08247688449753429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911715580691117,0.0,0.0,0.0608642963877216,0.07819242048253444,0.0,0.11191823417755004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18112606225969946,0.0,0.09050485326258699,0.0,0.08971641870433665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808241365585337,0.0,0.10504798117431076,0.05065849387190613,0.077676107124945,0.0,0.2766033391424255,0.0,0.07493969222924733,0.0,0.0,0.21470636325777706,0.0,0.07723019033115515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523282899060424,0.04663167151426047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108448829153641,0.07328946729708992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Misty_Rose98,2020/04/10,"Struggling with depression during quarantine My life has practically spiraled ever since my country went into quarantine. I’ve struggled with depression for several years now ever since my mother’s death, and I finally moved out of my toxic family’s home last year. After a rough start to 2020, things were finally looking up. I was excited to return to the US where I grew up and finally start building my life properly. I wanted to leave by June and use my remaining months to spend time with my partner until then.

Then the quarantine began. I’m currently with my family again to save on food expenses and my partner has not been very supportive or open to communication. He has his own problems to deal with...but when we are apart he just disappears and rarely talks to me. Not having the person I love for support and only having my family that yells at me and belittles me has been too much to deal with. I feel like everything I had built up, and the respect I thought I had earned by making it on my own means absolutely nothing anymore. I feel exactly like I did before I left this hell of a home...depressed and honestly really willing to just give up on it all. I know it’s cowardly and there are so many out there affected and suffering more, but my mental health is not in a good place, and zero support is not helping. I don’t mind being locked inside, that I can handle. It’s being in a toxic environment that is slowly killing me in life.",5.494900962082628,6.630983956989247,6.546877947557068,74.27891341256368,67.85304659498208,10.318128654970762,31.17166572344841,10.426177893888326,3.4542143369175617,1160,46,206,31,19,388,160,279,0.131,0.8009999999999999,0.069,-0.9387,1,3,0,0,0,0,26.0,2,0,0,1,12,19,2,2,8,0,23,6,0,3,4,46,42,19,2,2,8,1,3,2,2,1,4,1,1,3,9,22,1,0,5,0,2,4,5,8,0,1,10,5,34,11,38,29,5,46,1,3,1,1,15,19,1,1,25,150,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998486472976911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567224341582617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075956901966241,0.2601495817554929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18214372916073293,0.0,0.0,0.09048572596078386,0.0,0.2847396844216437,0.0,0.10181482947637648,0.07192663391456935,0.0,0.33087383680045096,0.0,0.0,0.1217440466246736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09658253356473886,0.0,0.08444657211406166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070193547405848,0.0,0.0,0.06748445280029712,0.0,0.2019828056454096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138877568944612,0.0,0.05533172718317991,0.08206857525510157,0.0,0.1066068009916114,0.10939036442531046,0.0,0.21334222192555047,0.09837544890222066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454680908361922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086866902961724,0.0,0.0672054496488759,0.10207488390572801,0.0,0.10967128840268547,0.0,0.0,0.10146291907585883,0.0,0.10165926086609982,0.0,0.0803627336411828,0.10700812926694736,0.07401223001600546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660627912965576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07657255169424249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791089701731902,0.10519037320693836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633826358182733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644989229911825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137410421256291,0.0,0.1665689759306562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14252527281673355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21050759709777925,0.0,0.0,0.3427553288150652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08092369490305601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06688808256197007,0.0,0.0,0.07992958717036541,0.058707988415233024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211070273068997,0.08695618789031294,0.0,0.08307249320735056,0.05938435102475423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09333243503949172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967071970587982
COVID19_support,Rapture265,2020/04/10,"How to survive quarantine/social distancing: by someone who's been isolated their whole life! Hi, everyone! How are you?

I'd like to help at least some people out with withstanding quarantine. I've been noticing a lot more memes, posts, comments, and videos online which are focusing on the fact that a lot of people feel like they're being driven insane from the social distancing and quarantining. 

I mean, anyone would! Being isolated in any way is difficult for any reason. Even without COVID-19 coming into the picture, it's damn hard to go for prolonged periods of time without the social contact which so many people crave. 

Luckily though, I have been isolated (relatively speaking) my whole life; and especially within the past 2 years after having met my fiance, I have largely spent my life in self-isolation. I do my work and school at home, and I've only actually stepped outside maybe a third of the length of time between the start of our relationship and now... most of that was within the first year. 

So in all honesty, when I started hearing about COVID-19, the idea that we'd be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future was not any change of pace for me, personally. It's something I've spent my whole life having to adapt to, but which now I fully embrace.

Unfortunately, a lot of the world doesn't have the luxury of experience, or the knowledge of how to survive while socially isolated. So, here are my tips and guidelines on surviving your social isolation/quarantine experience!

Here's what not to do. 

1. **DON'T be unhealthy!** Again, this is something I've had trouble with. Rewarding yourself for 10 minutes on a treadmill - even an imaginary treadmill - by ordering Chipotle from Postmates is NOT the same as being healthy. Don't order as much fast food if you can help it. Home-cooked meals are always tastier, healthier, and more fun to make, too.
2. **DON'T be lazy!** Don't use excuses to justify your laziness. If you're telling yourself you can't learn, or you can't be active, or you can't wash your clothes and do the dishes despite being stuck inside all day because you're browsing reddit while having The Clone Wars Season 7 streaming in the background, then you're being a lazy dumbass. Turn off the TV, put down the phone, shut down your computer. Look around you. Look at yourself. What needs to be done? Do it.
3. **DON'T be selfish!** We're all in this thing together. Don't take more than you need in this time: food or water; time alone; breaks; entertainment; etc. Instead, use the time you have to use what you've got to put yourself at a point where you're at the very least stable, and then help others do the same. If and when you have excess, give it to someone who doesn't. If you've got extra cash, food, or clothes, give it to charity. Lots of people need that stuff during the pandemic, and lots more will need it after. If you've got excess time, comfort someone who needs it. Or teach someone who wants to learn a skill which you have. Just don't be selfish by keeping more than what you need. 

Here's what to do!

1. **Stay active!** I myself need a lot of help with this, but staying active indoors is a big thing. A little bit of space goes a long way. So instead of using that part of the house where you usually pace as a spot of worrying and stress, turn it into a space where you don't have to do anything different, physically; but where your mental attitude affects whether or not this pacing is healthy. Because, yes, exercising while stressed does help relieve the stress, but if you're just pacing while focusing on your stress, then it doesn't help a whole lot. So if you can, maybe try doing some short-distant sprinting instead of pacing. Maybe combine it with squats, or lunges. Jumping jacks help. So do push-ups and crunches. A lot of Americans might be reading this and thinking, ""Wait, like PE we used to do in school?"" Yes, like PE. You were taught those basic exercises as a kid for a reason.
2. **Stay smart!** So, we're pretty much stuck indoors for who-knows-how-long. School may or may not be in session for a lot of us. If you're in high school or equivalent, I'm sure you might be attending your classes online. If you're a college/university student, I can see that ""might"" turning into a big ""maybe sometimes"" for a lot of you, haha. A lot of people aren't even in school, and haven't been for a while. And yeah, most of us don't like school, or are workers now. But that doesn't mean we have to distance ourselves from learning. So, take the time to learn, whether it be a formal class or not. 

* How do you do this? There's a few different ways. Practically speaking, you're gonna want to start teaching yourself any basic skills you've been lacking in life. Not just cooking and cleaning, but also things like plumbing, repair, and basic machinery. 
* More abstractly, you can teach yourself any other field you might find interesting. In my experience, school always sucked because it spent so many years forcing me into classes which were not taught effectively, until I was eventually told ""Now pick ONE of those subjects to focus on FOREVER or else YOU WILL BE POOR!"" Not fun. And I'm sure for a lot of you, it's the same way. But now, you have the freedom of the Internet to teach yourself the subjects YOU want to learn, at YOUR pace, with YOUR own way of practicing these skills at home. And you also have people online who have the time now to critique and help you succeed, just as you do too. So learn and teach, everyone!

1. **Look forward, backward, inside, and out!** This is a period where I think a lot of us feel like time is sort of wonky. So we might feel anxious about the present moment, and about the past, and the future, all at the same time; and at a much more intense level than we otherwise would be! But why? In my experience, it's because I never quite dedicated any time to think about my own life, and eventually had enough time on my hands that thinking about it was something I knew at some point I'd have to face. And that the refusal to face it, was what was causing my anxieties. So what I recommend you do is take some of the excess time you have each day to just sit down and... think. 

* Look **forward**; plan out the goals and future you would like to accomplish. Not only once the threat of COVID-19 ends, but also while in isolation. Also plan out the steps you'll take to get there, and each part of those steps. Once you have a plan, start taking action. And remember that even if one step can't be done the way you planned, you can always change it to be more flexible while still working toward your goal. 
* Look **backward**; reflect on your life choices. Ask yourself uncomfortable questions. We all know that the AITA subreddit is a place of external validation. But so is asking your family and friends if you've ever been the asshole of a given situation. Of course they'll usually say no. But if you ask yourself that. With the benefit of hindsight, put yourself in a ""fly on the wall"" mindset of past events where you might have been the asshole. Even if it was just to yourself. As painful as it is to admit, yes, we've all been assholes. So admit that you've been an asshole. BUT don't use it to pity or self-loathe. Examine why and how you were the asshole, and then going forward, avoid the mindset or circumstances that made you an asshole in the past.
* Look **inside**; Ask yourself who YOU are. What are your values? What are your morals? Can you make a list of values you hold dear? Or how you learned them and practice them? Do you use those values in a hypocritical way, by using them only when they benefit yourself? Or do you actively try and advance those same values for other people too? Yes, ***even and especially*** if it's going out of your way. Can you sum up your values into a single word? Can you sum up your moral code (how you live by those values for yourself and so that others can too) in three sentences? Don't stop thinking about this each day until you can. Also ask yourself if anything you're doing in your daily life causes you anxieties. Take this time to grow.
* Look **out**; Look around you. Take time to appreciate the life you do have. You have a roof over your head, food in the pantry, and clothes to wear. That's more than a lot of people could ever afford. Never mind anything else you've got. Appreciate how you got to where you are right now. It might not seem like heaven, but at least it isn't hell. So look around you at the world you know, and the things you have, and ask yourself questions like: Do I appreciate everything I have? Is this thing I have actually worth keeping, or would it be better elsewhere? Who helped me get the things I have? Who taught me important lessons which I can remind myself of with the stuff I have? And, don't be afraid to ""look out"" in the more common way. Look out for any potential dangers to your mental and physical health you're being exposed to, and try your best to fix the situations.

\---

Some people might be reading this and thinking, ""Whoa, look at this guy! He's using COVID-19 as a soapbox to tell us how to live our lives! You think you're so moral, buddy? Well FUCK YOU!"" If you're one of those people, I can't stop you from thinking that. And I wouldn't want to force you to change your mindset. Take it or leave it, it's your call.

Other people might read this and just ""get it"". Congratulations! 

And some other people - I think maybe the majority of people - who read this are sort of in the middle. You might be confused as to how or why this weird post which talks about morality so much helps anyone with dealing with COVID-19. But a part of you thinks it does.

Well, if you're in that group, then I'll explain it to you. Does this post help with COVID-19? No. I never said it does! It's supposed to help you deal with the isolation we're all going through so you don't go insane.  And once COVID-19 is over and done with, then if you've taken this post to heart, you can keep using the skills you've learned and practiced to help others in their own situations - whether because of social isolation or not. 

If you'd asked me a few years ago to read this post and answer the question, ""how can this help you, right now?"" Then I, as someone who was maybe between 19-21, wouldn't have been able to answer. But by learning to use my isolation to learn about myself, I learned to enjoy it. And from there, I learned to help other people. And from there, I learned how to enjoy life as much as I can, whether I'm by myself or with others.

And I hope that everyone who reads this, and who normally spends their time with others, and not enough time with themselves, uses this post to guide them. We're in a spot in life where a lot of us are just spending so much time by ourselves, indoors. Lots of people are feeling cooped-up because now they have to spend more time alone than otherwise.

Don't run away from the alone time. Embrace it. Learn about yourself. And then, when you CAN spend time with others, use this time you'd spent learning how to be a better person to make the enjoyment of life more fun for everyone involved.

COVID19_support,dumpslikeatruck1,2020/04/10,"Covid Symptoms and Issues....not sure what to do 37 Female 5'1, 230 lbs. Do not smoke, do not drink. Caucasian. No medications.

For the last week or so, I have had a sore throat on and off, and than over the last few days have developed some upper chest pain (similar to what you would feel with a chest cold) However, things seemed to be improving over the last couple of days. But, now, things seem to be getting worse again.

In the meantime, yesterday I had a Dr appointment, which was a follow up for a previous issue I had been having. That issue had cleared up and all was well. I told my Dr about the throat, but he did not visually see any issues. My oxygen saturation was 98%. My respiration rate was 18. My blood pressure was also well within normal as well. I've not had fever the whole time.

Is there any medication I should try to take? Claritin? Zyrtec? Should I be concerned in regards to Covid?

I would like to add that I woke up this morning, feeling like my throat is very closed. I woke up like a shot choking on something. I swallowed it back down, but it didn't really have a taste. As far as the trouble swallowing, throat feeling swollen, I would think that would be something the Dr would have been able to see yesterday.",2.7647663043478232,5.0546479875000045,3.377065217391305,89.43619565217394,77.45833333333334,6.6739130434782625,23.768115942028984,7.7425588080867325,1.1379039855072466,967,32,196,15,23,303,136,240,0.067,0.821,0.111,0.7797,2,0,4,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,0,0,10,10,0,1,15,0,35,21,7,0,3,33,49,13,0,8,8,0,3,3,0,7,10,0,0,0,11,7,4,0,6,1,0,1,6,3,3,0,17,7,17,7,30,21,4,29,0,0,2,0,3,16,0,4,15,134,28,0,0.11651755782935437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09317904889950053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584718697625393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0895948097711545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892446153881126,0.0,0.15028837108575366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11414284797521625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17674433459823635,0.08324016659459968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060875614880987014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3648421744858443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849320830666178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17077377967872615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2347583624885598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11416246765279466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12398289662908067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464413114806931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18569881602185748,0.2121464171088359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.179401817099739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981641932551048,0.12110635636077866,0.08760670269868574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15481817603934678,0.07465974628427115,0.0,0.0,0.06794232497967556,0.0,0.0,0.11133751975619184,0.0,0.07910777335276227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613918791503358,0.0,0.0,0.0934633566599641,0.0,0.3142898330542289,0.0,0.0,0.13008769223459607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11874134580156433,0.4138536501496086,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,throwaway_thoughtsac,2020/04/10,"I’m trying to be optimistic but find myself getting overwhelmed by the anxiety of this pandemic. I have people telling me, “it’s going to be fine”, “you’re going to be okay,” and I appreciate it, but I just find it hard to believe. I’ve always had this extreme fear that me or people I care about the most might contract some terrifying illness or disease and it’s been something that has caused a lot of panic and anxiety attacks over. People tell me because if my age, I’ll be fine. But I’m very overweight and I know people who are obese are at a much higher risk. Most of my family is overweight and this is what really scares me. I also keep hearing about young healthy people contracting it and getting severe cases. 

I look to my mom for some reassurance as she was a nurse for a few years. But she keeps saying it’s just like a flu. I asked her what her plan was and she said to just treat it like a flu. That just feels like she’s ill informed. It worries me because we have a two year old and a asthmatic living with us. 

I’m sorry for rambling. I’m just so overwhelmed and scared lately. I’ve been trying to take losing weight and being healthier seriously but my motivation is driven by fear and anxiety rather than the motivation to be healthy.",3.87590736842105,5.328850296000002,5.1175789473684254,81.8077368421053,72.04,7.823157894736843,27.55789473684211,8.371475516178862,1.91972,994,36,192,16,19,330,133,250,0.247,0.594,0.159,-0.9832,0,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,2,0,0,5,10,20,1,8,11,1,20,8,0,3,0,43,39,22,0,2,14,1,3,3,0,1,7,3,0,0,17,13,4,2,7,0,0,3,0,11,0,1,7,7,26,9,23,25,7,11,0,3,1,0,18,2,0,9,9,132,43,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066020124749208,0.09433110435926106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601782061012153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1059836041386242,0.12897225665501802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13821593640346966,0.0,0.0,0.12772670649001228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558604366335185,0.11645997531423816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10687308715397402,0.2551406215570614,0.05732217393387337,0.08098999017988072,0.0,0.0,0.20723225941641976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11846000922648806,0.0,0.1288590844363132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10155529514862728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277737676029041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20153304704098696,0.0,0.0,0.06230398667792865,0.0,0.12788383405119402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661573649476388,0.0,0.10010585824768066,0.0,0.09520041276442333,0.12682958739132805,0.0,0.09638126282697528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12026533707822346,0.0,0.1327750155665117,0.0,0.0,0.08333838879916178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11896045204590072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13301270525010556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3929748452962613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07262632567893093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10783875368840856,0.09015463728649538,0.22700192135923314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280733628622951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872760831674216,0.0,0.12690598810358766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523848859906781,0.0,0.1981769356011245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15393861038735854,0.0,0.11074388293984212,0.0,0.13636752366237964,0.0,0.0,0.09354032078121076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380514580413222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11513051983648005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14601031278720794

COVID19_support,macronancer,2020/04/10,"An American COVID Story - My experience contracting COVID-19 in the USA, greatest country north of Mexico and south of Canada I have been following the developments of this pandemic since January.

I contracted the virus by the end of February, and am still recovering.

It has been a challenging and frustrating ordeal, partly due to personal challenges in dealing with the disease, and partly due to the response that I have seen in the people around me and around the country.

I wrote a Medium article describing my experience and what I've learned, in hopes that it can help others understand the situation or at least gain a better perspective on it.

While letting my dogs out, I started coughing, ended up gagging and throwing up. I decided to take my temperature as a precaution, only to realize I was running a low grade fever. I notified my job, and they advised me to take the day off.

As the day went on, I couldn’t shake the fever, and finally gave in and called a tale-health company my health insurance offers. After going over my symptoms they advised that I have mild Covid symptoms and would need to quarantine for 14 days. They told me to put a call in to my primary doctor to keep them in the loop. Upon doing such, I was told that because I was young and healthy I probably wouldn’t be tested. After going over my symptoms I was instructed that I needed to video chat with another doctor in their office that handles all possible Covid cases. I had my video chat, went over my symptoms again, but was told that unless my fever spikes or I start experiencing respiratory distress, I don’t qualify for testing.

My fever is staying the same (99.1), as well as most of my other symptoms. My chest has started hurting, but I think that’s from coughing. The only new symptoms I have are loss of taste/smells. I haven’t experienced a complete loss, everything just seems muted. Some things I can’t taste/smell at all, while others are faintly experienced. All of this started this morning, 15 hours ago, and I’m just scared. 

I’m a private person, so I haven’t told many people about this. The few people I have told, with the exception of my job, have been told not to say anything. I’m typically the person who comforts people and solves problems, I’m the strong one. I am so scared, but I also don’t want to worry those close to me. I just want to talk to someone, to get advice, or even just get things off my chest, and right now, anonymity feels like the best option for me. Thank you for listening!",5.166915113871634,6.172009159420288,5.7672498274672215,80.0492391304348,68.51690821256038,8.522981366459629,30.486197377501725,8.738905477910976,2.399538578329884,1688,65,316,27,28,547,211,414,0.09699999999999999,0.816,0.08800000000000001,-0.6882,3,1,0,0,0,0,59.0,0,1,5,4,15,17,0,5,18,0,28,20,3,1,4,54,64,27,0,9,14,0,1,2,0,2,17,2,0,2,18,16,0,1,5,4,0,9,8,10,1,1,17,6,52,7,54,41,9,58,0,4,0,0,27,21,0,6,28,214,70,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06995756896877363,0.06346080470773194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05725102868180579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048684106932771885,0.0750690540249142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05891301711395299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08728200942016529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512998579153704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620414591451175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06166901855352722,0.07506144985047597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1846802246898332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465521577180137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06340807967386784,0.0,0.0,0.04728495883532168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06434107322415482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03619839112239371,0.05114438515385256,0.0,0.07842407383591582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07480633500204427,0.0,0.08137324909345134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15219505765472935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050238387129247,0.0,0.07663928721623643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14208537615371492,0.0636330721623808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05835594679517792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07320630505404897,0.0,0.06995116515968604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14516339477835266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616714148049143,0.0,0.06914271006027461,0.0,0.06718298912014033,0.07014365125174514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04851168717000058,0.10889585298027836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14889585835707692,0.12502041404063816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08070771773477876,0.0,0.0,0.077186844970435,0.06850259757094382,0.0,0.07196839148043686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06113803647432806,0.0,0.05693176999460636,0.215024233319612,0.0,0.0,0.06517345236985674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060658537865211824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25336120468792056,0.07630612311078505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5208707852691945,0.10765454054656648,0.05754186446581931,0.0,0.06591106553074128,0.0,0.0,0.09512331303631724,0.045872407224367605,0.0,0.0,0.04174509229339028,0.0,0.06785957924254925,0.410447688329454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05906979594421045,0.08445205776010611,0.056825337354021864,0.0,0.0,0.06436860524298993,0.13273052679418634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07270379507890032,0.0,0.050855954154115146,0.0,0.0,0.0

We simply do not have the necessary social programs to keep the millions of people and small business afloat until the virus has been contained. I have no confidence in our current leadership to approve things like UBI and bailouts for small businesses. People keep saying things like ""this will be worse than the great depression"" with out us even getting that far into this yet. I know some of it is just trying to grab attention, but to what end can we successfully pull us out of our current situation in a reasonable amount of time? I (thankfully) have a job I can work from home, but I know that I am just as susceptible to being laid off as anyone else if this goes on for too long.

Is there are pattern how symptoms of coronavirus develop?

I read a post below that someone developed similar symptoms and died, but I don't usually care about anecdotal evidence.

It makes me worry more for how bad this will effect this generation’s education for the years out then anything.",7.643771008403362,6.844238272058827,6.997436974789918,79.49882352941178,63.33823529411765,9.242016806722688,31.92857142857143,7.957251820313856,2.0612512605042017,559,17,110,5,7,173,89,136,0.147,0.845,0.008,-0.9575,2,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,1,1,4,2,0,1,16,0,14,2,2,5,0,14,19,6,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,3,8,6,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,2,0,0,9,3,8,0,21,6,9,12,0,0,1,0,8,6,0,0,4,82,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18079636341424832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16893759172266032,0.1834423352146832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475293807362578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256948946878813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12486194253844607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254780566107452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321276584624811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466530645646442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30462797569658345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17471617448910853,0.2199604396140344,0.4447011361570357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2036663349971498,0.0,0.2452898945263098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22311846176974584,0.22389552529729548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2829622973810183
COVID19_support,ImpressiveGanache4,2020/04/10,"Concerned about elderly mom, shelter in place vs being a shut in. Not sure if I'm just venting, looking for advice, or a slap.  My mom is 84.  But in great shape.  I'm in CA.  My mom hasn't left the house since sometime in february.  She's not very active in the house either pretty much just watches corona virus coverage and eats.  Most of her exercise pre-corona was shopping, man she can walk all day at the outlets, which isn't a good option now.  

She has the luxury of a backyard but won't go outside because of allergies, back of house is on a hillside.  Her large single pane bedroom window faces the backyard. Air can't be that much different lol.  I offered to drive her to a local college parking lot.  So much empty room,you can see people coming a mile away and not even get within 150 feet of someone.   But no dice.  She was already kind of a borderline hypochondriac so now well....you get the idea.

I'm concerned that she's going to come out of this in poor health when there's no need.  No sun, no walking more than a few lengths of the house a day, no fresh air  for 2-3 months can't be good.  I've tried googling for some info either way.  But nothing good found.  It's adding to my stress as her caregiver.  Actually role as caregiver is the source of most of my stress now a days.  My mind says she can make her own choices but I can't stop my worrying.",2.1338267148014443,4.029376722021663,3.427950902527076,90.22056895306862,77.80866425992781,6.309256317689531,24.43740072202166,7.24861992348623,0.9856265415162452,1060,37,223,13,25,345,163,277,0.139,0.7979999999999999,0.062,-0.9675,1,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,0,0,12,8,0,2,19,1,18,5,2,1,2,34,32,14,0,2,15,3,0,0,0,1,2,1,4,1,5,5,1,1,3,2,2,7,14,2,0,0,3,4,19,6,33,25,14,38,0,0,3,0,18,20,0,7,10,136,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.10270840708045796,0.0,0.0,0.1028486708972643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11614552808756975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888544447024336,0.08093042990586477,0.0,0.06415916672371376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18132638647292307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20363181493809185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10996340926378848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10769659533390608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06951635457509156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11540073134713046,0.0,0.0,0.10997712246247353,0.0,0.11963152292483385,0.2648350610573767,0.0,0.11603803287521725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118753812322177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4857755342908336,0.0,0.11881396414337796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10960124072524112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143539759969399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838313892963899,0.0,0.0,0.0894794286630865,0.0,0.0,0.07025491153984056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10627207193267962,0.3698011061014669,0.08400921015421704,0.0,0.232111653138583,0.07804122952803183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10098981005122452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07296680621253028,0.0,0.10996340926378848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10707666017788756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369868996430711,0.0,0.0,0.08387028808948696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706353971612643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917762709554858,0.0,0.10409452527206456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799336116008423,0.2411260752509027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919648302660558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145755566296202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08684192564990954,0.0,0.08354221717965263,0.0,0.0,0.09463201186575257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688605683810466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,rjasan,2020/04/11,"We lost my brother this morning due to Covid-19 Hello to all going through this same trauma. I have no real point to this post except to vent.

My 51 year old brother was admitted to the hospital Wednesday with the usual Covid symptoms. He seemed OK when he was there and it looked as though he just needed a little help beating this thing. He did not have any pre existing conditions.

His 02 levels were OK at the beginning, then this morning they went down to 52 percent, The doctors were able to get it back up to 65, but then he coded (heart stopped). They intubated him and apparently got his heart started again briefly, but it did not last and he passed away.

This post really wont accomplish anything for me personally, but I will pass on a little bit of advice. If you are a Black person as I am, Please take some Vitamin D supplements. Its been proven to help the immune system fight against respiratory diseases. Black people DO NOT generate enough vitamin D in many cases. Its strictly due to the melanin in the skin, etc.

Encourage people to stay home, the social distancing needs to happen. I don't want any of you to feel the pain our family is going through now.

Don't wait to go to the hospital if you are sick, please. I think my brother waited too long to go in.

Love your families, Love your friends, and look out for each other.

COVID19_support,Kennyv777,2020/04/11,"My psychologist died and I’m stuck in a bad pattern with a potential news development I’ve been treated for anxiety and panic driven by hypochondriasis for about six years. A month or so ago I found myself obsessively reading about COVID19 like I used to look up symptoms if diseases. A relapse. My psychologist intervened and told me to call him if I get like this again. 

I was ok for a while. We had a scare where my wife’s boss was exposed and an agonizing six day wait for the negative test. He talked with me twice a week instead of once. 

He died over the weekend. I knew something was wrong when he was 15 minutes late to our meeting. I found out online. 

Last night I read a rather frightening story that I think I probably didn’t understand. I went into full anxious research mode and barely slept. Woke up feeling beat up. 

I’m just weak and miserable and exhausted today. My mother in law has had a minor cough for years. It’s a little more frequent than average today and I flinch every time I hear (or think I hear) her coughing.",2.639226779820841,5.166641772277226,3.9337057991513436,83.9924587458746,79.29702970297029,7.015935879302218,26.45073078736445,8.11559375814309,1.9237008015087227,826,34,156,16,21,270,136,202,0.23,0.7290000000000001,0.042,-0.9892,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,2,0,0,2,9,12,0,4,13,1,9,6,1,2,0,31,30,15,2,3,6,2,1,2,0,0,5,2,0,0,3,13,0,1,7,3,0,2,2,8,0,3,17,4,24,4,23,13,2,30,0,1,1,0,15,11,0,4,19,98,27,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253217446224447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815264204453724,0.1597152133914405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11804347930395233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14436122202850588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117615220129373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934529907195544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11911580593728545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07148421059071887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3100240887794103,0.0,0.0,0.07386339059552631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31868320004165546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11524072370571788,0.15947885952493526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813884170801485,0.1416964024670167,0.0,0.0,0.11872066056367632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284538028097495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13267227612795926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15056136753153546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658748714643745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15242778779983734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2828295339991859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14154254834839905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10883854328117744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14694432443870142,0.0,0.11363308229222832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811767162381589,0.0,0.0,0.0824377790311133,0.0,0.26801679868976386,0.13509131243711206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717793126778536,0.0,0.12210391117454085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340370742604285,0.0,0.0,0.13105743977807546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15457301839800594,0.0,0.1820836725372294

I want to see more headlines about the recoveries, or the countries and people working together instead.

I live in a country where the lockdown is one of the strictest in the world. Alcohol sales are banned. Cigarettes are banned. Takeaway s are banned. Exercise outside is banned. Police and army are patrolling/set up road blocks and fear of them abusing their power is very real. The economy is taking a major hit and the lockdown has just been extended for another 2 weeks.

All this is causing me to have anxiety attacks over what is going to happen, not only with the virus, but afterwards and I just wish I could see more positive things in the news or on Facebook (which I can't even avoid as I have to use it for work)...

COVID19_support,CirclingLife,2020/04/11,"Concerned I won't get to spend time with my parents before they move across the world. Hi all. Thanks in advance for your support and well wishes. So my parents' retirement plan is to move to Japan from the US in September this year. In addition to my multitude of other concerns regarding the COVID-19 situation, I'm concerned that the rest of the family and I won't get to spend any time with my parents before they move to Japan, at which point we will only be able to see them like once a year at most on average. Obviously, once things open back up, it's not like the virus will be magically gone. The chance of there being a vaccine or common test kits before my parents move is practically nil, so I don't think I would be comfortable being around them at all before they move. What to do?

People can talk about timelines for reopening the economy until they are blue in the face, but it doesn't feel real until they start planning how!

COVID19_support,chicharito101,2020/04/11,"What should I do with my clothes when I get home from work? I had my method but my dad almost forcefully wants me to adopt his. Any help? Hello all, first time posting here and I believe this is the proper subreddit to ask questions, so apologies if it’s not. Also, I’m on mobile so forgive me for any format/gramatical/spelling errors. Might be a long one. 

So I work at a drive thru in a Mexican restaurant, and I arrive home at around 11-12 depending on how long we take to close. Normally, my routine would be to remove my shoes at the door and put on my sandals, walk to my bedroom while making sure I don’t touch anything I don’t absolutely need to, removing my clothes and placing them in the dirty laundry bin so they can get washed when laundry day comes. I’ll wash my hands, clean my watch and phone, and take a shower, putting on fresh clean clothes after. To me it seemed logical, safe, and simple. 

Today, walking in, my dad didn’t like that procedure that I’ve been doing for the past couple of weeks. He told me to take my clothes off at the door so I can leave them outside and have them ‘cleaned’ by the wind, which should basically carry away the virus. Only then could i enter the house, out on a pair of shorts do I’m not in my boxers, and head to my room to take a shower. He tells me it’s so I don’t shake off the virus and contaminate my entire bedroom and the house, and it’s much safer having the wind blow off the virus than leaving it sitting in the dirty laundry. I honestly find this somewhat bullshit, even though my dad’s been doing it for around two weeks as well. 

So I ask, what do you guys think? Is my method of leaving my clothes in the dirty laundry sufficient and safe enough or must I leave them in the wind for cleansing? Or perhaps there’s another, much safer and simpler alternative? 

Any and every comment will be appreciated, and trusty/credible sources and links are more than welcome! Thank you in advance and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy!",4.308558770343581,5.427759739240507,4.699127486437615,86.49852848101267,70.59493670886077,7.566907775768536,28.790687160940326,7.83500028581142,1.661537070524412,1567,58,321,19,28,495,207,395,0.059000000000000004,0.7709999999999999,0.17,0.9940000000000001,2,0,2,0,0,0,46.0,1,2,5,4,18,12,0,1,21,0,29,5,3,3,3,59,48,38,0,10,6,3,2,1,0,6,2,0,12,1,13,26,0,3,7,0,0,11,6,1,1,3,5,3,47,11,49,33,6,56,0,0,1,0,27,28,0,10,15,211,60,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10106486529463776,0.0,0.0,0.08071212691459717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2059036094873064,0.10583186285599712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08305518736878753,0.1796947289722684,0.1887082091236742,0.0,0.09482522743081524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137113529724329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869405802270371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058283712584999,0.11167497012488196,0.0,0.06509024412743522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10428565773622216,0.0,0.06666202663151187,0.0,0.0850362370061071,0.09644107909504963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09224641128446363,0.08584934967895831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546148329068644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09993463960655116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10358129934531453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06764994594659256,0.0,0.2024781311406426,0.10024432891897073,0.0,0.2329148428579679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4274729378610244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04930834825319725,0.0,0.0,0.17863630042931924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737025859151495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706871390220857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14838746265858438,0.07483687188363669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888806214382112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06839146023852409,0.07676033172318115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963472461133028,0.0,0.0,0.10544833315326146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666117495850833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20292113803902465,0.11306251698225875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09188110816967793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757587478661006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09512349480479336,0.0,0.303541338543266,0.0,0.08821556624454542,0.09292099039408433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06467062058131846,0.0991612988892469,0.0,0.05885195890491402,0.0,0.09566799231917388,0.09644107909504963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859204162204624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059529980168712485,0.0,0.1619167912464863,0.0,0.0907464399384472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14695364816072076,0.0,0.0,0.07169639254629387,0.0,0.0,0.0

She went for a walk yesterday and told us how many streets she had to cross so I asked her how she pushed the buttons and she goes ""with my hands????""

I'm. Blown away. I have been trying my best to protect my mom and myself. I have been disinfecting everything that comes into our home. We haven't personally left the house since March 13th. We've been relying on grocery delivery and I disinfect every single thing. My home is my safe place. I could lick the floors they're so clean and germ free. 

And she comes in here and doesn't wash her hands after pushing crosswalk buttons, of all things. She cooked us dinner that night, we touched her phone, etc. I'm just.....so upset. It seems so silly but when you try so hard and someone does that, it feels like your efforts were all for nothing.

Is there any reassurance anyone can give me to calm down?",2.099200845665962,4.444931074418606,2.7655496828752644,92.64126321353069,80.11627906976744,5.7695560253699805,20.935517970401694,6.980632752743323,0.3995581395348835,851,24,178,10,22,265,136,215,0.028999999999999998,0.861,0.11,0.9382,0,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,5,2,0,2,13,9,0,2,8,0,16,5,2,2,2,30,29,19,0,3,1,4,6,1,0,2,1,0,5,1,8,18,2,2,3,1,1,11,2,2,0,0,10,7,34,8,20,16,5,30,0,0,0,0,29,12,0,1,8,113,42,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08664445740156547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08908935911008216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191129220181292,0.0,0.1197076690279614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337109225909019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14572526439459188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21950813058709284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10172803015983696,0.0,0.0,0.08217013143091216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149900749252943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420979421832818,0.0,0.0,0.1073500163481004,0.0,0.11450959521224355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442328215942225,0.09102308289051182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12222509910418768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413603122747665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5112180748665953,0.0,0.0,0.14701621960719172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843339617887282,0.0,0.0,0.062247015830420666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291756629376819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2984465418715869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195674318719275,0.0,0.1222551490927118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14949040577213474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11125115177349933,0.13311831151547296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11599100349875707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10539643577045438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795568474453582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16929360244098254,0.0,0.0,0.10115081218806847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12174752531369065,0.0,0.17300862566124314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065216425468369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181121026887392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18101950845712325,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,StretchyYeti22,2020/04/11,"What to do about my essential job that has had a positive case but won't close? I work at a call center in Florida where I caption calls for the deaf or hard of hearing. My work doesn't have any way to work from home at this time, and they have stated that they won't be closing during the pandemic.

Things that they've changed since the outbreak started:

* Put signs around telling people to wash their hands after entering the building.
* Requiring employees to ""clean"" the timeclock after punching in/out with the same set of rags that all employees use all day to clean their cubicles.
* Encouraging employees to work in cubicles with one empty cube in between. This is not possible because of the high number of employees at my location. Even without the pandemic, there's often a line of people waiting for a cubicle to open up so we can work. We share computers and don't have our own assigned cubicles. The desks are probably 2 feet apart from each other.
* Started an emergency paid sick leave policy with up to 2 weeks of paid leave.

A couple of days ago, my work sent out an email letting us know that someone had tested positive and will be staying home for 2 weeks. They also identified 2 employees who likely came into contact with that person and made them stay home for 2 weeks. They also stated that they've deep cleaned the call center since then.

I actually got sick about a week ago but have no way of knowing if it was COVID19 because I'm ineligible for a test (due to the test shortages, my age of 24, and my low risk of being severely ill). Although since I've had my flu shot and I rarely get sick because I have a good immune system, it very well could be. I've been using paid sick leave days, but that's coming to an end and I'll need to go back. I have to keep going because I live alone and pay my own rent and bills. I get more and more anxious as that day comes because I don't know if I actually got the virus or not, and I'm worried about my coworkers who aren't as lucky as me in terms of age and/or immune system.

I could use any advice y'all have for me, and if there's any info you need that I left out, please let me know.",5.172919996562687,5.592257587006959,5.77569476669245,82.08549282461121,68.25754060324826,9.169407923004213,29.88407665205809,9.150863307647796,2.336513207871444,1704,60,344,30,27,553,216,431,0.126,0.7909999999999999,0.083,-0.9461,7,1,0,0,0,0,41.0,4,2,7,7,14,8,0,1,23,0,32,12,2,4,2,62,62,28,0,7,11,0,2,1,0,3,10,2,7,1,19,29,0,3,5,0,6,8,10,2,1,1,13,4,37,6,58,38,9,63,0,1,0,0,26,24,0,7,23,213,56,15,0.0,0.0,0.15162479402793844,0.0,0.0,0.07591593027350158,0.13773165924170144,0.0,0.0,0.08046146125936263,0.0,0.12425432059922532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584917538652199,0.0,0.0,0.08776546086562292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0691588963060551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05973736772811871,0.0,0.2367897798246109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23798476513450306,0.08885451121752674,0.0,0.0,0.0821837283002078,0.13384287022994076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240552821712305,0.08596042547291881,0.0,0.20040963782926827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880861393920974,0.0,0.0,0.05131226957772031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08117767091887196,0.0,0.0883038961383026,0.06516110791324163,0.12426857062448912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06959329467788686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875601557543495,0.0,0.0,0.08208176257303887,0.2337825514841993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07709347014176812,0.06905276927967956,0.0,0.0,0.17078143283965766,0.0,0.0,0.24678150065050944,0.08440836806683788,0.15888272940257642,0.0,0.03795449052255719,0.0,0.06860003195124167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07351037614849712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520951097611094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05264347968254229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771831904845536,0.06783426850717053,0.0,0.08527822481312704,0.0,0.08758168075882923,0.0,0.0,0.08376093147866058,0.0,0.0,0.07809801669871673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08776546086562292,0.0,0.1927932432998363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582489070086825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997610027120257,0.16561039518412346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06790283981482816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051612533899461736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045300566650914885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934492410744372,0.20129277249495225,0.0,0.06410083392366428,0.0,0.1233304247682394,0.2492668903549877,0.0,0.06985094850294987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07488857393077128,0.0,0.33934725319112385,0.07889605541170798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

All state employees are currently on paid leave. This leaves me, a fucked up 17 year old in a situation where I have way too much time with my own thoughts and no access to free therapy. This would be bad enough on it's own, but the pandemic has only served to amplify my ongoing problems as I can no longer meet with my friend.

COVID19_support,TheRottenKittensIEat,2020/04/11,"Husband being Forced Back to Work as an ""Essential Employee"" (which he absolutely isn't, and even so, could do his work from home) When there are 3 Confirmed Cases at his Plant. I'm hoping this belongs here, since it was removed from r/casualconversation. 

So.. my husband's plant has weaseled their way into getting deemed ""essential"" two days after our state issued a lock down on anyone but essential employees. They are absolutely not essential, but they said they provide resources to ambulances, and therefore are essential, despite the fact that almost everyone in their industry has a surplus they could send to ambulances (which can't be that many ambulances, considering how many plants make the same resource and have surpluses.. it's not a disposable product). The company has such a huge surplus that they were trying to decide what to do with the product prior to all this. Shouldn't an emergency situation for that resource have to be proven before they're allowed to be essential??

My state is currently nearing its peak for the virus, but the company doesn't care. They are open to their employees about the fact that the reason they are calling all employees back is because they just got a large order from a (non-essential) client and it would be too much money to lose out on.

Worst part is, he's in program engineering and could easily do his job from home. Why... WHY do they think it's okay to bring in staff who could do their jobs remotely? This is not the first time his company has made it clear they don't care about employees, but this really takes the cake. They KNOW the virus is active within the company, and yet they're bringing everyone back. At least my husband isn't immuno compromised, but he has a coworker who is going through chemo, and they told him he has to come in as well.

Plants in the U.S. are really fucked up, and capitalism is going to have to change after this (except I know they won't). I'm just so pissed about this, because my husband might get it and bring it home. I work for a non-profit, and they're doing everything to make sure we're safe and quarantined until the state mandate is over. God I hate his company so much and it's a fortune 500 company. He has had people join the team with lots of experience leave because ""get out of here, no other company works this way.""

They have dicked my husband over many times, but the only redeeming factor is it pays really well, and it's hard to find another place that pays as well. Still, at his old team 4 out of 7 people left within a year upon receiving a boss that even HR told the team was ""untrainable,"" and yet they did nothing about it other than sending the boss to a 2 week training, which did nothing, all because his wife is a ""big wig"" in the company. I would love to name the company, but I'm ""not supposed to"" lest I somehow get doxxed and my husband is afraid of that.

Am I in the right to be pissed? Because I'm pretty pissed that the health and well being is being shut down because they got a ""large order"" from a client that is not essential in the least.",8.244818789584802,7.129341355442178,7.990715458597237,73.88663265306124,62.31632653061224,11.715787004456955,35.58198451794511,10.852061532183503,3.6918588318085854,2439,90,459,53,29,781,252,588,0.095,0.82,0.085,-0.9326,9,1,0,0,0,0,82.0,1,0,20,9,30,19,5,1,40,1,65,7,4,9,7,75,97,33,0,8,15,7,1,0,0,5,1,1,3,0,37,24,0,1,6,3,3,10,13,8,4,2,12,2,41,11,73,68,11,69,0,1,0,3,55,33,5,5,19,324,78,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804071378912765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419975789948758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0561464310612288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18523328437185027,0.0,0.2936945519409232,0.0,0.06832793013379374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08199353148780614,0.0,0.16373891553400702,0.0,0.08494494313986793,0.06916986632577904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564466010045641,0.0,0.0,0.05178575382922141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10607252583467924,0.0,0.0,0.15345691348961002,0.07216692495777366,0.07854713518515002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07339118189591863,0.06830168404606447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423447475265893,0.1678101683399304,0.0,0.09127073681905412,0.0,0.1284437550363993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07193149521928204,0.07927793669564691,0.0,0.08535332684340037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24163719453536084,0.0797543197104901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381055210923444,0.15936732424029096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825967987797659,0.0,0.0,0.08502429444489681,0.08724432651406562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08983324646687457,0.0,0.06826673425664942,0.07247234134713408,0.07598018307607737,0.107199463563255,0.24422958677783205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851837957481876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180569640749176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15409674890426678,0.0,0.08425954722597251,0.0,0.0,0.0610704675601386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695522253992799,0.0,0.11133744691246934,0.0,0.0838946219295997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169222819891507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15432342126688176,0.08256001528870413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06857430050843574,0.07638206145763876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06642357487130415,0.09025864178792034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412631773690777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756801875822117,0.0,0.060374320474273664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051451901622159436,0.0,0.0,0.09364515672273367,0.0,0.0,0.15345691348961002,0.0,0.0545172676665244,0.0,0.07843976106409511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274740892879079,0.06441044433549561,0.0,0.2887912228646806,0.0,0.14491343338524934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338324444768668,0.0,0.0,0.11408320201031942,0.0,0.0,0.05170946576861428

My step mother is planning on hosting Easter dinner which one of the guests will have a sixth month old baby who was born preemie(dispite my quarantine and the shelter in place orders). They say if they get it its gods will.  They also think the media is overflowing it to make Trump look bad. I seriously don't know what to do and I'm biting my tounge very hard. If I don't then I will get the ""this is our house"" speech.  I feel like I'm at a loss....",4.304866071428569,5.473976183035717,5.041428571428573,83.85357142857143,70.65178571428571,8.1,26.05357142857143,8.472884824447931,1.6400410714285716,891,27,178,14,16,288,131,224,0.05,0.9129999999999999,0.037000000000000005,-0.3919,0,2,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,0,3,2,4,8,0,1,17,0,24,6,2,3,0,25,39,16,0,3,2,6,3,2,1,3,3,2,0,0,10,13,1,1,5,0,0,5,2,6,1,4,3,6,27,2,24,32,1,27,0,3,1,0,16,11,0,2,11,124,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933876242121733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12372620224773835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504128163945506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18054882954793688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12913157941279588,0.0,0.0,0.10430516383300537,0.0,0.13930140912800087,0.16415678455194174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16554178279272344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16355531829587766,0.1155429279246398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25349829548581193,0.0,0.09191725960450003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14488205421017927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916557777345617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18661952470077728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17776974725288774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15803029814469002,0.0,0.14281424085441233,0.0,0.13581597436924053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795881862268253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12909467655554205,0.17189783386675345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.339425622995978,0.0,0.328785790893245,0.12300612916102968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689777909564227,0.0,0.0,0.1823309828662448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286175085949482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723871126082742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12160397257405653,0.0,0.14136279888187311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10744900020838596,0.10363272968695726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15799078943204498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13344763368987286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041515069279351
COVID19_support,startingoverforever,2020/04/11,"Deciding whether to travel home or not... Ok, so I’m in a very confusing pickle... I am currently living on the island of Kauai in Hawaii with my sister. I was here visiting when the pandemic began and decided to shelter in place here until further notice... the plan was to get back to the East coast by late May (my lease ends and I’m supposed to move back home).  

My concern with traveling is a.) what if I’m infected and don’t know it for sure( I’ve had some mild but weird symptoms for a few weeks) and traveling is super irresponsible. b.) I actually don’t have it, but then go home in May when flights are potentially more full and put myself at risk of contracting and spreading it...

I don’t even know what my options are really.. I’m really hoping for an at home antibody test to come out so that when my symptoms subside, I can know if I had Covid, then I would feel fine about traveling home, or at least know my own risk level... but until then I just feel stuck and frustrated as hell.

Thanks for any kindness and support.",3.4945914634146327,5.007798078048778,4.890777439024394,82.81860518292686,73.09756097560975,8.63719512195122,26.95884146341464,9.188382445141503,2.201006097560976,806,29,163,18,16,269,122,205,0.127,0.763,0.11,-0.4033,1,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,2,12,14,2,3,8,1,17,3,0,0,1,38,35,27,0,4,10,1,2,0,0,3,3,0,5,0,6,12,0,0,8,4,0,9,4,6,0,0,6,2,15,8,28,26,6,38,1,0,0,0,2,14,1,10,15,111,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.1294661552098635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021971257821748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2040290935713916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428290420450787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750567246129735,0.0,0.0,0.08762685944484007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341632269178124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06931426360797804,0.0,0.07539905327733286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6653909142378183,0.1317706071086148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13815472020525088,0.29164643728265083,0.0,0.14965681401688294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11714947335545353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14100653119713893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510449429275524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861124143419928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13336934788693605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699827753132626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15055161477492066,0.12503929943860098,0.2757885214236915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12214411976621145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094661142598307,0.0,0.0,0.10641935615567097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424450515259844,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,mepace10,2020/04/12,"Support our Healthcare Workers   
As a pre-licensed nurse, the PPE (personal protective equipment) shortage is an issue I feel strongly about. Without the proper protective gear, nurses can not provide safe, quality care to their patients and in addition are putting themselves and their families at risk. Currently, in many areas of our country, doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are having to rely on makeshift masks such as bandanas, plastic, and other household items. A close family member of mine has been on the frontlines screening for Covid-19 and has been having to reuse disposable masks and was also instructed to conserve all PPE. WIth America being one of the wealthiest countries in the world this is something hard for me to understand. It is simply not acceptable. I would like to encourage anyone who feels led to write to their congressional representatives asking for their support in getting sufficient PPE to our health care workers. I have also attached a link on information for making or donating PPE. If you have any other questions or comments I would love to hear from you.

I have $15 to my name. My car is on empty. I have been crashing with friends around the country, but I can't afford to do that anymore. It seems my only option is to return to Louisiana and live with my family there. In addition to LA having a ridiculous amount of COVID cases, my family is very chaotic. My family triggers my depression and suicidal thoughts, so I've avoided staying with them for the past two years. I am absolutely terrified that my suicidal thoughts will get bad again, and I can't afford to see my therapist if she even accepts phone/video conferences right now. I hate feeling like a victim, but I'm beginning to feel hopeless. I have no financial support. I would love any tips or advice on what I could do in this situation.

COVID19_support,N95ZThrowZN95,2020/04/13,"Mom is 64 and Works at Lowe's While I Work in an ER - Feeling Like It's Inevitable She Gets COVID-19 I work as a medical scribe in an ER. I am trying to get another job, but a lot of the ones available would still have me working with the public like my mom's retail job. The most promising one I have applied for is 911 dispatch. It would be a godsend. The job is full time and has a high enough of a wage bump that my mom would be able to quit her job and stay at home if I could secure it. 

I know that I have already come into contact with this bug in the ER. I feel like it's not a question of if but when I track it in and give it to her. The anxiety about this is driving me crazy. She's been smoking since she was 12 years old and is on blood pressure medication. She already gets winded from basic physical exertion.  If she isn't the poster child for who CANNOT get this virus, I don't know who is. 

I've been crying every day for 3 days in a row. I'm surprised it's not a longer streak, really.  I keep picturing the hard conversations with the doctor over and over - her testing positive, her going on a vent, and her eventual death. If she made it on a vent, I could only hope that she would be heavily sedated when she passes. If/when she dies, what do I do? I feel like I'm killing her by going to work. I'm not sure how I will be able to live with myself.

I have asthma (albeit mild) and am sitting on a BMI of 30 (obese), so I'm not looking so hot either, but my chances are way better than my mom's due to being 37 years younger.",2.7131144095625888,3.3000875438066477,4.246777879942203,90.24776566399582,73.86404833836858,7.327518717982397,24.965322474714302,7.423996415210882,0.9162411926967038,1191,35,278,13,23,399,170,331,0.08199999999999999,0.7929999999999999,0.125,0.9273,6,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,0,7,7,13,1,1,22,0,34,6,1,2,1,45,55,22,3,11,12,4,5,4,0,5,5,0,1,1,17,14,1,2,6,0,2,5,7,3,3,2,4,6,38,10,36,39,5,36,0,1,1,0,27,17,0,8,15,180,55,12,0.17905219611740658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19758855083046786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387591973883844,0.06848721997120186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791785584717332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711880629510141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14295860898994872,0.0,0.09834021489578217,0.11547385387712192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092913955436895,0.0,0.0,0.09163375490867304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925043911291486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07542959884340536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13580125541024352,0.1918723870238936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18709476472896305,0.08588159096435463,0.10175948931300093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08019779914285309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945892379228827,0.08980197586473772,0.08891961571795914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3553633528788578,0.07957490943030705,0.09904736310700574,0.0,0.098402404366663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749517174943893,0.0,0.07905318477998569,0.0,0.07517937464535179,0.0,0.0,0.07611188708594656,0.0,0.08471175863363735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803762503418741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41940753612141823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394258000193613,0.0,0.12133040199641222,0.06808863177412769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10028971883580648,0.09522202527066324,0.0,0.0,0.057352710863162376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405691345132981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542290870419916,0.07149565755525579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437728792247727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05220338772783927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060782343934442165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07106164954214195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32588032818708884,0.0,0.0,0.254387085726659,0.0,0.0,0.11530374384276446

I doubt i would be able to fight it off. for example during the H1n1 scare, i caught it and was very sick for several weeks, originally i needed hospitalization but i made a surprising recovery which prevented me from going into the hospital. something that makes me feel even worse is i am stuck in a home with THREE essential workers who leave home and return everyday. as soon as these people arrive at our house i ask them to first thing change clothes and then wash their hands. i also wash my hands constantly, wear a mask if i have to go out (for food), and make sure that my medications are all stocked up. regardless of all this, NOTHING is making me feel better. i also have panic and anxiety disorder as well as clinical depression. it’s my birthday in two days and i have literally never felt worse. if anyone can reassure me or perhaps add some factual evidence about the risks of corona and having asthma, i feel that would help me greatly.",5.12581871345029,6.398735055555552,6.2535867446393825,75.53798245614036,68.81481481481481,9.387914230019494,28.284600389863552,9.682069395223575,2.6958518518518515,1115,38,200,25,19,373,166,270,0.154,0.725,0.12,-0.8945,0,0,1,0,1,0,29.0,1,0,2,3,10,16,1,4,11,0,21,16,3,6,5,47,42,24,2,7,7,0,8,2,0,2,12,0,2,1,12,14,1,2,6,1,0,5,2,7,1,3,8,9,32,9,30,30,5,32,0,1,0,0,11,11,0,7,15,141,44,2,0.11079147105885556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2657996981337324,0.18437475848133367,0.1200425126040823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16951034422086564,0.0,0.0,0.07746797259436328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20715013938158866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753745242822237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09798605277816114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720268595545913,0.0,0.0,0.11972622082344997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145133328324446,0.0,0.09542453167865944,0.0,0.2299681104832829,0.0,0.1269766243563587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07317672173512486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28009748339295537,0.15829889812325812,0.10637718663928207,0.0,0.0,0.0942391686848133,0.1339694865788005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05788397087891727,0.0,0.25186138477280035,0.0,0.0,0.12214798797064022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742611876667718,0.0,0.22226575771284635,0.0,0.0,0.12783848245427476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11731217082577265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10825423293198227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048335687415899,0.2218625017249743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11161075123788368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843269518688897,0.0,0.0,0.08215047195650901,0.0854492125581291,0.0,0.11782798637292813,0.0,0.0,0.10630740454347018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12998991993158698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680885608504416,0.09673883910233964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946153109299494,0.0,0.0,0.11092159025830993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251628267580522,0.0,0.09164784974735687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08529268720265093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10441965030976874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360493040529055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07522013630580084,0.0,0.10822716859411964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09141456664505287,0.0,0.0,0.0888702352448995,0.0,0.09961483800268868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2258119483782948,0.1574061645552296,0.0,0.0,0.0

One day, I’ll be completely convinced that if I contract this virus, I will die. The next day, I’ll feel confident that while it’ll be a horrible experience, I’ll survive it. Then another day, I’ll have a very calm acceptance of “if it’s my time, it’s my time”. Then my anxiety will go overboard for even thinking that.

COVID19_support,0101001000011,2020/04/13,"My mom is a nurse on a COVID floor, and my brothers are grocery store workers. I came back here because I was living in my car in the Bay, but I don't think it's safe here anymore. I'm in California still, but in a smaller city. The cold air from sleeping in my car fucked up my lungs, so I thought maybe if I come back home, I should have a better time surviving. I left my car up north with a friend because it is dangerous to drive. I'm still having issues breathing every morning after sleeping, so I guess my lungs are permanently fucked up.

I just don't know what should I do. The city is not taking it seriously here. Neither is my my family. Either I be homeless but still having risk in an area taking it more seriously or more cases, or I stay here with less cases, but more close contact.

I don't have a job, so I have food here with family.

My mom is already working with COVID patients.

COVID19_support,Pentacle_Pagan,2020/04/13,"Taking in relatives who might have been exposed My SIL works at an old folks home. They have recently had 1 (so far) confirmed case of Covid19. The unit where the individual case is located is locked down, with a full scrub in required to enter. SIL might have had contact with someone who had been in contact with the confirmed case, but has no known contact with confirmed case.
 
My MIL lives with SIL and is definitely immunocompromised. Suggestions have been made that perhaps MIL should stay with us for a while but that defies the current shelter in place order and makes me worry about my kid, myself, my SO.. But especially my child. The only spare room we have is located directly next to my kids room and the bathroom my child uses. 

I don't know what to do here. I want to help but all I see is the potential for my child to wind up sick. Kid's not immunocompromised but has respiratory issues like crazy and almost constantly. He just got over a 2 week battle with pneumonia about 3 weeks ago. Again,i want so desperately to help but I cant see past the risk to my child.

Reddit, what do I do? My heart and my head are tearing me in two different directions and I cant see clearly. Any help is beyond appreciated!!",4.5190118203309675,6.177938889361702,5.268475177304968,80.54361111111113,70.74468085106382,8.456264775413713,27.949172576832147,8.998388855275968,2.1880591016548467,969,35,188,19,18,314,134,235,0.115,0.7879999999999999,0.09699999999999999,-0.6829,2,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,2,0,1,2,9,3,1,1,12,0,29,3,2,3,2,36,40,16,0,3,8,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,3,7,6,14,0,1,2,0,0,1,5,2,0,1,8,3,23,1,29,29,2,29,0,0,3,0,20,16,0,3,11,123,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343926540702593,0.0,0.1518149916132433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309964350228867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16383598475190414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15839963538884022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12125594881881745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15559506308699453,0.0,0.0,0.17965796062009226,0.3048619106128634,0.0,0.15207666725407876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15824090496504453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08332060381617096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740687325382424,0.0,0.13387394610636608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14345655322372594,0.1012005033919096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3216673936232312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16123839912402535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590886430100692,0.0,0.0,0.11530583930242293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14472840109179091,0.0,0.0,0.15839963538884022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14969606857047132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3624393734863917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284582181595612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16159553056251916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399145892807015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14810042964335338,0.0,0.1823675340584674,0.13094191071584227,0.0,0.0,0.1788463956035003,0.0,0.2432239555602793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11037350516430673,0.15396678353880394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,x78370,2020/04/13,"Boss took away hand sanitizer from employees and told to use 100% alcohol instead - at a medical production company. How is this legal? A friend of mine is very distraught with conditions at her company. They are a small company and manufacture medical components/supplies and she is worried with how they're handling the COVID-19. At the end of last week her boss removed all hand sanitizer from the workplace citing concerns about it somehow being transferred to the products and gave them 100% alcohol to use on their hands!!! There's no way their hands won't end up dried like the Sahara and bleeding. Is this even legal? To make matters worse, there's a fellow co-worker who thinks it's amusing to fake cough around her and is not taking it at all seriously. I've read articles of people in public getting fined and charged for such behavior. This company is in the US and I'm hoping someone out there might have some advice for how she can deal with any of this crap she's dealing with on a daily basis. It's severely affecting her, as you might imagine. She's a strong woman, but this environment is NOT good!

I'm the one that can (and has) function in multiple emergency situations, including serious injuries. I have always been the calm, stoic, methodical one in frantic situations. 

Lately, however, I am getting angry. Like, illogically angry. No patience. Constantly irritated. Sounds are setting me off. Certain topics are rubbing me the wrong way when discussed. Sometimes there appears to be no reason for the anger and frustration at all. It's just there and I'm struggling to shake it. 

I recognize the anger and have not taken it out on anyone or anything around me. I openly state that I need to disconnect for a second and physically remove myself from being around others for a quick break. 

Last night, it was so overwhelming that I couldn't get myself out of the negativity loop. I was just so *mad.* 

I'm still working. I'm 'essential', but not really. I'm in an office with 3 people. The rest are working from home. 

I feel like perhaps I've relied on structure too long. Logic for too long. Predictability and planning and the long-game. At work, I'm getting no answers about whether we are going to switch to working completely from home or not. Nobody is telling us about lay-offs. We have no idea if pay cuts are coming. I don't know if I should defer my mortgage, or not. Because I'm still getting a regular paycheck so I should push it as long as I can, right? I'm happy to be going to work, but also frustrated to still be going to work. I'm in *accounting*. I'm not essential. I'm only essential because the people *at home* need me to be here in case I need to go into old records. 

But, I did work from home for a week and, yeah, needing paperwork and not having it *also* sucks. 

I literally don't know what to do. I'm so frustrated. I'm so angry. I'm an introvert so I'm not going stir-crazy, but I think this uncertainty is slowly chipping away at my patience. There is no logical choice right now. There is no stability. No game plan from work. No game plan for my future. I feel like a cornered animal. 

I know I'm not alone. We are all struggling. Is anyone else having their feelings manifest as anger?",1.4934300077339486,4.2136266705336425,3.6110359628770334,81.96758255993818,89.71925754060325,6.5856303170920345,24.35270688321733,7.793537801064563,1.9436635421500383,1769,74,317,40,60,599,203,431,0.193,0.7490000000000001,0.057999999999999996,-0.9951,2,1,1,0,0,0,75.0,4,0,1,11,28,23,10,5,19,1,36,0,0,1,3,65,77,31,0,10,20,0,4,3,0,2,0,1,4,0,13,20,0,0,13,3,2,13,20,17,0,4,5,5,32,6,50,64,6,56,0,1,0,0,9,23,1,6,19,217,45,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369999910970763,0.0,0.1292555014630972,0.06724457937303184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130154968043939,0.08280454907486665,0.06650388425411816,0.14388502193829106,0.0,0.0,0.07592838146795003,0.0,0.0,0.09852818504810136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961499296523896,0.08473302195925167,0.08733233795677844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06751058806460959,0.09090603196073584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07618521844709858,0.0,0.12258752299509112,0.11546854794215874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16889007177574952,0.0,0.2296452212176177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08602910276770531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3242562595777821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123033264933594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13324148188059368,0.06587503613504181,0.09116287451307553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844642540261298,0.0,0.0,0.2860750357370183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.239693284591156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583943160896618,0.07918157128134028,0.0,0.0,0.08480178000870574,0.0,0.16428706862621073,0.06146347239648248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875148027162202,0.0,0.11205393324131056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05177217795615754,0.08309131112764842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13803118904428996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18167896070593806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07992813164692683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19361696336592865,0.0,0.0,0.1689708335061539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07063589876558947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05178300840723008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09721053125695132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414720961894245,0.06482494281808837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4706744379303491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835854934817543,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,blueboxbandit,2020/04/13,"I need help finding the edge of my anxiety and reasonable fears regarding my roommates behavior. TW: Coronavirus

While I was waiting for mod approval to post I also posted in r/anxiety but I'm very interested in this community's advice as well.

----

Some background: I'm in my 30's, diabetic, chronic depression and anxiety issues. My roommate has been living with me for 4 years. She's always been a little flakey but right now she owes me $1k. I'm not too stressed about it but it's kind of relevant. We share a small free-standing house, owned by me, with one bathroom.

Today I blew a gasket when she took a lyft to the grocery store. I have a car and have always been happy to drive her places as long as I was awake and available. I was awake and very available, I knew she was going to the grocery store and she told me which one and I told her the other one was much closer and nicer bc I assumed she was walking. But she didn't seem to mind and I thought she was just trying to get some steps in or something. 

My bedroom window was open and I just happened to hear the car pull up and looked out the window to see her get in. I was incensed.

1. How could someone CHOOSE to sit in an enclosed space with someone who has had who knows how many passengers over the duration of this pandemic. I was obviously available. Even in the driver sanitized after every ride, the driver was at the very least exposed to every passenger. I didn't ask if they were wearing a mask, but I know my roommate wasn't.



2. When she came home, I said I need you to change clothes because you were in a lyft, and she said but I just got home. I said, I'm immunocompromised and I need you to take everything that was in that car and treat it like your driver coughed on it. 



3. I have absolutely no understanding of why she did this, but she went to the grossest grocery store in town. When she told me she was going to the store I was like, oh we could probably use butter, then she told me which store and I was like, nvm I don't want their butter. It might make sense if she was trying to save money but then .. she took a lyft.. when there's a store in walking distance. I just don't get it on any level. There is almost no chance they are taking sufficient steps to prevent spread of the virus. It didn't seem like that big a deal before she left because that was before my trust in her common sense plummeted, and just thought I'd remind her to sanitize everything when she got home.


So the reason I'm posting this here is because I having been mulling this over for hours and I honestly don't know what the threat level is. How dangerous was that car ride? Personally I feel like I should consider her contaminated until she doesn't show symptoms for 2 weeks. Is it overkill? I have anxiety anyway but next to having a limb mangled, being intubated is my greatest fear and I'm tearing up just writing that. Also, is even possible to avoid cross contamination when we share a kitchen and bathroom? At this point the trust meter is leaning closer to suspicion than trust for me so I can't just trust her to clean where she's been. I think I would have to clean the bathroom and kitchen every time I used them.

I'm not completely without options, my parents are in Florida and their summer home is unoccupied in a town less than an hour away, but I have three cats and a dog, so it's an unappealing option to say the least.

I thank you for any advice you can give me. Dealing with a mental illness at times like this is so painful. Everything I've ever overthought, I could usually at least tell that I was overthinking it. It didn't help much but it was some comfort compared to this.",3.10542120824324,4.959794608755132,4.133533603989232,86.42705650677375,74.8686730506156,7.123789770972158,26.154207669564446,7.941651935203635,1.5071490490269626,2893,105,585,44,62,937,311,731,0.08,0.7879999999999999,0.132,0.9914,2,1,1,0,0,0,75.0,3,6,5,1,34,29,2,4,36,0,68,9,1,8,2,103,122,58,0,11,24,1,1,6,0,3,6,5,11,1,33,32,2,4,16,1,8,19,15,8,1,4,50,10,98,21,75,65,11,92,0,1,2,0,65,44,0,13,31,401,131,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13131858179008624,0.0,0.0,0.06728312942298703,0.0,0.0,0.107466911777253,0.1118183318648654,0.0,0.0,0.0913857924505947,0.0,0.2056069288523058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0628154938941077,0.0,0.06312914019319664,0.0,0.0,0.122878944999802,0.0,0.11435096651775314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684980185779082,0.0,0.0,0.07108027661469687,0.0,0.07044958313139751,0.0,0.0,0.16094214672339902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13854410058858554,0.057872411815926325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08875942697535255,0.060779053530743865,0.16983659326450234,0.0,0.18116363842816266,0.0,0.0,0.1512194672545176,0.03397431797120752,0.048002011961905934,0.0,0.0,0.06141231387549246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105315214274034,0.06445673430223853,0.0763735777566341,0.0,0.10747923654954633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05941770545438903,0.07152718370020615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573032058986506,0.0,0.09007482581237193,0.0,0.2695964074783805,0.0,0.1323412634154128,0.07753060111869964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07013104025916843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997017739222597,0.1107809757901898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07300435590935356,0.0,0.0,0.19695984163130992,0.0673440833018816,0.05933180871351356,0.05946284738217124,0.0564243969180212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04485121327632648,0.06812218967556075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06771377986288224,0.07128014383270831,0.06784481339595379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987877718502823,0.14946615488613485,0.0,0.0,0.07145950449909767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13659321042700198,0.0,0.07149707563712379,0.0,0.07460881679875117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05866950391727496,0.07020138825006263,0.0,0.06351820301497504,0.07574893745361898,0.1930542229275512,0.0,0.07244439139168149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.138169230730356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05738164119755911,0.19174507119994455,0.053433812843240606,0.0,0.0,0.053543362253261485,0.12233823247050653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138632071316743,0.051727720658886964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696826307601899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.069838264440356,0.10104011471688416,0.0,0.058728810882497186,0.061861409546934074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04305395076471353,0.0,0.10668596014153,0.07836044616003142,0.0,0.06369020420779037,0.25681952229501603,0.14930567356218122,0.09123797892555867,0.0,0.0,0.06994929081423575,0.0,0.11606471050015445,0.07400254719549636,0.16632142763892885,0.039631610338195816,0.0,0.05389740732069295,0.0,0.06041371989418577,0.06228770094428121,0.06063037156460557,0.0,0.0,0.06477073576943014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04773130251339206,0.0,0.0,0.04326947543397952
COVID19_support,psychopompandparade,2020/04/13,"the contamination anxiety is going wild i have vaguely ocd-like contamination anxiety stemming from a long running phobia. before, I was able to manage it mostly. Was about to get a handle on what was rational and what wasn't at least 95% of the time. I've lost that entirely. Everything about this virus is unknown, it seems. I wish I had a magic epidemiologist on hand to bug constantly about questions, but I know that isn't the way to solve this. It just feels like the only one my brain will listen too.

I've been googling for an hour if I should shower after being inside the shared stairwell of my nine unit apartment to take the trash out. No, right? That's overkill? No one was even in the stairwell with me. But. But what about the study about it hanging in the air? Should I have worn a real mask to do that? Where will I get that many masks? 

And on and on.

This feels so petty to post here. There are people posting about working in hospitals, about losing loved ones, about being sick, and here I am looking for some way to deal with this bullshit.

Does anyone have a solution? Found a trustworthy place to ask these questions? Found some factoid that could keep their brain from screaming about stray viral particles being carried by the wind or whatever?

I hate it. I know I'm not being rational, but I don't know which parts are the irrational ones. I just want to lie down, but I haven't decided about the shower yet. It's been over an hour now.

Sorry if this is a total waste of space on this sub, where people are far more in need than I am. I just.

COVID19_support,P_DrewG,2020/04/13,"Isolation &amp; Depression / Anxiety This may get jumbled. Just need to share.

I'm an emotionally intense person.  My depression and anxiety are increasing with each day of shelter-in-place.   I wish ""sucking it up"" were an option, or that reading, meditation and facetiming friends helped in a significant way.  But the truth is I wake up feeling an intense dread of the monotony and lack of touch awaiting me for that day and each one of the foreseeable future.   On the surface it's almost strange that something like simply being distanced from others and being forced to entertain one's self could do this to me. But there it is, tightness in my chest and a sense of deep sadness.   The fact that it's so indefinite probably contributes.             

I think this all has stirred up the latent feeling of disconnection / lack of community that American culture and capitalist realism create.   But now I have no remedy to access. No playing music with my bandmates.  No taking someone out on a date.      I have an almost resentful envy of those who are truly contented and pacified by things like watching movies, reading, cooking, and doing household projects for the sake of being ""productive"". That stuff could get me through a week or so.  After two or three, even strenuous exercise, writing and playing music feel empty and rather worthless.     

Turns out touch, face-to-face interaction, and simply the *potential* for new experiences with others are things I need to even begin to flourish.   I'm an ambiverted empath and putting around with my own thoughts isn't enough to feel like I am *really* living.       On paper, 40 or 50 days of hanging out by yourself seems tolerable- like one of those white collar prisons in Scandinavia, minus the co-workers. But somehow my heart and mind are going off the rails.      Oh and fuck, then there's the backdrop reality that even if this is a relatively short-lived, one-time pandemic, we are entering an era of such severe climate disruption that this is likely to look like child's play in hindsight.   Ugh.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway.  Anyone else feeling really raw during this isolation ?    Maybe I should have gotten the wife and kid and rural house thing set up and these would be typical days in the life.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I am glad lives are being saved, and have deep sympathy for those who lose loved ones in this and all other tragic situations.",6.950307881773398,8.545596035714286,6.831133004926113,71.88214285714288,64.83333333333334,9.888341543513958,34.95894909688013,10.085429814115964,3.855422003284071,1885,86,299,43,29,597,239,420,0.139,0.732,0.128,-0.8426,0,2,1,0,0,0,72.0,1,0,0,1,14,27,3,1,24,0,31,8,3,0,4,73,55,32,0,11,11,1,8,6,1,3,2,0,0,4,32,31,1,1,8,8,0,5,4,11,0,6,3,11,18,16,51,42,9,41,0,6,3,2,15,21,2,12,19,216,50,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18078062676646411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29341586040079426,0.2193708806839446,0.0,0.0,0.13810947032417886,0.0,0.0,0.0631174499188972,0.09249018279918872,0.0,0.0803576139826908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1441432268252772,0.0,0.0,0.23286144191524946,0.0,0.15549530722326527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07540728982571936,0.10153929473120424,0.0,0.09327092315091368,0.0,0.17886339017274944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829937678345201,0.0,0.0,0.2282109404493485,0.06448744197055667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06974079474183383,0.08345126580435662,0.09432255706980514,0.0,0.05130135657202552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10696795612657993,0.06050470454439572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10415709542658937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06375892307446901,0.26460216642187634,0.0,0.1594165083937435,0.0,0.07580234396971047,0.10098674711383897,0.0,0.0,0.08147034974484177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906862892507993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911448976419342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338650832306926,0.0,0.08718134921919407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30583949751848355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0788184926979547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973241181988544,0.0,0.0,0.09074422256417293,0.0,0.0,0.1805847568503061,0.0,0.11565592124045634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821765520316434,0.09416915922159194,0.10197709046775524,0.0,0.0,0.1014649585934352,0.0,0.0,0.07648374164308443,0.06949267849244314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333520705993893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787026489300456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799100461670482,0.057840057907281715,0.0,0.07166266977684066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09818560919712924,0.08817867132488283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716504975873926,0.07240750512113826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038036883718864,0.0,0.0,0.06571614314891658,0.0,0.0,0.06412376221759605,0.0,0.2193708806839446,0.0
COVID19_support,AcademicF,2020/04/13,"Should I have thrown out my food? I ordered Papa Johns pizza from Postmates, and chose “contactless delivery”. I laid a towel out in front of my door for the delivery guy to lay the pizza down, but when he delivered it he knocked on my door. Which means he had to stand on the towel to be close enough to my door.

I asked him to leave it on the towel, and he confusingly said okay, and then when he walked away I grabbed the box that he laid down where he was standing. When I brought it into my kitchen I moved the pizza from the box to a plate, took the box out to the dumpster and washed down the table where the box was and washed my hands.

I also microwaved my 3 slices just in case the virus particles somehow made it from his shoes, to where he laid the pizza where he stood - to the inside of the pizza box.

This virus has made me an anxious, OCD wreck.

COVID19_support,alexoflyer88,2020/04/13,"Worried my neighbours frequent fires are going to kill me Hello all, I hope you are all hanging in there. I've been really stressed and anxious throughout this whole outbreak, but things have gotten way worse for me in the last week. The weather where I live has gotten really nice lately, and several of my neighbours have taken to burning large bonfires and using their fire pits on a daily basis. Sometimes there will be two or three people burning at once.

Unfortunately, the smoke from these fires seems to get inside my home even when I have all the windows and doors closed, and the air quality inside my home deteriorates pretty dramatically as a result. Ordinarily, I would just leave for the day and return once the smoke subsides, but I cant really do that since I'm under a stay at home order.

I've read tons of articles suggesting that individuals that are exposed to even small amounts of air pollution have a much harder time dealing with covid-19, so breathing in all this smoke on a daily basis has me very anxious headed for a breakdown. Idk how much more I can take before I start down a destructive path. Any advice or encouragement that you all could share would be absolutely amazing.",8.515120663650073,8.4799546561086,8.091142533936656,69.85520550527906,61.26244343891402,10.262594268476624,35.15874811463047,9.725611199111238,3.394402413273002,973,37,161,16,12,309,140,221,0.13,0.7759999999999999,0.094,-0.5415,0,0,3,0,0,1,18.0,0,2,1,0,9,8,2,1,14,0,19,2,2,3,5,26,30,14,1,4,5,0,3,0,2,3,0,0,5,0,8,8,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,3,0,2,4,3,17,5,22,20,11,28,0,0,0,0,10,14,0,4,9,111,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12850899655857895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08943057659813286,0.0,0.0,0.2971352986839243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11190440653852317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10499917324454383,0.0,0.0,0.08481237523311054,0.13557992405225675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17372080539142912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0687079839182849,0.0,0.07473955100111053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349660943045248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39574251406658095,0.13061803275190922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14549513753339524,0.0,0.0,0.10719732369804788,0.1483477921498141,0.13924896001652898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11612478748768815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19334837857190465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28010541990197435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911717280024274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13379185199242372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13154451018938915,0.0,0.2527439487490599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11972078346586162,0.0,0.14856764934196215,0.0,0.10878553926023556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13006568653976136,0.0,0.09308269186955476,0.14017101304105367,0.0,0.0,0.1506430258372261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887834286229508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736868424545409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668390998925953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284651078074997,0.0,0.0,0.11358148465294216,0.0,0.10850863338459964,0.0,0.10438566105302584,0.10548852473845634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468250149669208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13355369389351465,0.1340188266470798,0.18684033003752906,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,margosmango,2020/04/13,"Went food shopping and someone near me sneezed into the shelf I'm from NYC, living in Queens near the largest outbreak in the country. I haven't been food shopping in 2 weeks, and I was pretty low on food, so I made the trek to Costco right in my neighborhood. Unfortunately it was very full of people.  I was wearing a t-shirt mask, but most people were not 6 feet apart. I was doing my best to be in and out, quickly grabbing only what I needed. 

And then a teenager sneezed into the cheese refrigerator.

He was wearing what looked like a medical mask, but he didn't seem to care at all. He didn't even bend into his elbow. I was standing about 8 feet back, as far away as I could without being closer to other people. I had politely asked him to move, so I could grab the cheese next to him, but then after realized that I might have walked right into a cloud of the virus. It totally sent me spiraling.

I don't go out, when I do it's every 2 weeks, and I'm wearing a mask. I'm washing my hands constantly, cleaning my apartment and surfaces everyday. Cleaning groceries, and even spraying down my apartment building's public surfaces. I'm 28 and healthy, but I can't help but feel unsafe. And that's now turned into anger, especially towards the morons in my neighborhood who still continue to gather in large groups on the corner of the street. And especially that teenager not giving a shit in the world. His mother didn't even say anything. 

I need advice on how to get over this anxiety. It's been weeks of it, as I'm sure it is for most of us. My therapist and I have discussed how this pandemic is triggering my PTSD, so that is somewhat comforting to know where it's stemming from. Some days are good, some not so much. I feel guilty even worrying considering how so many others are right in the face of the virus, and how many of my friends are now losing their loved ones. It's a terrible spiral of anxiety and guilt, building on top of each other.",4.815796064400715,5.685243842377265,5.521459948320416,81.98758050089447,69.23255813953489,8.3311071357583,29.87169548797456,8.502166056373571,2.1557490359769425,1545,58,302,23,26,502,196,387,0.107,0.792,0.10099999999999999,0.1649,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,1,0,1,4,21,15,3,1,20,0,31,15,9,6,3,54,53,33,0,4,9,1,5,1,1,1,2,1,2,0,20,21,3,0,5,2,2,5,10,7,0,1,16,7,34,8,54,32,11,68,0,2,1,1,22,45,1,7,18,214,54,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10517169138843108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646684587497601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08856770962746964,0.0,0.10061655628909202,0.0,0.10111894843075607,0.08275838786963914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11294771668254645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973272482105326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630636670316034,0.0,0.17186253009892286,0.0,0.0,0.06941040077198432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2843460212382677,0.0,0.09068024509447964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10883871683938688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39042836546335496,0.0,0.0831522208807619,0.0,0.056230575866968335,0.10324546116066732,0.06116680701662481,0.09027227760089478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07213999460753119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059148890373790085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052581032066162166,0.0,0.09503646156504808,0.0,0.0903794296061834,0.12040689144889398,0.0,0.0,0.09713741494190886,0.10183910763240428,0.0,0.21823342322459105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10842270700777017,0.0,0.11417505713365128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143902861763383,0.07911810280282046,0.15960785950641196,0.0,0.0,0.11446235333188284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07293072453750896,0.08185505308391915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22384467463607688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10949517734051968,0.0,0.0,0.1258100032659081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2757381709637213,0.0,0.08558917401407302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09797942267577547,0.0,0.0,0.11047739303080814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09119186270296373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859509244343329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014370123471319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124963043468368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170670838136362,0.0,0.0,0.12946182319515542,0.0,0.0,0.08880340527834964,0.0,0.0,0.2589952501206385,0.0,0.0,0.09977114848039556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037484222032375,0.0,0.0,0.10930026888468483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,6seanryan15,2020/04/14,"Feelings of being ashamed, but no where to talk about what's going on? I'm so tired of feeling like I have no body who understands my situations and I wish I could post about things, but I read people going through issues on the other corona subs and the unemployment subs and it's just full of downvotes and people not being able to understand that now more than ever - nothing is black and white. 

We're all in this situation that we could not predict and we all are just trying to figure out how to handle it best for ourselves, meaning mentally, physically, and financially. I'm so scared to post my issues and what I'm feeling because I know I'm just gonna be downvoted and insulted with comments from people who have no idea what's going on in my life and people not in my shoes. 

Sorry, I just needed to rant. Anybody else just getting upset feeling like they can't be honest about their issues and how they're feeling? I try to calm myself down by reading Reddit, but it seems a lot of people are just combative and looking for arguments. 

""Be lucky you even have a job!""
""YOU HAVE TO WORK""

To me just translates into

""So you wanna commit fraud and be lazy? Go back to your job where you get treated like shit and make 10 times less than I do but do 10 times the work""!!!!!!!

Hopefully I can find some COVID-friends in this sub who feel just as worthless and ashamed as I do and can tell me I'm not crazy.",4.570074920397079,5.425090270462637,5.253339576699754,83.74041018917401,69.78291814946618,7.766323281513393,27.600861584566392,7.85451343220497,1.5828533807829177,1110,36,221,13,19,359,150,281,0.2,0.669,0.13,-0.9808,4,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,5,2,3,22,16,2,4,5,0,21,5,3,3,4,67,49,27,0,6,16,0,6,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,15,21,0,0,14,2,0,4,8,7,0,0,0,9,26,9,38,40,8,24,0,1,3,0,16,13,1,5,8,159,41,7,0.10245269751744099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07877980036330823,0.0,0.06245421347507382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10751778521542274,0.0,0.0,0.11380185063452357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16360028463161058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08558608233281664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06766904045586686,0.09267433043215337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3108189733436473,0.14638445515495355,0.0,0.0,0.09363990944382923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791546999570703,0.0,0.10705461174742767,0.0,0.2329049160900101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10175864569173552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11565662491198846,0.0,0.3208019944852182,0.20333698715098786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05630532318607265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236537014279534,0.1501596387641314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08603446254342609,0.0,0.0,0.08710161968619423,0.0,0.0,0.06838797115112616,0.0,0.0,0.11160102263396048,0.0,0.0,0.10324822196595396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07596737703576599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09830612643251684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3551390023046678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962427273606752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2049608453448291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257302323254798,0.0,0.0,0.09326908796566248,0.0,0.0,0.10516622171682903,0.0,0.23032224921871436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468740694488658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08234759742531232,0.08954817341568065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06806501979380276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11948198365037678,0.11775430439565004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391173128853029,0.0,0.0,0.2133137426081908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11781554595025598,0.0,0.0,0.14917356799687065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,SME_TX_BX,2020/04/14,"I need a better approach to help my mom Hello!   
I am trying to help educate my 82 year old mom on the following concepts related to COVID19:  
\--Any item brought in to the apartment from the outside must be treated with care (i.e. assume any such item could have the virus on it - and clean or 'quarantine' as appropriate).   
\--Any space outside the apartment (including elevators, laundry room, public hallways, mail area) must be avoided (and if can't be avoided...must assume the virus could be there and take proper precautions).  
\--Any human you encounter in person might be sick or be a carrier, or have the virus on their shoes or clothes, so keep them 6 feet away and out of the apartment (and definitely do not ask the FedEX delivery person to bring the box inside for you with the dolly - which she did).   
My mom is having a hard time embracing these ideas and adjusting her actions. I have tried the best I can to explain.   
I think if it were spelled out in this way (above) by a medical professional (and I emailed that info to her) she might start getting it. I have searched the CDC web site - but have not found wording that I think will help her get it.   
To summarize:  
\--I need a better description for her of dos and don'ts

COVID19_support,gabrrdt,2020/04/14,"I hate this ""the world has changed forever"" thing some people say ""This is the new reality"". ""World has changed forever"". All that sentences. And all of them are said with this sense, this feeling, that it is a very important and profound thing to say, and all the time they sound really vague and not very well explained. I mean, why this will change the world forever? I get it, we will have political and social changes, but that happens with any major event, it is not a big deal. After WWII, the world changed, but that doesn't mean we were at war all the time. I hate when people say those things in a very uncritical way, trying to sound ""wise"", it only brings more panic and sadness.

I mean, this is a virus, much probably we will have medicine and vaccines, and we have this herd immunity thing, I'm almost certain it WILL pass, and we will live sorta the same way we did before, without that social distance shit. So why saying in that ""insightful way"" that we have to ""accept it, the world has changed forever, but we still can be happy in new ways and blah blah blah""? C'mon, we are not babies and we are not stupid. I understand that could last months or some years at the worst scenario, but I can't see why that would last forever. And I don't want to be ""happy in new ways"", I just want to get back to my normal life, go to a stadium to watch my soccer team, go to the streets, get a crowded train in the subway, all the regular stuff.

PS: I don't know if it is allowed to curse here, just tell me if it is not allowed and I'll edit. Also, clearly english is not my first language, I'm making a huge effort to express myself on it, but I'm sorry if that is not clear enough.",6.6788566940129135,5.4234756498516346,6.777378251003668,81.77999301797874,65.49851632047478,9.82852155699075,31.692965613545127,8.671277953709913,2.2195534648280675,1302,40,276,16,17,418,162,337,0.138,0.7809999999999999,0.081,-0.9669,2,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,10,0,2,3,9,14,5,1,19,0,34,3,1,3,8,74,58,25,1,8,19,0,1,3,0,6,2,7,0,0,32,25,0,0,9,2,0,4,12,8,1,1,3,10,27,6,24,46,13,40,0,1,2,0,25,16,1,8,15,187,59,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08021945064144789,0.0,0.0,0.06406462287676286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054478129433702456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06160030358214023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06816843830720201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5084799821625179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06396200011269335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259077523698534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08277592958732878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04050645603052189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814225348338729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255638479616116,0.0,0.09105769163385474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084176569673657,0.17055899247159992,0.0,0.15818577048001714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0440268315679563,0.13060208035135665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0565846669967741,0.0,0.0,0.07073935385257872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05347461868205111,0.0,0.0,0.2617926235897577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06394372123334748,0.0,0.05889069708769293,0.0,0.0,0.2321146927843708,0.0,0.0,0.07849163007389455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06092791618469221,0.0,0.09399282907395658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11107756178582556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637305264087887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05132106593105955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07620376958670302,0.2548294735231659,0.0,0.0,0.06383798052034763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223264281538592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16332585889374718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967754490710665,0.0,0.0,0.0639766333614491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917077641618877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07002041947546289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128883730746516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09342656913976533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05439001284431776,0.0,0.0,0.08339822671743613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19829953911950304,0.09450291734735587,0.31794134457073725,0.0,0.0,0.07202928078226628,0.0,0.21686276221738196,0.0,0.0,0.07722400675511558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05690845385555025,0.0,0.0,0.05158876494932458
COVID19_support,drumbum424,2020/04/14,"The Internet can be a scary place How are you all dealing with the rampant ignorance and disinformation being spewed left and right on social media right now?

My bar was already set pretty low for the general public, but I've been especially shocked by how so many loud voices on Instagram, YouTube and even Reddit are insisting that this is just a cold, that medical experts should not be trusted, and that we should open everything up immediately. As if hundreds of thousands of people suddenly dying isn't a big deal. They are so, so confident in their stupid opinions. It's not even just conspiracy theories, it's people acting like they know everything. None of these people care about any facts.

I've made a pact with myself in the past to not argue with strangers in the comments about things, because everyone ends up angry in that situation, but I'm finding it harder and harder to refrain from calling people out. Refusing to listen to experts on this is what's going to make this last year(s) and not months, and these people will still probably downplay this when this is all over. I know arguing with strangers is a waste of my time. I've never done this with previous world events but it feels like I can't help myself here.

Some genius was trying to tell me we shouldn't listen to someone who was interviewed for an article about their recommendations about slowly opening concert venues back up months and months from now. The commentor said ""ok what makes this person an expert"". I found that the interviewee was a professor at Harvard medical school, and now runs an advisory board on public health, and I explained this to the commenter. He replied ""who cares if he went to Harvard, he can't run my life"", totally missing the point. This kind of thinking is going to get people killed! Or at the very least, make people angry at those who know what they're doing.

I feel like the lack of respect for expert advice is what got us here in the first place. How do you avoid getting frustrated when you read things like this? Are there really this many ignorant people in the world? Have I been blind to this my entire life?",7.559024203263607,7.900246065491184,7.1623940422735775,74.45526776913813,63.15617128463476,10.229284853794766,33.129887197459205,9.971965246562196,3.2148712955864625,1716,63,299,33,23,539,214,397,0.149,0.7559999999999999,0.095,-0.9768,0,1,0,0,0,0,40.0,3,3,4,1,24,21,5,1,22,1,31,7,0,7,5,65,56,25,2,6,12,0,2,4,0,4,6,6,0,1,33,20,1,5,9,3,0,6,10,11,0,2,12,10,23,10,51,37,7,55,0,2,1,0,35,30,0,5,22,210,56,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08871928529885045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10018941569871898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061740555541835176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06981217975436202,0.0,0.055344958446605266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927071046383426,0.0,0.1851336379874969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18720174127739928,0.0,0.0,0.09422605577452203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929100561187488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041330757718493,0.0,0.0,0.1199323479959068,0.0,0.0,0.08675407607290399,0.16319303589168413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918126640672866,0.12972129720300318,0.0,0.0,0.08298074074987752,0.07722623059326576,0.0,0.09954693938931973,0.0,0.0,0.0948684277489709,0.0,0.1031965033724769,0.0,0.07261334170044859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650590307942224,0.0,0.0,0.060854861974266185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10044607741168342,0.09454418477341063,0.14968801616401373,0.07400625792066724,0.0,0.0,0.09864398764729462,0.0,0.12825582713085265,0.17742232814177186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08590803024409167,0.18180980326254487,0.18409434212956893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18292346445907112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174039883562944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700231197401307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08666966812441361,0.5035408112707153,0.07927463707610184,0.1897131969484266,0.0,0.0858262326342197,0.0,0.0,0.0923664319654592,0.09788735974097144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09081492534781496,0.0,0.05816262699399044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15506893622900353,0.08636241951718744,0.0,0.0,0.09188468752807408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10205216432215536,0.0,0.09254933463454283,0.07692637417227839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250529573044713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07935477305527608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206341568502453,0.05817479429138407,0.0,0.0,0.05294058680994587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06164069221617376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920961977249104,0.0,0.0,0.07491155219042135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841635697759622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05846601270633948
COVID19_support,Aslan27,2020/04/14,"My dad (54) got off the ventilator yesterday after being on it for 14 full days. He's a previous heart patient, diabetic, slightly overweight, but most importantly a fighter. I write this message with great happiness and I want all of those who have loved ones in a similar situation to remain hopeful and keep your morale up. No matter what. Everyone has their own time when they're ready, whether it be 7 days or 14. 


I will write a more detailed log of his 14 days and counting at a later date but I am tired and want to keep this simple and boost morale for others.



He's been stable most of the 14 days. There were time periods where he was progressing well and tried weaning off, but had difficulties and took a couple steps back. They put him in prone position many times during these two weeks as he often responded well. He was put in prone again two days in a row before coming off the ventilator.



He's now very weak and tired, so he'll continue to rest and cough up whatever is bad in his lungs. We FaceTimed with him 30 minutes ago and he looked good and happy to see us. We told him we loved him and we are expecting him to get better and come home soon!

COVID19_support,guypersonhuman,2020/04/14,"Essential Employee Dilemma and Stress We are a food ingredient manufacturing company. The vp of my dept went home sick (headache, looked sweaty) on Wednesday am last week and was still not at work today.

The owner called a meeting (very appropriate social distancing, masks etc..) with all of us today informing us that ""someone"" (small company, we all know who it is) went home with covid symptoms and they are still sick but haven't been tested. 

When all the shit hit the fan (March 17 ish) we were given a memo saying if we come in contact with someone showing symptoms we must report and self quarantine for 14 days. Don't come in to work, just call and explain. 

Imo, we are all subject to that directive as we all had direct contact with him, but the boss said we aren't, just go back to work as normal and continue to use precautions. 

I'm obviously stressed out because:
1. Direct, sustained contact with someone suspected/presumed to have covid. 
2. Feel like I should quarantine, not just morally, but also to follow work guidelines
3. I can't find any good info on job protection for a voluntary leave of absence related to covid for my state (NY, not NYC) and can't find any info on being given an order to quarantine by my local health dept. 
4. Despite consistent inquiry, my requests to work from home are largely being ignored (""oh yeah, we'll see what we can do"" but then no action for the weeks) 
5. My SO has been working from home and pretty much isolated for a month and I dread bringing this thing to her, in spite of her own efforts. 

Anyone have any insight into this or maybe just some kind words? I'm definitely self medicating(not at work) my stress with wine and weed (not smoking) and can't seem to relax even when I'm not at work/in danger

I know I'm one of the lucky ones for still having a job and very grateful for that, but I'm stressed and nervous and don't want to infect anyone. That was the one thing I promised myself, that  I won't infect a single person and now I'm at a crossroads where I have to put my money where my mouth is.",5.384907692307691,6.148217860000003,5.809000000000001,80.8166153846154,67.9,8.553846153846155,30.634615384615394,8.617729084823388,2.3101576923076927,1624,61,309,24,26,522,214,400,0.10800000000000001,0.794,0.098,0.4123,3,3,1,0,0,0,58.0,12,0,1,8,16,16,3,6,17,1,33,11,2,2,7,77,59,29,0,5,16,0,1,1,0,4,7,2,4,3,12,34,2,2,11,3,1,9,14,10,0,3,11,5,32,6,48,41,10,45,1,0,2,0,33,16,1,5,19,199,44,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289107668177217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16044057056038102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997854938937317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060471899189310924,0.0,0.04794027001585779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16060735262953782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13548860392693926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0507184693445794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877081489228256,0.051943205920974525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03976445217234545,0.05618284112290954,0.0,0.0,0.14375723568400406,0.0,0.0950958783542996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044694841004730895,0.06596232975525942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083594227579287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31554285975940644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15608282493414016,0.0,0.0,0.0818949706293341,0.08644068179476086,0.06410484508725149,0.0,0.08327197641206617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03842117943843349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604062617243896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07900783819786385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627723897343501,0.0,0.057811927707897226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07705380761158133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598723538083902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06866835956709555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000858277086807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07905831094172737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07480785652537976,0.06254036643183808,0.0,0.0,0.0626685859969512,0.07159397280683416,0.164084378277565,0.0,0.08072629187243786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08016701460618961,0.19990282327438294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18841409691818795,0.0,0.3603428705728429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16348115235111793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10449432459354983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14908944345631442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891965883495398,0.06792262369316485,0.0,0.12977803724545406,0.046385898758638335,0.0,0.12616593966262585,0.0,0.0,0.14580638865058546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4580264953206472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,Mdfinest,2020/04/14,"Should I continue going to work or staying at home? Hi everyone, 

I have an issue here. My dad and I had a lengthy ""discussion"" (really a butting of heads) about how he does not want me to go to work anymore because of Covid19. But I disagree with him and feel the need to go to work because I have no choice as I'm working an essential job. I want to go to work as I feel like I shouldn't be held hostage to earn an income because of Covid19. I actually like working at my job and would rather do that for 10 hours a day currently than to stay under quarantine with my dad who has at this point basically become paranoid and panicky about the virus which he was not a few weeks prior despite only watching the news and not going into any further research at all about it until the US started seeing a spike in cases. He watches the news everyday (mostly CNN) and keeps track of the number of cases and deaths, minute by minute. I've told him that he should try not to follow the news so much especially at this time. But he won't listen so yeah. That's where the problem lies for me as I have not been paranoid or panicky this whole time and have tried to maintain a calm head in this whole situation, not only for myself but for everyone else in my family. 

I work in a warehouse with 8 to 10 other people and they've taken our temperatures everyday and have strict guidelines. I'm a fit, young healthy male in my 20s who exercises regularly and takes vitamin D every morning. I take precautions such as wearing a mask, hand washing everyday, etc. With that being said, I know I'm not immune to Covid but I think I'll be fine. 

He doesn't seem to understand that and is now saying I'm being ""selfish"" for still continuing to go to work. He doesn't understand that I've been taking precautions and looking at content from reputable sources like everyone else (which he knows I have and I was actually the first person in my family to start thinking about the impact Covid might have by buying the necessary supplies back in Early March and doing the initial research) when I take the bus. He says it's not ""enough"". I even mentioned I could get a coworker friend to drop me off to and from work before I start having enough money to get my own car. Not ""enough"" he says. Not only that but he has not taken into consideration that I can't just ""stay home"" like everyone else. I'm not a white collar office worker or a college/ grade school student so if I ever decide to quit my job because of that then I will not only be further behind financially and job wise but it will take me another 3 months to find another job after this lockdown is over and who knows when it will be. I don't ever want to do after having gone through that ordeal back in December 2019. Again, he's called me selfish and berated me for not caring about my two younger siblings despite me doing the research initially and basically consuming content from reputed sources (the news imo is not a reputable source and only feeds into the paranoia and fear. That's another story). He always seems to frame this into the ""greater good"" whenever I have my own personal interests at stake and says, oh well what about your youngest siblings or your mother or your family"". ""You're the oldest sibling here"". He don't really care about the impact this has for me, honestly. I don't want to quit and feel like quitting would be a ""I told you so"" moment for my parents and I refuse to do so as it will give me the strength to persevere through tough times as I have before. 

He's basically givien me an ultimatum if I decide to go back to work which is I should get my own ""room or hotel or Airbnb"" which is further confirmation he doesn't want me to go back to work. He knows I can't afford one at the moment and is using it as a scare tactic. He has a minor in psychology so I know what he's doing even if he tries to deny it. My mom is not off this too as she berated me also for going to work and said ""I don't go out much at all anyways"" so why should it be a problem for me to be in quarantine, she says. Again, she's said this nonsense before and I know exactly what she's trying to do here just like my dad. She works as a manager in a grocery store with far more people yet she wants me to quit when my little warehouse has a little over 8-10 people at any given time depending on which managers come in and out during the day. 

I'm honestly just tired of the BS and hypocrisy and self righteousness from my parents regarding this situation. I'm an adult and last time I checked, should be able to make decisions regarding my job without them having to play silly mind games and toying with the only stable source of income I have at the moment. I have a second source of income which can earn me enough in the future maybe more than the current job I have but I can't really do much with that one at the moment. Will they pay for my expenses (ie, phone bill, cable bill, credit card/college debt) once I quit my job. The answer to that is a big fat No so I think they should cool it a little bit.  

I can't do it anymore with the people in my personal life anymore especially my parents as I've become persona non grata in their eyes. Everytime I come home, I get stared at with contempt and have to constantly spray down everything from the outside including my shoes and other pieces of clothing. I get no praise or support for having to wake up at 4am every morning and work 10 hour shifts at my warehouse during such a time from my parents/family members. Nope, just beratment and constant guilt for working during this time as if I had a choice to do so. And then my dad has the nerve to ask me what I did with my tax refund for me to justify working during our ""discussion"" as if that has anything to do with anything. But again, I know what he's trying to do here. 

So I'm here to get a non judgmental assessment from people who aren't in my personal life about whether I should quit my ""essential job"" or stay at home like everyone else? I think about this disease everyday and it's impacts and did so way before it was talked about en-mass. I need an honest assessment and what I should do based on my current situation. 

Apologies if this was such a long post/vent but I needed to get this off my chest since last night. 

Thank You. 

Edit- I'm honestly afraid of being locked down at home with my dad and getting constantly lectured for not doing much in my life so far despite taking steps to do so. Also having my every move being watched. I'm afraid of being berated by mom for leaching off of her. I have too much pride for that which get from my dad's side. I also have depression and anxiety and I feel like that will make everything worse. I'm afraid of returning to the person I was 2 years ago.

Update- I've decided to stay at home. I literally could not sleep while trying to make this choice. For my family's sake and for the public's sake, I couldn't risk myself going to work while knowingly or unknowingly having the virus. It's not my preferred choice at all but it's what is needed unfortunately.",5.259204545454544,5.634848694209044,6.110454545454547,79.91332049306627,68.06073446327683,9.17647663071392,29.86209553158705,9.126865294068056,2.382179661016949,5605,195,1102,97,88,1851,472,1416,0.068,0.85,0.08199999999999999,0.9801,22,3,0,0,0,1,123.0,3,5,4,31,62,44,1,7,68,2,111,19,10,6,6,195,208,110,1,34,53,12,5,8,1,19,9,9,7,8,65,65,2,3,28,5,12,18,39,14,1,5,21,23,136,30,194,152,25,162,1,1,8,0,92,68,0,22,77,755,201,46,0.0329495753830306,0.0,0.0643080650808941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02920781051344025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904929058836763,0.027416686254131958,0.0,0.0,0.04481368229909055,0.10365150814652817,0.025206334981064626,0.0,0.09803137489483554,0.0,0.0,0.05422938610892693,0.0,0.03080340511740768,0.0,0.0,0.10134475845456534,0.0,0.08034302130637468,0.07278043458778623,0.11215064720024064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03597240245306454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03364520044945273,0.0,0.06718857615416851,0.0,0.0,0.05676628327537731,0.0,0.10682035631385316,0.0,0.052615109623998485,0.0,0.0,0.04249950054338824,0.0,0.02837942099591849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028834395460960262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11010056894142156,0.0,0.0,0.13618287738945722,0.03674748637897912,0.043525767571290466,0.05960955466548451,0.08328431509121023,0.1574236565075898,0.059225907506764826,0.0,0.15530963617004126,0.037077432833147024,0.06664118135050733,0.07061754971182058,0.0,0.0,0.03011531496820149,0.028026891988507444,0.0,0.0,0.025456760205973747,0.0,0.15493313874655226,0.031608235105243784,0.20598603314782865,0.02763654054927049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06763154059143509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19830666392006013,0.0,0.06489738913151996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034390796131446695,0.2942763242829368,0.029287096541976913,0.0,0.0,0.14486579939739125,0.053716603316827816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06981977858323463,0.1287799854784724,0.09907239209351644,0.0,0.029159337351312632,0.027669344759131992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598229227745675,0.0,0.03310227719619572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03495429250317434,0.0332696782687643,0.07718028891744129,0.026300036713449385,0.03502018411822695,0.12110864566630955,0.09772677057585397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030920944431524013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03509022242511882,0.04465497004250981,0.15035782106115805,0.0,0.0,0.1097598124305107,0.0,0.0,0.11421543416072474,0.14385149150046564,0.0,0.0,0.031147998980925868,0.0,0.031556585113053426,0.0,0.0,0.06305658740841037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2102755755795311,0.0,0.0,0.06332502513740063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09402777469830756,0.13101412421852154,0.03298827305831396,0.033346729381501815,0.02625654558436958,0.0599921118584105,0.034373593159876176,0.0,0.0,0.02725622924835989,0.11111010979085163,0.032973371172314365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996563713992852,0.17559931638902693,0.026313573463589892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037390787674529184,0.0,0.0,0.14864388037672405,0.026483620585147444,0.0,0.030335542097629307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08445102983961716,0.0,0.0,0.13449213665517926,0.03787068982444607,0.0,0.06296946260303593,0.0,0.13422359290887226,0.0,0.0321869473886625,0.06860334000584473,0.039634282211573856,0.028457853912585908,0.0,0.0,0.11660707952983575,0.026153839262557738,0.026430161884518327,0.0,0.029625625354268832,0.0,0.02973186680457971,0.07357404843595937,0.0,0.03176221486090197,0.0,0.4077906162087165,0.0,0.03357843227628544,0.04681286596520648,0.0,0.0,0.021218446252408055
COVID19_support,Mystogyn,2020/04/14,"My work is putting me in an uncomfortable position Hello all. So up to this point I've been pretty calm about everything that's been going on. I worked as a server in a popular chain restaurant and we were basically furloughed around March 17th. The restaurant stayed open for takeout (which we have an entire job code that only does takeout). Originally they were offering hours to those who wanted them and I was happy to take time off work.

Since then I've pretty much isolated in the house. It seems to me that most people (at least in the US) are not taking this very seriously. People are out meeting friends, getting takeout food, and any business that can find a slight reason to be deemed essential is open. It seems more like people are looking for a work around.

Anyway my job called me today saying they had hours to offer me in our takeout position. I was asleep at the time. I had some coworkers that are working tell me our GM is going to report people to unemployment who decline the hours, which would either cut us off, and potentially mean we have to pay the money back. But the kicker is they don't have enough hours to support all the servers that they laid off, so it is my understanding that they picked a few people that they want to come work (because we're good workers) and are saying if we refuse they're gonna screw us. 

Now I feel like I'm an awful position for a variety of reasons. On one hand I understand that I am being offered work. On the other hand I barely consider it essential or life sustaining. In fact I hate that Togo even exist. I prefer not to use single use plastics.

And aside from concern for my own health and safety, my roomate works in a personal care home. I've been extra cautious so as not to put and entire building of elderly people at risk.

Basically I feel like I don't have a choice in the matter and the US is so determined to not let its already failing economy collapse that it'll find any work around it can so long as the numbers are good. And the sad thing is the economy doesn't even exist and is really just an idea, and no one understands that. These places of business will still stand at the end of this, people will still exist to work, and the product will be available.

And to top it off with our push to open the country back up , I feel like we're going to end up exactly where we were before because nothings really changed.

If anyone has any advice on what to do that'd be awesome, though I'm not sure my workplace will leave me much a choice. Am I being too paranoid?",5.675481285150942,6.151527641282566,6.105778007628161,79.95729523563256,67.17635270541082,8.923679617299115,29.92442950416963,8.841846274778883,2.2889858555821325,2019,69,385,31,31,652,240,499,0.084,0.799,0.11800000000000001,0.9671,6,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,12,0,7,13,22,20,3,1,30,1,50,7,3,6,5,70,77,28,0,6,11,0,5,4,1,7,2,2,1,1,33,28,1,1,15,0,2,7,9,7,0,2,10,8,45,13,60,53,14,61,0,2,1,1,33,34,1,7,22,274,78,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06305764325154505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07121009159879275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13164715808051114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045120643196289466,0.0,0.0,0.1723352527681541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923866069782997,0.0,0.07867337149396174,0.0,0.054909993344827726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589200433114863,0.0,0.0657922956590112,0.0,0.06826383081345569,0.055586593830283054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05647034599939649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11430826217317586,0.06667639534690567,0.0,0.08524247224006926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057995103340444415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09788441482413388,0.13830001989309212,0.0,0.0,0.11795789222892948,0.0,0.07802952885786478,0.0,0.04985546025410344,0.0,0.033714087375020234,0.0,0.11002108965173604,0.10824884531785374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06869302989831452,0.0,0.06370968603652545,0.0,0.06859201793106916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06472851691257488,0.0,0.254194891907913,0.07445857120564614,0.0,0.07284613888437015,0.0,0.0,0.1280714737923748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0683275994600766,0.0,0.06598595600030788,0.04557921180781836,0.1261037421022526,0.0,0.0,0.05710672420967456,0.054188667636201435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07029172432290587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09487345949117464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191795536777134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745394410322882,0.049077719180523054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31315721988914097,0.05634481575005775,0.06741976703817627,0.0,0.06100139266048465,0.0,0.0,0.1312997392996695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12974027606324004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08267871345458762,0.13269448909617992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263316164120384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11749076960762872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05337960694815605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878003852844161,0.1030669500237182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07322750081684269,0.060818446985550875,0.0,0.09703655676234947,0.0,0.0564017727686965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04287064306813268,0.0,0.06340006968720127,0.0,0.07525553492330203,0.0,0.061166578572600674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20153297571763665,0.3104849738161653,0.11146582622270013,0.0,0.053243732944096366,0.07612253839856384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4697836574621795,0.0,0.0,0.045840023624870975,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Batgoil123,2020/04/14,"I'm really struggling. (I'm sorry if theres spelling mistakes or grammatical issues. I'm tired and dyslexic. I just need to get this off my chest) 

Im really panicked about how this world is. 

I'm an extrovert to the point of fault. This has been really bad on my mental health. I've been having panic attacks daily almost now. 

I'm dyslexic and online learning in nearly impossible for me. I'm in my last year of highschool and the struggle is so bad right now. I've fail everything I've been assigned so far. 

Everyone keeps telling me everyone is struggling. But my family is okay. My boyfriend acts like everything is fine. 

I feel like such a downer. Everyone around me is okay and I'm here a babbling child, barely pulling through to the next day. 
When will this end? 

I wnat to wake up and for this all to be over. But I know it wont be.

I feel so freaking alone right now. And I am. Even if i had everyone around right now. 

I dont have the words to describe the pain in ny chest, my throat, my mind feels like it on fire. 

I've been told to get therapy. But do they even know how to deal with this? 

I just want know I'm not alone. I'm not crazy.

COVID19_support,nashamagirl99,2020/04/15,"My COVID-19 first world problems rant COVID-19 has caused a lot of changes in a short period of time and its been a struggle. I feel bad complaining when I’m in a very privileged position and most have it much worse than I do, but I need to vent. I am 20 years old and live at home with my parents and immunocompromised 15 year old brother. My dad is a doctor so we all have to social distance from him. 

He is sleeping in the studio apartment attached to our house and we have to try to stay six feet apart at all times. I miss being able to hug him and curl up on the couch and watch tv together. It’s pretty much impossible to social distance and we end up crossing paths much more closely just by moving around the house. Somewhat humorously my mom has been complaining about not knowing “how much longer she can take it” in a sort of wink and nudge way, which is kind of awkward.

I’m completely stuck at home and other than going on walks have not left the house in weeks. I’m in community college and all my classes are online now. I’m worried about registering for next semester and how I will return this semester’s books. I was planning on transferring to four year university and moving out in a year and a half and am worried about having to postpone that.

In addition to my school being closed, so is my work. Unlike many of my coworkers I don’t need the money to survive as I live with my parents, but I still miss having a job and earning my own money. My job was as a childcare assistant and I miss the children so much. I worry that I will never see them again and that they will forget about me. 

One of the things that sucks about staying home is not being able to see anyone outside of my immediate family. I’m a major introvert but that doesn’t mean I enjoy being completely socially isolated. I miss seeing people I care about like my good friend who lives nearby and my 77 year old grandmother who is still working right now. I had also recently started online dating which has obviously had to be put on hold.

Not earning my own money or being able to go out by myself to movies and restaurants has been very infantilizing. I feel completely reliant on my parents and my independence has suffered. None of this has been good for my mental health. I already struggled with anxiety and now get bouts of panic where I feel like I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown. I feel hopeless and depressed and terrified about the state of the world.",5.500995909060425,6.227351047817052,6.039252900543225,79.40005834618738,67.62785862785863,8.95073435718597,30.692844208973238,9.023248300946321,2.4930805579773327,1958,73,371,33,31,635,238,481,0.145,0.77,0.085,-0.9725,5,0,0,0,0,1,31.0,4,0,2,7,23,27,1,4,22,0,42,5,2,4,5,69,71,37,0,3,9,6,4,2,1,3,2,0,5,1,17,36,0,1,6,2,3,7,8,16,0,5,9,8,50,11,67,53,16,71,0,7,4,1,25,33,1,5,29,266,67,12,0.2154185528941321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923990994677732,0.057423379640285974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054931534445834325,0.0,0.0,0.050208553638137185,0.0,0.0,0.06392272782038827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05995516454254489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321119052317271,0.0737647311978896,0.07596142182707118,0.0,0.2258622542000173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061846561317272765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07349667231760146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635989660834015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06769247996944841,0.0,0.14522945726209144,0.051298352410076686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06107830368171,0.0,0.0,0.05547727986572719,0.0,0.03751576760476568,0.0,0.08161821862148988,0.12045524113572101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632661610026352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2160823727080212,0.0,0.0,0.2485640873912793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425131160796159,0.0,0.0,0.07477509111306578,0.039462800996252864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07801762934188451,0.0,0.0,0.07016174915511228,0.0,0.19021852885636195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0610470500767467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07280020045193646,0.0,0.07821798540482694,0.0,0.0,0.14472748955527606,0.0,0.0,0.08409853519745625,0.0,0.1526372200984368,0.2639290379226025,0.10648675160828427,0.05538135604149759,0.0,0.07636669162436965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260455339613784,0.0,0.04865772883901076,0.0,0.0,0.08424908576705327,0.2391968099219579,0.0,0.0,0.049781366950482235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305270422034915,0.0,0.06870882073621397,0.0,0.0721850482207178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708999442316981,0.0,0.0,0.06132208904820428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267169205883951,0.1716606963225598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185804186558366,0.2195920863775165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050824786830557855,0.15307167668976815,0.11468902307249512,0.0,0.0,0.1501348292448446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053989314202232234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04770483817404413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0837415270284543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04875168565664247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849524439572505,0.0,0.056996406793024576,0.0575985897616233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104551514753007,0.21876799712938708,0.07317663637365432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312041421485561
COVID19_support,myworldofwater,2020/04/15,"Self-isolating dilemma - infant at home Hi Everyone - I developed a bit of a scratchy throat, dry cough and tightness in my chest yesterday. No fever or body aches yet, but I'm trying to figure out the best next steps to keep my family safe just in case. I am a new mom with a 7 week old baby and we live in a one bedroom along with my husband. With only one room, it's hard to isolate (unless I move into our garage which is possible, but has no heat). I am breast and formula feeding and my baby girl wants to be cuddling with me all the time. My husband is also an essential worker. So basically if I self isolate, he has to stop working completely (potentially losing his clients as he works for himself), I'll no longer be able to breast feed since I'm sure the supply I have left will dwindle and I would imagine this will be traumatic for our new baby at such an important stage in her life. Any thoughts on how to handle this?

I have been quarantined for 6 weeks now with our little one, but I went to a doctor's appointment last week and my husband could possibly be a carrier since he is still working. We have been extremely careful and vigilant, but I'm worried I may have contracted COVID-19 even so and I'm just not sure where to go from here.",6.76360711002145,5.8113798565737085,7.265896414342631,77.35880784554094,65.17529880478088,10.910327919092861,35.243947287771995,10.214889679676881,3.3824891817345994,988,40,198,20,13,326,155,251,0.11800000000000001,0.794,0.087,-0.6101,0,1,0,0,0,0,26.0,5,0,0,6,13,6,0,0,12,0,22,12,5,1,3,43,32,20,0,4,10,4,2,0,0,4,4,0,3,3,4,18,2,4,3,0,0,5,4,1,0,3,4,2,25,5,31,19,3,33,0,1,0,3,19,13,0,3,14,130,29,5,0.12406615192407372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09921565686981566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436923771800002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13019977217101336,0.0,0.13544810504945992,0.13780952607577768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649371046217353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13008099983507232,0.0,0.0,0.09905672695670996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12698696362727896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194452325010451,0.0,0.0,0.1185505249015894,0.0,0.0,0.11695852642925733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050965324404418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111389030482412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244484661155568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102756963254596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10113047270683506,0.0,0.0,0.13479823707816735,0.0,0.08763159217598437,0.0,0.1243468775755037,0.10955268514622933,0.0,0.0,0.1387982891104204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453047776650051,0.0,0.13186268510939927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396477252667936,0.13194576007105865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301865562711923,0.0,0.2522113062030034,0.09435789917317874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27973189002504323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588561085582799,0.0,0.0,0.2052576058716647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09907938918934707,0.1037248583230656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338617598516837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849466630406448,0.07234397090049209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423277324034675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0731774308479749,0.0,0.2985551505557137,0.0,0.0,0.11501056579920388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27096490866439066,0.12599519959322494,0.0,0.08813303469506524,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,etto34,2020/04/15,"Corona relapse I'm writing here because maybe someone else who has had this disease might be able to illuminate something about my present condition. 

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland in student accommodation...beginning on  Friday, the 31st of January, I started to feel very tired. By the next day, I had the usual symptoms of a cold: congestion, a mild cough with yellow phlegm, and a bit of a headache. I was not concerned at this stage, and I kept functioning largely as usual, even though I was a bit knackered. There were no documented Corona cases in the area at this time, but I live in student accommodation surrounded by students recently returned from China. I presumed I did not have Corona, because no cases were reported, I had no fever, and my cough was not 'persistent'.

These cold-like symptoms continued, but by following Friday, began to improve. My cough had disappeared. On Saturday, I was feeling mostly better, went out for a walk, did laundry that I'd been putting off whilst I was sick, and cleaned my room. That night I got hit like truck by new symptoms. My heart start racing, I had horrible aches and pains. I had night sweats where the whole bed became wet. I felt tightness in my upper chest. However, somehow, I was able to sleep. On Sunday, my symptoms lessened in the morning, but by night, they came back with a vengeance. I was up the whole night, my heart racing, with shortness of breath, nightsweats and aches and pains. I still had no fever. That morning on 10 February, as soon as I could I rushed to my GP, who conveniently has his surgery across the street from my flat. I had never experienced anything like this before, and I wanted to know what was going on. He took my blood pressure, it was high, but he said that was nothing to worry about. My heart rate was only slightly elevated. He said my lungs sounded fine, even though I was winded just by holding my breath as he used his stethoscope. Because I have a history of anxiety, he presumed I was having a panic attack or something like that related to my health, and that I'd just suffered a minor viral infection. He prescribed Propranolol. I never agreed with this anxiety diagnosis. As an 'anxiety-prone' person, I know the difference between anxiety and physical symptoms. However, because he said I was not 'in danger' of dying or anything like that, I went home. I rested, and my shortness of breath eased up a bit. My heart (combined with the upper chest area) still felt really odd, but not as bad as before. I took the Propranolol for two days, but it did nothing but give me cold feet, and I was certain it wasn't going to help. As the week went on, I rested, but was completely knackered, with horrible aches and pains and nightsweats. The shortness of breath did not return, but my upper chest was always achey and tight. On Thursday and Friday, I had stomach cramps. I also started to feel this strange 'bubbling' inside my chest, and a 'buzzing' inside my legs. This is one of the strangest symptoms I had. The buzzing is so bizarre...my legs are not shaking, or anything, but I just feel this internal 'buzzing'. In any case, I was continued on, still no fever, no cough. That weekend on Saturday-Sunday I had what felt like a relapse. Again, my heart started racing badly, I felt tightness in my chest. I didn't sleep at all Sunday-Monday, and again went to the doctor. I tried to explain that I'd never experienced an illness like this before. A cold never lasts this long, and a flu normally has a fever, and certainly it doesn't mess with your heart beat. He took my blood pressure and listened to my lungs. My BP was higher again, but not at a 'dangerous' level, and he said that was likely just a normal variation. My lungs he said sounded fine, and my heart rate was slightly elevated, but he said when he exercises at his age his heart beats faster than that. He tried to pinpoint where the pain in my chest was. He pushed under my breast area, and I found it very sore. He said this was an indication of muscleoskeletal pain, rather than a heart or lung issue. He said I just needed to go home and rest. So, I did. I rested for another week, and was able to sleep until the weekend again, though symptoms continued, when I had yet another relapse, though this time milder. I went to the GP again on Monday, and said, this is not getting better, it's clearly not normal...what's going on? And he said, I'll do a blood test and a ECG. I had those done. My ECG was normal, and this was a relief. Clearly whatever strange pain I was having, and my sometimes racing heart, were not going to kill me. My blood test showed slightly lower white blood count, and this was put down to the infection that I had had, but everything else was normal, except for slightly elevated bilirubin, which the doctor put down to gilbert's syndrome, because my other liver markers were fine. He ordered a followup blood test in a week's time. I continued to be extremely tired, aching allover, with strange pain in my chest, and buzzing inside me. But, the symptoms began to get milder. I thought I was getting better. When I had my next blood test, my white blood cell count had recovered. However, I continued to have bad and good days. By the 8th of March, however, I made close to a full recovery. I still had aches and pains, particularly in my upper chest, but by and large, I started getting back to normal.

Unfortunately, as I was getting better, the world itself started to get sick. Everything went into lockdown, etc. We all know what happened. I haven't exactly been enjoying these weeks on lockdown, but I was happy I wasn't sick anymore. I started to wonder, however, whether I had had an early case of Corona. In the early days, a fever and a persistent cough were required in order to be considered for corona, but we increasingly learned that for some people this was not the case. I had never experienced a sickness like that before, and I came to be certain that I had probably had a 'mild' case, the shortness of breath being the biggest hint. I was probably exposed from Chinese students returning after Christmas break. However, I was not able to be certain, and I took all precautions, staying inside and washing my hands.

However, starting this past Sunday, it seems like my symptoms have come back. On Sunday, I started to have a headache, and a bit of congestion. Then, on Monday, I had horrible headache and nausea. More importantly, the tightness and pain in my upper left chest returned. I had trouble sleeping again. While my headache somewhat recovered on Tuesday, on Tuesday into Wednesday I had the peak symptom of my previous illness...I couldn't sleep, with tightness and pain in my upper chest, and real shortness of breath. I could still breath, but it was painful, and I needed to focus on my breathing. I made it through that night, and here we are today. I still have no fever, no cough, but the tightness in my chest is bad. The shortness of breath comes and goes, but isn't as bad as it was last night. The buzzing in my legs and bubbling in my chest, which had been gone while I had been feeling better, came back. WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?

Did I have Corona, and am I now relapsing? That's the best explanation I can come up with. I did not expect this, but I don't know what to do. I can call the doctor, but because I don't have a fever and a cough, I don't think he'll take me seriously, and in any case, only hospitalised people get tested in the UK now....I have no idea what to do. I am sorry for the long post, but I am hoping that maybe some other sufferers who have been tested can shared some information, so that I can figure out what to do....",5.487004019433087,6.664028144636681,5.707822166299678,80.13733284401108,67.89965397923876,8.412778302051658,31.8277935059942,8.666027191798058,2.5610292195309503,6019,249,1098,93,99,1911,442,1445,0.128,0.778,0.094,-0.9941,9,2,2,0,0,1,248.0,3,1,1,11,47,57,4,4,74,0,135,112,57,3,15,199,222,106,2,14,49,0,17,9,0,2,55,13,5,1,65,76,0,9,25,4,0,33,38,29,0,2,122,39,152,28,158,88,23,225,0,2,3,1,51,85,0,14,110,759,217,16,0.12163901065491695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024318668218443248,0.025303350290717272,0.0,0.0,0.04135934921237643,0.06377455428619902,0.06979013265779871,0.0,0.030158303298121508,0.0,0.0,0.07507390609019722,0.0,0.0,0.034595483749425886,0.0,0.09353289086559556,0.12695436628998288,0.1112250178241385,0.0,0.10350583893086852,0.0,0.03191315928793747,0.13447477504365307,0.1327982954076181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03105175748384239,0.10434196739028076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858592776885001,0.03188404709816413,0.0,0.0,0.048559426075785436,0.0,0.0,0.07844709892814357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03156052218417954,0.03177171914767442,0.0,0.09337701126863654,0.0,0.03111973501560918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050806892512624366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0339149126751427,0.040170709666370485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054660649723977384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768804232880701,0.0,0.1167925257728714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03334272418747794,0.0,0.0,0.11121488455380336,0.029171805721736107,0.10369537939093484,0.025506257753393248,0.02432145718895811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026891243850785337,0.03237174717759286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03232414505740077,0.0,0.360357033237696,0.020383016200422658,0.03212957330050718,0.061006922762794916,0.030203745941925562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03432890926953431,0.0,0.031739881079154576,0.0,0.0,0.033643885742720724,0.0,0.06684961912099299,0.04957601431312122,0.0,0.0,0.033040285246877264,0.0,0.0,0.1337100218600341,0.0,0.05370473746913727,0.05382334833658183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05754888649495899,0.0,0.0,0.06110136779856309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225994196285178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045096892559156714,0.11726937978026945,0.029369928617792668,0.06468223389799653,0.1712249571706151,0.1787706060516757,0.05835795567282592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02060643541552769,0.04625597443340533,0.35593932969306713,0.0356792926036482,0.0,0.0,0.029029549852766387,0.04216458710417083,0.026552623067128318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029124137019807976,0.0,0.06557371341210345,0.0,0.0,0.0917106019712786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034612956073441926,0.019481266242604812,0.0,0.03002596209553592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2892663854649646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027683896714623516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521585711170997,0.0,0.025766084748600454,0.046821826573267125,0.030076022959790418,0.034041228423924624,0.1937176150817299,0.032412750193195936,0.14571160655479848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31607376703950424,0.02286434946271013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019485341614922557,0.11950971037346578,0.02414194681266616,0.05319651398092031,0.06990307446324902,0.02882488980616622,0.0,0.13514541651725093,0.041292451820163285,0.0,0.029705909642580214,0.0,0.0,0.026264262551558268,0.06698409260320387,0.0501824614290263,0.017936460010591092,0.0,0.09757147719535816,0.0,0.0,0.16914087228931166,0.0,0.06790280570835609,0.0,0.0,0.032978079570614466,0.0,0.03088257995453885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,wanderer_idn,2020/04/15,"Preparing to Face OVID-19 At Home I made this thread with the assumption that I might have COVID-19 at one point and have to self-isolate at home. I think most of those who contract this disease face mild symptoms and can be self-""medicated"" at home.

What drugs should I prepare? What vitamins should I consume? Are there drugs that are instead counter productive? Anti-biotics? Anti-inflammations?

COVID19_support,probablyoverthinkin0,2020/04/15,"Paranoid... COVID-19 is worrying me and I have no idea how to deal with the stress. I found out yesterday that my dad (60s) is at very high risk if he gets the virus, and he's started to acknowledge this. My mom is kind of the opposite. She really doesn't believe it's anything to worry about, etc. I promise any level of trying to convince her that it's dangerous does next to nothing.

I've been taking my temp everyday because, like the title says I'm paranoid (I don't want to actually get it by accident and give it to my parents). It's been around 97.9-98.8 F depending on the day. 

If anyone has any thoughts on how to reduce stress/paranoia or just any words of encouragement to get through this that would be greatly appreciated!",4.72496551724138,5.759199324137932,5.689827586206897,80.09543103448277,69.55172413793103,9.110344827586207,32.43103448275862,9.3871,2.905537931034482,582,26,114,12,10,192,97,145,0.147,0.767,0.086,-0.802,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,0,5,9,1,2,5,0,11,0,0,3,0,20,21,8,0,4,4,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,10,6,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,4,1,11,6,21,15,1,12,0,0,0,0,11,7,0,4,6,69,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.1533889122220994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32067153498759937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990670914850442,0.0,0.12934904098353694,0.13992708702921092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581790889929252,0.0,0.0,0.1770925443899745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137067800333527,0.16204980448952708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13755277969489307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17530171232729785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17234414547101884,0.0,0.0,0.2463664610817204,0.15078521780914736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17329591749172732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16607352847623516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17744160614302662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636829503145502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07679216387428434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18409200381230129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16716696970569264,0.0,0.0,0.15082228952435134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17453423312964472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069609682750684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12499902756726282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112556458801849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36010748722980906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818280797168387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247865402371148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10671761976218347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12969326357361574,0.09271119707913243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3192559685452627,0.0,0.11165900543531217,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,__babybummer,2020/04/15,"Fearing my health with a Roommate Hey, I’m seeking some advice or validation on my situation.
My city is currently on lockdown. We are not allowed in parks or to cross provincial borders, no gathering of more than 5, everyone has to be at least 6ft apart. Washing hands, not leaving the house unless necessary (groceries, medication, doctors...)
I have two autoimmune diseases (so I’m on immune suppressants) as well as just finished cancer treatments under a year ago. So I’m very susceptible to getting sick with this virus. To make matters worse, I have lung problems due to improper intubation as a child. My doctor gave me a phone call when this all started to stay completely isolated (getting grocery delivery etc.) for these reasons. 
So here’s the problem. My roommate. She doesn’t follow the isolation/social distancing guidelines. She goes to the store every day to get beer, goes shopping at Walmart’s for unnecessary things, last night she even went out to a house party. She comes home casually and doesn’t wash her hands AT ALL (haven’t seen her wash her hands ONCE) doesn’t clean/disinfect anything. She just walks into my room to talk to me (standing les than a foot away). She seems to not really care about the guidelines set out, or about my health and safety. It’s causing me a lot of anxiety and I’m really scared for my health. I’ve been feeling like I’m simply disposable, and that no one really cares that if I catch this virus I will not fare well. I don’t know how to address this situation. Any suggestions would be helpful.

COVID19_support,Sarithus,2020/04/16,"My girlfriend had COVID19. We've been apart for weeks. When can I see her safely? Hello, everyone. I'll try to keep things simple so as not to over complicate things:

- Girlfriend went on holiday and 12 days later (24th March) she developed a fever, aches and an occasional tightness in the chest. She never coughed continuously, however. This sounds like corona, but we're not sure as testing isn't available yet.
- I last seen her on 18th of March but, strangely, have had no symptoms. 
- Girlfriend started to feel better on the 2nd of April and has been feeling normal since then. 
- We've been been isolating from others completely 

We want to try living together for a least 2 weeks. When, in your opinion, would it be safe to do so? The original guidelines in the UK were that you could leave self isolation 2 weeks after your first had symptoms, which would mean I could have seen her on the 7th of April. However, the WHO have also said you could still be contagious for another 2 weeks which would take us to the 21st of April.

I think I would be comfortable seeing her on a date past the 21st, say, the 25th or even pushing it to May the 1st to be extremely safe. Having said this, though, we've also read that the virus could be reactivating in people within 57 days.

When do you think I could live with her? Thank you very much for any thoughts on our situation.",4.6487837837837835,6.387357305019307,4.6774884169884166,84.59268050193052,70.54440154440155,8.114362934362935,26.8496138996139,8.697196308434329,1.873792123552123,1078,36,209,19,20,334,153,259,0.064,0.8170000000000001,0.11900000000000001,0.9431,2,1,0,0,0,0,38.0,3,6,0,2,12,8,0,0,15,0,32,5,1,1,2,37,50,17,0,11,5,0,3,1,3,5,4,4,0,1,12,5,0,5,6,2,0,2,5,0,0,1,14,11,23,8,33,21,2,42,0,0,4,0,25,13,0,3,28,140,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17404833207939469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07400205555709657,0.11410837451001568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09624338838320604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140968158192088,0.0,0.0,0.4344238261376795,0.0,0.0,0.140361168241892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718752868483043,0.0,0.0,0.10398319064365186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100463999315422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925631419522231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09672516223686488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870369179796417,0.0,0.1152257948835168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05316447539624193,0.0,0.19218198746130746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185380413309018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07999600358861689,0.0,0.0839295136205759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10662153840219796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10388201951490468,0.07544282433948872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885051311935152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20702750440350895,0.08653887832270496,0.0,0.0,0.17343259874106698,0.0,0.11352410336366466,0.0,0.0,0.09001790915784769,0.12231943602731005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702410961844013,0.0,0.0869046427545116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256256553526036,0.2262135059088299,0.08181989762595329,0.0,0.0,0.10018781570685452,0.0,0.0,0.144591759807965,0.13945628837941307,0.10691614344868916,0.08639176985660989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477647193138163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308983419220632,0.0,0.0,0.08978877495372667,0.064185483353989,0.0,0.34915877612688384,0.0,0.0,0.10087821711004967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3092134482342621,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,product_of_boredom,2020/04/16,"Help! My energy level is decreasing every day. Hey there, I'm having some trouble with this whole thing and I'd love some suggestions. 
First off, I don't have it that bad- I'm employed,  working from home and not high risk. I rent a basement unit with no windows but a decent amount of space. 

However, it is getting harder and harder just to get out of bed as my energy level keeps going down. I'm also finding to very hard to concentrate for very long, and video games have stopped being fun. The other day, I sort of ""woke up"" and realized that I had been sitting on my bed zoning out for an hour and a half. 

The main thing I really look forward to right now is my weekly grocery trip, because it means I can go outside and see the sun and move around for a little bit. Its very hard going back in, though. 

Anyway, sorry for complaining- what's a good way to try to keep myself energized when I'm inside and alone for days on end?",3.1004432624113463,4.638569292553194,4.2990638297872374,86.5636666666667,74.15957446808511,7.14099290780142,23.171631205673762,7.793537801064563,1.0727541843971629,729,20,147,10,15,239,127,188,0.094,0.787,0.11900000000000001,0.8325,3,1,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,2,9,8,0,1,9,0,11,1,0,0,0,26,27,14,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,11,14,0,3,3,2,1,6,3,4,0,2,3,4,11,4,27,23,6,35,0,0,2,1,6,16,0,3,13,95,22,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873866118567464,0.0,0.11484641841695264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12784507619720328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11042871903600683,0.11990997319286414,0.0875445071026847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15678704588636494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27785346630119817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1271975546450706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12099925536766247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312587135641671,0.12215624480427102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15006262503391102,0.0,0.2448539291391817,0.12045488362620385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2572961841824504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626005775176112,0.15173390194244812,0.1440544875856522,0.0,0.1414288347983563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552977858733007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393689445221547,0.0,0.12709204978125588,0.12059786198756102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961538496135086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1564355065098205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15263676707324386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200148766754593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12264381409015625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144401245572988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16076181178524154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12006601432716045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19081878634693344,0.0,0.14109800420763433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975030819246052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3554846781103547,0.0,0.11399247525692904,0.11519683761958477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16033760496293567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045512044455334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,PeppaPigsDiarrhea69,2020/04/16,"Feeling down as I just found out two of my close, pro-quarantine friends have been going out with their SO as usual This one is gonna be a very mild post, just venting. I haven't seen my girlfriend in over 40 days, sometimes I catch myself crying in the shower thinking of how awesome it'll be when I finally see her, anxiously waiting. So to me, finding out I'm actually one of the few in my inner circle actually following quarantine makes me kinda demotivated, I feel dumb. I love my friends to death but jesus, I kind of want to punch them. Not only because they are putting lives at danger but because I'm deeply envious they are not experiencing the longing I am. Anybody feeling this as well? Feeling stupid for going through such hoops when other people probably aren't going to do that as well, even people that advocate for quarantine?",5.6643308865048,6.865774857142861,6.462281197063806,74.8002089215133,67.50931677018633,9.084359119141727,33.891022021456806,9.339509955726095,3.2353055900621133,676,31,118,13,11,223,106,161,0.12,0.7509999999999999,0.129,-0.6365,1,3,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,4,0,11,10,4,0,4,0,12,1,0,2,0,23,31,11,1,1,6,0,4,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,6,5,0,1,7,0,0,6,4,4,2,3,3,7,20,6,25,24,1,24,1,0,2,1,9,11,1,1,6,85,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.3046500961829657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17634158229641278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19030668344497487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17146172781440813,0.10066759831744593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309849363645864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3157028948490368,0.0,0.0,0.1709931461604142,0.1426669203948522,0.0,0.0,0.17114881295426632,0.2411953908269812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26613513928573823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16254768951172896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13783369973283818,0.13813811560858474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14088076369260816,0.0,0.10419383459608972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2115464195880441,0.1187163812981628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21643159662088352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14949472788217827,0.0,0.16829553500759803,0.0,0.0,0.15691739897485954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12438656220877553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543807758181485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001861481536654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15248097739307315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17191528609654608,0.1287937460719936,0.09206817721772162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28069417427830423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,pathetic_slug_,2020/04/17,"Bosses pressuring me to go into work when I am not essential: I work for a small law firm in NJ. I am their only employee. Once the state of emergency was put into action, I was told I could work from home. I transferred all calls to my personal phone and forwarded office mail to my own home. Now that business is slow because deadlines have changed and people probably have more to worry about, my bosses have asked me numerous times in the past two weeks to go into the office and prepare advertisement mailers.

I have expressed every time that I do not feel comfortable and even though they have said it is okay, they continue to find ways to make going in seem safer and keep asking. (i.e. I wouldn't have to go to the post office, just prep the mail. I would be in the office alone. etc. etc.)

Note: I know them. I know if I agreed to go in under the conditions they are presenting, they would pressure me in the next few days to just go to the post office and keep pushing me to do other things they said I wouldn't have to do. This isn't the first time they have asked too much of me considering they pay me $13/hr with no benefits, and no real sick days or PTO. They ask me to try to keep my hours down to about 25-30 a week while also expecting me to complete full-time hour work in impossible time-frames.

I have anxiety and can't even go to the grocery at this time. I feel uncomfortable going anywhere. Obviously, I do not want to tell them this personal info and I shouldn't have to. I also have concerns about going out, even to an empty office, because our area has a fair amount of cases and my father had a really bad respiratory issue last year that almost killed him, so I am afraid he is at risk. It may be unreasonable, but I am very uncomfortable and mentally, I cannot handle it right now.

I am not attached to this job at all, I almost quit a month or so ago, but finding a new job now is difficult. I'm just so tired of the pressure and manipulation on top of my own anxiety. It's taking a serious toll on me. I get sick every time I see them text/email or call me because I know it is just them asking me to come in once again. How many times can I say no? I don't care what they do to try and twist it into a good idea. Why even ask if I'm comfortable coming in if ""no"" is unacceptable? If it's so important and safe, how come they won't go into the office? I just want to quit, but then I won't be able to get unemployment and I don't think I could handle that financially with no job prospect in sight. I don't even know how to respond when they ask anymore.",4.0154253611557005,4.502087797752811,5.364405564472982,83.77708988764047,70.83520599250936,8.724579989299091,25.744034242910647,8.841846274778883,1.6222676939539866,2020,56,438,35,35,679,236,534,0.145,0.809,0.046,-0.992,6,1,0,0,0,0,59.0,1,0,16,8,31,16,1,5,22,1,52,3,0,7,3,87,96,39,1,14,19,1,2,0,0,8,3,3,2,2,18,26,0,4,13,0,1,17,20,9,0,2,6,7,69,7,63,77,10,79,0,0,2,0,42,28,0,11,32,298,87,12,0.06382483138708016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0565768620546833,0.0,0.12782269831273668,0.06610327675499175,0.0,0.10208138920194312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09765164262974113,0.0,0.06329708249218552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4176732113960089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05329106824322388,0.11672107443869068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034457778031147,0.0,0.0650736693011577,0.0,0.06751820873690056,0.16493832240952588,0.06691912139112055,0.0,0.0,0.10191786877757238,0.0,0.0,0.08232347229621223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14236311665765958,0.21077849592422745,0.0,0.10755034637204146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06454350494183439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666947920695675,0.054289368972920166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06669168025396045,0.0,0.3627312252109416,0.05353324041886803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128043019679809,0.0,0.1257092047660863,0.0,0.0,0.07205046585083624,0.0,0.06661654175633099,0.1900088904559012,0.17019132813209145,0.07061271949431266,0.0,0.14030583266719254,0.05202575616723877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04260357055881404,0.06470836132309357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643204182776254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050944371488757335,0.0,0.046918594848725986,0.0,0.0,0.061642419871339976,0.06787843225708498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13594272482016753,0.0,0.048541660326926486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060928023489173526,0.04424810178807178,0.1114587618573766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225309131175995,0.0,0.06881396320832442,0.0,0.0,0.06416158408073304,0.0,0.13577112906788946,0.0,0.07264663115234052,0.04088782131477516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054506057271612535,0.12142406077687184,0.05075606766015937,0.0,0.0,0.05086012718672661,0.058103729401773614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047988330104812835,0.0,0.05578571582562649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04240238194761242,0.040896374819103035,0.06270757278143732,0.0,0.26051740713252963,0.07335725466746107,0.0,0.060987361543415435,0.0,0.08666574187972548,0.0,0.062347586154454814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05266217017142087,0.07529107839292061,0.05066118035369992,0.10239285976846838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05759198300936914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18586094959946967,0.06481721440462203,0.0,0.09067865798701764,0.0,0.0,0.041101098833984606
COVID19_support,cathb0t,2020/04/17,"He's gone My brother who lived with my mother in NYC died last night at home from what we suspect was COVID-19. He was 36 years old. He had not been tested. He hadn't been feeling well for a few days and had quarantined himself from my mother. She thinks he was having shortness of breath but no fever. She went to check on him last night and found him. I will never forget the first thing she said when she called me. I keep hearing it over and over in my mind. I live in a different state (several hours away) and was advised to not go there as she needs to quarantine. I'm stuck in a horrible nightmare I can't wake up from.

She is alone in the house and is afraid. She has lost her son and scared she will get sick. I cannot figure out how/if she can get tested since she had some contact with him. These NYC COVID-19 website are useless for real information. Luckily, she has no symptoms so far. But she is in a bad state. She has no one to provide any emotional support in person. Our relatives are calling her but it is not the same.  We have no way to give my brother a service until this pandemic is over. No closure. I won't be able to help her settle his estate from here as I don't have any notion of what his financial affairs look like. I don't even know where he was working to notify his employer. I'm not sure what I need to do since he had no will.  Probate, death certificates, court - no one expects to die at 36. Just going to be stuck in an NY Pause until who knows when.  I know all of this can wait but I've been keeping busy with it because thinking about the here-and-now is a nightmare.  My feelings are a jumble of grief, sadness, anger, guilt, immense helplessness.

Until today, this seemed to be something that was happening to other people in other places. I'm just scared of the world now.",2.4944565217391315,4.314944532608699,3.4205434782608712,91.02173913043482,76.5,6.339130434782609,24.27173913043478,7.1686216300943375,0.8798380434782609,1420,47,300,16,32,453,197,368,0.22899999999999998,0.726,0.045,-0.9974,2,3,1,0,0,0,45.0,3,0,0,3,12,15,1,4,13,0,43,5,2,0,3,48,75,18,4,3,10,5,2,1,0,4,3,2,1,1,16,12,0,3,12,0,1,4,18,11,1,3,21,5,43,4,50,47,4,47,0,5,1,0,51,23,0,2,18,205,59,7,0.11385097158718308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11791527090780082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15484512959090924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10696673555096582,0.0,0.09506080571703768,0.06940249555303361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325091425844894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07342445801785209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363186675144132,0.11895003336453468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128067019113745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751974929792485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11513294414683715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09684157827126216,0.0,0.1248317138940618,0.0,0.0,0.11896486725748183,0.1092162261593649,0.12940826169933195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10067803817593826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12831831941533325,0.0,0.07631190637940648,0.0,0.11420180734276092,0.0,0.11212027348158593,0.1313687352875607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20239194936569266,0.0,0.0,0.1877085495725511,0.18560747466062325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05562183388279097,0.0,0.20106498751595084,0.0,0.09560614203332914,0.0,0.12428178453175052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149570260393267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16883810566294688,0.08780888797780005,0.0,0.0,0.21368284871648707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11946744288591656,0.0,0.15429672966755803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892992852434402,0.09941027695323858,0.11895003336453468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295873308159485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10829834558956956,0.0,0.22796936804269666,0.0,0.0,0.10364564858952037,0.0,0.12861919150286005,0.0,0.18835740040079105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764804018302938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291967333620818,0.10730319335001597,0.11833475223752618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563752660886358,0.14590221098464215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10791740881995926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036960191938412,0.0,0.0,0.10236569640889744,0.10554099128539383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08288486327399654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07331629295141734

Now I'm feeling ill (fatigue, mild chest pain, nausea, foggy brain) and I don't know how to confront them.

COVID19_support,lam378,2020/04/17,"My brother had a stroke. He’s 38, and he had a stroke on Easter Sunday. They actually found he had another stroke earlier last week, but didn’t realize it, and had another one in the past that they can’t date. So, three strokes all together. He suddenly got confused on Sunday, couldn’t answer questions, and was taken away in an ambulance by EMTs and police (after much arguing, because he didn’t think anything was wrong with him).

He’s a smoker, drinker, and drug user. They found cocaine in his system. My sister and I have been begging and fighting my parents to get him into treatment for 12 years. They did nothing, and here we are with a disaster on our hands in the middle of a pandemic. In central New Jersey, no less. 

He lives with my mother (70, cancer survivor with COPD) and his girlfriend, who is not a drug user but is just a complete airheaded idiot. My parents are divorced but we’re all very close. 

We obviously haven’t been able to visit him in the hospital, but we’ve been able to text and call him. He’s improved since Sunday; he remembers some things, but not others. He can pretty much answer questions, even if the answer is jumbled. 

He’s confusing words and having trouble with his short term memory. For instance, he insists he hasn’t seen a single doctor or therapist, but that’s not true. He can’t understand that he had a stroke or that his addictions brought it on, so nothing is going to stop him from going back to those behaviors except sheer force. Communication with the hospital has been horrendous, of course, because they’re a mess over there. 

He has no physical aftereffects, thank God. Just mixing up some words and unable to comprehend some very important information. He’s going to be released within a day or two and he’ll have to start speech therapy remotely. They can’t put him into inpatient therapy because those places are full, plus they’re full of Covid. We can’t send him straight to a detox because they’re all full. He has to come home.

He was in the ER for 6 hours Sunday night, not with suspected Covid patients, but the hospital has warned us that Covid is “all over the hospital” and he’ll need to self-isolate for 14 days when he’s home. He was tested for Covid upon arrival (negative) but will not be tested again upon discharge. 

I’m terrified for my mother, who will have to be the one to pick him up because the girlfriend doesn’t drive. I’m terrified he’ll come home and freak out when they try to stop him from smoking and drinking and drugging. I’m terrified my father will insist on going over there and thereby expose himself, and my mom will just allow it because she won’t be able to control my brother. 

I’m angry as hell at my brother and my parents. So so so angry, and it’s eating me up, although I’m trying to be patient with them all. My sister and I have husbands and 5 young children among us. We’ve self-isolated with our families and been responsible human beings for 5 weeks. We want to help, but doing so will risk our families. This is a nightmare on top of a disaster.",5.624640662570133,6.363397233502539,6.2687581262801695,77.81963732300295,67.35871404399323,9.266737910766764,31.96549113901505,9.345792617884785,2.8763813874788493,2419,97,443,45,38,791,266,591,0.168,0.774,0.057999999999999996,-0.9977,3,0,7,0,3,0,75.0,9,0,7,2,17,13,4,3,25,0,57,15,1,3,7,101,84,48,0,4,22,13,6,0,2,9,12,1,3,2,16,44,2,3,13,1,0,11,19,11,1,4,23,8,46,2,72,45,16,75,1,0,1,0,84,37,1,11,26,298,62,3,0.2470512059180585,0.0,0.0803621131370434,0.08977409352609605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17270315346436407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06776736411453241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737091346280361,0.06332237593004318,0.0,0.3012002441625167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08408896774102202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14187515899310282,0.08634282968639842,0.0,0.09236297820917727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10621839318721167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08428912590435672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067204280776805,0.2865009652981149,0.08426502001844842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054391663837820896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15526525996351906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1805859304458078,0.0,0.0,0.0430246861432308,0.0,0.18720652482734293,0.0,0.06586313930994525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055197738570318726,0.0,0.2478125028598971,0.0,0.08109855771784681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06712656876947634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07271691367118598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09644779550016094,0.0,0.0,0.1210740416172354,0.06106177960459226,0.0,0.07953453138305537,0.0,0.07728027368214567,0.0,0.15803486339083125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11160552724369313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743211276329301,0.0,0.0786127768251397,0.0,0.0,0.08603864267186116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377996431014051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08278489931619679,0.18450259396854046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328695218359928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17181885842566638,0.0,0.0,0.06812110349737913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0582880383714601,0.0,0.0,0.13769724691214402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07581718601101273,0.18834972312892645,0.09561516384696618,0.0547099478697894,0.0527668124206046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118210346341967,0.0,0.08044437674590339,0.08572967269647634,0.198114788071165,0.0,0.0,0.13589541211849987,0.048572400708833945,0.0,0.13211305032563134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900372369744538,0.0,0.05303095890642473
COVID19_support,Itsallsotiresome44,2020/04/17,Losing my will to keep going The lockdown has taken everything that made my life tolerable away from me. I've lost the motivation to really do anything. I stopped doing online assignments so I'm probably going to fail this semester. If my school ends up going online only in the fall I don't even know if I'd wanna continue my education. I just stay up all night reading r/covid19 in hopes some good news will come but it doesn't seem to matter. Lockdowns seem to be tightening and even if they do lift them it sounds like they're going to keep social distancing policies in place until they find a vaccine (which they might never find anyways). A life thats nothing but going to work then going home where I don't get to see friends or meet new people doesn't sound like a life worth living to me. My life was finally getting better but all that progress has been done away. I'm legitimately suicidal and I don't know what to do. I talk to my dad about it sometimes and he's great and tries to help me think it through but the feelings just remain. I just want my old life back.,3.7411356209150313,5.36274994907408,4.716220043572986,83.88019607843138,72.6574074074074,7.674945533769064,26.1318082788671,8.313332769828598,1.6713216775599131,863,29,170,14,17,281,130,216,0.065,0.773,0.162,0.9723,0,2,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,4,7,10,10,0,0,7,0,18,5,0,2,3,39,43,15,1,6,11,1,1,2,1,3,5,2,1,0,10,5,0,3,9,1,1,8,6,3,0,0,6,4,21,7,24,33,3,29,0,3,1,0,11,9,0,9,13,106,31,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329977973338163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.213043233366726,0.08718007264503416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10027292473255604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976644234038933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11602424491523802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10041855190416726,0.0,0.0,0.14976914984694162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10189612166716326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057326921686756536,0.0,0.0,0.12419918675243767,0.20724942358675047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08759494769762434,0.0,0.11846982076732375,0.0,0.38660927186551214,0.09509542079861943,0.0,0.12499876928140735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07599435093399391,0.0,0.11372658129327205,0.11260914704980167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015497391696952,0.0,0.0,0.1246182941065226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.400408365909748,0.11078075137228686,0.0,0.10011414959192842,0.0,0.0,0.12684009214887446,0.12376461284365994,0.0,0.0,0.10728025315673867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202752981467188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08744349033730163,0.10950041153578663,0.0,0.10639682694598768,0.0,0.10878848644341542,0.0,0.11897030503629558,0.0,0.0,0.08622847372836716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07860147874765631,0.0,0.11845504860240448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1222398034737666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340788694656358,0.0,0.07263234100988354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147437848502825,0.0903469537590032,0.2064286994098465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557378304299235,0.0,0.0,0.11213295525211707,0.0,0.0,0.12084501570805475,0.0,0.09478842046359814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401626091318407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112830310022484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264753529080133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697568023523073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06687281328511838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08253995589422185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,modernviolinist,2020/04/17,"My grandfather is dying and I'm a 6 hour drive away and I don't know what to do because California is sheltering My grandfather has been ill since before last year and this year has been really rough so my family has been mentally preparing for him to go.  But what we couldn't predict was covid.

I moved to LA at the beginning of the year to look for work and had plans to make frequent visits since I'm from NorCal and it's a very short flight or a day's drive.  I didn't anticipate covid grounding me to the spot.

The doctors say that he's likely got a week left and he'll be moved to hospice.  I want to be there for my family.  I don't even know what kind of hospice and I've heard that if they're in a facility they won't allow visitors anyway.

My parents just called me a earlier tonight asking if I wanted them to come pick me up (via car) and bring me home for a bit.  Flying is completely no-go.  I told them I didn't think it was a good idea to potentially put them in danger since that would mean two trips from two big populations.  I don't want to risk passing anything onto them even though I've been exercising precautions.  At the same time I want to be there for my family, I want to pay respects.  But I also know I absolutely can't put them at risk.  Don't even know if there's going to be a funeral.  I won't even be able to attend if there is one, if I'm sheltering.

After some back and forth with my parents they said that maybe it would be best if I stayed where I am.  Yes, it is safest to stay where I am.

I don't really know what I want.",3.0952226296490286,3.756156180722893,4.789565217391306,86.43369565217392,73.03614457831327,8.665479308538503,24.073336825563125,8.964715089967882,1.4295799895233112,1220,32,280,24,23,415,161,332,0.039,0.878,0.083,0.8467,2,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,0,7,3,16,8,1,2,14,1,37,3,0,3,0,44,66,21,2,15,10,2,1,1,0,5,3,3,1,0,13,12,0,0,8,1,1,15,11,3,0,3,13,5,39,5,35,41,4,44,0,0,1,0,20,14,0,8,14,178,52,3,0.09738314756801056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778772679265759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801380328665486,0.0,0.09104009721747792,0.0,0.09149467279733556,0.07488162937683945,0.0,0.05936386287976246,0.0,0.08286588597264337,0.0,0.10219760530987236,0.0,0.10631717513017748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09943908175556557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838869587366607,0.10210437743314237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06280407387457589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10106833235941612,0.0,0.0,0.0996757780131434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2572826021053293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2754124939468045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16603526087525033,0.08168036386790534,0.07788619922997105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09768323714723218,0.0,0.09590278401323858,0.0,0.0,0.10993372008682216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10140956246958628,0.26759615557025285,0.07938026282349299,0.0,0.0,0.10580707477188764,0.0,0.0,0.04757648688894445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177731738468537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500400719418083,0.0,0.097834460916741,0.10607879654953682,0.0,0.0,0.09813930798780146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070057485232769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598934108775226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21626492171150324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19579392142338367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12477227594015125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926336738535812,0.07744298761942016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2416690379938143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075949561348373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06239918880242541,0.09567844804432378,0.0,0.05678489648143475,0.0,0.0,0.09305377076434043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902583696983359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08035129553187176,0.3446346212757867,0.0,0.07811488691814884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07089609125720146,0.0,0.0,0.13835638794662666,0.0,0.0,0.18813466260566727
COVID19_support,Audric_Sage,2020/04/17,"Desperate for info regarding checks Hey. I'm 18 years old today. I'll be starting college soon, and I'm as broke as everyone else. I really need this money if I'm gonna survive.

I filed taxes a few weeks ago, and my mother doesn't work, so she hasn't claimed me as a dependent. That being said, I was still a minor when I filed. 

Obviously I'm asking if anyone has any clue if I'll be getting this check. I meet all the requirements by pure technicality, and I can't find any source of info that discusses a case as unique as mine. 

I'm in the middle of trying to plan my life out right now, and I need to know if this is even something I can count on.

COVID19_support,[deleted],2020/04/17,"Don't want get out of bed?? Parks closed?? Want fruit!! That's basically all, I'm a high school student right now (class of 21!) and I'm just exhausted with all of this. It's absolutely draining and I can't stand being inside all day. I used to go to the park but then they closed all the parks so I go nowhere, I can't drive either. I'm super mad since it was the only thing I looked forward to. I don't feel like getting out of bed anymore, much less being ""productive"" by creating or doing something, like some people are. I kind of just want to sleep all day, I already sleep about 10 hours, which is normal for me but lately I can't start the day until 2pm because I can't manage to stay asleep longer than 6hrs. I don't have any drive to do my schoolwork since it all feels pointless. I'm just sick and tired of this. My older brother and dad keep taking all the food in the house and leaving me with scraps, which used to not happen when he was at college. I just want to eat a piece of fruit for once but it's so hard to find any.

I'm especially sad because I applied for a selective residential science program this summer and I've been so excited to go, if I get accepted, but I learned that it may just all be put online. What a waste if so. I wouldn't even go then, it'd just be more time in front of a computer instead of enjoying summer. I'd rather just go to color guard that I would've missed and go to the beach, if I can't actually travel and do lab work and research. It's right now a ""strong possibility"" which basically means I'm screwed. Horrible because it's supposed to be in mid July!! 

The only positives of this is that I'm getting into new interests, even if they're not productive. I started reading Harry Potter series. Can you believe I never have? They're quite good. I'm a Gryffindor. I've also started writing a bit again. No big novels or anything. Just scenes here and there. I'm into some new TV shows and movies as well. Started watching Arrested Development. Why did no one tell me how hilarious it is until now, I don't know! But I'm seriously sick of all this. I don't want to even get out of bed anymore. Everything is being cancelled left and right, AP exams that I studied so hard for are kind of a joke, can't even go to color guard, which I practiced months for for only half a season, not to mention how crushing this must be for our seniors who won't get to perform at championships.",2.2063381818181824,4.009507372000002,3.851418181818184,87.6897090909091,77.28,6.545454545454546,24.763636363636365,7.435244526350478,1.11448,1906,67,400,25,44,636,235,500,0.14300000000000002,0.7609999999999999,0.096,-0.9649,0,0,1,0,0,0,61.0,1,1,1,5,31,19,2,0,18,0,39,12,3,4,11,81,82,37,0,13,24,2,4,2,0,4,4,0,3,0,27,21,4,3,7,7,0,13,19,6,1,2,4,10,32,13,55,66,17,62,0,2,4,1,10,20,1,9,31,249,59,13,0.0,0.0,0.08334152988366364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424492381019342,0.06829717553638716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615466389257866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16939471485279067,0.0,0.0,0.07027983188865418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15618360549472673,0.0,0.0,0.09622053749935043,0.0,0.0,0.09323854015069588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523464312549604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738913662012507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256329158209945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07675518979078437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08636518607766415,0.06101230197918405,0.0,0.0,0.07805728314857928,0.0,0.10327029269373143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677189306727014,0.0,0.3397575767356864,0.07163243264031621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07552206334539346,0.0,0.15300958356536348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09023352298337448,0.0,0.0,0.08410527806850819,0.09854421210168683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07591058535468458,0.0,0.17786927747859618,0.04693554896423672,0.0,0.09633890662361852,0.09043001154287947,0.0927911899207913,0.0,0.0,0.08344770593448136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07171745939498665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302948577321722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06816828629311696,0.0,0.06278142437824649,0.0,0.06586847062473734,0.1649665312493788,0.0,0.0,0.08367733074158724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09095197677581204,0.05787164511279357,0.19485970883198012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059208057386318215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962796528235152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585414060119545,0.0,0.09083717127300436,0.08542664572444111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2188024550044917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08643293620403353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14129337224254676,0.0,0.1709304234525331,0.0,0.0,0.06574781315498797,0.0,0.0,0.24179624463139884,0.09102880427814312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06421282920401536,0.0,0.074646453304601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05673831333364916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04979948765620034,0.09815879932785396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14752246576209613,0.0,0.0,0.25186608634178465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07678803390147627,0.0,0.07706340604942785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06217479013262176,0.0,0.0,0.06066822043038452,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,mslitty,2020/04/17,"COVID Skype/Zoom support group? Hey guys, forgive me if this has been mentioned before but it sounds like it might be a good idea. It’s so helpful to connect with other people online and speak openly about our fears, sadness and anxiety over this and it might be nice to connect using video conferencing software to see and hear others.

I wouldn’t mind facilitating something like that if the interest was there, I’m a certified group facilitator and a Masters of Social Work student so I have some knowledge/experience, but if anyone more qualified would be interested I wouldn’t mind passing the torch over either. 

Just thinking of a way to lean on each other and get through this together.",7.453095238095237,8.546640619047622,7.222341269841268,71.33446428571429,63.444444444444436,9.474603174603176,35.59126984126985,9.516144504307137,3.5058603174603182,562,25,91,10,8,178,89,126,0.068,0.7190000000000001,0.213,0.9653,0,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,1,0,0,2,5,10,0,1,6,0,12,0,0,1,0,28,19,13,0,6,7,0,0,2,0,5,0,3,0,1,11,9,0,0,3,1,0,1,2,2,0,0,2,4,5,8,12,9,4,6,0,1,1,0,11,4,0,6,2,65,16,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15190108113768547,0.0,0.0,0.13884071611931598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16896352219397667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942339039561436,0.0,0.22343994624350855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10374160700887207,0.0,0.0,0.16654624289859227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19660979127441613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22379630174365148,0.0,0.13309340789790752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22415482964712785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19401689136650105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4212905069795925,0.40098650612432735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13765942525684427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15822997132279665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202411211620264,0.0,0.1528644338346674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22532831832225134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272319314317762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17149572833287535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15761103162630313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14455711355764606,0.0,0.0,0.14105432139599547,0.0,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Doing_It_For_Value,2020/04/17,"[Support] I don't even know how to properly describe how I'm feeling now. I think it's a sense of defeat. I have anxiety/depression. I was also a mild germaphobe BEFORE all this. When the outbreak first started in the US, I was very nervous but reassured by my mother, a doctor, that I was not going to die if I did get this disease. I don't know how much of that was (non-malicious) ignorance on her part or if she was doing it just to calm me down. I am careful, I wash my hands often, like when I get home from work. I use hand sanitizer at work and I have it in the car for if I have to touch something like a key pad in a store.

There's no point in mincing words. I'm morbidly obese, but not bedridden/immobile. I can move, function like normal, take care of myself. I don't have heart issues, yet, but I was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes.

More and more I'm seeing articles about studies that show that the obese are at much higher risk for needing critical care. Now they're saying that some people who  are in critical care don't have ANY underlying conditions other than Obesity! And they're in their early 30s, like me.

This is definitely the wake-up call to end all wake-up calls, sure. I've tried off and on to lose weight. Could I do it via something like Intermittent Fasting, which from I've read looks promising for me? Possibly. But it's very unlikely to lose ALL the weight I would need to be healthy before a vaccine is made for COVID-19. I have a lot to lose.

So even if I start my weight loss journey again, I'll still be in a vulnerable group. Therein comes the feeling of defeat. I don't want to have to disinfect everything I buy from stores or have delivered to me. I don't want to have to put takeout food into the oven when I get it at home. Is that just laziness? Subconsciously suicidal? I don't know, and it's kind of scary. I live alone, my dad and mom are in another state and country, respectively. I need supplies to function like everyone else. Short of going out in a hazmat suit, I can't eliminate all risk.

I feel like I'm going to just get the virus anyway, no matter what I do, and then go to the hospital and suffer, if not die. Maybe I kind of want to. Maybe they'll triage me for someone skinnier, which is fine. Better save them than me, pragmatically.

Yeah, it's defeat.

COVID19_support,SheHasTrouble,2020/04/18,"COVID-19 probably just destroyed my family and I don't know where else to turn So this whole ridiculous saga started this past Wednesday. My mom, an oncologist (so in healthcare, but not front lines) came home complaining about some mild sniffles. She's been having really really terrible health anxiety and this sent her over the edge. She's been low key freaking out since she accidentally touched a doorknob at work and then touched her face. I don't think it's anything; it's been colder where I am and the symptoms she's describing are generally what I get when the temperature falls and the air gets dry. For caution's sake she wanted to sleep in the guest room (and has been doing so the past couple of nights), but this really sent my dad over the edge. He's bad at dealing with stress (he's been having trouble sleeping when she's not there and bad headaches) and told her that no, she couldn't do that. His position is that if she has symptoms, then she has no right to bring anything home and should just piss off to a hotel instead. So he's not letting her self-isolate at home. It came to a head this morning when he screamed at her and told her to get out of the house (like a clothes-throwing, screaming, red-in-the-face angry outburst) and she left to drive around...somewhere for like 5 hours. They've had big fights together and made up, but this feels completely irreparable. She eventually came home (because I kept telling her that Dad would want her back and he would be fine with her wearing a mask and gloves, which was...only partially true) but little has changed from this morning. Nobody has changed their basic positions. Mom has COVID-whatever, Dad is adamant that she gets far away from him if she has symptoms (he has hypertension and is on the wrong side of 50) She's now desperately looking for a hotel and I'm really really worried for her. It feels like my whole world is falling apart. I know I shouldn't be this distraught; I'm almost 21 and am only home because my school moved online so theoretically I shouldn't be dependent on my parents at all but I like having a normal family and this is sending my anxiety into super overdrive. My parents hate each other, and my mom won't even tell me where she's gong to go. Thank you to this stupid pandemic for blowing up every pillar of ""normal"" I had in my life. Someone please tell me it's gonna be ok :(",6.190129870129869,6.587232926406928,6.067510822510822,80.94983766233767,66.05627705627704,9.1974025974026,32.08441558441558,9.04235418022936,2.5498389610389607,1900,72,369,30,28,596,230,462,0.19699999999999998,0.748,0.055,-0.9973,2,0,0,0,1,0,60.0,0,1,1,2,19,27,6,2,17,1,42,11,6,2,2,63,72,36,0,12,12,8,4,4,1,7,5,2,6,0,23,28,0,1,5,2,0,13,11,18,0,0,16,7,51,9,42,43,5,59,0,1,1,0,55,33,1,5,17,231,74,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07709387893082388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177935376684689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126711623093133,0.06853699176023287,0.0,0.0,0.07233418440549765,0.05920018534768912,0.12856605962692302,0.09386418844469516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2641664873984679,0.0,0.0,0.16288939847767364,0.0,0.08072204249767567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08518743483515846,0.0,0.0,0.07937281016024808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06431486134668034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05085084906045788,0.0,0.06486698756654355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14515772715244032,0.0,0.07785642489853459,0.055001325449092704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16089537745831567,0.0,0.043754916035996835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601120763387856,0.07901345465552995,0.08183625507110663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38613380829203947,0.0,0.07581916467617802,0.08883556438795727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462284883447152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364933415204122,0.07872699607378128,0.05437997183860484,0.15045275405764896,0.07716372067273097,0.0,0.0,0.06465180294150416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07284934134988585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27050757111325835,0.0,0.08182767110303735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224944513701613,0.15086675806461547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05855399602329245,0.0,0.0,0.17097549233463066,0.0,0.14699040869490687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451136879743483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830077195734509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466072761563929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657486258037402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791750023299633,0.0,0.0,0.08031685573726126,0.0,0.0,0.06368652303238376,0.0,0.1540902333544395,0.0,0.06523296687122876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449357552464314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08819123019374832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2400647569313657,0.0,0.0,0.20187669069891576,0.07088160225306181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04933177300481635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14713356326229127,0.0,0.0,0.08374248506142315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09082082226105867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17191208980546707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056049284421035066,0.0781865904241401,0.0,0.10938228613132224,0.08417594947748258,0.0,0.0

People say that you're supposed to wear with the blue side out, but at the same time there are people who say that you wear it with the contact points of the ear loops on the outside. If I follow the latter suggestion, then I'm wearing the white side on the outside. So how am I supposed to wear these masks (the WHO link didn't really address this)?

My mum's a frontline NHS worker and she's just tested positive for COVID-19.

She's 47, and has mild asthma. So far, she's only got the no taste/smell and achy symptoms. No fever or cough. I'm hoping she stays like this - what's the likelihood that she does?

I'm so fucking worried and I'm living alone 40 miles away so there's no way I can go and be with her because the UK is on lockdown, and even if I did visit, I'm worried I'd bring it back with me.

COVID19_support,CoinBoy8601,2020/04/18,"I feel like we could really be in a lot of trouble as a society after this pandemic. With the COVID-19 virus going around, and the way that certain people are reacting to it, I truly feel that this could be the end of the golden era of humanity. People are dying, and the mortality rate could become higher if hospitals become more overwhelmed. In addition, since most businesses are closed, we could enter a major economic depression, which could heavily damage a lot of people's lives.

The worst part is this ""new normal"" that a lot of people are preaching (especially journalists). Personally, I see this as fear mongering, as well as an attack on society. Why would we still need to worry after this virus is under control or has a vaccine? It simply does not make any sense.

If there is a depression, people will have to sell almost every enjoyable thing that they own, which would make life much less pleasant. Not to mention that they might have to give up their future goals (for example: wanting to move to Brooklyn, NY). This could devastate a lot of people, including myself. We need a plan to gradually open businesses back up at some point (as well as give people their jobs back), because a pandemic plus depression is worse than a pandemic alone.

For all we know, I could be completely wrong about this rant, and things could still mostly return to normal after this pandemic is over. I just wanted to explain how I feel about this whole situation somewhere.",8.804624060150372,8.526577958646616,8.588421052631581,67.32894736842107,60.76691729323309,12.111278195488724,35.16541353383459,11.491704259439757,4.24507067669173,1171,43,190,30,14,378,152,266,0.162,0.773,0.065,-0.9838,1,1,0,0,0,0,39.0,5,0,4,3,12,16,1,2,18,0,27,1,0,5,2,57,42,14,2,18,6,0,3,1,0,4,1,0,0,2,20,14,0,1,5,0,1,3,2,10,2,0,0,4,16,6,41,27,16,28,1,5,1,0,15,12,0,12,13,154,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08295856715814426,0.08580374528842116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056338301037189814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375074017043882,0.0,0.0942495863749774,0.0,0.12740732779440578,0.0,0.050502314119004584,0.18299438131677093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686273250947497,0.0,0.0929191306226796,0.5291680099515904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21406609963336776,0.0,0.08598134320600688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249932468673417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07337720060859887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0698015512906571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09322508062152324,0.1256686823236695,0.05918538818301933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589473726107648,0.0470834415236553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221213450402072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04553014056049245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058516766939160726,0.04047450029339784,0.0,0.07315476970208484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817317271586089,0.0,0.0,0.1106010502370357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788679494993372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805246853238495,0.06090153709947078,0.122858911333126,0.0,0.08001343886788426,0.0,0.0,0.16234349930771028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971443155437349,0.0,0.40204618124671104,0.07233816296293469,0.0,0.0,0.07831649858994498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0530734386813361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660177469664853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06853128641758237,0.09312267284641693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323222682984944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11007875430261604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977297469966777,0.06575950888472983,0.0,0.0,0.14897748312529746,0.0,0.07475586814110279,0.09249489612671223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08413440343801404,0.0844274216661125,0.1177032191891512,0.09057938522063763,0.0,0.0

COVID19_support,Yozakura_,2020/04/18,"What things (books/shows/movies/songs/sites/podcasts, etc) give you a little more hope? I was randomly listening to an old World War II song my mother liked called [The White Cliffs of Dover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuHYnzWHS7o) when I realized that people back then wanted hope in dark times too. The song is all about hope that the war would end and things would return to normal. I thought about this, and figured I could search for things that give me a little more hope too. Not because the world right now isn't frightening. It is, or a lot of it is anyway. But because I read that decreasing fear and anxiety can help our immune systems work better, and is better for our bodies in general.

COVID19_support,beardedstoner,2020/04/18,"I'm worried that I have Covid. And I'm worried that my family will hate me Right now I am just very dizzy and queasy and tired. So I'm hoping that this isn't Corona but I am extremely anxious about it. 

I am living at home with my parents and two younger sisters. If I do have it, it is highly likely they will all get it. We are all worried about my mom. But now I am even further worried that I could be the person to give her the virus. I very much fear my family's reaction toward me if that were to happen

I have been staying in my room the past 24 hours, trying to sleep. I have been quarantining for weeks now, over a month, but I did make a trip to one store three days ago and now I can't help but feel that was a huge mistake.

COVID19_support,zooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,2020/04/18,"Feeling so stressed from being a key worker that it’s making me physically ill. Okay so I’m a checkout worker. Last night I had this weird feeling just seem to hit me, like really sudden just body aches and malaise. This persisted into today. No fever, no anything else, just feeling aches all over my body and feeling fucking awful. I rang up my work saying I felt super ill so I’m self-isolating for a week (said high temperature). 

But honestly? I don’t think what I’m feeling is a virus as much as just general stress manifesting physically now. I felt exhausted and like aches similar to when I was really, really depressed. Like I already had clinical anxiety which I take meds for, before this all kicked off. Now I just think my body is telling me like ‘Zoe, you can’t do this for the sake of your mental health’. I’m going to take this week off because although I feel shitty for not doing my part and skiving, I’m just feeling way, way too stressed and awful about going into work. To the point where I’m almost wishing that I would get obviously sick with this virus so I don’t have to stress about getting at work anymore.

I’m going to take this week off but I really have no idea what to do afterwards. Given the exceptional circumstances I’m considering quitting or taking a lifestyle break due to this pandemic since money problems can be overcome, whereas my mental health is more important. And although I’ll feel terrible for not contributing during this crisis... I feel like it’s doing such a number on my mental health.

So not being able to go to the gym and get a haircut is starting to do a toll on my mental health and image of myself :(. I'm also very scared of putting fat back on which I worked so hard to lose. My hair and especially my body is exactly what I've been so insecure about my entire life.

I keep telling myself that the economy can't be shut down forever, and that gyms and barber shops will have to open up within several months. But gyms and barbershops are also prime places to spread contagious disease. So I do not know what to believe.

COVID19_support,SkyMagpie,2020/04/19,"[TW] I don't know how much more of this I can take... Hello, I am a 23 year old woman and I have been suffering with hypochondria, GAD and depression for the past 8 years. Every other year I come close to being hospitalized for my breakdowns but I usually managed to recover. I can't recover from this one, it's only getting worse. This is a vent post. 

I think I might have COVID-19 but I don't show any typical symptom. No fever (temp went up to 98.4 few times in the past month), no cough, no shortness of breath. But I feel everything else, fatigue, tiredness, my muscles ache, I have no appetite, I barely drink, had few times my chest hurt and felt tight at night, I am having really bad panic attacks and I can't tell if it's anxiety or COVID. I lost 11 pounds in 2-3 weeks. I just feel so tired mentally and physically. I keep weeping at everything that reminds me of the time things were better. When I didn't have to fear for my life and didn't have to be locked up in my own house (we have a police enforced curfew we cannot leave or we will be arrested).

My mom is quarantined with me but she is mad at me right now and I don't know if she is feeling bad because of the situation or if she is sick. I am tired of being careful where I step of thinking I didn't wash my hands enough, didn't wipe the products, touched my face without realizing, my mom not washing her hands properly and handling our food and surfaces, not wiping things enough. I can't anymore. I am breaking down. My body feels like it will crash. I have this strange heaviness in my chest, pain without hurting, I don't know if it's the COVID or if it's the stress. I haven't slept properly in weeks, wake up sweating and with a pounding heart every 2-3 hours, bizarre and scary dreams, sometimes my mind is awake but my body feels like it's too heavy to move. 

I can't enjoy daily activities, I can't read or write or draw or play video games. I completely dropped uni. I can't talk to people. All I do is sit at my balcony and watch the empty streets of the once most lively neighborhood in my town. I live day for day but I am not living, I am just not physically dead yet. All if me, my personality, my flair and spirit are crushed. I can't even recognize myself in the mirror. 

I am scared. I am scared of this uncertainty. I am scared I have COVID or that I will catch it. I am scared of death. I am sad for everyone who is sick, who lost a loved one or who died.

COVID19_support,olszewskisa,2020/04/19,"My depression is back Hi. I apologize in advance for the long post, I just feel the need to express what’s been on my mind. I (25F) have had clinical depression off and on since 2010. I’ve been on a combination of medicines that works with me for about two years and I’ve been seeing a therapist at least once a month. But I recently came to the realization that my depression is back. I’m not sick with COVID-19 but my job deems me an essential worker (I’m a lab technician that tests consumable products) so I’ve been heading to the office everyday since stay-at-home orders have been in effect. We’ve been short-handed since mid-March so I’ve been doing the work of 2-3 people also. We hired a temp who started on Monday but because my supervisor works from home most of the time it is my responsibility to train the new hire. I didn’t realize my depression came back until my supervisor spoke with me (more than once) about being more focused at work. I attributed my lack of concentration, fatigue, irritability, and overall sadness to work stress/burnout. But on Friday I bawled my eyes out until 2am over being criticized at work, my lack of social outlets to utilize, and the fact that I basically feel trapped having nothing to do outside of work because of social distancing (I have hobbies but I’ve lost interest in them, another sign of depression). I woke up at 4:30pm today and basically told myself I can only move forward from here. I’m hoping I can bounce back from this, I’m hoping my depression is purely circumstantial, but at the same time I’m terrified that I’m going to be in a months-long depression once this is over.
Can anyone else relate? I haven’t felt this bad since college and it’s scaring me.",5.579082743603703,6.491515362275454,6.476418072945019,75.67036472509528,67.53293413173652,9.90506260206859,31.648884050081648,10.018931242160765,3.146723353293413,1377,55,256,32,22,457,171,334,0.18100000000000002,0.767,0.052000000000000005,-0.9936,1,2,0,0,0,0,41.0,1,0,1,11,11,15,0,1,16,0,27,5,2,2,2,38,48,17,0,5,8,0,3,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,12,13,0,0,5,0,0,6,3,12,0,1,16,6,32,3,48,29,7,44,0,10,2,0,10,20,0,3,18,165,44,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06742286267429891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840663018898393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058951675053350035,0.08638579678058682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2593174593162375,0.07039552271024897,0.10278947069719364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19285689154051386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5083139595205346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07043038101462744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085259573840682,0.0,0.08095104505555144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047915448205150375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08652662231010473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08457003769018051,0.16747816916614194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08366489672771993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14922380580101585,0.0,0.0,0.09203457849407913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512930093757556,0.0,0.06729562341907419,0.0896084347016012,0.0,0.06251496929728406,0.0,0.08142734816578531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08089794218866236,0.0,0.0,0.2693629388895217,0.0,0.06412173117531457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0584500997445042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08074589747907171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832461835840045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440925102749514,0.0,0.06718433982367418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789691830937395,0.0,0.0,0.17188732971296716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05967521668688312,0.08986349028417724,0.0,0.0,0.096577086767132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789067844000958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983239494495808,0.0,0.07991624251565832,0.08056204043373749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235884664637402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296519750333154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05429302567512047
COVID19_support,jsflaherty1,2020/04/19,"Terrified of getting the virus Hi, just made this account since I deleted my older one a few years ago.

As most of you probably relate with, I'm having some severe anxiety about the virus. I have taken time off from my job (Dunkin') indefinitely until all of this blows over; I have 2 infant siblings, one whom has underdeveloped lungs, so if I were to take this virus home I would be screwed, and so would they. I want to protect them and my family desperately.

I've had very very little contact with the outside for the past couple weeks, only time I've left my house was today to go put air into my tire so it wouldn't deflate while I'm sitting here in quarantine, also went out to get a coffee for my mother and I to make her day a little better (obviously wore gloves and all of that). I practice perfect hygiene all the time in an attempt to minimize any chance of getting the virus.

However, about 30 minutes ago I had bad stomach pains, used the bathroom, washed my hands and decided to take my temperature since I've been super paranoid about that. Only made my anxiety worse because my temperature right now is hovering around 99.5-99.9 degrees and I don't know how to feel about this. I don't feel sick at all besides that stomach pain I had, now gone, I think it was because of some of the food I ate earlier.

I've had some run-ins in the past couple weeks with false alarm low-grade fevers, only mostly because I was most likely dehydrated, or something else like that  but I just can't help be absolutely terrified when I read a number like that, I'm just sitting here so scared.",7.356250000000002,6.4462973814102575,7.597051282051287,75.3271153846154,63.96794871794872,10.364102564102565,34.243589743589745,9.516144504307137,3.001682051282052,1261,46,242,20,16,412,177,312,0.11900000000000001,0.818,0.063,-0.9509,2,1,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,2,4,19,12,1,2,14,0,22,13,4,5,6,45,45,19,0,5,6,1,3,3,0,3,6,0,1,1,12,12,2,1,5,1,1,4,4,6,0,2,16,3,31,6,36,24,11,38,0,0,0,1,10,14,1,9,21,152,43,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19434737121438306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08766503178514341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07454702352010477,0.0,0.16772174481427946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09758721972253988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153016486020826,0.20047447983729316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695214657816907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2425903065585588,0.0,0.07069740989940844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915754885714852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103342287502243,0.0,0.11085680664194507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13255589883997032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17181961320203434,0.0,0.06230096325330167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347761592191054,0.0,0.10996025306719216,0.0,0.0,0.12648958640366753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878336427759186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060245630357155834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11910511012938672,0.0,0.0,0.16066797204328254,0.21974098280361712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074548210643398,0.07317383504275313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14856601516613646,0.2501184336576002,0.23329202652680803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20929406065264214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181915394976741,0.0,0.0,0.11020083781766457,0.0,0.0,0.10965211304736004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936169713314953,0.0,0.0,0.1097511938944449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384216306230506,0.0,0.18136164301660948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439271587395117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16484487591100672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07024163809764382,0.0,0.0,0.1917651923660619,0.1259948774672715,0.10390926256168888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09467859796900913,0.0,0.18089999981561244,0.06465815984729441,0.0,0.17586503037134707,0.0,0.0,0.1016211072375806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11171463946935224,0.15574528318654066,0.0,0.0,0.0705932621774508
COVID19_support,Forsaken_Painter,2020/04/19,"Is it safe to have a plumber in apartment for repair? Hi everyone. My partner and I have been taking this extremely seriously. I leave the house once a week for groceries but that's it besides a few socially distant walks. I sewed us masks for whenever we're outside. Part of the motivation is that my partner has asthma and I am very worried about how it would affect her if she were to get sick. Unfortunately her father who is a nursing home recently contracted the virus which has us generally more scared and taking it even more seriously than before.

Here's my dilemma: today we realized that our bathroom sink has a bad leak from from the pipe below. I don't think it would be that difficult to fix but we've tried ourselves and we're not able to. Obviously a sink is pretty important to have (the only other one is in our kitchen), but I don't feel super comfortable bringing someone into our home to fix it right now, especially because we rent our apartment and if we go through our landlord we won't have much control over who comes to fix it/won't know if they've been social distancing, etc. It's causing me a lot of stress.

So what do you think, is it safe to have someone come in and fix it?  If so, what precautions should we take? Thanks in advance. Stay safe, everyone.",3.795700952380951,5.774214772000004,4.817657142857144,81.72606666666667,73.28,7.961904761904763,29.50476190476191,8.704169506293173,2.408676190476191,1023,44,194,20,21,334,145,250,0.166,0.7490000000000001,0.084,-0.9697,1,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,12,1,0,4,7,12,0,2,12,0,26,3,0,5,1,41,39,16,0,7,8,1,1,0,2,4,2,0,5,2,20,14,1,4,6,0,1,6,4,6,0,1,3,1,26,6,25,31,7,21,0,0,0,0,24,10,0,5,4,137,46,1,0.13134953625710674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967137630088937,0.08006945816001383,0.0,0.11176878100432662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13493215563101374,0.0,0.2262919900054434,0.0,0.0,0.14731967379011165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464894536085309,0.08675512991083921,0.0,0.0,0.251020221508762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641427214357161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06862471144215344,0.0,0.07464896840616465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2635085889048975,0.0,0.0,0.15155972951438776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218627003977286,0.0,0.0,0.13908019352043882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11166867862192577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655702242031676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13988296932869776,0.0890058451205324,0.09989724116031816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14223874784757926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13362969938414934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12969182092776865,0.0,0.0,0.11217178628189607,0.0,0.0,0.13150379990522998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2677886219539543,0.22258407165058114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000112903817466,0.0,0.0,0.150460449998757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962755138415955,0.0,0.0,0.12092900561879902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16832695834346947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12450400207358447,0.0,0.0,0.08917771310857217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.315994638950925,0.0,0.0,0.10837712344836976,0.0,0.0,0.10536067510355984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13339182992730886,0.0,0.1866138839094932,0.0,0.0,0.0

My grandmother, who, up until now, was safe in a nursing facility, has contracted the virus from someone who works there along with others. The problem is, we have a very evil and vindictive family member who has cut us off from any information, and the facility won't tell us what's going on. 

All we know is they are taking her out of her private room and into an isolation unit with other sick people. She has alzheimers, she must be scared, she loves her stuffed animals, and she must be in so much pain. We have a lot of questions and we also know that they arent planning on treating her or the other elderly there because of a shortage of meds... 

What should we do? We just want to be able to ask questions about how shes doing, what, if anything, they're doing for her, etc. Should we call the area's police dept.? Thank you in advance...

I could not find anything similar so I decided to create a site which would allow people to post a story or their thoughts anonymously and also hopefully find other stories which others can resonate with.

I would really appreciate it if people could visit and give feedback and if you want contribute your own story as well.

COVID19_support,Murrivel,2020/04/20,"Has anyone else decided to abandon/temporarily abandon social media as a result of the overwhelming and depressing COVID-19 discourse? I finally broke down this morning and deleted Instagram off my phone and logged off FB for the time being after seeing way too many posts about what we've lost, the ""new normal"", and people attacking each other if they don't share the \*exact\* same opinions on how the virus/economy/etc. should be handled. I was starting to feel like no one was posting about ANYTHING else anymore--just covid, covid, covid. Even the kind and helpful stuff was getting to be too much. It was doing bad things for my mental health, and I don't want to watch some of my classmates and friends ripping into each other online. I feel really disconnected from a lot of people because I've had to come home and be away from everyone, but a lot of the platforms I used to use to socialize with people aren't healthy for me anymore. Have any of you guys decided to make this decision as well? How are you approaching it, and what kind of limits are you setting for yourselves?",9.002277227722773,8.116806257425742,8.293940594059407,71.57754455445547,60.68316831683168,11.248316831683171,39.011881188118814,10.355215969177356,4.079172673267327,872,38,148,16,10,274,129,202,0.094,0.831,0.075,0.2728,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,3,1,2,8,13,1,1,10,0,18,1,0,6,1,38,29,15,0,4,2,0,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,10,14,0,2,5,0,0,2,4,7,1,1,6,4,13,6,32,18,7,18,0,5,2,0,11,7,0,5,6,109,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09124525013551243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306795104388602,0.09381997533595343,0.13748062826029528,0.11041658811208067,0.0,0.0,0.1526461914120647,0.1260641076320956,0.0,0.1120325452747554,0.08179331288618229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558197075071144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11556681953476285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22417604262183385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14964329706819618,0.08862292375074862,0.0,0.0,0.1282122796284788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13568827531444544,0.09585637922524716,0.0,0.14698481053961915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036651457084558,0.0,0.07010216659009624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13285674608823494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14262432834878996,0.0,0.0,0.08993629963438703,0.0,0.13459089742696806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794502807044725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06555231228827932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464705095581282,0.2281456969986353,0.0,0.0,0.08956447308791694,0.1360348489637661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13521928552624832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986358460225869,0.0,0.0,0.1295893931711435,0.0,0.0,0.13146538792879173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092209571462312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2790651959312787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25700976615542104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595749426014021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10692203571001384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2735539748385327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497147201778948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15360104994984086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914151905572644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07823993553995705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23177242889736546,0.0,0.0,0.07914132167835254,0.10650379451476127,0.0,0.0,0.12064161913006187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,S_Lang,2020/04/20,"Youth Strategies to Stay Home Hi, I work in youth-programming for my company and we are trying to brainstorm ideas for encouraging youth to stay at home during this pandemic. So far, we've come up with things like online video game tournaments, streaming concerts once a week, and chain mail videos of ""why"" we stay home.

The goal is to spread awareness to youth that it's not just about keeping them safe, but also them keeping *others* safe. I am hoping we can all share ideas on this post and hopefully parents who are looking for ideas for their kids can refer to these ideas as well.

Thanks for any ideas and help! Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy out there!",4.9788,6.997975880000002,4.105800000000002,87.88990000000004,70.2,7.240000000000001,26.9,7.908726449838941,1.5241199999999997,535,18,101,7,10,157,89,125,0.0,0.718,0.282,0.991,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,3,0,3,2,6,11,0,0,2,0,7,0,0,0,1,29,15,9,0,3,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,1,8,11,0,5,6,4,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,2,9,11,20,15,1,16,0,0,1,0,15,6,0,3,5,59,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877197647239581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07459356633876411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09448898863177926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1048143456421837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352349106476523,0.0,0.3300867175300211,0.32684341066817496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6191383132711744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19499660520582388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05358942792170675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211272084563038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681721742215365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12179875177737495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10505355080375432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4676635735911337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009886336400348,0.0,0.0,0.07287375293887886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07447291368926719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08798741512554094,0.0,0.09862528303039593,0.0,0.09897896647103796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985627398733801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
COVID19_support,ChristmasChan,2020/04/20,"question about stimulus package and unemployment benefits I work in essential retail at lowes and im constantly around people coming in and out of the store. the way lowes works is you are entitled to engage customers that are in your department. regardless of social distancing guidelines you MUST assist customers that need it. The issue is that i am diabetic, asthmatic, and suffer from high blood pressure so i am at extreme risk of dying if i contract the virus. working 5 days a week i fear i will contract it at some point. Ive talked with my doctor and he advised that i stay home which i did.

I took the emergency paid leave offered but the problem is that ends soon and once it does im SoL unless i apply for FMLA. So once the time is up i either go back to work, quit, or get unpaid leave through FMLA. I am thinking about quitting since FMLA is also temporary. The job is not worth the risk. im part time and i get paid in peanuts and my doctor agrees that its not worth the risk and still recommends i stay home. 

So my question is if i quit specifically because i am at high risk from the virus and provide documentation from my doctor stating why i am at high risk from the virus would i qualify for the unemployment benefits from my state and government package? I would not be quitting for just any reason, I absolutely can not contract this virus as im not the only one at risk, my mom also has bad health and my step dad is very hold.

COVID19_support,Dr__2Savage,2020/04/20,"I think I had Covid-19. My mum went to Sainsbury's just to get some foodstuff. She came home and after a few days she was really sick. She had all the symptoms the fever, dry cough and sore throat. Also a really bad nose blocked. It was inevitable we were gonna get it. My dad said we should not go to hospital because we never know what we had caught could just be the common cold.

&amp;#x200B;

So we all had it for like a week and then we were fine. I mean we might take an anti-body test just to make sure but we are fine. My dad is kinda old (57) but he was the first to recover then me (14), my mum (47),  my brother (18) and then finally my sister (16). This really felt like Covid-19 and it was unlike anything we ever ha. My family have a history of high blood-pressure and diabetes so we were kinda worried.

&amp;#x200B;

But we are fine now. I just wanna know if there are any medical people out there who would know if what we had is covid or just something else. Here are is the EXACT information of what happened and our symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms:

Heavy dry cough (Every couple of minutes)

Fever (My temperature was above the recommended and felt like hell for ten days)

Sore throat (The soreness came and went and was more like a strong tickle I think)

Blocked nose (This was like its not even possible to breath, I tried holding my breath buy squeezing my nose and it went away in 4 days)

Headaches (Had a headache as well but it was only for 3 days but every time I moved my eyes it would hurt like hell)

&amp;#x200B;

Information:

I had it for 10 days

Dad had it for 8 days

Mum had it longest 13 days

Brother had it 12 days

Sister had it for shortest 6 days

My sister caught it last as she is studying for A-Level so stays in her room most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope someone out there can help us thanks!
