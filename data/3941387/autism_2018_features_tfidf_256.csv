autism,babbeg,2018/01/01,"Divorce and custody of a diagnosed autist toddler First, english is not my first langage - but ill try my best!

When my baby was 13 month, my husband left us. We went into mediation, and I got full custody.

Fast forward to when my toddler was more than 2 years old - he was not reaching his milestones; I went to all the usual testing(hearing test, physio, etc). Finally, we went to see a child psychiatrist and he was diagnosed. Deep down I knew he was different. But I didn't mind. I am a programmer and work with tons of great autist programmer. But my ex husband wouldn't accept it. He said our toddler was normal.

He doest not come to any appointment (langage, behavior, etc etc). He doesn't do anything our educator tell us to do (pictograms, see our toddler the same day every week). He say he is not autistic.

The problem now is that our son is now more fun to be with, he wants half custody. I am scared he wont go to any appointment since he thinks he is not autistic. He doesn't know how to handle his crisis (when my son has a sensory overload). He never spend any time with him that much.

I do not want my son to not see his father, but I feel he will be detrimental to his progress. 

Any advice on this? Thank you everyone.",2.6959090909090944,4.761581318181824,3.864462809917357,86.94851239669424,76.72727272727272,7.044628099173554,27.115702479338843,8.00094639256281,1.7258528925619832,957,39,193,16,22,311,131,242,0.07400000000000001,0.821,0.105,0.8964,1,0,0,0,1,0,42.0,8,1,0,5,6,7,0,1,7,0,25,3,0,1,2,37,42,12,0,5,11,7,1,0,0,3,3,2,0,1,4,11,0,0,5,0,1,6,13,2,0,3,13,6,30,5,19,24,11,29,0,0,3,0,41,7,0,0,18,121,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371435154610834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31653939564038586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576169723290756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12212199111387642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10024151151435026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07504831965847725,0.0,0.0,0.2362239871630128,0.0,0.12158074255253833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3893462844251059,0.0,0.0,0.098045825191466,0.11119547989347764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05883961713038876,0.0,0.0,0.12747645227403367,0.0,0.19796666992260445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06613513298319508,0.0,0.09307084741776528,0.12829713352613015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13115621842491645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395330934334731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12643516064685625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11749942553324225,0.0,0.09288455332718973,0.0,0.08554453805019555,0.0,0.08975087691094863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140168238368732,0.0,0.0,0.1221095951474811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11134933041313844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069348113286917,0.09254122752891224,0.116505579115406,0.0,0.27819286357938694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626156444955586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017115560576572,0.10713685719820816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07456449842770205,0.0,0.0,0.06785564693499008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07900685088483539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799549399703468,0.0,0.12816391332260704,0.0,0.1372747956580874,0.0,0.09334411992487368,0.0,0.0,0.3236254348298901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08471795205248475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07493776240411247

autism,rageagainsthepusheen,2018/01/01,"Five year-old was just diagnosed with Social Communications Disorder (and other things) - looking for more information (x-posted /r/parenting) I hope it's okay that I post here.  My son wasn't diagnosed autistic, but he was diagnosed with SCD.  I've read that it is very close to autism and I've searched the sub and I see that other SCD people participate here.  I am looking for advice to help my son.  

We realized last spring that there was something really off with my son.  He would have crazy melt-downs and severe rigidity sometimes.  He had paralyzing anxiety sometimes and obvious sensory struggles.  A child psychologist we brought in to help us said that he might be autistic, but his teachers, occupational therapist and social emotional group therapist all said that he was not autistic, because there were certain criteria that he just didn't meet.  

Turns out he's not autistic, but he has a diagnosis that is very close - Social Communications Disorder.  Well, that is just one of the diagnoses he got from the neuropsych.  He also got confirmation of SPD, ""unspecified anxiety disorder"", and ""unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder"".  Basically, other than SPD (""coordination development disorder""), a lot of things that I hadn't heard of before.  From the way the diagnosing doctors described these conditions, they do perfectly describe the things that I have seen with my son for whatever that's work. 

Our recommendations from the neuropsych was to get him into more social-emotional group work over the summer and do only part-time kindergarten next year, so that he can go to social-emotional groups in the afternoon.  Get him into therapy with a social worker to work on emotional coping strategies, etc.  Get me and my husband into therapy for 6 - 8 weeks for a crash course in how to better parent a child that is so different and fights us tooth and nail when we try to have any structure.  

We learned a lot over the last year working with different professionals trying to help my son.  Things are much better now... but, now that we know more, I wonder what else might help.  

So... has anyone else been through this?   Do you have any tips on how to help him?  Any books or anything else that might help?  It's a new diagnosis that came with the new DSM, so there isn't a lot of information on this, but I've seen it called ""autism lite.""  I want to know as much as I can to help my son...

autism,onajourney22,2018/01/01,"How do I cope with my autism? Hi everyone, I've reached a point in my life where I envy neurotypicals. They can have normal and healthy relationships with others while I struggle a lot socially. Is there a way to make friends with neurotypicals? I've also had relationships beyond friendships with people, but it never lasted. I often didn't understand the social cues, body language, etc that I'm supposed to understand. It resulted in my ex-girlfriends getting incredibly upset. I'd like to learn how to make friends, etc. I've had friends before, but it never lasted. If anyone has any tips, advice, etc then please share it with me. I'm very open minded :)   ",4.086542699724518,6.8252643140495906,4.823491735537194,78.4400860881543,75.28099173553719,7.339118457300277,27.438705234159784,8.344100000000001,2.2829168044077144,526,21,88,10,12,169,81,121,0.054000000000000006,0.721,0.225,0.9695,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,1,0,7,7,0,2,4,0,8,2,1,5,2,24,15,9,0,2,3,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,3,0,9,5,12,12,4,13,0,0,0,0,10,6,0,3,7,57,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13737268124348356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124213924225662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955988951858025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09829646995494004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196228184861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15615215681998093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4703499804242184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13432975703976255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3258341683852721,0.0,0.07344699769238723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2291821455755252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09929547335011184,0.0686800531789568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11951568186876944,0.0,0.0,0.18767584421955544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419452418327836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21684718661411245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13773808305090074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746013948203174,0.0,0.0,0.1543140991891778,0.13289308697961855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3018595909957429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2866062368113391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469642387870571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2926964790281391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11599282778084635,0.0,0.11158548059855927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,fantageTD,2018/01/02,"Any songs you relate to the autistic experience? ***AUTISTIC PEOPLE REPLY ONLY PLEASE*** Is there any songs y’all relate to having autism? Whether the good parts or the bad parts? One song that immediately comes to mind is “Alphabet Boy” by Melanie Martinez. While not intended for this purpose, I think a lot about how autistic people, myself included. Have been I infantalized by neurotypicals. Most often the school system and my own family are the worst offenders as a semi-verbal, mid-support 13 year old. 

The song talks about how this boy continues to teach her the alphabet over and over again despite her protests that she already understands. One of the lyrics I like in particular that says “you won the spelling bee now, but are you smarter than me now?” Which I think about how autistic people have different abilities than NTs and thus are looked down upon. Even if they are smart, we’re not “the right kind”.

The second verse is all about how sweets like apples and candies aren’t exactly good apologies. Lots of NTs think that they can buy me back with a menial thing after they’ve done something wrong. They can’t! 

Sorry, can you tell I relate a lot to this song? :p

Owl City (yes, the fireflies guys) also has a great amount of positive autistic songs. One that comes to mind is “The Real World”. Particularly the lyric “reality is a lovely place, but I wouldn’t wanna live there”. Which.. Ouch that hits close to home. The lead singer, Adam Young is actually autistic! So hell yeah autistic creators success! 

Any of you guys have any songs you relate to autism? I kinda wanna make a playlist! Only autistic people reply PLEASE. I really am not in the mood to hear an “Autism Parent” butt in saying “oh well my 6 year old likes these songs!!!” Or “AS AN AUTISM MOM I feel out of control a lot so I like this song”.

autism,thewildeman2,2018/01/02,"The Self Injury Seizure. I've been having them since I was 6 years old. They are the reason that I have permanent nerve damage exacerbated by my MS. They are rare but today I fell.

It actually started last night. I was borderline sensory overload. I was overheating and aggravated. I took my meds and turned off the heat for the house. I did all I could think of to stave it off. Finally, in the wee hours of the morning I passed out, but I hadn't been as successful as I hoped.

I was rousted from bed by my wife around noon. I didn't want to be in bed all day so I don't mind that she woke me on the issue. I do the same to her on some days after all. But I still didn't feel right. My son made my coffee for me and I sat down to my laptop to peruse social media sources and emails. That's when the extra tab opened and said I was infected and had to call a toll free number. Panic set in. 

I tried to close the tab and it took over the screen with a recorded message on repeat. My wife called a coworker and I had to walk away. You see, while I'm home disabled, all my work is in my laptop. Months of creative works with illustrations and writing. I didn't come here to advertise myself but suffice to say. That much work that I have fought so hard to complete for months on end, was a huge stress trigger. 

When I get upset I vent. Everyone I know does. But my wife started shouting at me, accusing me of taking  this out  on her. A yelling match was the last straw and that was it. 

Between medications and self protocols there is a lot you can do to avoid this form of seizure, but once it has you, there is nothing you can do. Only someone else can do anything and that means physical restraint. I don't know how much any of you will understand and I take quite a risk posting this here, but I hurt myself significantly. I have a concussion and soon the bruises will show across my upper forehead and hairline. 

Out of all my medical condition, this is my greatest shame. This makes me feel less than human. This is what people understand the least once they find out about it. I guess I'm one hell of a freak. I don't know how I made it to 47 years old.

Well, that's what happened anyway. Now to deal with the consequences and blame. (Studies have found this to be involuntary as as seizure effect but that knowledge doesn't make me feel much better)",2.561810821889729,4.354842340336138,3.6134351301496217,89.83429083828655,76.22689075630252,6.828776388604223,23.794630047140807,7.678348718463194,0.9899117237138756,1838,58,395,26,41,592,238,476,0.139,0.81,0.05,-0.9918,0,1,0,0,1,2,51.0,0,5,4,7,17,16,2,6,24,0,46,4,1,9,5,72,81,35,0,3,8,4,4,0,0,2,3,4,3,3,25,27,0,1,15,1,1,6,8,11,1,1,26,10,65,6,61,50,16,60,1,2,2,0,29,26,1,4,26,278,90,6,0.0,0.0,0.0925974387172954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452739940420378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808510877416835,0.08447083741826199,0.0,0.0,0.08915082167707053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392112239943703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19378343184982075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0817379970955161,0.0994887337883945,0.0,0.0,0.07576070564218322,0.0,0.0,0.12239039977743772,0.09782582471568498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303752144580641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07926712359070481,0.0,0.08404300171756866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066997968467838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393535317201875,0.0,0.0,0.10394565812417957,0.08672632363335027,0.0,0.0,0.10404028698912753,0.0,0.0,0.04957529839570937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10453032474925553,0.0,0.08390954236369916,0.0,0.08500141260383716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09518085140368404,0.09424564046643737,0.0934460087620295,0.10948853055334604,0.1015800475314174,0.0,0.0,0.09903888830164008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15644463060416314,0.1546935015841119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806707663725926,0.0,0.17957149011504175,0.1266775534899161,0.0,0.0,0.10336133881645404,0.10539967612980512,0.1911802598464326,0.0,0.0,0.0958102841614281,0.0,0.15147810992433547,0.0,0.20926178477515764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08904638177115975,0.0,0.0910480262824447,0.0,0.1991389312215351,0.202106203413143,0.06429886899462091,0.07216694154853419,0.0,0.111331150423717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06578370319158704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09087690486278444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10092554590665423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09756112955445788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08103421726140571,0.09026064454381022,0.07545910344628898,0.0,0.0,0.07561380886264205,0.0,0.19797869409449975,0.0,0.0,0.0784927058313685,0.0,0.0,0.09672682450208714,0.08039867518795389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13432506564003507,0.0,0.0757780382029165,0.0,0.10869439810655793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.142688609757534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060800686899455024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08994315494442362,0.0,0.21084911719661606,0.06442302844990583,0.10321138496086034,0.0,0.19756444433531284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055967665886512565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08531611158733128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20723976367254068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12221010064986795

autism,tokiistheking,2018/01/03,"Have an opening to work in ABA. Consider it or avoid at all costs? I am about to lose my current job and an opening for a Behavioral Interventionalist is wanting to interview me. Pretty much from my understanding this is the """"entry level"""" job to becoming someone who administers ABA therapy. My dream is to work with kids, especially kids with autism, as I believe I am autistic as well but haven't been officially diagnosed. Working with kids would be a dream come true but... 

I've heard some bad things about ABA and am torn about this """"opportunity"""". I would absolutely die if I had any hand in """"training"""" autistic kids """"normal"""" behaviors especially in the harmful ways I've heard ABA does. 

Should I just avoid the job at all costs, despite the fact I may be jobless soon? (I of course put the kids health and safety 110% above my own possible income or lack thereof). Is all work with ABA negative? I really don't know much about it. Could experience in an ABA field actually be helpful to the kids, and/or for a future for me working with autistic kids in helpful and healthy ways? Could I be helpful in a bad industry or is there just no way to avoid the harmful ways of ABA? 

Also, are there good therapies and resources out there for autistic kids? If this is all wrong is there a right way?

autism,ash_darkmare,2018/01/03,"Help dealing with school Hello this is my first post on this subreddit because I’m desperate now. My son was diagnosed with autism and mixed receptive / expressive language disorder and disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified in 2016 when he was 3 and I have gotten him in Speech, occupational, and behavioral therapy since. He’s been in Speech and occupational therapy for over a year and has been in behavioral therapy for 6 months. He just started talking really good in June so me and my so decided we wanted to put him in pre k to help with his social. The school I wanted told me to call back in August then when I did they were filled up. So I called the school we’re in district with ( who we’ll call B) and had a meeting with them and they said he would be a better fit at a sister school of theirs and that the sister school has what they call a “ self contained “ class that would be half a day with a smaller class size of ten kids and two adults it sounded perfect. My son is 4 and is doing small math but  he gets upset when it’s time to do something new so we thought school would help and this self contained would help but when I called the sister school to ask they said that their self contained was for non verbal low functioning kids who are still in pull ups. My son is potty trained and can talk. He can’t hold a pencil or write his name but I just don’t feel like that’s the fit for him. I have a meeting this Friday to talk to the district school supervisor about why I think  school B is not the place for him the classes they offer are either 1)regular class 2) regular class with labs 3) or the mental disabled class. But even then I’m not sure those are good fits and the principle herself said the sister was better and she rather him go there but what she told me was a lie and I’m not sure what to say or do. So if anyone has gone through this I would  love some help on what to say before I talk to this important person with nothing to show

autism,daisydemure,2018/01/03,"My autistic brother constantly terrifies me. My brother is twenty-one, and I am fifteen. We are also Iranian, if that’s worth anything. He constantly has meltdowns over the smallest things, and it has caused me to have severe anxiety since the seventh grade. I am terrified that he could hurt my family one day, physically. A few years back he cut a wire on my dads car, that almost killed my father when he tried to fix it by electrocuting him. He took a hammer and smashed the back of my mothers car, and he constantly raises his voice (if you don’t know, Persians can get very loud) and calls other people, telling them that our parents are yelling and hurting him. It’s gone too far and I’m constantly terrified of and for him. I think I do love him, but I can’t live with him anymore. My parents never really do anything to him, but maybe something they’ve said could’ve set him off? Tonight he started screaming about how he hated my father because he was telling him to come inside faster. My parents were worried because he took my dads car out without telling him, so it’s reasonable why they were freaking out.

So I need to brag because over the last 2 days (since finishing that ball machine), he has started building original designs with K'nex. Pizzas! Insects! Some sort of 4-legged creature!

autism,Alice42,2018/01/04,"Any help for people with Autism in the workplace, specifically social skills. tl;dr I really struggle with knowing how I should behave in the workplace, I am often blunt/rambling, unempathetic/overly empathic, and lack patience/completely distracted. Any help on the subject would be much appreciated.

I have a mix of autism and ADHD. I often struggle with regulating my emotions, translating the multivariate representation of thoughts into a linear cohesive sentence, and struggle to understand anything from basic social interactions to office politics.

Add to that I am really stubborn, if I think a workflow is inefficient I lose respect for it, this also applies to people. I have a general inability to lie or deceive, or even hide my thoughts as I have zero filters.

The key area's I need to improve on are:
 - Politely dealing with things and people I disagree with, or find inefficient.
 - Talking to members of the public while representing an organisation.
 - Talking to co-workers/colleagues/superiors in the day to day of a job.

Any comments from your personal experience, resources, groups, videos etc that might be of help I would love to know about. A few recent brain glitches have lost me a handful of close friends recently, and mean I am always struggling to keep a job. I need to get them under control.

autism,wizardboxxx,2018/01/04,"Question about autism and childhood illnesses. I tried asking about this in autism_parenting and haven't gotten anything so I though that maybe you guys can help! My 4 year old does not get as sick as the neurotypical kids his age. For example, his cousins got the flu while we were over for NYE and they are doing nothing but sleeping and whining. My son has a fever and headache but is basically himself. Illnesses don't seem to effect him in the way they do most people. He has been pretty sick before but in the last year or 2 he hasn't had anything major and even the illnesses that should make him feel pretty yucky haven't been that bad. Are we getting lucky here or could this have something to do with his ASD diagnosis? I'm not complaining at all, I just find it so odd. I have the flu now and my 4 year old is handling it better than me! He has the flu symptoms but is still playing, not complaining, still happy go lucky and not lethargic like I would expect. I tried to do some research and I'm having trouble finding any info on this sort of thing. Sorry if this is a dumb question... he was just diagnosed within the past year and I still feel like we have a lot to learn!

autism,tinymewkit,2018/01/04,"Thoughts on 'famous people with autism' project? In SEN departments around me there seems to be a bit of a poster project giving examples of famous people who have autism e.g. Gary Numan. They're also mentioning lots of people who are suspected autists e.g. Bill Gates and Michelangelo.

What are your thoughts on this? I feel like it encourages the savant stereotype and reinforces an attitude of 'if you're autistic you're either amazing/genius or you're useless'. But I'm really curious to find out what y'all think.

autism,ledzeppelinfangirl,2018/01/04,"CAARS-Observer importance in diagnosis Hey everyone, I'm currently going through diagnosis in Melbourne, Australia. I've filled out all my forms/tests and had my interview and my mum spoke over the phone with my psychiatrist about my early development.

I'm about to send all my forms through to complete the diagnostic process, and one of the forms is the CAARS-Observer. My mum filled this out, and I've noticed that she's basically selected ""never"" for every answer even though I've clearly exhibited atypical 
behaviours in front of her virtually all the time and she also believes that I'm autistic.

I'm just fairly concerned about this having a negative impact on the accuracy of my diagnosis, since it really conflicts with all of my other results and her answers basically give the impression that I'm NT. Diagnostic testing here is costing me around $1k and I work part time in retail (that's over a month's wages for me) so I can't really afford to mess it up, should I maybe talk to my mum before I send her form? 

I feel like I maybe should have asked someone else to fill it out but I'm not really close to anyone except my dad, who doesn't know I'm being tested.

Edit: If anyone could please give me some advice asap, I would appreciate that so much. I feel like I'm about to simultaneously vomit and throw the biggest tantrum like the lady in that meme right now because this is a really big deal for me. Everything feels yuck and I probably should have asked someone who actually pays attention to my behaviour but I'm always alone so there's nobody.",6.358481102084067,7.213335738255032,7.355701165665843,70.2611638996821,65.77852348993288,10.837442599788062,32.798304486047336,10.771109862388434,3.738775838926175,1262,51,222,34,19,425,160,298,0.044,0.8859999999999999,0.07,0.7522,3,1,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,0,1,15,6,1,0,12,0,15,1,0,1,6,43,34,17,0,6,6,4,3,3,0,4,1,1,0,0,15,16,0,1,7,0,4,8,5,2,0,1,2,4,30,4,37,26,10,32,0,0,0,0,23,17,0,2,10,145,45,7,0.0,0.0,0.13035258799873845,0.0,0.0,0.1305306041129302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13834623521250175,0.0,0.10682205614175168,0.1111473655156614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18680129832576087,0.0,0.0,0.11891249283371898,0.2497542770833962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08142773959805567,0.0,0.11366480308414828,0.15049635036911593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14005370025005315,0.0,0.0,0.1066509418172993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771276615687522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11158704653603213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822682567749858,0.0,0.1125449920699195,0.127639237860294,0.12005104352571153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20262272963907185,0.1908559027857764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2562798456372912,0.07591529779673498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341082273351728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19577798331098664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2683935519283855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066204634130254,0.0,0.09819499542875164,0.0,0.10302337412618603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520791220131033,0.0,0.0,0.09051572154635816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14465165603269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14662822628179215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14401937706067475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34229323704522496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11407464485843613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049687211522692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22635994100044696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073647132286766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312394337996367,0.0,0.1557804879766045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724617262700766,0.0,0.0,0.09488978128212537,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Silhouette_shadow,2018/01/04,"Overcoming ""avoiding"" people So we have all been there, where we don't want to be around people. But I am wanting to ask if it's exhausting, sitting with people. Rather than the other room. Like for example when my bro and his daughter are in their room. I will go in there for a minute or two than leave. Normally I stay quiet once back in my room. And because of this habit. I've Missed out on just about a little bit of everything. In my head just being around them is good enough. But in reality they are wandering why I'm distant.

I want to say she is non-verbal, but I'm refraining from that description because she's trying SO HARD and she is making progress.

I'll get down to it.... I know she understands me, but sometimes I don't understand her. If you were ever in this state where others couldn't understand you, but you could understand them... can you please tell me what helped? What helped you bridge the gap of language?

autism,fhgkewsso1937,2018/01/04,"Does anyone relate to this I've been wrestling with the idea that I'm on the spectrum for quite some time and I was wondering if anyone has any comments on my experiences so that I can either go see someone or dismiss it altogether.  

I've just started binge watching the British TV series, Skins -- at this point, I'm on series 3 and there's a character with autism.  I found myself relating to an almost uncomfortable degree to this idea of the aforementioned character [whose name I forgot] 'locking on'.  My head started to buzz and connected autistic traits (having read diagnostic manuals and taken quizzes in the past) to personal past experiences. This mental episode concluded in me asking myself in my head (there's an audible monologue most of the time), 'So, wait, are you autistic?'  The head buzz reached a crescendo and my body froze up -- it felt as though the cognitive dissonance that arose from asking myself such a question fed into a feedback loop that only resulted in greater concern and ultimately panic.

I'd love to discuss this if anyone wants to get in touch, I've plenty of stories. It's difficult to shake off this feeling that I need to see someone lol.

autism,smaffit,2018/01/05,"I'm 32, almost 33, and I just found out I have ASD As a young person, my parents used to jokingly comment that I had some autistic tendencies (rocking, echolalia, overly sensitive to stimuli, outbursts, over facination with certain things, etc), but never had me tested. 
A friend of mine works with autistic and ASD kids, and suggested that she thought I was likely high functionong ASD... Well, I decided to find out, and it seems she was correct... So I guess, my question is what now? It explains so much about my life, who I am, why I do certain tjings, and why I have such a hard time when Im over stimulated... But what do I do? Anything? 

Thanks for your help and support, folks. One love

I am at the Tate Modern Members Bar now - what do I do now?",2.9827226890756293,4.65942801176471,4.2774789915966425,86.02294117647061,74.76470588235293,6.26890756302521,28.61344537815126,6.868970318607317,1.4738739495798323,331,14,65,3,7,109,58,85,0.187,0.799,0.014,-0.9349,0,0,0,0,1,0,15.0,1,0,0,0,3,5,3,1,4,0,8,2,0,1,0,11,15,7,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,8,1,0,3,1,0,2,1,5,0,0,6,3,15,0,8,9,0,16,0,1,1,0,14,7,0,0,7,48,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14694035701248412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23242611379872025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30704376806988154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31110234116922825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298793872902244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941112520046446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6170824401130609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335800527482764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3495661667503063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,P0W3R64M3R,2018/01/05,"Do People with High Functioning Autism Prefer Making Lifelong Commitments? So, I have HFA and there's something I've always wondered: do people with HFA prefer lifelong commitments over short relationships with someone else? 

I'm asking because I have this quirk where I date someone and then buckle down for the long run only to find that the other person doesn't want that. The end result is me becoming very depressed, almost feeling lost without the former companion. I was in a relationship with a girl for two years, which ended in a mutual breakup that I still feel grief over almost 8 months later. The relationship began in 8th grade.",8.321015037593984,9.357539096491234,7.633358395989977,69.34184210526318,61.54385964912281,9.67218045112782,32.95238095238095,9.606745405546679,3.3285854636591488,523,19,77,9,7,163,82,114,0.095,0.863,0.041,-0.7861,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,8,0,7,0,0,2,2,20,16,4,1,3,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,6,6,0,0,6,0,0,1,2,3,0,1,3,2,6,0,14,13,0,21,0,3,0,0,7,9,0,3,11,49,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3165762122470051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13153008883926753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.147777691807447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963603390293931,0.17458012500780085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13614875737353466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205040061995615,0.0,0.2800129875637368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15985375515731687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14447661604593426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1670136792966033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13989036445767775,0.0,0.0,0.17255625748365466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10551550838575477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261730222730566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202222701079365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21917697948943876,0.13802397037582062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5091364049137395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.267870884850122,0.1216929564275504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12623796410928265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15441516200221214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13042746383577494,0.09323603995319547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523775303719181,0.1714243246777736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017943632845069
autism,limefizz,2018/01/06,"Is anyone on the spectrum happy that they were taught not to stim in public? I've read lots of opinions on stimming and the practice of discouraging stimming in young children. I'm talking about relatively harmless stimming, like hand flapping and finger wiggling, not self-harming behaviors like head-banging. Despite specifically looking for it, I have not been able to find a single person on the spectrum on the internet who thinks that children should be taught not to stim. 

I'm asking this question because my husband believes that we should teach my son not to flap his hands. My husband is worried that other kids will make fun of our son, that he will be called names, that he will come home crying from school. My husband worries that my son's stimming behavior could eventually prevent him from being hired for certain jobs and otherwise discriminated against. One argument is that it will be easier for my son to learn not to flap his hands now, at a young age (3 years old), than it will be for him to learn not to do it when he is older.

I am really torn. I worry about all of the same things that my husband worries about, but I've also learned that stimming can be really beneficial to people on the spectrum. I also really don't want my son to get the message that we don't accept him for who he is.

To be clear, I am NOT worried about personally being embarrassed by my son's behavior. I could not give less of a s**t about that. I just want to do what is best for my son. My son flaps his hands and wiggles his fingers A LOT ... to the point that anyone who knows anything about ASD figures out that my son is probably on the spectrum within about five minutes of meeting him. I guess I wish that my son could choose whether/when to ""out"" himself rather than having every person on the street judge him based on a first impression.

I totally get that the negative judgments from society are society's problem, not my son's. But my ability to change how society behaves is approximately zero, so that observation is not particularly helpful in practice. I wish that I could ask my son to make the decision for himself, but he's not at a stage yet where that is possible.

Thanks in advance for any thoughts. Please be kind.",8.448420523138832,7.378071950704228,8.193259557344067,72.45204225352114,61.887323943661976,11.025083836351442,39.065057008718966,10.07000556051586,3.8811845741113338,1785,80,323,31,21,573,199,426,0.086,0.7959999999999999,0.118,0.9456,1,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,3,0,1,3,17,14,0,1,18,0,42,6,6,3,4,64,64,12,0,12,17,16,6,2,0,7,0,0,1,6,30,9,0,2,12,1,0,2,15,3,0,4,5,7,43,11,61,39,8,33,0,1,1,0,56,20,0,5,12,236,73,10,0.09838538188445776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15735750869468287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0669054334599328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375866931753667,0.0,0.08096278631308652,0.0,0.18395410202333656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05997481561666607,0.0,0.0,0.11084663419275886,0.10324938839204016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10046247504917237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407868859766664,0.08475029485638877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3142108869734136,0.0,0.1080717221784535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289392756438176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992245664091805,0.08368655557072414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280460265548416,0.09438022327670748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838259021176153,0.0,0.0,0.10473306848474763,0.0,0.0,0.10097178599681453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06594564760230921,0.0,0.09868855988381997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09763231040685587,0.0,0.0,0.10245323528219416,0.05407003288367821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613225590229957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08261894179133836,0.0,0.0,0.16728746676723066,0.0,0.0,0.13134601276577268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10323890808511776,0.0,0.06666848099860488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682080359238213,0.2577189616812671,0.0,0.10799760473345199,0.09300598684659678,0.1109147353994573,0.0,0.0,0.10607608202165199,0.09414152322737056,0.0,0.0,0.11021414426300342,0.0,0.09841200636605732,0.0,0.18908458481060425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957125901192608,0.0,0.0,0.10263741035998593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07907844318669828,0.0,0.0905800411462781,0.0,0.0,0.06536287601648036,0.06304138008395678,0.0,0.07810700346245923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606049462560153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262766674009451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4995756552187619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335696024213827

autism,9loabl,2018/01/06,"Fear of dogs: Autism, phobia or bad experience m So we're in a difficult situation where my gf's 7 year old son who has autism is petrified of dogs. It's getting to the point where if he so much as sees a dog in the distance in the park he'll get anxious and will look for safety. Whether it's jumping onto a bench or stay on a high playground equipment, or jumping right onto me or his mum. He once ran away towards a lake and slipped in a bit. He's also attempted to flip his baby brothers pram over.

We think it MAY have happened after a bad experience a couple of years ago when he was his Gran out in a park, but we haven't had the full story, we only know because his Grandad slip up and mentioned something. So we suspect the dog was a small terrier type dog, the ones that are full of life and scurry about.


His Dad (not me) is also a bit on edge about dogs and is wary of dog poo and whether the dog is on a lead or not in the parks. 


So is his fear of dogs due to a bad experience, or due to how wary his dad is and he's been conditioned to be scared of dogs. Could his Autism contribute to the oversensitivity of dogs? If so how? Do we assume that his autism is the one of the main contributing factors to help him overcome his fear of dogs?


Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? Summer is coming soon. And we don't want him confined to a garden.

autism,DidntWantSleepAnyway,2018/01/07,"What’s the best way to get a diagnosis, and is it worth it? I have many, many reasons to believe that I have autism, based on some recent readings about how it often manifests differently in women, plus many other memories from my childhood and many stereotypical autism symptoms. I always assumed I didn’t have it, because my mother got me misdiagnosed with other things as a child and she has a psychology degree. She would be over the moon to get me a real diagnosis. I even remember her telling me that a friend of mine had Asperger’s but her parents didn’t tell her, and it was really messed up that she didn’t tell her.

Now I’m thinking it’s possible that my mother just never considered it because I don’t have *all* the stereotypical traits and the research has changed. I’d like to leave it to the experts, though.

Anyway, who should I go to to discuss this possibility? What are tests like? And will having a diagnosis actually help me in any way?

Thanks!

If I say anything misinformed, ignorant, offensive, etc. I apologize, please help to inform me correctly.

autism,Grungyshawn,2018/01/08,"I'm looking for some help. My 5 year old kiddo is having a rough time using the restroom. On two separate recent incidents, some trauma occurred while he was using the restroom. 

The first mishap was while at school. He was using the restroom when the school had a scheduled fire drill take place. It scared him immensely. He hasn't been wanting to use the restroom at school ever since and has become.infstuated with fire alarms when he sees them. This has been causing some accidents at school. 

The second mishap took place at home. We just moved into a new place. He was using the restroom and when he was all done.. the toilet flooded sending him into a pretty substantial breakdown. He's been super hesitant to use the restroom at home ever sense. Last night he was having what seemed like bad dreams due to his severe need to potty. Eventually he had 4 separate accidents while sleeping last night alone. 

So to sum it all up, the kiddo is having a very hard time using the bathroom at home and at school so much so that he has many accidents. Any ideas on what route I can take to show him the bathrooms are safe?",4.665029272372458,6.644520554502371,4.741583495957626,83.17449958182327,70.9431279620853,7.0500139392249785,25.681906885977146,7.724431198458867,1.4350337886813491,891,28,161,11,17,277,114,211,0.135,0.779,0.085,-0.8221,0,1,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,1,2,9,7,0,2,18,0,23,1,1,8,4,28,39,12,0,2,1,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,7,0,1,2,2,0,3,1,4,0,3,13,6,8,3,20,26,6,39,0,0,2,0,18,15,0,4,22,99,14,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09494560856621716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06234080178647591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654314814453758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09417345096126717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09381333455194736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658470021356172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07797702971540772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212102554315942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0614464974405754,0.0,0.2758665611513172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348768871235284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494515044609524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0447868102826133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.076982254021367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09294206046570673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743391949224328,0.06739022268888775,0.06797438774435813,0.0,0.08853838047804022,0.0,0.17205785099211934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0961954205025936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2873364040082215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326442524445656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09051605439119967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178069225738364,0.4638899862602109,0.0730515333664501,0.08345568054766075,0.0,0.1035644265286252,0.0,0.07583287504375577,0.0,0.09173923190538018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785341452181218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10691055821621967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10185210579826454,0.0,0.0,0.08955122651499042,0.0,0.0,0.5542324296114834,0.0,0.07563984783803729,0.05407112633855017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05903442360348985
autism,stormvaader,2018/01/08,"Dad, looking for advice for his son Hi Reddit

My son is soon turning 3 and is non-verbal. He is the sweetest boy in the world and I am blessed to have him. He does not currently speak and does not respond to words (he can understand tone however at times). He has other traits such stimming but none of that is an issue to me, its just him being him. He loves physical activities with me, loves to climb at play centres (and he is extremely good at it), loves to go on journeys - he is no doubt an adventurer.

I live in the UK and have created a home based ABA programme with heavily vetted tutors and consultants. My aim with this is solely to teach him important life skills prior to him turning 5 as Ive read enough studies showing these key years are the most important for his development. I am choosing to go down this route as it is the only route I have read to increase the likelyhood of these key skills that isn't just based on anecdotal evidence. That being said, I am here on r/autism, I have searched for similar posts and read most definitely mixed reviews (to put it kindly). So my question to you reddit - do you think I am doing the right thing? Would you do anything different? Are there alternatives with grounded data on it? 

As a parent I am beginning to understand how terrible the NHS is with giving that early help. Its always 'wait and see'. I do not want to waste these critical years waiting, I wont get a second chance. I don't want my son to become another statistic. I am terrified he may grow up and not be able to express if he is sick or describe how he is sick. These are the kind of reasons I feel like I need to try.

P.S. I want to stress that ground rules for the therapy have been set so that they are not trying to ""cure"" him as I have read complete HORROR stories about ABA. All I want is for him to be able to grow up and be able to express himself and communicate via whatever medium suits him, it does not matter to me if it is not verbally (not saying that I would not enjoy to one day have a verbal conversation with my son). It is NOT, and WILL never be about or focused on compliance. It will only be about developing his communication skills. Also, sorry if parts of this post are incoherent or a ramble, I tried my best.

autism,DirtyReadingGlasses,2018/01/08,"Jumps, Coins, &amp; Pencils: 1st time Dad to a boy with a beautiful I want to understand Hello everyone

I'm new here and I made this post to be educated and talk to people the know what I am experiencing. I am a firdt time Dad. My Son is 3yrs old in Feb. and he has diagnosed with ASD. They told me he was ""medium"" I guess that means not as high on the spectrum as some. Nevertheless his ASD is very noticeable and apparent. I love this kid more than life itself I even named him after me.

Before I had my Son I knew little about Austism and now I strive to learn all I can and look to give him the most comfortable life possible. My Son has 3 sisters all under the age of 12 and they love him just as well. I can say I have we have no shame in saying there are things, expressions, habits, and behaviors we DON'T understand. This is where I come this community...

Some of the things are as followed;

 Jumping
- whenever he watches his favorite cartoon or show my Son jumps up and down repeatedly throughout very forcefully. No matter how we try to calm him down he can't stop or won't stop but if we take away his show he'll cry. I don't know how to teach him another way to channel his excitement. We are currently renting and we have neighbors and they complain. I dont know what to do there.

Coins
- my Son has a fascination  with holding coins in his hand.  He can hold them from the time he keeps up til he goes to sleep. We have to hide all coins from him because he would hold them so much it leaves colors and marks on his hand. I don't know why he has to hold them or what it does for him. Any ideas?

Pencils
- I mentioned jumping and another reason why it's a problem is because my Son like to have pencils in his hands at all times. Pencil, Pen, or Marker and couple with the jumping he can poke himself or stab himself but he just has to have one. I usually try to trade him for straws as an alternative because it's safer.

My Son goes to daycare and has a speech therapist that comes to his school everyday to help him with speech. At first it was a sensory overload for him going to school but he adjusted quickly over time. He doesn't understand sharing or group participation but he is learning. I think the school is doing a great job but it's hard to get him be as calm at home as he is at school. For example at school he sits down and play, at home to only time he will sit still is if he's not feeling well.

autism,beadmaze,2018/01/08,"It's the early hours in the morning... We've been up since 2am. Myself and my awesome autistic 3 year old. He has a hard time sleeping because his mind gets going and won't stop. If he lies there in bed it seems like it gets harder and harder to get to sleep so we just get up and do things. (Right now he is recreating famous paintings from one of his books with watercolours because the book was stuck in his head - he recites books as one of his stims). Im not really dping anything here...mostly we are just hanging out. In a couple hours he will get tired enough to sleep again. 

He goes through phases where he will sleep well and then others where sleep is really hard. We mostly just ride it out. If anyone (autistic or a parent) has any helpful anecdotes about handling similar sleep disruptions I would like to read about it!",3.688972795497186,5.337414079268296,3.936097560975611,89.31209193245779,72.84146341463416,6.509568480300188,24.20075046904315,7.010146845296331,0.8328288930581613,655,19,131,6,13,203,105,164,0.076,0.8290000000000001,0.095,0.6463,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,3,0,0,0,12,3,0,0,6,0,12,8,7,0,0,23,20,11,0,3,7,1,2,2,0,4,1,0,1,0,7,11,0,1,1,4,0,3,2,0,1,2,3,2,10,3,20,13,2,24,0,0,0,0,16,11,0,5,12,79,17,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909351310153184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08132534501685326,0.0,0.09571167644890202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14180070644275888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12869272765075135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12017738383022734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038309733057321,0.0,0.06610058753028727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20837846879018407,0.0,0.119365690731333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795888424735846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2290801484810479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256327331392018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11364454945563968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743805012370792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12204581163214698,0.0,0.1576267906097705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12914640822646636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633959922736607,0.0,0.14901992571322278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09932650290908554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058825484054911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09621128256167688,0.0,0.698352725601943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09723880009620642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726994988619693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782020277770205,0.13367907960800005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045749720569822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262195467062643,0.0,0.0,0.07489861892884639
autism,Asnerek,2018/01/08,"Training your ability to perform daily tasks I have always had a real problem with my executive function and am probably one my own worst enemy when it comes to trying to plan my daily/weekly activities and chores. 

During my treatment for a traumatic experience in my youth, my psychologist and I got to the concept of the mind being divided in different ego's (child ego, adult ego etc.) during a brainstorm session, about why I seemed to be unable to use the tools I had learned to use over the years when I encountered a similar situation as one that relates to my childhood trauma. 

A while ago about a year after I had this conversation with my therapist, I started reading a book about autism that discusses the more recently idea that is called mas1p, which explores the idea of an autistic person as someone with a spectrum of developmental ages within a single person. 

Long story short this got me thinking about how I could learn to do certain things I really wanted to do in my daily routine that I never seemed to get around doing because I always came back to my ""safe"" routine of spending my free time which often feels very wasteful and compulsive.

So starting January first I made a schedule of monday to saturday with 5 tasks of which I could pick 3 to 4 daily. The tasks in my first version where 1 indoor sports activity, 1 outdoor activity of 1 hour, cooking a meal, reading 15 minutes and doing a mindfulness/meditation exercise. If I completed the task I put down a smilyface, very straightforward positive reinforcement without any negative consequences or tasks that would be moved to the next day.

Now I am a 33 your old man, and not a 4 to say max 7 your old this kind of schedule would be normally targeted at in terms of the simplicity, but I realized that my executive function is so limited that within the concept of differing developmental ages in myself, my executive function very well might be that of a 4 year old rather than a adult. 

If we have a spectrum of ages within ourselves and we want to train that part of ourselves it might be needed to ignore your adult ego that feels insulted by being treated like a child. If that part of your brain has the limited learning capacity of a child, you have to teach it to yourself as if you are that age.

So far I have cooked every day, read 15 minutes every day and then did one other activity, some days I did 3 and some days I completed them all. For the first time in god knows how many ways I've tried to ""act normal"" I think I finally found a way to target my executive function. I don't know if I also will grow or if this part of me will ever reach a different age level, but it is interesting to test it out and I hope some of you are helped by this approach.

autism,0neTrickPhony,2018/01/09,"Social needs, or rather, the relative lack thereof. I'm not sure whether this is an effect of my diagnosed autism, my ADHD-PI, or my depression, so I'm wondering if y'all have the same thing going on.

I am not a social person. At all. I'm not shy by a wide margin - I'm very friendly, fairly charismatic, understanding, etc. when I'm in social situations, and I make friends easily. But I don't *keep* those friends, instead choosing to stick to myself after getting tired of the novelty of being around people.

This all said, I would do poorly in a rural area where people aren't around. I can't really enjoy living in a place unless I have *access* to people, even if I don't use that access. I'm basically an urban hermit. And I don't mind. Sometimes I get lonely, and that's when I go out and talk to people I've never met before. But those days are few and far between.

How many of y'all have this same personality trait? Is this a trait common in some forms of autism, or is this from something else?",1.9237128712871296,4.119678351485149,4.004445544554454,84.34191584158418,79.84158415841584,6.4162376237623775,20.4960396039604,7.554174236665415,0.8348091089108909,785,21,153,12,20,268,118,202,0.087,0.84,0.073,-0.4086,0,2,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,2,0,1,10,7,0,0,10,0,16,2,0,4,4,40,34,18,0,6,13,0,0,0,3,1,2,1,0,2,10,8,0,1,4,0,1,2,9,2,0,0,2,1,16,5,23,30,9,22,0,2,0,0,13,14,0,7,6,109,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1610468016264638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23858399218038945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402755860200145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08642151266616314,0.0,0.11541747360316695,0.13601126841721276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11194317099807792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494499144199785,0.08850839716637443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3105935405994741,0.0,0.1400231484176727,0.0,0.15231515532379994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11910893786498206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183280124526549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944872974804606,0.1358590523871208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1353058687815799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993622893582252,0.1033521680572718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3716060834141921,0.23401429825392164,0.1400056887386798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08584641218563467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12746851795375758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15062614286216938,0.0,0.409800695351885,0.0,0.10316284817520036,0.13253341090653642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12629721122304352,0.0,0.0,0.10770736232575544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902632229543796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1540179182575766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13950291983322066,0.0,0.1157364557659948,0.0,0.11056735775481837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453216529487301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09519261725961342,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,ghostofafrog,2018/01/09,"Discrimination within reddit You ever get in trouble for merely mentioning autism elsewhere on Reddit?
I find this to be true IRL especially. I'm a support worker, so when I talk about what I do, or autism in general, I've been shut down a couple times cause its a topic people seem to have a problem with talking about rationally.

On Reddit, obviously that problem is exacerbated by the Mod system, where comments can be removed, or you can be banned, without much cross dialogue. A lot of mods are uncomfortable with disabilities, I find.

I'm of the persuasion that the more you treat people as 'other' the more segregated the community becomes. If you treat autism as a topic as though its unwanted, you're alienating those with autism who want to be a bigger part of your community.

Sorry, I'm just tired of being warned and banned from other boards for mentioning autism. Usually I'm okay with it causeits the internet and it doesn't really matter, but I just got kicked from my fav sub for it, kinda perterbed.",5.750924369747898,7.578751048128343,6.719820473644003,70.67536096256686,67.93048128342247,9.620932009167305,29.93468296409473,9.957137785484203,3.2172447669977093,814,31,135,20,14,271,117,187,0.102,0.8190000000000001,0.079,-0.033,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,5,0,1,9,8,0,0,13,1,13,1,0,1,3,30,22,12,0,5,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,13,6,0,2,3,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,2,0,11,5,29,15,5,16,0,0,0,0,11,9,0,6,4,97,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20844467995313468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19388441626664488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20883339148325925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17072300563702564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34500355628753304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09860705224196901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15094985230421404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16045705687149986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874307307149786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20438328038233528,0.0,0.26169230512768504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.361190758360454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209094602832982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17181865740243304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112751042391618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21417598875730806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30339856298674633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18543269210432184,0.0,0.11005379414745188,0.2169248882552243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2078666341130231,0.0,0.11132170118032107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18193528930629574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,iamanobodyfornow,2018/01/09,"5 year old starting IEP. I can't sleep. I am so anxious. Tomorrow is her first day of school. I am worried about everything.

What if its traumatic for her?
Will she cry as the bus pulls away? Will she ask for me? 

Will the teachers be nice? Will she be ok? I'm used to her daily, but will they know how to calm her?

Will the teachers remember that she needs her hand held so she doesn't run off? 

Can I put my trust in everyone else? I have to.  This is scary.

autism,OliAlvey,2018/01/09,Speaking/Texting Nuerotypicals Right so I'm very close with this person even though I met her a month ago and I've told her a lot about myself. Firstly I've been told by many that I'm getting too close too fast which although I can see why they'd think that I feel it has helped my depression. Anyway I seem to frequently fall out with her and many other people. The thing is unlike how you'd expect with someone with autism it's over text not in person. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I tend to mirror people's ways of talking when I'm lost and it works sometimes. But she knows I do that as I've told her. I guess she doesn't really understand autism too well but I just feel like I'm not able to improve how I speak to nuerotypical people and I also feel I'm misunderstood massively by them. I guess part of it could be my depression Because I can never express it like nuerotypicals do. But even so I just don't know how to improve talking to some people. I feel very alone at times Because of this and I feel that maybe because I've got so close to her so fast I'm scared of losing her Because of how much she's become a part of my daily life. I know the fear of not being able to predict is common when on the spectrum so I can kind of understand that but she doesn't. So I feel like I need to learn to speak better with nuerotypicals and I also need to explain ASD better to this girl if we are to last as friends,2.303355481727575,3.8547087308970127,3.532178073089703,91.18317076411962,76.30897009966777,6.4106843853820585,22.33900332225913,7.087006719466742,0.5619418205980065,1132,31,247,12,25,368,139,301,0.119,0.8029999999999999,0.078,-0.9033,0,1,0,0,0,0,13.0,1,1,2,6,25,15,0,2,6,0,20,1,0,4,1,55,55,29,0,5,10,0,6,3,1,0,1,2,0,3,17,16,0,0,16,0,0,1,8,7,1,1,7,9,39,8,36,43,5,23,0,4,1,0,29,9,0,6,15,162,56,2,0.19041329173351587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843949471205813,0.0,0.0,0.09860537229587976,0.0,0.15227344060486514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23214835057694916,0.10514826035355693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16840508276627275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601475968932396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16400268915474764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257661833594628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713394562322434,0.2888360447391862,0.1360312936607984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098272433792672,0.0,0.0,0.07355641842636085,0.0,0.04974154295598477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614545199226502,0.0,0.2097617082287955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06381500785452454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991430708768372,0.20929233079791607,0.07760612344315973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724726957071205,0.13953947429117958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065118838080408,0.1039293005817013,0.08094128569404263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930491912698752,0.0956478724161207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07599303640646198,0.0,0.06998783932914206,0.1411890431023432,0.07342923459598621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20619903930757652,0.0,0.2640172024373557,0.16626154175866156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06099181524774195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08130595536993618,0.0,0.0,0.09531846144628336,0.0,0.0758673703098124,0.08667255468554808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066828208566049,0.0,0.09416180718985484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15304699116810294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06325106505194056,0.061004574395549585,0.0935400461735458,0.0,0.055515760836471306,0.0,0.0,0.27292209035058673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19822695197999546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15711090737328087,0.0,0.07557060398443956,0.0,0.0,0.08560220849273023,0.0,0.08590918944828235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693115720966794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040935214656436,0.0,0.0

Meeting with the principal, plus the regular IEP meetings.

Listening to his interests, and encouraging him to do what he liked. Getting him into a charter school so he could take classes that were more tailored to his interests.  Working to get a regular diploma (which took so much extra work on the part of myself and the school!).

And today....it paid off.  He is excited and looking forward to going to college in the fall. PLUS, he earned an academic scholarship.  I am beaming on the inside.",6.1447007182761375,8.328012396648049,6.338328012769357,72.3926955307263,67.49162011173185,8.913168395849961,36.80806065442937,9.424239791934726,4.024000478850759,805,43,120,17,14,257,108,179,0.01,0.885,0.105,0.9458,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,1,3,5,7,0,0,12,0,14,1,0,0,2,28,30,14,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,3,1,3,0,0,7,17,0,1,2,0,2,5,2,0,0,2,12,4,12,7,24,13,5,24,0,0,1,0,26,8,0,3,14,92,19,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12164474169185252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546392427366787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836742231971818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2388008790252653,0.0,0.08658804726510137,0.0,0.12185388569885006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16218695902157226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443397999433267,0.0,0.0,0.13483123328467378,0.12794158636408967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16162679933410992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11199999410062042,0.0,0.2350143659354013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16498788509096038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3083870250100699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455357318279975,0.12245886051241354,0.0,0.0,0.17423361438601107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08884064640051323,0.0,0.14441670992135952,0.2911674637784004,0.33854867348353235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15860910741888745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986416113935937,0.0,0.244423340617702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22183555715801187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3924518917735909
autism,godofsadness1996,2018/01/09,"Autism and OCD High functioning autistic here and I was wondering how closely linked are autism and OCD if at all. I was wondering this to myself as I am recently diagnosed (at 21) and since I was around 14 I was plagued with obsessive thoughts and even compulsions at one point similar to the kind of people with OCD, though I learnt to manage it however it is always there. Looking back now I wonder if this was the autism, well a symptom of it. Does anyone else have any similar experiences?

autism,bongsucker420,2018/01/10,"Really struggling right now. I'm 15 and I have been diagnosed with Autism since I was about 7. I have a sister who is 12 years old and has severe autism that she cannot communicate at all. My mother has a lot of mental illnesses including depression and she has had many psychotic breakdowns.
Its really tough lately, I've become pretty dependant on cannabis smoking at least 2 grams of it a day for about 6 months. But lets get back to what I'm saying. My autism has really sort have gotten worse since, I am sure I have depression and I have tried to tell loads of people but I just cant quite manage to explain it. My moods been the worst it has been and I just break down in tears all of the time. About 2 years ago I was borderline obese, I was happy then. I used to be able to eat a lot but since I've felt like this I've completely lost my appetite. Also I've just lost enjoyment in everything I do and used to do, I cannot focus anymore at all.

autism,onceiwasnothing,2018/01/10,"A question on comedy in your opinions? I really don't know much about autism. I think it is a very literal way of living from my understanding.
I always wondered how that might effect comedy and humour in a person with autism. Are there any traits that you find different to the public in general?
Or is it individual like most others?

autism,daddysbluekitten,2018/01/11,"Needing advice regarding my partner Hi, I'm the wife of my husband (obviously..lol). We recently discovered/admitted that my husband has some form of high functioning autism. On the surface you wouldn't see it but when you see his brain work, live with him constantly and see his habits/breakdowns it's obvious. His father also has it.  
  
I'm finding a great problem with handling him when he's gaming. He loves competitive computer/console games but it drives him bonkers when everyone doesn't play how he expects them to (as they're all at the same ""level"" in game and he doesn't get how someone the same level as him is playing so terribly). Hell start hitting himself, storm up the stairs punching them, throw things, make what I describe as tantrum grunts/noises as he stomps around. He plays with his brother on LoL and will even start yelling at him. It stresses me out so freaking much. I'm really calm and empathetic, I try to understand where he's coming from, talk him down but it seems I just escalate the issue and he's making me want to yell at him when that's not me at all.  
  
I'm wondering if there's any games that would be challenging/potentially competitive but maybe not multiplayer and more single player that I could see if he'd like. He gets so worked up over it *daily* and it's exhausting. Every time we have an honest chat over it, he knows the way he acts is ridiculous and will give it genuine effort for up to 48 hours before he reverts to blowing his top over lag/dumb teammates etc. I don't mind him playing video games, it's the imminent freak out every day that's making me lose my cool and I need to find him an alternative game or even another activity before I lose my mind.  
  
Thank you for any advice/suggestions.",4.226655708963403,6.050959408284028,4.897547666009206,82.24645518299366,71.78106508875742,8.202673679596758,28.790707867630946,8.841846274778883,2.32022647381109,1392,55,264,27,27,447,190,338,0.116,0.747,0.136,0.5088,0,0,0,0,1,0,41.0,2,3,2,6,16,22,3,1,11,2,15,3,1,5,3,55,42,30,0,10,10,5,0,1,1,4,1,2,0,1,18,18,0,0,6,12,0,4,6,11,0,0,0,7,39,11,35,34,10,40,1,2,4,1,52,24,1,6,12,160,57,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113727737927561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930711298574992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15828832922879366,0.12203731245186845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10360519598611538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19806605546018966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992148096910305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025331188160627,0.0,0.1257682539579166,0.0,0.09292204263631283,0.0,0.0,0.07505715429914195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979737267438302,0.15373923038232887,0.0,0.196114734167837,0.11120856975495444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21274319118436888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12161021870601695,0.1116448028369558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283122365834427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12296461558078566,0.0,0.0,0.11461342574327615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12147320597676553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639608378864238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056858663732006536,0.0,0.1027679754099821,0.0,0.0,0.26040473847277884,0.0,0.0,0.10503984792517426,0.0,0.2330588844179073,0.0,0.11692197298325005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23502651498241545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08555460829904242,0.17259245884031588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.111362438385801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745576790623305,0.0,0.1149137852528696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3709674830228235,0.10595035562573496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09861060638746748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647524184302089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133315884660428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935439321048016,0.0,0.10714946928119147,0.0,0.0,0.07731943358855456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786363485877664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07901615152128925,0.0,0.0,0.12115839975574152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06864547778005045,0.0923790973515404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621197421657498,0.16945584999230287,0.0,0.0,0.08267486579868008,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,a-bicycle,2018/01/11,"How do you feel about the TV show, The Good Doctor? The Good Doctor is a medical drama about an autistic physician with savant abilities in surgery and medicine.

The show has been lauded for representing autistic people and showing that someone can still succeed in a field despite their disability. However, they have chosen a gentleman with savant abilities, something that is only found in 10% of people with autism, according to Applied Behavioural Analysis Edu, as they call themselves. 

Anyway, I thought that was fair enough until I saw the promo for the next episode, in which he drives his partner's muscle car without a licence (his partner telling him ""you have autism, you are not blind""), nearly smashing into a tree, and later downs consecutive shots of Tequila. I have little knowledge of autism, remember, but I do recall hearing that autistic people don't take well to breaks of their routine. 

I probably should have made that clear, I have no idea how accurate the behaviours depicted in the show are of someone who actually has autism, but it seems really suspicious that they are getting it seriously wrong. The reception should always lie with sufferers and their families though, so how do you see it?",11.129763033175356,10.273415364928912,9.639947867298575,63.53034834123223,56.48815165876778,12.610616113744078,44.32274881516588,11.602472056035307,5.435289668246447,986,49,145,22,10,304,132,211,0.091,0.845,0.064,-0.8696,1,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,0,4,6,1,10,7,0,0,15,0,21,5,0,4,1,27,31,13,0,2,4,0,1,0,2,2,5,1,0,2,11,9,0,0,7,7,0,2,4,3,1,0,6,5,19,4,26,23,1,16,0,1,3,0,20,9,0,1,4,109,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.15595557675610955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13297819214824375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16318813618692582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3271531504470321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16513075895584126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15065857667595406,0.0,0.0808068463897434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17522798889500926,0.0,0.0,0.08349630790289865,0.0,0.0,0.2680890874563483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801221848849891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18041074563784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16017578334449828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512200320969274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16099596328880048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699641831821158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215458780267959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3323850696470863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17230670566947634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10238104977942676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810383010561548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12735120253058335,0.14548881845420572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27082005578243906,0.12303275612233493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127627802853849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1201603669578995,0.0,0.13968462894990588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15701661091351468,0.12687459981396787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436921320233627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15405515720158475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17473170719057154,0.0,0.0

I work at a small company called Camp Createability where we strive to teach/employee Adults with Autism with a beginning focus of teaching students how to film and make their own movies.

autism,TheSilverHook,2018/01/11,"What should I consider when buying a gift for an autistic boy? And his Mom? My son's friend is turning 5 in a couple of weeks, and I want to make sure that I get him a considerate gift. 

I know that his triggers are loud noises, busy places and that he likes lights, body brushes, heavy blankets/toys and beanie babies.  He is advanced in reading and writing.

I'm thinking about getting him a collection of Dr. Seuss books and rainbow nylon scarves. I'd also like to get something to help at home. For my 5 year old (neurotypical) I use a timer for transition between activities. It changes from green, to orange, to red. There is an alarm, but there is volume control.  

How do these sound? Is there more I should consider (the mom hasn't given any specific requests or suggestions)? I am open to suggestions. Are there specific good websites for purchasing gifts that you would recommend?",4.080363636363637,6.489901157575762,4.361818181818183,83.38272727272731,73.78787878787878,7.551515151515153,29.78787878787879,8.447377352677275,2.408624242424243,701,31,127,13,15,219,114,165,0.011,0.8290000000000001,0.161,0.959,0,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,0,1,0,2,8,6,0,1,8,0,13,2,1,5,1,23,24,11,0,4,2,3,0,2,1,3,1,2,1,1,7,7,0,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,6,14,5,18,20,1,10,0,0,2,0,17,5,0,1,6,76,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15315773850878425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302395413815992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127345221977228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20260179135788825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148049326138917,0.0,0.21191221847568045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14796716557053158,0.0,0.30018244280084005,0.0,0.0,0.1606371171415211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12837120179455652,0.0,0.1921092520322207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10525387731738507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18713309627075247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12784047259151474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4486096618983204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20096705673082588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20009667509274293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19157090706592667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14744074400779728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18050446568915016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227176928031498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083177621719932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16541099289914651,0.0,0.0,0.11296291504943405,0.0,0.15362505314815195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604965897190952,0.0,0.0,0.1233320078586722
autism,nilknarf91,2018/01/11,"Request for advice: 26yo and possible autism Hi, I've always struggled in social situations, never knowing what to say, sitting in uncomfortable silence. It even affects my work quite badly and I get anxious, shaky and sweaty when talking to someone higher than me, and even amongst peers that I don't know. 
I find it very difficult to talk to anybody I don't know, and takes me a few weeks/months to come out of my shell when there is a new coworker. 
Does this seem like autism symptoms, and would you recommend I get tested? The only issue is I'm in the British army and am worried I may get kicked out if diagnosed.

autism,autisticteddybear,2018/01/11,"I need some help here. (16yo autistic daughter) Editing the post now! No idea why the pictures aren’t showing but I’ll try again. 

2nd edit: [hopefully this link works](https://imgur.com/a/ZZV5y) 

3rd edit: god I feel silly, the images hadn’t uploaded when I’d shared the 2nd link. Australian internet being especially patchy right now. 

Final edit (for the love of god let it please be that): [here’s the link (again)](https://m.imgur.com/a/oUjHF) 

LTL, FTP, on mobile, using a throwaway. 

My daughter is 16 and autistic. She sleeps with this teddy bear that her grandfather had gotten her shortly after she was born. She has to sleep with this bear, or she will not sleep at all. It’s to the point where she’s stayed up for literal DAYS without him. This is especially dangerous as she’s epileptic and lack of sleep can induce some of her seizures. This bear understandably is getting old and has some noticeable wear and tear over the years, and I have zero idea what I’ll do when it inevitably has to be thrown out... if ANYONE can help me ID this bear, it’d be just so appreciated that I can’t put it into words. I’ve tried searching the specific numbers on his tag, but nothing like him shows up. He’s fluffy and non battery operated - with little pellets/beads in his feet. 

[Here’s a link to some pictures I managed to get](https://imgur.com/a/tSD1F)

The final picture was hard to get, so here is a transcription of the tag.

autism,misssundaymorning81,2018/01/11,"Needed support and advice My 4 year old son was diagnosed with ASD this past November. TBH..... As a single mom I feel like I already don't know what I'm doing and now, I REALLY have no idea what I'm doing. Every day is a roller coaster of emotions from my son to include depression. I try my best to see a trigger coming and redirect but when we're in public I'm not as fortunate. He's been kicked out of 3 preschools because of his behavioral issues that become safety concerns to teachers and students (hitting, biting, pulling hair, screaming, throwing things, breaking things). I'm looking for any helpful advice on how best to help him when he is in the midst of his episodes (emotional meltdown/tantrum/etc) as well as best discipline practices. He already attend OT and will hopefully start ABA soon.",5.372643540669858,6.8926450921052655,5.7135645933014345,78.71086124401914,68.47368421052633,8.158851674641149,34.87081339712919,8.575989854853784,3.094018421052632,642,32,109,10,11,205,111,152,0.066,0.723,0.211,0.9776,0,0,0,0,1,0,24.0,0,0,0,3,6,9,0,0,4,0,9,2,1,2,0,18,23,13,0,2,2,3,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,6,8,0,1,3,1,0,4,3,2,1,0,2,5,10,7,19,19,4,18,0,1,2,0,12,4,0,1,10,66,16,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28215438444034524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31863289721830296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817689798351636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08800692335255282,0.15944588650475805,0.0,0.0,0.4545238322278989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12436241156962932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310703595725947,0.0,0.12434610935794918,0.14653302943252133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3247947857010632,0.0,0.0,0.16101128210358676,0.0,0.0,0.12163838195316395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07299806808201686,0.103138321724033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935370203075084,0.0,0.0,0.1433924924124835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16297673379405708,0.0,0.15068530458330456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934225709135077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07053213911466102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12123486838496972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690849973187704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704890440657716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514925652947471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13781798837151918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924874460025402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504460535208078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218619057745358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16382994472739731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1918267046105366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09801810006779124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12980642736260722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09296987554774837
autism,Malzypants,2018/01/11,"Help me with my 4.5 year old (toilet training) My son is on the spectrum and fully potty trained except for bowel movements. He will only use a diaper at night once we've put him to bed.

We have tried removing diapers, encouraging the potty, showing him where poop goes, rewards, etc...no success. He has used the toilet for bowel movements a few times and then it abruptly stopped and he went back to using a diaper. 

I don't know how to remove his desire for a diaper and have him use the toilet? Urinating is not an issue, he is an expert in that regard. 

If anyone has any insight I would certainly appreciate it. His 2 year old younger brother is fully potty trained and sets a good example, and we try to use him as a peer model.

I don't want to rush him but I'm very tired of wiping his almost five year old butt :)",3.258180112570358,4.799622829268298,5.015365853658538,81.57428705440903,73.75609756097559,7.4851782363977515,25.4202626641651,8.139509932561175,1.6424020637898693,640,21,122,10,13,218,105,164,0.042,0.838,0.12,0.8735,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,0,0,2,3,5,0,0,12,0,12,6,5,6,1,27,21,11,0,4,4,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,3,9,0,1,2,1,0,7,3,0,0,1,1,0,16,5,15,18,1,24,0,0,0,1,18,4,1,2,12,73,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14330795242977645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973223964876472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006860438813417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11004579693354284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15960988947217128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003719484295206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095926266831977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14937378608132912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865168651148198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13430275127372684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4505220619321739,0.15241169055935616,0.0,0.10884461118124257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14386905237697656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964967398524595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08345089762457797,0.16448843751588982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19432996140018774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6180225323113948,0.0,0.11808400037542904,0.08441231818092597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13266806940215756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1016640469707924,0.0,0.0,0.2764820831164677

I'm a manager and I am faced with the terrible task of laying off a staff member who is autistic. I have made it clear that I disagree with the decision, but I have no choice. It has nothing to do with their performance. They will be provided with a letter to simplify applying for unemployment, a glowing reference, and severance pay.

Is there anything I can do or say to soften this blow for my employee? It will be such a huge change in routine.

autism,OldTectonics,2018/01/11,"Why do people think that Charlie from The Perks of Being a Wallflower is autistic? What specific actions make Charlie autistic? The most common thing I keep hearing that surprises me is that Charlie is autistic. How is Charlie autistic? What specifically does he do that make people think he's autistic? Just because someone is socially awkward and smart does not mean that they have Aspergers. Otherwise, autism would be diagnosed way more. Does Charlie have social anxiety? Yes. Depression? Maybe. PTSD? Definitely. But not autism. I fail to see how Charlie has autism. He seems to understand other people’s emotions very well. Could someone explain to me how Charlie has autism? And be specific. Granted, I've only watched the movie and not the book.

autism,JohnnyJohnson11,2018/01/12,"Need Help! My fiancee nephew is autistic I ( male 27) am looking for any advice on how to handle autistic meltdowns of a 7 year old. My fiancee (23 f) and I babysit her 2 nephews about every other weekend and the oldest one has been diagnosed with autism. I'd say probably about 80% of the time he is acting like any other 7 year old, but the rest of the time he has these intense meltdowns. Things get thrown, he tries to hit us, screaming and yelling, the whole works. Another thing i should mention is We have a 5 month old son that has had some things thrown at him during these fits. I am just looking for the correct way to handle these situations without making it worse.  

The kids home life is God awful. His parents are the type of parents that do JUST enough for them not to taken away by CPS. They don't work with him on his fits at all. I want to start working with him since he's over here so much and figure why the hell not?

autism,malu2kucing,2018/01/12,"How do I tell my cousin's parents that he doesn't have to hug me? Hi r/autism,

I was hoping to seek some advice regarding my young cousin (who I'll call J) and my family who doesn't seem to understand how to make him feel more at ease during family get-togethers.

My 6yo cousin J has autism. To J, I probably come across as kind of a stranger and kind of intimating. I'm in my early 20s, and he only sees me at certain large family gatherings (which I can tell are already stressful for him), and even then, I'm absent from most of these, so I'm probably a total stranger to him. J's parents (my aunt and uncle) are always insistent that J hugs every person before saying goodbye. I can tell that J is super uncomfortable hugging me and a bunch of other family members, he usually hides behind his mom and become super shy, but his parents still tell him has to hug everyone before they leave the house.

I try to encourage some alternate ways of saying goodbye like waving, high fives, fist bumps, or just saying 'bye', and my dad does the same. Yet still, his parents won't let him leave until he actually hugs everyone. While I don't have autism, I feel uncomfortable with physical contact besides people I know very well, and even then I am only okay with certain forms of contact (a combination of PTSD and a different culture on my mom's side of the family), so I think I understand why he seems so uncomfortable and overwhelmed.

My dad and I see that J gets pretty stressed out being forced to hug us and other family members, so we want to say something to my aunt and uncle before a family party this weekend. Do you guys have any insight of what would be a polite way to say his to my aunt and uncle without insulting their parenting or seeming patronizing towards J? We would greatly appreciate any insight!

Apparently it's a tough concept for lots of kids like him, but I'm wondering if anyone has any tips they can share. He is in Kindergarten now and likes books (can read most 3-4 letter words), but math isn't his forte.

I've tried a few apps on my phone that teach more and less, but they aren't that helpful as they give you two options, and he just tries one, and if that one doesn't work, tries the other which ends up ""right.""

No vocal communication skills. Fed through a feeding tube. He can be violent when upset. He has no way to articulate because he has no verbal communication with him.
We’re implementing PAX and it is slowly taking. 
I work directly with the young man and I would love any kind of counsel and feedback with working with non verbal low function autistic children. I’ve never worked with anything like this before.

autism,pm_me_your_street,2018/01/13,"Autistic Adults, dealing with a break-up when you’re being left for someone else... I don’t even know how to explain what I want to say....

Today my boyfriend admitted to falling for a coworker and it’s over between us. I... he was still my “person” to me - I was blindsided by it. He was in my trust bubble and I am feeling like I’m out of control. 

I’ve had break ups before but they’ve been things I’ve been cautious with and seen coming. I’ve almost been dead emotionally to all of them. This one is the first one I haven’t had warning for, and I haven’t been able to protect myself. 

I don’t feel emotion a lot but I feel it all right now. I have no idea how to even explain that to someone who’s not autistic. But I am FEELING EVERYTHING. I keep feeling too much and then vomiting. I can’t sleep or eat. 

I don’t know what to do. How do I make this stop - it’s not that I’m surprised I feel sad. It just that I can’t stop feeling. I can’t stop the ... sensations. 

I feel wildly out of control and erratic. I’m terrified.

autism,deakers,2018/01/13,"Serious question about stimming So, I know many people that follow this subreddit have ASD, and I enjoy reading your posts as it gives me incredible insights. I work as an ABA therapist with kids with autism, and my older brother is on the spectrum as well. I've been around autism my whole life, and I truly love my job. However, not being in the spectrum myself, there's definitely things I don't understand.

Many people with autism stim, I see it all the time. I know it can be a source of comfort, but i have questions. Those of you that stim, how did it start? Meaning how did you develop it? What exactly do you gain from it besides comfort? What is your main circumstance makes you want to stim (this I know varies from one person to the next)? Do you ever change stims? Seriously, any info about stims would be great :D

autism,blueeyedboredpanda,2018/01/15,"Adult sister of sibling with severe autism - any testing worth pursuing to define increased risk for autism if I decide to have children? My younger brother is 18 with very severe, non-verbal autism. I am thinking more and more about possiblity of having childen (or not) in future but before my and my partner take any decision I want to investigate how much my chances of having a child with autism are increased. I have seen what does it mean to care for a child with severe autism and it is one of my biggest fears to have a child with a similar level of disability as my brother (for which I will have to care for the rest of my life).

Is there any kind of genetic testing that is worth pursuing?

I did find those two threads below, however those are pretty old and was wondering if there is any new, relevant information that could be useful.

autism,kafoBoto,2018/01/15,"Could a bad memory also be a symptom of Autism? Hey, first time poster here, so I'm not really sure if it's the right place to ask. Seems like it.

So about a year ago I got diagnosed with ADD, my doctor also believes that I may show symptoms of Asperger, mainly in my problems living a regular life or in the area of social interaction. I never really believed him on that point, since I have really bad memory problems and afaik this is the opposite of the usual Asperger symptomatik, since Autists seem to have pretty decent working memories, except in a few areas like names, for example.

But my ADD medication never really took hold and while it made me more active it didn't really fix my memory issue. So last week I read something about how Autism sometimes can get misdiagnosed as ADD.

Could my memory problems also be a symptom of the autism?",6.454658385093168,7.122588409937888,7.546142857142858,69.63635714285715,65.52173913043478,11.160496894409938,30.385714285714286,11.00357731598739,3.6379137888198763,678,23,114,19,10,230,104,161,0.106,0.826,0.067,-0.754,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,2,10,8,0,0,11,0,10,7,0,2,3,26,18,14,0,6,5,0,0,2,0,1,7,0,0,0,7,6,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,5,0,1,4,0,12,3,17,9,3,20,0,0,0,0,6,9,0,5,12,78,19,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10120250348313914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738988635395208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10673109893850154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19065000509545346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25725510767955306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823067433465513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158774984631701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11685516217628268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711072429695806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0596477496107363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091310091817015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11916109438189855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09306166122537883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063980445698875,0.11155284066009093,0.0,0.10081189772506556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10802794563245467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150116352181398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761058599716165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11928062410157105,0.0,0.1079250864733399,0.0,0.0,0.11614928036735772,0.0,0.3277283230746456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141982861231288,0.0,0.3656927698665088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097498327948111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20786740952451305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18888089089561014,0.0,0.0,0.11637927748794885,0.0,0.08789163515634983,0.1129144687595406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760141471887616,0.3559908988812108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06657192368868692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12684417194831274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12573925152508506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09157819443354248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311522023366998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07352005655398232
autism,HollyJollyPaca,2018/01/15,"Autism and femininity (Newbie at Reddit, pardon me)
Do any ladies here have issues with people waving off your diagnoses or have a hard time believing you have ASD? It’s such a stereotype that people on the spectrum can be identified by physical appearance but for ladies it seems so much worse. If we wear make up, have nice hair, and dress nice, certainly we can’t be autistic? But if we’re taking a chill day, dressed super casual, maybe have zits or anything that we hide with make up, etc, it’s suddenly like we are because “autistic people don’t care about their physical appearance”.

Because of it, I’m always paranoid of how I look to others while out in town if I feel as if I don’t look “pretty enough” to pass as a neurotypical girl. It’s as if everybody would judge me differently if my hair or face wasn’t at a certain level. Anybody else feel this way???",7.135833333333332,6.6235547261904815,7.423333333333336,75.08833333333338,64.23809523809524,10.8,32.95238095238096,10.25414643259724,3.1810666666666663,686,24,130,14,9,224,111,168,0.065,0.743,0.192,0.9781,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,4,2,1,1,5,8,0,0,6,0,15,6,4,3,2,31,27,19,0,7,11,0,5,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,9,9,0,0,3,1,0,3,4,0,0,0,1,7,13,8,20,23,3,18,0,0,2,0,8,10,0,12,5,84,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525582512220884,0.0,0.0,0.12468131522169565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15087783098474322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22353158793127792,0.0,0.0,0.20656773933507125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18693308857917248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182427631956134,0.0,0.0,0.18609195450577048,0.0,0.19155715965670853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15316174701573232,0.0,0.0,0.1894450466073062,0.2044788420752224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18541011834855206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642416712435803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19136520246527453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957341340823415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3079283039377569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447692627321424,0.0,0.1841953281191796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13478013367091884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3813263222977367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18652841910347365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1669109750792673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785309570809706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106910310964076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455312266280202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18684486007412374,0.13024347472462328,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,rachelannedee,2018/01/15,"Went on a date with someone who is autistic. Hey guys. I recently went on a date with someone who is autistic. He had mentioned to me once before that he was tested for it, but never elaborated on the outcome of that. His older brother is very low-functioning as I've been told, and he said his parents did also think that he was. There wasn't anything in specific that I didn't like about him. It was mostly his mannerisms. No eye contact, very nervous, to the point it was uncomfortable. I had suggested we get coffee after, but since this wasn't planned prior, it threw him off a bit. He did speak about things I felt were inappropriate for a first date, but again, he was very nervous and it might have been word vomit. His attention span was very short, and he kept losing his train of thought. When we text, the conversation flows really nicely, and we have so much in common. He did invite me over to his house, but I declined because I do not really know him, and was uncomfortable with that. He didn't understand why I was uncomfortable, and I had to explain it to him. I do work with children who are autistic, but have never been romantically involved with an adult who has autism. I enjoyed his company, and would love to go out with him again. He's very intelligent, and incredibly handsome. I need advice on how to overcome the barrier that is obviously present.

autism,neidrporffor,2018/01/16,"Brother (28) trying to get diagnosis (UK) 
So my 28 year old brother recently confided in me that he thinks he may have ASD and so we sought help from his doctor who seemed reluctant to pursue a diagnosis. He didn't have much awareness of autism until very recently and since looking it up has realised that a lot of the symptoms (in adults and in children) apply to him. 

My brother has very bad social anxiety and as a child (and to some extent now) engaged in repetitive behaviours (e.g. watching the same movie over and over), had sensory issues (very strong reactions to loud noises and new foods), and had trouble in school which meant he had to repeat exams and school years. 

We had a bit of a hectic childhood so I think the opportunity for a diagnosis was missed when he was a child as teachers and family were looking to explain his symptoms away as natural for a kid that has experienced a lot of stress as a young child. Also, this was the 90s in a small low income area and I don't think awareness of autism was very high. 

As an adult he has done well, making slow but steady progress in education (reaching as far as a part time masters course) and holding the same part time job for nearly 10 years. However recently he has suffered with severe depression which derailed his education and stopped him from completing his masters. He is also being pressured by family to find a 'real' job but is having trouble considering leaving his job where he is comfortable and where they make certain exceptions for him due to his issues with social interaction. He also says he wishes he had friends and seems quite lonely, but doesn't know how to go about making and keeping friends. 

We recently visited his GP (I went along as he doesn't like going to the doctors and has trouble speaking to strangers) and made him aware of all this. The GP responded that he doesn't think my brother is autistic (this was only their second meeting) and told my brother that if he did seek and get a diagnosis the ""stigma would live with him forever"". He only seemed to take note when my brother mentioned that he does tend to lash out and get aggressive when he feels cornered in by people. He then said he would ask for a referral but told my brother he would need written evidence from his employers, family, and previous teachers that they think my brother might have ASD before the referral team would even consider meeting him. My brother seemed put off by this for obvious reasons and the doctor then asked again if he really wanted a diagnosis as ""there's no cure for autism"". 

This was an NHS doctor, so I understand they need to have some filtering process before forwarding my brother onto a specialist team, but is asking him to provide evidence normal procedure? 

Also if anyone has the details of any UK based charities/organisations that can help with this it would be much appreciated.

Anyone else who was diagnosed as an adult or has a relative who was any advice would be great.

What little I have read so far, has really opened my eyes in understanding what my son is going through.  My son has less than a dozen words (most are about trains), so any insight is invaluable to me.

Also, I would like to apologise in advance if I say anything on this subreddit that is offensive.  Though my son's diagnosis did not really come as a surprise, I have not done as much research as I should have.  Please correct me if i say anything incorrect/out of line, I promise to learn from my mistakes.",5.5790422077922095,6.446320767857145,6.310411255411258,77.02246753246756,67.51190476190476,10.394805194805196,33.12987012987013,10.436869588844218,3.518064285714286,691,30,131,18,11,227,105,168,0.032,0.8220000000000001,0.145,0.9457,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,1,7,9,1,0,4,0,20,3,1,0,2,24,29,14,0,7,7,4,0,3,0,3,2,2,0,0,9,4,0,0,5,1,0,3,2,2,0,1,3,3,21,7,23,23,4,19,0,0,1,0,12,12,0,7,5,96,30,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25920752854240703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22042026716191454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11332000294789345,0.0,0.2667322826626741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13960512374143286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3289862499117046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16584932879204833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1548605811654652,0.0,0.15853120888526484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467256249212801,0.15546804611849166,0.092105588635835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10862912405590644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375311290100828,0.16243226036694913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11913682903905153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17006053563088935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17789930994505992,0.0,0.0,0.15521400082487966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16210941035257573,0.0,0.20764668649875076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2577620653397352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29841637422402384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592285830810391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687159563385716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17575317909660246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23025343808614265,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,andromachenon,2018/01/16,"Going About My Diagnosis Hi, my name is Macey and I've had three medical professionals all tell me they strongly believed I was autistic and that I should get tested, but my mother would not allow it. Now, she has me at a new therapist who talks to me like I am faking everything about me. My awkwardness, my sensitivities, my misunderstandings, my stimming, even my meltdowns. To her, it is all fake and for attention. My question is, how do I go about getting her to believe me so after all these years of being told to, I can finally get my diagnosis on paper?",4.757780373831778,6.330745093457947,6.388866822429907,73.07993574766357,70.02803738317758,9.46214953271028,31.132009345794398,9.827888789773867,3.2087766355140195,443,19,80,11,8,152,74,107,0.107,0.8490000000000001,0.043,-0.7963,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,1,7,5,0,1,1,0,12,1,0,2,3,15,18,6,0,2,2,1,0,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,5,3,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,3,0,1,3,0,24,2,12,12,3,9,0,0,0,0,12,2,0,1,6,67,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5128894111285522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15033788047513932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2045661202688741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2493416369416451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3567590876885677,0.0,0.2587182498919014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11120142816977527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2292986537450663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21983245278843144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2549814343067435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18294870410074152,0.19894596555589933,0.0,0.0,0.2642791203611019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174963491888696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16169150921115558,0.0,0.0,0.14657690901546636
autism,KurNeko,2018/01/17,"I REALLY NEED some advice! So, my whole life I've been struggling on the social part of life.
And I'll get straight to my main question! I really need some tips, advice, personal experience, books,... about this subject for people with asperger! 

First, I'll give some insight on myself and such though. 

So as long as I can remember, people have always seem to distance themselve from me and disliked me for some reasons.
See, it's not like these people don't give me a chance, but it's just that after a while they start acting different, distancing themselves and most of the time also disliking me!

See, I don't know what I'm doing wrong and for some reason no one wants to tell me what I do wrong.. no matter who asks them, where, when,... NO, never! 
It's always been like that, even as a kid.. 
I mean, I've always had some friends, but not that many..

See, I always try to be as good of a person I can be to others, I look them in the eyes when I'm talking to them or them to me, I let them talk too and ask question about themselves.. 
Often I even try to ask open questions, but many don't seem to go further.. 
Also no one ever texts me or calls me first, I'm always the one that has to.. but like always always! Fun thing is though, it's not like they try to stop the conversation asap. They sometimes continue it themselves and answer with decently sized answers. 

I think I'm the main problem.. I don't know why or whatever, but I have to be, right?
I mean, yeah, not everyone will like you, but if almost everyone starts disliking you after they give you a chance and it's been like this for my whole life, then I must be the source of the problem, not?
They're part of the problem though, I could try to fix myself if they would just say what's wrong about me, but they don't. 

Anyway, I've been getting prof. help (extra help at school, psychologist, psychiatrist) for about 9 months now, but they don't seem to make any progress on the social part though! 

I just really need help..
So anyone wanna help me out?
Any advice you can give me, any books I should read,...?
I would prefer advice from other aspies, but NTs (normal people) are appreciated too! :)

autism,FatManSkills,2018/01/17,"What the general public should know about people with autism/ASD? I'm in the process of pitching a video item on the subject of those with autism locally (which I am one of), and am trying to find my focus. I have my own ideas for this but am hoping to get a consensus from others as well.

What do you think are aspects of people living with autism the the general public should know, might not know, or that maybe people get wrong? If you had an opportunity to put certain knowledge about people living with autism out to educate, what would you deem most important for people to know?

autism,shessorad,2018/01/17,"Hyposensitivity--anyone on here affected by this currently or in childhood? Can someone offer insight into the child I am working with? I suspect he is hyposensitive. I don't think he senses pain, cold, hot, etc as quickly as neuro-typical children. As such, I am always reminding him to drink water, go to the toilet, take his jacket off/put it on, etc. 

His Occupational Therapist told me it's because ""he lacks expressive ability"", but I kind of think that's bullshit. He knows how to say ""hot"", ""cold"", and ""ouch"".

autism,unkn0wn123,2018/01/17,"My Eyes are Often Always Wide.. I read this is a sign of autism? Hi, I'm 25 and on multiple medication (which I'm by my own wanting to coming off) so some of it could be that. But they are things like benzos and anti-psychotics. My mate often says you look like you've taken something, he notices my eyes are often very wide. I am naturally hyper, (I don't believe ADHD is real I believe it's just how I am), so it could be that.
I have to say I'm very high functioning autistic, I don't have any noticeable signs unless someone really knows me, and I don't have any facial features that are often connected to autism.
Has anyone else noticed people with autism often have their eyes wide open and look like they're own ritalin? By wide I mean the eye balls not the eyes around them, and it's not a wide eye look of boredom I just have wide open eyes and feel very hyper and happy, even when I'm not hyper they are still wide.",2.814938917975568,4.194393774869114,4.203225130890053,87.6070017452007,74.6020942408377,6.768726003490403,22.15741710296684,7.3011,0.6844845375218154,725,18,152,8,15,240,101,191,0.013,0.92,0.067,0.8599,0,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,4,0,14,4,0,0,4,0,22,10,8,1,0,35,35,13,0,3,7,0,1,3,1,0,2,2,0,0,10,12,0,0,3,2,0,1,6,0,0,0,1,13,20,4,13,30,3,16,0,0,10,0,10,13,0,6,5,96,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16121560863374934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116189616871934,0.0,0.0,0.1824457062840841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937969463522872,0.13744688236416502,0.0,0.11941703629372395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022698070796074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555360008330295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21420691949609608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120605082658249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860117043162652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782748468399008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14279930390438514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14173101862210055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372230346713182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19660866559456008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3379427590867782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14612267530502662,0.0,0.13513646085737338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4581731725619005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929988989296674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13418079130330726,0.15268579747162425,0.08593639519542379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21335416506689506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11366019097629487,0.10327098203124488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071279629150274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911963844257377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3320497587430407,0.07912189570645553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,meltrem,2018/01/17,"Help with an autistic teenager I'd like some advice for helping my autistic brother. Our father has unfortunately passed away and now my brother is being taken care of by our mother exclusively but she's a very incompetent caregiver. She doesn't pay attention to his needs and ignores him when he's having meltdowns.
He's been pining for this woman named Lily who once rented a room in our house for a few months 2 years ago. He told me that he wants to see Lily again, even though she barely spent any time with him nor talked to him much. I've constantly told him that he will never see her again since she moved away. He often throws mini-tantrums by jumping in place and talking to himself. Or sometimes even full-blown meltdowns.
Every time he has a fit over Lily, I do my best to tell him that she has moved away and that it's fine if he doesn't see her anymore. But then the next day he'll throw another fit. He's been throwing fits over Lily for nearly a year now and I don't know how to help him anymore.
It there somehow that I can help him just forget about her? I'm not sure why he's so fixated on her, she rarely talked to him when she lived in our house and has never talked to him since she moved out. He doesn't throw fits over our father anymore, which I do not understand. 
Our father took care of my brother and I alone for nearly all our lives (my parents lived separately) and my brother was very attached to him. When he was 16 my parents decided to move in together again, but then my father decided to separate again and left me and my brother with my mother. He came every few months to visit and help out, but my brother became detached from my father after a while. He threw a huge fit over my father leaving for a few days but then just got over it. Then our father passed away, and yes he was very sad but he's largely gotten over him.
I just don't understand why my brother is so hung up on a woman he barely knew, but has accepted our father's passing so well. I don't know what to do. Is there any advice or some explanation for his behavior?",4.46142857142857,5.186128857142858,5.038095238095238,85.65857142857145,69.95238095238095,7.7142857142857135,26.666666666666664,7.7094869923839395,1.3438809523809527,1640,49,338,18,28,526,181,420,0.052000000000000005,0.8220000000000001,0.126,0.9848,3,1,0,0,0,0,34.0,9,0,0,1,25,10,0,0,11,1,26,0,0,1,4,56,49,36,0,3,15,19,0,1,0,2,0,0,2,2,12,18,0,1,9,0,3,16,11,2,1,0,15,3,58,8,51,31,8,74,0,1,3,0,89,30,0,7,29,222,70,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15899479148665344,0.07211469438414046,0.0,0.0,0.08425737002467573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11064591786980303,0.0853059130536622,0.0,0.0,0.2420415127434857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057360000367217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537515383540975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09304637664836957,0.1658899982672034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791389716383972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493215476575143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10746602949900587,0.0,0.13708714265615934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506557781615455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726466421014129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877413171946571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08941917133303955,0.0,0.0,0.08614128176025886,0.0883904789954211,0.0,0.0,0.0397450593365284,0.0,0.21550907174760398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12987068024214474,0.34586226499930856,0.05980395528438647,0.060322359578987676,0.1254891908205138,0.0,0.08652004052050576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663849229282396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18066618003757506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499676842942383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19448387884419766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345923989341869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08046038512771057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07667441882053544,0.0,0.0,0.2615544501433409,0.07110627386646569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07992909614417659,0.0,0.0948753986540228,0.0,0.0,0.1554729187612985,0.09038638748680687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16938307977505598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20137470529102527,0.04798421926360956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314628795537532,0.0,0.14681720063170134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477757421047353

autism,sadplasterer,2018/01/18,"Feeling hopeless after dropping my 1st class after returning to college, don't know what to do As a kid and as an adult every task is a massive, painful struggle for me, from showering to driving to eating to studying or working. For whatever reason I've never found support in my life, as even my family think that I'm just incredibly lazy. I've only had one job, for less than a year, doing retail, because working stressing me out so much that I stop being able to sleep or eat.

I decided after two years of unemployment that I was going to go back to school and get a practical degree to go into a medical field since the employment outlook is good. However after only a few weeks I was already failing the class. I was studying 5+ hours a day, meeting with my study group, I got my disability documented so I get extra testing time, and I still only managed a 55% of my last exam. For the past few days I started having daily panic attacks and wanting to cry during class because I just couldn't understand. So I dropped, since my grade could only be salvaged to a D if I aced every exam after.

I don't know what to do. If I can't hack it in a community college class, I know I'll never be able to work in the medical field, or any field I know of. I don't have any strong skills and I'm physically sickly. Right now I can barely afford to live in a shitty apartment in a dangerous part of town with daily gunfire, I can't even afford to turn the heat on.

I've spent the 15 years feeling suicidal off and on, and I feel like it's finally time to admit that I just can't hack it.",6.808148148148147,5.350115339506175,8.113672839506176,72.95902777777779,65.35802469135803,10.569135802469138,35.6820987654321,9.516144504307137,3.2845654320987645,1246,50,240,20,16,434,171,324,0.153,0.815,0.033,-0.9894,8,0,0,1,0,1,30.0,0,0,0,7,11,12,2,3,19,0,23,8,1,1,2,38,47,18,1,5,8,0,3,1,0,0,5,0,1,2,9,11,2,1,13,0,2,4,9,8,0,2,7,3,30,4,46,35,6,44,0,2,0,0,5,13,0,5,26,160,39,19,0.2083102244362966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11493775631366301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14165809587865202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849147646834872,0.0,0.08008885218436397,0.0,0.12698397935076602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08315938192757509,0.0,0.11440950002434813,0.1343428616865143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21315336430287316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13758693861965718,0.0,0.17551034843388966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09818817023166496,0.0,0.1579918627453716,0.0744084329798206,0.0,0.11409683437331693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11420070455053975,0.0,0.0,0.10883349458051568,0.0,0.17758125158722998,0.08736036652275424,0.08330235799143018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025718050852252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10335787747904827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22896370313436265,0.08490031785543695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07356783599228894,0.05088492675185465,0.0,0.0919708722987394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2098506357724625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07656599172114867,0.0,0.16066168700326086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057819959450826,0.3168586250040423,0.11082838288153407,0.12220358271540772,0.0,0.11278983669066392,0.09942784000882507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10708880236970028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08894789674043406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10541053414082227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17231637027216765,0.0,0.10423033179455736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372152451142591,0.0,0.08317840716005652,0.087078337571572,0.119309329142498,0.1088855377897811,0.0,0.11392878770787845,0.11819398705123298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06673839031028574,0.0,0.0,0.12146736705525435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11329085319996267,0.1017444103074032,0.10842914504641074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06143338375216972,0.0,0.08354694848187857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274784865286344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.201217432226986
autism,Typhlojian,2018/01/18,"Autistic man with trouble controlling emotions and intrusive thoughts. Well first i thought i would mention that as a 21 year old with autism, i can't find ways to get advice or strategies to deal with my detrimental thoughts and behavior. Everything i find is for kids with autism. If anyone can maybe show me where i can find advice for autistic adults, let me know

Ok so i am 21, in college and working per diem. I have serious trouble structuring my time and schedules because i always distract myself with video games and other things. When i try to push myself to stop playing and do the things i have to do, i just get so angry and frustrated. I start losing my temper and hitting my head because i feel like im losing control of my mind. My parents dont know what to do, and the 7 different therapists and Autism counseling i have seen through out my life haven't been able to help. I really am at a loss, and don't know what to do. I want to eventually move out and be independent, but i dont think it will ever be possible for me :(",5.409493433395873,5.985744463414638,5.871219512195122,81.05557223264543,67.78048780487805,9.23452157598499,32.84240150093809,9.265573868473778,2.8237129455909944,825,35,161,15,13,266,119,205,0.123,0.8290000000000001,0.048,-0.9159,2,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,7,8,13,2,1,4,1,23,2,1,3,1,42,37,19,0,3,4,1,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,3,7,19,0,3,11,4,0,2,5,9,1,1,5,2,29,4,24,26,0,17,0,3,1,0,8,5,0,2,10,110,36,2,0.12222163173933832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23886712799134666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169818857790963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08546020670663011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14901034457625773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741639054239184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12600513558941756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12769559161934133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28648568427857835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748288512486484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055646322870304,0.0,0.0,0.10984492171100826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06179892935654437,0.08731515813562005,0.0,0.0,0.33512507153460885,0.10396165752053166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771151614397006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12543465510617158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08192258343345289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320203356157925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20150943729639986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497989922237307,0.08632875302056328,0.05971131561475794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2734694856673845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12278805678602367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234090065860258,0.0,0.0,0.12990225206198322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12825104261900486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13571265809158814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377865256484829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829830695596507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650910001638988,0.0,0.0,0.10218275685648023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419087346808151,0.16239724253532226,0.07831468652537911,0.0,0.2910909699368657,0.07126841634753447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08298046511239625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208948505314786,0.09701384232600599,0.0,0.0,0.10989192516155608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889788035588468,0.0,0.0,0.0868227404776987,0.0,0.0,0.0787067236465319
autism,basichumanrights,2018/01/18,"Children with autism and their rights In July of 2017 my daughter was diagnosed in the Autistic Spectrum Disorder, she was 3 years and 9 months old at the time. We had moved from the United States in January of 2015 to Switzerland. It is devastating for any parent to know that their child will face difficulties in life from a disability or any other circumstance. What was even more devastating was to find out that in Switzerland, not only services to children with autism are very limited and not covered by health insurance. As a family of three, we pay mandatory health insurance of about 1200 USD a month. There is only one place in the French speaking part of Switzerland that offers Applied Behavior Analysis, the now scientifically-proven therapy that is used in many countries around the world and is recommended for children with autism, specially at an early age. We contacted the ABA office and it is full until 2019. We found the only other place that offers therapy for children with autism using the Denver method. There are no other places that we could find in all of the French speaking part of Switzerland. It was recommended to us that she does 8 hours of therapy per week. This is costing us 35,000 USD per year. We are using our life savings we had planned to buy a house in the future since the health insurance that we are obligated to pay won't pay a dime because these therapies for children are not recognized in Switzerland. Recently, I read that Switzerland is banning to boil lobsters alive and everyone is applauding that Switzerland is recognizing animal rights, don't get me wrong, I think that's great and I am against animal cruelty, so it's a great thing. However, in my mind, I am thinking: What about the rights for people with disabilities? Children with autism? How many families can afford 35,000 USD a year for 8 hours of therapy per week? What is Switzerland's solution for these children? To deny them access to proven therapies because no one wants to invest in clinical studies to find out what many countries already know, that it is of utmost importance to offer ABA therapy to young children with autism so that they might have a better chance in life or is it better not to help them and simply put them at institutions because they will most likely have lesser chances to go into a mainstream school without the help of therapy. To me, this is shocking, to me, people in Switzerland are more concerned about lobsters than they are with children with autism because what options do they have? They simply get a diagnosis and then it's basically good luck. They offered us 1.5 hours of speech therapy and 1.5 hours of play therapy. How can they help a child with 3 hours a week where most countries like in the United States do 20 to 40 hours of therapy per week with children who are diagnosed. Policies for children with autism in Switzerland need to change, they need to change fast!!

autism,SerBoobsalot,2018/01/18,"Making/keeping friends I guess I just need to hear some experiences, or get some advice, idk. 

I got diagnosed as autistic two years ago, at age 24. I had to go interstate just for the diagnosis (I am Australian, in NSW for context) and now I am really struggling.

I was so relieved when I got the diagnosis because it explained a lot of my behaviours and ways of thinking and made me feel like I finally belonged to some kind of community, after a lifetime of having problems with social interaction.

However, in the past year I have realised that NSW has literally no support for autistic adults. In fact, every organisation or support group I can find is targeted at children, and usually boys, which is a whole other issue as an autistic female.

I have tried many support networks over the years, but until my diagnosis thought I was dealing with depression/anxiety, and have since been told these networks don't know how to treat or support autism. So I don't really know what to do.

I just want someone to teach me how to make friends, and how to keep them. How to be interesting to other people. How to have a personality that other people want to be around. I feel like I've pretended to be so many different people over the years, and none of them kept any friends, and then I tried to just be myself, but that was even worse. Now I have no close friends, and I honestly feel like the only person on earth who would even notice if I was gone is my mum. I'm 25 years old and my mum is my best, and pretty much only, friend. 

..........

I'm not really sure what I want from this post, just advice and other people's experiences, I guess. Does anyone know how to act to make people like me? Or even want to be around me if it's not their absolute last resort? Or any support networks in NSW Australia? Or just, idk, any tips at all about handling being an autistic female adult?

autism,sudanon,2018/01/18,"Constantly feel stupid and everything is going to fall apart soon I've been fighting this reading difficulty - no sequential/working memory and disappearing words, shifting. Also have a slight listening difficulty (phonemic processing defect). I've always compensated for social isolation with academic performance, as hard as it is

The problem is that at any given moment of any day its about avoiding looking stupid. What's worse is that after 10 years psychiatrists are still refusing my insistence on the autism diagnosis. They believe that persecutory beliefs should ensure it is an undeniable diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia

Now more than ever I need to succeed professionally. To remove the stigmatization and show everyone I am not mentally invalid. To show them I have some degree of worth and can contribute on an even better level. But I don't know what to do to alleviate the sense that it I am fooling myself into this, feeling stupid and that it will come crashing down through a stark realization in the coming years. And what's worse the sensory bombardment means its amplified with the anxiety showing bodily symptoms, severe palpitations, chest tightness, muscle spasms in the neck and chest, splenic area pain.

autism,E_H_Smith,2018/01/19,"Can't Get Anything Right! Socialising is the single most hardest thing I have to do during the day.  Socialising at work is harder than my actual job!

What annoys me is that, as I am an adult, I am EXPECTED to be 'normal' and get it right every time when it comes to talking to people, asking people to do things, taking criticism, etc.

I work soooooo hard on my tone, what I say, my body language, my facial expressions, timing, etc.  When I get it right, I hardly get any recognition or encouragement!  They know I'm autistic but they overlook things when I do it right.

But when I do it wrong - even if it is just a slight tone out of place, I'm pulled up and automatically the worst person.  They talk to me as if I should know what I did wrong.

Saying 'watch how you speak to someone' is not a good thing to say to someone with autism.  What does this mean?  It does not tell me what inflection or diction to employ or in what pitch I should deliver my lines.

This is often what leads to me burning out and getting so frustrated and fed up.  

It happens with friends and family, too, although my friends are more understanding as they know what I'm like.

autism,DesMephisto,2018/01/19,"I can't stand it anymore. I feel like I'm doomed to be nothing. Meltdowns are beyond debilitating. I started a masters program recently (after about 2 and a half years of being out of school with poor employment during that time) and it involves a lot of driving (The number one of my triggers for anxiety and stress) and I've been having meltdowns in public, and I feel like they're getting worse. 

My wife has been a huge help, I went and I went through rush hour traffic (the worse for me) so I can be home early to spend time with her, I bought her flowers and one of her favorite low calorie ice creams (she was having a bad day too). She had taken our dog out to the dog park which I had warned about, and as soon as she got home she started yelling at me because my phone was off (I've been getting a lot of spam phone calls, around 15+ and I hate phones) and she had spent an hour in the traffic I warned her about. She completely blew off the flowers and ice cream and just left. I felt crushed, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know how to communicate, I was starting to shutdown. She tried to reach out but it was too soon, shutdown ran its full course, I ended up laying in my corner for quite a while, she then called our dog into the bedroom to sleep in the bed which caused the shutdown to start revving into a meltdown. My brain panicked, I've been working a lot in a lab and I'm super sensitive about having a clean bed, the bed has to be clean (we've made exceptions about the top of the bed) but since our puppy smells and just went to the dog park my brain started to snap, I got up I got our pupper and had him go to the kennel and then boom. Glass, glass, glass, glass. The sound of each shattering as it hits the floor, the wall, the door. There is a hole in the wall, a giant gash in the door, a gash in the floor, glass everywhere. I lose my mind more. I start stemming. I spin in a circle while digging my nails into my skull. I spin and I spin and I spin and I spin, I've never spun this much before. It seemed like 30 minutes, really it may have been 5 to 10, I don't know, its all a blur, but I collapse into a dizzy mess and I start to recover until I see the wall, bam, everything hits me again. I start punching myself in the head, my face, my arms, my legs, this time I was angry at myself. How could I do this to her, what is wrong with me, why are you so broken, you can't do anything right, all the negative voices blaming myself for being broken, shattered like the glass. I slow down, I look at the wall again, I lose it. I'm rocking back and forth, I'm slamming my head into the floor, why is there blood on the floor, my head is bleeding, the carpet is being coated in my blood with each hit, I scream, I scream, I scream. 

I come to again, feeling numb. Full of so much self hatred and self loathing and self disgust/despise/every negative word you can have towards yourself, I try to help clean. It's a mess, glass everywhere. I vacuum, I mop, snot covering my face, stuck to me and dripping. 

My wife asks if I did it for attention, the pain inside digs deeper. I don't deserve happiness, I'm broken. Good people don't do this, good people don't hurt the ones they love, good people don't put holes in walls. Scientists are logical, scientists are smart, scientists don't meltdown. The voices are so loud. I'm so angry at myself, I'm so frustrated, I'm so sad. 

I'm here now, trying to reach out, the person who I talk to a lot about my problems is offline right now and I just need to get this out as I can't keep it inside right now. I have to drive again tomorrow, I have to go to work, I have to pretend like I'm only kind of suffering. I don't want to go tomorrow, but I've fought so hard to go higher in education, I've risked everything, and am risking everything to pursue a dream but I don't want to lose everything. I hate this disorder, I hate that I can't function, I hate how hard it is to just do normal things, like have a disagreement, or drive or be like haha work sucks without it being a meltdown waiting to happen.

autism,Graymouzer,2018/01/19,"Son put ipad pro in oven I have two boys with autism and two kids who are neurotypical. Tonight, I was watching one of the Harry Potter movies with the kids and my oldest came into the room laughing and said you should not put the ipad in the oven. I ran to the oven and sure enough the otterbox case was smoking and melted to a pan. I pulled it out and tore it apart and put the ipad in the fridge to cool it. It works but the display has these patches of light and dark in it. So, I tried to get across that it was very bad to put the ipad in the oven, that he was going to have to not use and ipad for a while. At first, he laughed at me but when he realized I was serious he cried. My oldest NT (6 years old) son says I was too hard on him but it's a $1000 device and I have been out of work most of last year. My wife is coming home soon and she is going to be pissed. I don't know why I'm posting this really. I'm just exhausted and frustrated. I never thought I'd have to tell someone not to bake an ipad. We didn't have the money for the thing and we bought it for the boys because they love them so much.

autism,yelhmoo,2018/01/19,"Getting an Autism/Asperger's diagnosis as an adult I'm a 23 year old female, and I'm pretty sure i'm somewhere on the more functional side of the autism spectrum.  I was wondering if anyone would feel comfortable sharing any similar stories with me.  Everywhere I look on the internet it's about kids and how to get a diagnosis for one, but I haven't really been able to find any help on searching a diagnosis out for an adult.  I'm from a really small town and I don't really have any outside help from family or friends, which means I don't have a lot of resources to look at (or lots of money).  I've tried bringing it up with doctors before and they kind of just give me a weird look.  One doctor even referred me to a licensed social worker who wanted to hypnotize me.  I have a hard time being taken seriously,  but I can't live like this anymore.  I need help.  Autism is really the only thing i've found that ""fits"" me, you know?  I've lived my entire life knowing I was a little bit off and I never really knew why.  I flunked out of college, but when I was taking psychology classes all those things doctors told me I have (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, etc) didn't really fit when I was looking over the symptoms.  Then in March of 2017, I was watching Girl Meets World on Netflix, where there was this character talking about how SHE was autistic.  Before they'd even brought that up in the episode I was already comparing myself to her.  So after I watched the episode, I got on the computer and researched, as I'd never really paid any attention to autism before.  I spent an entire day clicking on each link, crying because for the first time in my life I didn't feel like I was crazy, or like I was just being a hypochondriac.  I wanted to tell everyone I knew because for the first time I had something that made me feel ""normal"" in a sense.  But almost a year later and I don't know what I need to do.  Who do I need to talk to?  Should I even talk to anyone?  What about insurance?  Help me, please!

autism,blackfox24,2018/01/19,"Diagnosed Yet Unsure So this is kinda a weird thing; I don't know if it breaks the rule about asking for diagnosis. I was diagnosed autistic as a wee child, but everyone around naysayed it to hell and back... especially my parents. I didn't act autistic. I've been given a lot of diagnoses recently that seem to fit, but...

I'm 23, almost 24. And as I age I see more and more traits that I could certainly deem autistic, mainly around executive dysfunction. I've done my research; taken plenty of the accredited tests, studied up on articles relating to my emotional symptoms and my current diagnoses, and none of my other diagnoses explain the severe executive dysfunction and overstimulation.

My question is, does this happen? Can someone on the spectrum be ignored or overlooked this long? I've read that other people can but I'm struggling to believe it can happen to me. I am trying to get a psychologist in the area and get professional help, but I don't even know if I'm completely off base with this suspicion or not, so I don't go in and make a fool of myself.

Is there a chance the original diagnosis was correct, and I (being a trans man who was seen as a girl at the time) am possibly autistic, and it was overlooked for all these years? Or do people not get diagnosed past a certain age, and if you aren't, you probably don't have the thing? The articles say it's possible but I want input from people.",5.202021751796465,6.4686960073800766,6.562299475626336,73.41841134200818,68.63099630996311,10.133307438337543,33.08234608661876,10.307518312809881,3.667364575645756,1122,51,201,30,19,381,147,271,0.136,0.787,0.077,-0.9539,2,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,2,0,0,9,7,1,1,18,0,25,7,0,2,4,44,45,27,0,5,13,1,0,0,0,0,7,1,0,3,18,14,0,1,5,1,0,2,9,5,0,0,10,3,21,2,27,32,6,25,1,0,2,0,12,11,1,11,11,145,39,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847597771682352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19287178940969366,0.10127311518302423,0.0,0.0,0.08329841584920132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220498355707198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11358103398963025,0.0,0.0,0.08649199718357428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6597107328058078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479955354352884,0.11085831323965503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12185569294294933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07155037009505466,0.0,0.0,0.1035131280925586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16979250125261833,0.0,0.061565942234936326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19159018755905372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07261073378619788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11906971593346652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09586787301548384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09209755424994463,0.0,0.0,0.07231053688583465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12028668134117534,0.0,0.10341241431425988,0.2253053409261197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2442496394492776,0.0,0.0,0.11679712661563665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135342027142848,0.0,0.1083584475309812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069619490538509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614767388224376,0.0,0.0,0.0863242928870705,0.0986187733328909,0.0,0.12238108464461625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09178692211187299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11324912967784892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259544676626546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393812366676098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06316758810442492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07354836980483549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389532884092038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06976040938118762
autism,SuperKirbzz1234,2018/01/20,"When I eat certain foods my autism gets worse. Foods like potatoes, junk-food and bakers products, such as milk, wheat, bread, gluten, bakers-yeast, sugar, etc.. i know when I eat chibata bread I act crazy, sugar makes me crazy and brain-numb, and milk makes me hyper/edgy, and when I drank starbucks coffee it made me hypersensitive to my senses, worse autism symptoms, and violent. All these things make me hyper and paranoid, and sometimes have meltdowns.

Of course eating these things once isnt going to do much (except for the coffee and bakers products sometimes) but eating them every day builds it up in your system and causing me to behave worse. I get more paranoid, in-my-head, oversensitive, and alienated when these things happen.

And maybe things like almonds and oranges may be doing it too. I can feel my brain overheating when i eat this stuff, followed by brainfog, then worsened autistic symptoms and hyperactivity

Now I probably have yeast overgrowth, strep buildup, and now eating potatoes with the yeast in my gut, and supposedly yeast and potatoes make alcohol (dont know for sure, just sometjing my mom said), and ive been acting exceptionally bad.

If I were you, I would consider researching on “autism and food-sensitivity”, “autism and nutrition”, and “PANDAS syndrome”",7.694255952380956,9.25471979464286,6.564357142857144,74.59730952380954,63.10714285714286,8.651904761904763,32.79047619047619,8.841846274778883,2.8395765476190484,1030,40,164,15,15,310,131,224,0.12,0.838,0.042,-0.9489,1,0,1,0,0,0,47.0,0,2,1,0,10,6,1,0,2,0,13,20,2,6,3,40,28,29,0,2,5,1,1,2,0,2,3,1,0,0,12,21,16,0,3,0,0,4,2,2,0,0,5,4,25,4,15,20,4,18,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,2,11,103,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976099667350811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07626140095955303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20392144558720396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382680850728142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05890389830909775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704462900174733,0.0,0.0,0.5607546513831126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186332418530453,0.0,0.0,0.07695417223185393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04618201766231243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4417734226275236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954381500723676,0.0,0.05190811953723391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807677589017144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937366636913401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003913011572746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08924390959755812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08642394184661771,0.24386885711246345,0.0,0.09175887456717992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10697113687767827,0.0,0.0,0.06714216644873648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972694204376659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984752119416041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868810599065031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18066646411879067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10455739650746516,0.0,0.0,0.08608271085629311,0.18986529558139265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427172250770675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2792363018236388,0.0648821812283846,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,ThirdLionsRoar,2018/01/20,"My 6.5 month old showing signs of autism I have a 6.5 month old who was developing very well... but at about 4 months, I noticed that he wasn't rolling over. It's 6.5 and he is still not showing signs of rolling over.  

Also, he used to make eye contact with me, but now has minimized it. I put him on my lap and sing songs, and he will stare off at ANYTHING else in the room; a light, a chair, ceiling fan, alarm clock, etc.  

There are also other little things, like he always straightens his legs out, he stopped babbling to us (only babbles alone) and squeals with delight when my cat walks in the room... but won't smile at me. He has also been somewhat fixated on his wrists, turning them around often.  

I am meeting with the pediatrician soon, but does anyone have any advice? Explain anything about early intervention... what I should do? Thank you!!",4.432832310838446,5.828976981595094,4.403205521472393,87.68718047034767,70.59509202453987,6.660327198364008,28.307259713701434,6.816661863887847,1.2512867075664618,660,24,132,5,12,203,113,163,0.048,0.86,0.092,0.8486,0,1,0,0,0,0,37.0,1,1,1,0,13,4,0,1,6,0,14,3,3,2,0,23,19,12,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,2,0,7,9,0,1,1,4,0,2,3,1,1,0,3,4,16,3,21,13,2,29,0,0,2,0,17,15,0,2,13,85,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15885793281948402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168369686852917,0.0,0.3900126977928671,0.13526820659524186,0.0,0.0,0.1105506766816747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136701553696654,0.0,0.267556470381607,0.14471849668015951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14226288786721092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13580330576582125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813044265558695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794216956033888,0.16293416689590973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085142853113102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892766726045705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18508284024413332,0.3411720262008881,0.0,0.0,0.12363901685022148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16342405928983475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298256783675131,0.13591272822273354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14966923199999607,0.0,0.0,0.10800184379359323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17682548117587085,0.0,0.0,0.19554727455953214,0.1404051104726318,0.0,0.13413424471560095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14616665098724388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,J-Em-Dance-Fu,2018/01/21,"Struggling with anxiety right now It’s been an ongoing thing for me to have anxiety whenever I do stuff in the community, like live streaming games (which I started a few days ago actually). Well, in this particular case earlier for me, I did a vlog stream for the first time and I felt very anxious, and didn’t know what to say except it was like I had to make an effort to speak. I can say I was shutting down. After the stream was done, I felt like I failed to do a vlog stream.

I am a very high functioning autistic and verbal, but I struggle in the social world. It’s a frustrating thing for me. 

I feel like I’m a failure when I don’t succeed. I’m also trapped in a perfectionist stage where I feel I need to do everything right or I’m labeled a failure.

autism,Kelekona,2018/01/21,"The fire alarm incident sucked. My process was notice the fire alarm and try to access the situation... as in determining if it was our local smoke detector.  Quieter in the foyer but coming from outside, open the door and it was too loud.

At this point, my vetran husband is screaming ""shoes, get out"" and not letting me get out of the foyer to get my nicely-muffling headphones.  Fortunately my coat was right there, but I at least wanted to close the door again so I could check for my keys.  Husband had time to wonder if we were the only ones home before anyone else came out.

I couldn't bear to unplug my ears long enough to get the door to the stairs open.  There was a call button, but I also might have managed getting it open with my butt.  I can stare at fire engines and not react to the pain.  I told hubby that if he finds his shooting earmuffs to put them by the door.

Happy ending, they let us back into the building quickly.  It might have been a water pressure issue.

autism,F00dbAby,2018/01/21,"What is the best way to encourage relatives to get their child checked for autism or any other developmental issues? So my cousin is 5 years old and will be starting primary school in a few weeks but I am unsure if he is ready. I don't think my uncle and aunt have taken him to be checked for autism although I know he saw a speech pathologist for part of his life. It feels as if they are in denial and whenever I try to bring up how a school may be hard for him. He barely knows his age and sometimes doesn't respond to his own name

His speech is very delayed, he cant speak in complete sentences, and has trouble focusing. He very frequently shakes his head back and forth and occasionally just runs around flailing around. I am concerned that he may get bullied at school or feel odd or something.

autism,Mebradhen,2018/01/21,"An Aspie Life - Now on Steam Early Access Hey there guys!

Well, the time has finally come. An Aspie Life is now out on Steam Early Access! 
An Aspie Life is now available on Steam Early Access.
http://store.steampowered.com/app/786410/An_Aspie_Life/

One day your roommate Leaves for no reason. You’re left to face the outside world alone. But everything is difficult when you have a disability. That being autism. Every element of this game recreates how people with autism perceive the world. All forms of sound, graphics and interactions are intentional.

In terms of updates, not much has happened. Just a lot of bug fixes.

So I'll see you all next time!

autism,Trueoriginalgangster,2018/01/22,"Help Preparing for New Sibling? Hello.  We are expecting baby #2, totally unplanned, and I didn't find out until I was already almost 7 months along.

Our daughter is 3.5, and we have no idea how to communicate with her that a baby is coming.

I have tried buying her baby dolls and playing her favorite TV show where the main character gets a baby sibling.  Also, I have showed her some books with babies in them.  She's really not interested in any of it.  

I am nervous and don't know how she is going to take all the changes.  I have looked for some apps or games but can't find anything.  I can't just explain to her verbally.  She's very visual.

Any ideas?

autism,ThrowntoDiscard,2018/01/22,"Scary huge decision I'm an adult woman on the spectrum. 34 years old and my life has always been a huge mess. 

I have survived childhood abuse on top of being undiagnosed.  Every crack that I could had slipped through? I went. Never got the help I needed at every single stage.

Until a few years ago where I finally got a bloody long laundry list of what was wrong with me. I've worked hard on learning what is proper behavior in terms of how others treat me.

I've learned to identify very subtle forms of abuse and neglect. How to read people in and out just to avoid putting myself at risk again. I know many more kids are suffering just as I did. I know I can make a difference. 

So... I think I've made up my mind and going to go through the social worker training program at a local college.  I really want to get into child protection.

Has anyone else on the spectrum attempted this? What were the obstacles you had to overcome and how did you do it? Because right now? What I fear the most is just proving that I'm a burden...",2.3252941176470614,4.587303882352941,3.485058823529413,88.24376470588236,78.80392156862743,6.2368627450980405,23.925490196078428,7.365786028017652,1.105341960784314,808,28,159,11,20,261,134,204,0.191,0.745,0.065,-0.9802,0,1,0,0,2,1,23.0,0,2,0,5,10,9,0,3,13,0,17,1,0,5,2,31,32,11,0,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,9,8,0,3,7,1,0,4,1,8,0,0,11,1,19,1,27,19,6,35,0,2,0,0,8,18,0,1,12,106,28,7,0.0,0.3719475789231319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13913695796207087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306045970493093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10975117666053053,0.16082567348335422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09568231392170633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12532103857211987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16399142916533588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13112124773400466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2644937785257425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1766253999447577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17194372360665486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08200594001613641,0.0,0.1784097505617228,0.0,0.2510730064849335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406067329668443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052080292498801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17252394382336156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11086659614770264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13890604683923488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14852082915810388,0.10477306429873208,0.1591343920860045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15848643720016548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163850125219465,0.1210584362659934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16470476000245413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088173867337832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15778972715723194,0.0,0.0,0.15700404227946335,0.0,0.10055359857066536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13404431995448235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16000255015622908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10057463382304377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12950973050167378,0.09257999850848582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14550494444483586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11426988963358095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17161283245542974,0.0,0.20215620495642728

I've been doing research this whole time and I see myself so much in so many characteristics. my parents have always vehemently denied that I could be autistic, but they also denied I could possibly have asthma, which I later ended up getting diagnosed with, so I don't really trust their judgment... I've been diagnosed with ADHD but I want to get advice on how to get a proper diagnosis since I read it's much harder to diagnose autism in adults than in children. anything would be really appreciated. thank you in advance!! :)",4.1687449118046125,6.123503649253732,5.628073270013566,76.4092605156038,72.2089552238806,8.156309362279513,25.614654002713703,8.841846274778883,2.1009791044776125,555,18,98,11,11,187,88,134,0.084,0.8059999999999999,0.11,0.6661,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,2,1,9,2,0,0,3,0,13,4,0,1,0,14,21,11,0,4,2,1,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,2,6,6,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,5,2,15,2,15,11,3,17,0,0,2,0,7,8,0,0,8,67,21,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1728297019349644,0.2810557290813037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11500349314597998,0.11966007536226485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11834202661281848,0.1280199291092745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296385465567572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4378873732903851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12737152194596002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254017971231009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553377059123814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579910493158407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2114313820878826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3018053642778975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15968216466719018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621223177477858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28769455219478673,0.0,0.18425463505499756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145966436007524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23791952212739614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323994161770886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385581090819598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482189638685744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605568977036201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021573325345982,0.0,0.0,0.1852157371681388

autism,DirkHellbender1337,2018/01/23,"Looking for help services in the Chicago area. I am professionally diagnosed, with Asperger at 23 years of age. And have been falling flat on my face in life due to not being able to hold a job or essentially have life skills to prevent me from falling into depression. Im looking for some sort of social service that is able to help me get onto my feet, and find a job that helps with the more difficult ways of living with Asperger. 

Ive tried calling Garden Center for the Handicapped in oak lawn, and thats what seemed to be the best fit for me, but at the time ( yesterday) they said a waiting list, and a referral packet would be needed to be able to be considered and that could be 10 years. 

My only other option is to move to Maryland with my mother, but im so torn over myself with that because that would mean giving up everything I know here, and admitting that I failed so hard in life that I have to move to another region of the country. 

Any advice is helpful, Thanks in advance.",9.694115384615383,6.625375200000002,9.528557692307693,70.16206730769233,61.10256410256411,12.621794871794872,39.24679487179488,10.686352973137794,4.019987179487179,784,29,149,14,8,258,116,195,0.083,0.812,0.105,0.5469,2,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,4,3,5,0,0,10,0,18,6,2,0,0,31,30,11,0,4,4,1,1,0,0,2,4,1,2,0,10,12,0,3,5,1,0,5,1,3,0,0,2,4,14,2,37,19,3,27,0,2,2,0,11,15,0,5,6,104,24,6,0.38784909745535306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12633388307886784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791689539396702,0.13556453195590482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07880973664120383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356745664638757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13201243087688055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032219815832688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113512864391486,0.13121955658593987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161912533795662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816234953178448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06754504851308696,0.12402006515728922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11581220333116565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3466227660216375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27929572032737193,0.0,0.25658692208462336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105057361043017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27394928759321124,0.0,0.0,0.11415928625931372,0.0,0.21713037304748195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14082712299598066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27481480707173284,0.0,0.09586173044835833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832557192149413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297776940989248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11769441724332665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178777062239078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11902644658908933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07538597590867896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877746926962618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1026188535568558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1836779139320306,0.0,0.0,0.16650806841939242

We are conducting research about the experiences of college students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the academic library. Are you a college student? Do you identify as being on the autism spectrum? Do you use the library? 

Students will be asked to complete surveys and/or interviews about their experiences in the library. Each survey should take approximately 30 minutes to complete, and interviews will be one hour or less.

autism,deanreeds,2018/01/23,"Q: What's your opinion on why so few kids with autism participate in clinical trials? This stat caught my eye - ""Nearly 90% of children with cancer are enrolled in clinical trials, while only 5 percent of children with autism are enrolled.""

Obviously, autism and cancer are two very different things but I'd like to figure out why there is there such a large difference in trial participation rates? I know money/funding has a role to play and I feel that the immediacy and the terminal consequences of a cancer diagnosis also play a part.

But I wonder if part of it is a lack of autism trials or a lack of willing participants? Have you participated in a trial? Been asked and chose not to participate? Would be willing to participate but nobody's ever asked you?

Any insights are welcome, I'm just trying to get my head around the discrepancy.",5.6003978494623645,7.590239658064518,6.804919354838713,69.2807123655914,68.54838709677419,9.295698924731182,30.336021505376344,9.725611199111238,3.1996344086021518,677,27,111,16,12,228,97,155,0.113,0.8029999999999999,0.083,-0.7105,1,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,3,0,0,8,4,0,0,10,0,13,7,2,0,2,27,21,12,0,4,7,0,1,1,0,3,5,0,0,3,5,9,0,0,5,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,2,8,4,22,15,6,11,0,0,1,0,10,8,0,4,3,82,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585458919499717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348214230410342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1764905855706312,0.3706866920438413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142723199975049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17933462671524406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10024459542117747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10358099565621123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20346867468152227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108956752841585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09685825851987467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15078323078147576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4293855905059584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317130089871391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346033538066853,0.0,0.1936680865153741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16358262376958696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3577918516498496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21500104336942646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14083594300364868,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Reeddddit,2018/01/23,"Double-speak It's hard for people to understand my words because I often can't put my thoughts into a coherent sentence, so people will often misunderstand me, and if I'm in a debate, the opposing person will use my vagueness against me to try to make me sound like an idiot, even if they have nothing to gain from being right or wrong. They literally twist it to fit their ignorant arrogant ego.

Anyone else have this issue? It angers me because I can understand what I am writing/saying just fine, but other people completely skip over it and just go to a default response, like I'm speaking spanish!

autism,meisale,2018/01/23,"How to support my partner with autism? I know that it is terrible to diagnose someone yourself if they haven't had a medical diagnosis. But I need support, and thats why I am coming here. 

I am a 32f dating a wonderful 38m. He is very good at giving practical advice, he is very logical, and he is super smart. They are the reasons i fell for him. He is also fun; enjoys conversation and going to the theatre and other things I enjoy. He has some behaviours that have made me wonder if i need to support him in a different way though, as some of these behaviours have caused issues in our relationship. I love him, and I want to understand.

- He is very sensitive to certain sensations. He hates being touched/ stroked against the direction of his hair, and he can only handle firm pressure [not soft touches].
- He is sensitive to having cold eyes or warm ears. 
- He is very pedantic about language. he will frequently interrupt conversations to correct pronunciation or use of words, even if he can still understand what is being said. He does not see that sometimes, interrupting can be perceived as rude, or as disrupting the flow of conversation.
- He loves routine, but more than most. From the time he spends on the toilet each morning to the order in which he does things, he is very structured. He always keeps plans [yay!] and takes commitments seriously. 
- He has never french kissed me, ever, or made out with me, and I suspect now this is to do with his aversion to certain sensations.
- When i tell him precisely what I need or want in no uncertain terms he responds. Without this, he can forget invitations or conversations. it's even better if i text invitations as opposed to speaking to him about them as he can sometimes think i'm being vague! He needs direct, simple requests.
- He gets fixated on topics. On a three-hour road trip to a weekend getaway he explained to me how the cruise control function worked on his car. He then, for the next three hours, kept bringing it up, referring to motorists passing us and how he could tell whether or not they had cruise control.... he could not let it drop. Another time I needed to get a taxi from the airport and he kept going on and on at me that I should use a certain driver he books for airport pick-ups. i kept explaining why that wouldn't be convenient to me but he did not let it drop. Something so little became like, a proper full-on longwinded conversation. and not a conversation, more him telling me why i should do this.
- He can't stand to be interrupted during a rant. He may be talking about politics or world events, and even if i chime in 'yes i agree! and my thoughts on it are x, y and z', he will get very annoyed and say 'let me finish'. i understand interrupting people is rude, but a conversation requires back and forth. Even when i agree with him, he can't stand being interrupted. He gets utterly fixated.
- He is very logical and practical and sees things in black and white. He can sometimes focus on the negatives so much he will decide something is not worth it. He doesn't realise there are other outcomes and perspectives. 
- I am not allowed to tell him i think he is gorgeous [and god, i do] or attractive or smart because ""scientifically"" he is only slightly above average or average. So he thinks I'm being stupid or falsely flattering him, or just flattering him to get a compliment back! He doesn't feel a need for praise or flattery at all. more than that, it makes him annoyed and uncomfortable. This is hard for me as I genuinely, utterly love him and find him brilliant and gorgeous. You could put him next to Ryan Gosling and I'd choose him every time!

So, they're the issues. I worry I make him mad without even realising it by doing things like complimenting him, or shutting down and getting sad when he doesn't respond to me in the way I need him to when i am sick. When I am sick, I have learned i need to say to him, 'i am very sick and i need you now' and he will always do exactly as i have asked. but vague mentions of 'i'm unwell, i feel awful' is not enough to prompt him; i have to say 'and i need you'.

He is not a jerk. He doesn't do these things to hurt me. But I'm terrified my actions and lack of understanding will make him leave me if, indeed, he does have autism. i think he has ended relationships with previous longterm partners because his 'logic' kicks in and he begins thinking 'i make her unhappy when i fail to hug her when she cries, therefore longterm she will be unhappy, we might as well end this now'. He probably also focusses on all the times I upset him [ie - complimenting him too much, going silent and quiet when he upsets or confuses me/ corrects me] rather than focussing on how much I adore him and how much fun we also have together. 

I need advice and help. I want to  understand him. i don't think his quirks are weird or insurmountable, but i do want him to feel comfortable around me and maybe even one day he can accept that I am allowed to find him more gorgeous than ryan gosling even if he doesn't think that's true. it is my right to love him.

autism,DoubleD87,2018/01/24,"Startup &amp; Product design looking for your thoughts :) Hello everyone, 

I'm asking for your help.  

My co-founder and I are looking to facilitate effective communication, informaton sharing and goal tracking between people on the spectrum and others (their family, friends, parents, support system etc.). Specifically, by giving insight into and understanding emotions, activities and progress (our background is in analytics and Machine Learning). The actual product is likely to be in the form of an app for the family &amp; supporting professionals. Currently we are in the discovery phase - ensuring we fully understand the problem that needs to be solved (if there is any). Following this, we will start prototyping. 

To do this successfully, we'd love your thoughts through filling out a survey. It'll take a few mins tops! 
If you have Autism, please fill out: https://goo.gl/forms/FwS2W2HGg34BeEuD3
If you are a parent/loved one of someone who has autism, please fill out: https://goo.gl/forms/kX8d8MFSqp760ICv1

autism,short_scooterer,2018/01/24,"What to expect with IEP? My 3yo son has just been found eligible for services in Seattle School District. They are going to write up an IEP geared towards 'pragmatic language' and 'social communication'. He's going to be bussed from his daycare centre.

What are things to watch out for? We definitely do not want ABA-type conditioning; what we want is for him to understand and cope with the world.

Thanks in advance for any guidance.",5.034505494505496,7.626343256410259,5.094175824175828,78.38653846153849,71.56410256410257,7.534065934065935,29.091575091575088,8.418075326091056,2.3310344322344325,346,14,59,6,7,108,61,78,0.03,0.895,0.07400000000000001,0.6722,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,2,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,7,0,0,0,0,15,14,2,0,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,2,1,6,1,17,11,0,9,0,0,1,0,9,6,0,0,0,40,10,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22944412269321265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36994257622933546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3835053146753938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34146763555656023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3439376387968286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106333372276721,0.0,0.0,0.22415410780183934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3512461452377607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3980154823248971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,BenNCM,2018/01/24,"Important lesson I learned supporting a client People with autism appreciate the reassurance of what is happening next. How long things are going to last for. Uncertainty about the future can lead to anxiety, which is why autistic people prefer it if you let them know how long an activity they're involved in will last.

I've started working with clients that are unable to communicate verbally, and so body language and gesture as a means of communicating are crucial in establishing rapport and trust.

An incident occurred recently in which a client became very anxious while we were embarking on a walk to the shops. It was dark outside. He had assumed we would be going in the mini-bus as we had to walk past it in order to get off-site.

As soon as we passed the mini-bus he became agitated, clinging onto me, becoming vocal, started pulling me back toward the van and when I gently redirected him onward, began slapping himself in the face vigorously in distress.

In the past I had watched support workers from other organisations try a number of ineffective strategies; detaching themselves from their client and running on ahead in the hope that their client would give up wanting something they couldn't have or just forget about their increasing anxiety altogether.

I stopped walking and stood still with my client, looking at him calmly. I didn't say anything. He was holding onto my arm like a child would if it feared the dark and wanted to know it was safe. While one arm was linked with my client's, the other I placed gently but firmly on his shoulder and almost telepathically tried to radiate or convey to him reassurance through my hand. Attempting to communicate with touch alone that this moment of reassurance would last forever, if he needed it to.

Gradually he would lessen the slapping and distressed cries and seemed to shift his focus to how comfortable he felt right there and then. We walked to the shops and on the way back he didn't need to hold onto my arm at all. It was a great lesson for me.",10.385861516268632,9.071708746594009,9.580910402308062,64.82321365603464,58.26430517711172,12.341016188491745,40.934284340439184,11.20814326018867,4.657386728642411,1638,71,267,34,17,521,206,367,0.068,0.813,0.118,0.9601,0,1,1,0,0,0,30.0,5,1,5,8,13,17,0,3,23,0,27,7,7,4,1,62,49,30,0,15,7,0,3,1,0,6,0,1,0,1,17,22,0,4,11,2,2,11,3,4,0,1,14,6,31,13,56,26,2,59,0,0,2,0,31,22,0,9,25,188,48,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547654137624255,0.1194369681451546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1764393038081833,0.13027902289597632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09489871433304373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17734826026636388,0.0,0.0,0.12736212165684366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12809476624749996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12667384557188102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297673073255101,0.0,0.0,0.11072549488338393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06025005477082952,0.11062566217508553,0.13107827604779235,0.0,0.0,0.1271409485844064,0.0,0.0,0.10197728882748712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11453899792373615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675395297696354,0.28200411025486016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11792273713064465,0.0,0.0563396339633435,0.0,0.0,0.20410952983202227,0.09683993983649852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561752579217156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1710169623705589,0.0,0.0,0.1226443612058956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814396491789123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.220172395616504,0.15989703939589964,0.0,0.1204850842172396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386480394621927,0.0,0.0,0.09848283694311652,0.0,0.09170726677845037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498319627022523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08877913863685281,0.0,0.0,0.16324848914288778,0.0,0.09209487587364426,0.09641286679733732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617280358723095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661362931714615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15658971779161165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09515125800089376,0.13603770604231852,0.09153582214279364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10405856075185972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08395449290289425,0.0,0.0,0.4096008744613005,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,sirmisterdude,2018/01/24,"Maybe someone can help me with suggestions for colleges and information additional information. At the moment I am looking to go to school full time till I get a degree. Looking into schools that are affordable. Unfortunately having a low income job never works out for me, just like public schooling never did. The highest level of education is my GED.  I always end up being bullied/being screwed over tho I am quiet, work hard and keep to myself. 

There has only been three jobs where this hasn't happened. First one went out of business and the other two were in different places then where I'm from and I ended up not being able to afford to live there. It only gets harder for me to find a job. Won't dive any farther into it. 

What I am trying to say is, funding school doesn't seem possible.  Also is there any schools that have programs that work with people  who have autism? Looking for any information that could help me. Maybe someone as been in the same situation. That can guide me in the right direction. I've tried looking up information for myself but I am not knowledgeable about anything on this subject. Wanting to get into a dormitory for the convenience also for focusing. I'd really appreciate any advice given.",4.4085714285714275,6.953406122807021,5.4644611528822065,75.22289473684212,73.29824561403508,7.6761904761904765,27.962406015037594,8.563005593585519,2.462287969924813,988,39,161,19,21,325,138,228,0.03,0.927,0.043,0.598,7,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,4,10,3,1,0,10,0,24,1,0,0,2,29,39,11,0,2,4,0,1,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,12,12,0,1,7,0,1,2,7,2,0,4,6,7,15,1,37,29,2,33,0,1,4,1,10,22,1,1,10,123,27,13,0.09934995123063647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708362250945256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15890024020998253,0.08266711818254516,0.0,0.0,0.2702454947673065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08175654469835696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07932285187855508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379955347679698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1759891363250438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09080405554867832,0.08450701776383329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15571874699996655,0.0,0.056462866804895276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08785483376499928,0.0,0.08899804198349354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13318435620560726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2957684899423396,0.08830680150830902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04853736781141309,0.0,0.08772782711213617,0.0,0.3337157484365239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19962075910445734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15324961423856573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06732209815082646,0.15112022958232188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06887674685785458,0.0,0.10379955347679698,0.0,0.0,0.1120021424080664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364612275923988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484431551205257,0.0,0.07900706883365896,0.0,0.5027372734307933,0.0,0.09044446427715648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11167350778301556,0.0,0.0,0.16835778254988135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05793175551372801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13490419076705304,0.0,0.0970504662398038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058599175304306986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09209840013536896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21698384324433515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Bulbaop,2018/01/24,"Could my girlfriend maybe have ""Autistic tendencies""? So i've been going through a hard time with my girlfriend as of late. We are in a long distance relationship which really doesn't make things easier. We love eachother, but the last month things have been hard. I'm starting to concider there might be a mental issue involved, she has also mentioned this herself. She also mentioned that someone has told her that she appears to be somewhat ""autistic"", she didn't feel hurt by it, but she mentioned it.

Here are some obersvations i've made as of late, i'm not saying this has to be a mental issue, but here we go: 

- She becomes very cold and distant at times.

- She says she loves me but her actions usually doesn’t show it.

- She lacks empathy most of the time, especially when she feels pressured

- Her routine is important to her, if it gets disrupted she might break down.

- When she does 1 thing she can’t do another thing at the same time.

- She says she has a “One track mind” and even in terms of interests, if she plays games 1 month and then switch to wanting to watch series, she will stop playing games entirely and only watch series. 

- She feels the need to run away if there is conflict or she feels pressured

- Romance, anniversaries and “Big dates” doesn’t really mean much to her.

- Gifts and surprises seems to confuse her more than it makes her happy. 

- She can be very blunt and brutally honest, when there is no need to be at all. 

- She seems very confused about her feelings most of the time.

- She can cut me off to be alone, but then feel guilty about it so she can’t fully use that alone time.

- I sometimes need to get extremely mad or sad before she understands me.

- She makes promises to change and get better, but the next day she seems to revert to being “cold” at times, with clearly no intention of actually doing so.

- She is scared of most social situations, unless It’s with few people that she knows well.

- Some days she can be overly energetic and happy, but it doesn’t take much for her to break down.

- If she is used to doing things a certain way, she will not change the way she does it, even if a better option is suggested most of the time.

- She seems to have a hard time reading between the lines and can misunderstand moods and things quite easily.

- Things have to be explained in an EXTREMELY specific way for her to understand and adjust. 

- When she feels pressured and bad she can say incredibly cold hearted and mean things, only to regret it and apologize almost right after.

- She can get so caught up in talking with me, that she sometimes wants to leave so I don’t distract her.

- She says she loves me, but sometimes is having a really hard time showing it, unless she really feels like she wants to in the moment.

- Adjusting for my sake can be really hard for her, even if it’s a small thing, if her mind “doesn’t let her”, she won’t compromise or “fake it” to make me feel good. 

- Intimacy seems somewhat scary and alien to her, and most of her life she has avoided it entirely. 

- When she gets cornered she can want to break up with me despite loving me, as she wants to stop hurting me, then regret saying so right after. 

- Even when she is doing something wrong or feels a certain way but wants to feel differantly, she is completely unable to change it.

- Most of the time when she hurts me, she doesn't realize and clearly didn't have any intentions to do so. 

- She has an incredibly high interest in certain things, and if others don't appriciate or value them, she might be offended.

- She sleeps more than average (10-12 hours most of the time)

autism,orangeoliviero,2018/01/24,"Question about autism supports in Ontario (Kitchener/Waterloo) public schools I have a six year old son who was diagnosed with autism when he was four. Before Asperger's was folded into the criteria, he would have been diagnosed with that.
He's also recently been diagnosed with ADHD.
He's an incredibly bright and sweet boy, who understandably struggles with social interactions and occasionally getting overwhelmed.

Currently we live in Calgary and he attends a Traditional Learning Centre school. The TLC program is more structured than the newer education styles, which we feel is better for our son. So far he's doing well academically, and the teachers are generally quite willing to work with him and us to accommodate his additional needs. For example, the teacher gives him advanced notice of a change in subject (i.e. ""in 5 minutes we're going to go to the gym""), and if he's getting overwhelmed he will politely ask if he can go for a short walk around the school - he goes, is quiet so as not to disturb other classes, and returns within a few minutes, much the same as if he just went to the bathroom.

I am exploring moving to the Kitchener-Waterloo area for a dream job. My wife holds very strong reservations about whether we would receive the same supports for our child there - Alberta is much more supportive of children with Autism than Ontario is, and many of the Ontario ""supports"" revolve around Applied Behavioural Analysis, which basically uses conditioning techniques to attempt to force changes in behaviour. We don't want this for our son - all he needs is support and a little bit of understanding/accommodation to enable him to be successful. He doesn't need to be changed into a different person.

Does anyone have experience with/knowledge of how the public schools in the Kitchener/Waterloo area deal with and help children with ""high functioning"" autism?

autism,cheap_peep,2018/01/24,"This Week I Leave My Autistic Boss and I Feel Awful I just want to thank everyone who showed support with my previous posts: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/77c3qd/how_to_be_the_best_employee_possible_for_someone/
and 
https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/79to6x/updateemployer_with_possible_autism/ 

But sadly I now have to move on. 
I feel really awful about it. As passive aggressive and sarcastic as he sounded, he did once refer to me as being like one of his children. He's currently away perusing one of his obsessions and wont be back for two weeks. He got my notice, and I have the notification it is read- but he has not responded. I hope it is not too much of a shock for him. 

I know (or at least I think) I got on his nerves too, because his emails got more and more frustrated with me. The stress has just taken its toll. I feel like a weak person for not being able to handle it. It was such an easy job, but his behavior just kept me so on edge and another door opened at the right time. 

Im just feeling very guilty about the whole thing.

autism,TheWattpadian,2018/01/25,"Fired for being Autistic today. Depressed. Hi all. 

So 25 year old male who has been diagnosed with depression and Autism but I do have previous work experience in the delivery field. I've been jobless for a few months and figured that I would apply for a pizza delivery position. 

Was hired on the spot today and asked to do training a few hours after being hired. Boss was running late so I asked if I could help out at all. I have all the required documents for handling food in California. 

My last pizza delivery job never required me to do food prep but this one did. When my boss arrived I immediately took him to the side and explained that I was Autistic. Because of my Autism I'm slower to learn things than the average person. However, I can complete delivery tasks and do things like washing dishes. 

So after I shadowed someone for a delivery trip I was surprised when my boss took me aside this time and asked for me to explain what I needed from him. 

I told him that I would need him to be a little more patient with me as I'm slower than the average person to learn things but that I would probably get everything down within one to two weeks. 

He then goes on saying that he doesn't want someone who will forget things for a delivery order when it gets busy or who hurts themselves. I'm not the type of person who hurts themselves. I rarely have suicidal thoughts. It's also strange considering the fact that I never even mentioned my depression to him.

But given what happened today I feel like I was discriminated against and he kind of forced my hand into a pressured quitting. I have a feeling my boss knew nothing of Autism or the ADA and I did my best to explain the ADA gives me certain protections from being fired for having a disability. 

I'm currently talking with my parents about the possibility of filing a lawsuit against them just so they can at least become more aware of Autism. I'll most likely donate anything that comes from the lawsuit to an Autism charity if it happens.

I'm in Northern California for those wondering. r/legaladvice wasn't any help either when I tried posting there.

autism,Aurora34,2018/01/26,"So much emphasis is placed on how people with autism lack empathy, yet very little people try to empathise with those with autism. Hello everyone,

What do you feel are the most important things that parents/caregivers of people with autism should know and why?

It could be that you would like them to understand how you feel about certain aspects of your life (family/growing up/school/adulthood/friendships/relationships/the future) and what you need from them emotionally as support. 

The reason for this post is that I feel that a lot of information and advise on how to understand and support people with autism are from people without autism. Additionally, the information can be generic and practical as opposed to trying to understand people with autism emotionally and what they need emotionally from the people closest to them. 

So much emphasis is placed on how people with autism lack empathy yet very little people try to empathise with those with autism. 

I guess that is the main aim of the post - to gain insight into how to support those with autism emotionally thus learning to empathise with them and the importance of being mindful of their emotional and spiritual needs.

autism,RJSAE,2018/01/26,"Being shamed over obsessionsobsessions. This is a running theme in my life. Being told that I'm not interested in enough things. Being told that I'm fixated on Bad Things. I guess I feel like it's not fair. I feel like nobody should tell me what I should be interested in or how many things I should be interested in. Not everybody's brain is capable of being interested in a wide number of things. And then some people seem to suggest that I am somehow perverse because I am obsessed with some of the bad things that happen in this world such as crime. I don't know why I'm obsessed with those things other than to say that often in life bad things are more interesting and good things. And also I resent being told that I should get on some sort of medication. Or that I should go into therapy. First of all, I don't need to fix my brain. It is not broken. It is simply wired differently than most people. Second of all, I do want to go back into therapy, but that is not a possibility right now because I don't have any health care insurance coverage, and I can't afford any, and I can't get any from my job. Plus, I'm I'm not aware of any public assistance such as from Obamacare or from Medicaid that I could use to get access to therapy. And also, but I think about every single problem I have that I want to get help with, I'm not sure that traditional therapy works for me because most therapist aren't going to allow somebody to get more then one hour per week and therapy. I was thinking of getting some therapy from online services such as better help or talkspace, but I'll go that's cheaper than traditional therapy, I can't afford that either.

 sorry if I'm rambling but I just feel like I am misunderstood.

autism,_CaptainKirk,2018/01/26,"Is it normal for autistic people to have some kind of fear of responsibility? If so, how to get past it? So I'm in my senior year of high school and one of the courses I need to graduate has to be done online thanks to schedule conflicts. It's not a difficult class--I can probably get the course done in time if I do it regularly--but it's insanely boring and seems largely unnecessary. 

Every time I think about working on it I get unsure of myself because of how menial it all is, which leads me to mentally beat myself up, until finally I'm crying over it all and wishing nothing was expected of me. 

Is this sort of anxiety at all common or at least understandable? I really don't know what to do about it other than ""suck it up,"" as everyone tells me, which if anything just sets off that cycle all over again.",6.147702794819359,5.688146742331291,7.544498977505113,73.2301363326517,66.23926380368097,10.680027266530336,32.22154055896387,10.25414643259724,3.15765630538514,641,23,124,14,9,222,105,163,0.114,0.8440000000000001,0.042,-0.9004,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,3,8,6,1,1,3,0,13,0,0,3,4,27,26,13,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,3,0,1,4,0,0,1,2,4,0,1,3,0,11,2,31,22,6,23,0,0,0,0,1,11,1,7,10,95,27,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13622870083066307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14654250254972012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855431205686758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19560962936287699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3644699538392869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15003786485910814,0.17016055862267787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20038654999983874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19507505476811254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791142282672865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881485188070873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854401778430549,0.0978666655700204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17946010497886025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320421136385548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17447801345029146,0.17087003953890872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12066983476759212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699949997888169,0.12345642650717875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919975241465928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11408092332103108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18022380580145025,0.0,0.1621149497675583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15564747068615295,0.1639497170873266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11410478841435175,0.0,0.0,0.2076766933192288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18538482267773448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047801874142358,0.0,0.0,0.1296424464414369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11467598795232364
autism,Buns209,2018/01/26,"Feeling upset To give a little background, I was diagnosed with autism back in 2016 because I had a lot of the symptoms. Back then I got no help at all because I hadn’t been diagnosed yet, but these days I get most of the help I need. Anyways, I’m a freshman in high school and stupidly I took intro to journalism. I have social anxiety, so I have no idea what I was thinking. So tonight, I asked my mom if I could drop the class. She said I could but I would need to replace it with another class instead of study hall which I think is dumb because the other day she was complaining that I didn’t get my work done so I have no idea why she wouldn’t want me to get another. Do you guys have any advice? I’m feeling really stuck and don’t want to be in the class anymore.

autism,hoosier415,2018/01/27,"Help Me Understand A kiddo I sometimes work with is diagnosed with ASD and is in the general education classroom. He engages in vocal stereotypy/scripting throughout the day and it often interferes with his ability to follow along and complete his work. He will script about videos and laugh about them. He has been told that he can script as long as it doesn't interfere with his work. Often times, even through prompting, he has a hard time stopping and attending to the task. He sometimes is able to respond and say what he is laughing or talking about. He has expressed that he cannot help it. He says that these videos play in his mind and he can't turn them off. He often does it during non-preferred tasks or when he has nothing required of him (it definitely appears to be automatically reinforcing). I was hoping to hear from others diagnosed with ASD if this is something you struggle with. Right now he is receiving ABA services, but the goal is eventually to fade back and allow him to be at school on his own without support. He has also expressed that he does not want to have to have help. I want him to succeed but he doesn't appear to be intrinsically motivated to do his work. I guess I'm asking (in addition to any struggles with vocal stereotypy and any possibility of its interference with daily activities), how were you motivated to do your schoolwork and be independent?

autism,CarolinianRevolution,2018/01/27,"Does anyone else here feel the need to be the best in your ""area""? I am in High School, and my special interest is politics and American history. I always fear that someone else in my classes might one up me or show more expertise in my area, and I always feel like trying to think of the answer is fiercely competitive. 
One example is my American History class, the teacher has a teaching style where she will have the kids just call out the answer without raising their hand. I am the most active overall but there are days where my brain is slogging along slower.

I find my ego is bruised somewhat easily if someone else displays more knowledge than I or doubts my ability in my specific interests, although that very rarely happens I have sort of ""day nightmares"" about it possibly happening",8.244794520547945,8.2318456369863,7.853527397260276,71.26193493150687,61.80821917808219,11.409589041095893,40.16780821917809,10.9516,4.633043835616438,637,32,106,15,8,202,99,146,0.044,0.8270000000000001,0.129,0.8733,1,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,1,1,6,7,0,2,8,0,14,2,2,0,0,24,20,8,0,2,6,0,3,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,7,1,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,3,19,5,15,17,5,14,0,0,0,0,5,12,0,8,3,79,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785765539068099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704834773068885,0.1715187019099324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756735340690079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18687116892031566,0.17093174408157788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2159153060000712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14649083494344406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41951783661844655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18836892559932625,0.1692825901425745,0.11958893367414768,0.0,0.0,0.15299844382899075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2960584253132559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768648361919709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178204924691428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1775824813313721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12412325617651848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268659960205697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18871572850356672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16941538574454287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28367101646492904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072616720002774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11365203419963787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13812061457122635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16136538672802278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,divinechaos207,2018/01/27,"at what point do you give up on potty training? My daughter is 5. She can use PECS at school, but has trouble at home. We have been working on potty training her for 3 weeks now and I am at a loss.... 

She is totally naked at home, her choice. She strips herself and then refuses to get dressed. (stays dressed at school though without problems) She can go on the potty, pees and poops with reminding and does really well.... the problem is the consistency... 

she drinks well, and we put her on the potty literally every 10-15 minutes.... and sometimes she pees there, sometimes she pees.... on her bed.... like, floods her bed. Multiple times a day..... I literally cannot afford to go to the laundry mat to clean her sheets and matress pads as often as she goes through them- I have spent, so far this week.... $60 on just her laundry (twice/3x a day, 6$ for wash and dry.... adds up fast. we have 2 waterproof matress pads and 5 sheets. She'll go through all of this within a day easily) 

She totally understands that she should go on the potty, she gets praise every time.... chocolate rewards, lots of attention etc..... she loves it so much she'll squeeze the teeniest bit out for candy and she looks so proud of herself. She can run to the potty all by herself and come and get us.... she can recognize the feeling, she can say ""no"" if she really doesnt have to pee. We have a solid routine everytime. We don't engage when she pees somewhere she isnt supposed too... just clean it up and go about our day. 

we can't leave the bathroom door open, because she has so far flushed 7 things down the toilet and our landlord is less then pleased with the plumbing bill, she pees all over her bedroom floor and it STINKS in there now.... carpet, not ours..... steamer isnt helping, there goes the security deposit. She consantly reeks of urine.... she gets bathed nightly..... but she also doesnt seem to care if she lays in her pee on the floor.... she has a wonderful rash on her butt cheek from this. 

I am at a total loss, to make matters worse.... even if I did throw in the towel.... she'll still strip off all of her clothes and pee whereever she wants too.... and I can't keep her dressed without literally standing over her while shes home, .... I have a 3 week old that also needs my attention (just to be clear, the peeing thing has been happening now for 3+ months and seems to not be in retaliation to having a sibling) She has no medical problems such as uti or anything of the like... 

does anyone have any ideas here? because I feel like I am about to go completely insane...

autism,throwceeaway,2018/01/28,"16 year old guy, just completely lost Hey /r/Autism, I’m a 16-year-old guy and currently incredibly lost in life. For a very long time I have suspected something is different about me, first I thought I had ADHD, now my mind is intrusively convincing me I have Autism (accompanied with anxiety and depression). I have always felt out of place (like every kid) but recently I have found the things I do are actually quite autistic. 




I feel I have to say I hate the thought of having Autism, it fills with intense amounts of anxiety and depression. Anyway, recently I have seen these ‘symptoms’ more prevalent than ever.




•	**I have trouble reading**: I find it hard to keep up with the words and find myself making some of the dumbest pronunciation mistakes.


•	**Socially awkward**: In my head I am the coolest guy ever when having conversations, in real life I can keep up with a conversation but I never say what I really want to (this relates to next point).


•	**I cannot for the life of me translate me thoughts into words**. When I’m alone I can think of a beautifully constructed sentence full of intellect, but as soon as I talk to someone (even family) It’s hard to find words and I sound like an idiot.


•	**My acne and terrible skin makes me look like I’m 30**, I know it’s a stereotype that autistic people look different and that’s not what I’m trying to say, it’s just another aspect of me that further isolates me (or at least I feel it does). 



I do not like trains, or am fascinated by dates, or can only do things in a certain order; I don’t relate to any real stereotypical symptom other than feeling socially inept. I feel I am high-functioning and yet completely hopeless; I don’t want to move out, people looking at me makes more nervous etc…


If anyone has any advice or can relate its greatly appreciated.

autism,JonzoR82,2018/01/29,"Help with my son? This is my first time posting on this sub, as well as attending it.  But i recently received news from my ex about our son, Emery.  He's 9 years old, and he was diagnosed with moderate autism around 2 years ago.  My ex and I split over 3 years ago, and I moved out to about 30 minutes away.  I still see my son on a semi-regular basis (twice a week or more, depending on schedule), and he comes to stay with me two weekends a month.

I'm really here to ask for some guidance.  My son is VERY stubborn, and has had his own issues with school for most of his life.  Right now as it is, he's rejecting learning math because he doesn't see the utility in it, even though he's stated multiple times that he wants to become a Marine Biologist.  It's to the point where the teacher allows him to use a calculator for relatively easy problems (2x3, for example) because he's not able to grasp the concept, and refuses to try.  He also has a lot of issues with his perception of peoples reactions/interactions in a social environment.  I asked him this morning if anybody complimented him on his jacket when I was taking him to school, and he said he didn't hear anything, and then told me everybody else was ""probably jealous"".  He has this type of attitude towards most everything (i.e., general negativity).  When he comes over, sometimes I direct him and his brothers to go outside and play, and he'll make a comment about how i'm just trying to get him to go somewhere else and leave me be.

I know my behavior and interaction with him comes in to play, but I have no clue on what I can do.  Getting him medication or regular counseling appointments is too expensive for either his mother or myself to afford, and I feel like he's really starting to get behind because of this.  If there's anybody that can show me a light, or maybe let me know that others have experienced this before, I could maybe figure out a method to work with him and help him.  When he has some of these misconceptions, I try and talk with him reasonably on why school is required, or the true meaning of a situation he figures out as mean or insulting is in fact a social cue for joking around, maybe.  I dunno, I'm a little fraught and worried, and I really want to help him improve and overcome.",8.637297297297295,6.544754531531535,8.934216216216218,70.54929729729733,62.24324324324325,12.483603603603608,38.41621621621621,11.20814326018867,4.149812972972971,1788,72,344,40,20,597,228,444,0.039,0.884,0.077,0.9322,1,0,1,0,0,0,56.0,1,0,0,3,20,12,3,0,18,0,24,3,0,6,2,81,54,40,0,6,13,8,1,1,0,1,3,2,0,0,16,35,0,3,11,5,1,8,5,5,1,3,7,7,47,7,66,43,8,55,0,1,2,0,60,23,0,15,22,230,63,8,0.09065604948334832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16072223598792598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724976100187051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07460220432877553,0.16140620847760545,0.16950233719961755,0.0,0.08517434270426782,0.0,0.0,0.1657892589780581,0.1001224841702813,0.07714162097678155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2342764781840889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07238147876256917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920139819307485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514629932262919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059877465686185974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08147581173981795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04583842252828987,0.06476469986483922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711198937887173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420921324937778,0.0,0.10304384418173404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021759564487206,0.0,0.18229451706354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18924272495905015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09964438787106747,0.0,0.0,0.09599166670267076,0.0,0.09270195273199416,0.06403304876798653,0.044289966563627804,0.09086117778105562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07707253137973442,0.0,0.0,0.06051361698589607,0.0,0.2732285601217798,0.19750202923791796,0.0,0.09132643235434787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236079378844633,0.09635303361065478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09512827394381228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284949005060238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08569926938652946,0.0,0.08682343575838024,0.0,0.0977425543974408,0.08674559598865074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17422976003954946,0.09320951761260224,0.08951191203750597,0.0,0.0,0.07741977092254057,0.08623466308510656,0.0,0.0,0.27524628591792183,0.14448226831986966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10190119795885966,0.0,0.18482485172551824,0.0,0.0,0.08966115100821448,0.0,0.0641668184284399,0.09662728657804978,0.07239803822259508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06816206692691412,0.07286589858459418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906910833148568,0.0,0.10572454298075687,0.0,0.0,0.08662574026099057,0.0,0.18464852033944984,0.0,0.08855778750603531,0.0,0.0,0.07829771954566522,0.0,0.07480073509332065,0.1069425736050585,0.0,0.07271881460693404,0.0,0.08151067583938944,0.0,0.08180298401224456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599868373221586,0.09206561879970253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1751385707758228
autism,MrXian,2018/01/29,"Share your stories about loneliness. Hello everyone.

I (help) run a support group for and by autistic people, and we have meetings every other week where we discuss a subject linked to autism. (We also do fun things.)

Tomorrow, I get to lead a discussion about loneliness. I've done my research, but now I'm looking for stories. So if you have stories about being lonely, maybe with advice on how to overcome this, I would love to hear them.

autism,pasteljade965,2018/01/29,"Having trouble with my doctor's diagnosis. My psychiatrist believes I may have Asperger's Syndrome. I concur with the suspicion of some kind of autism, but I am having trouble reconciling with the ""empathy"" factor. I cry when I watch sad movies, and it hurts and angers me to watch an animal be abused in any sort of way. Is that not empathy? 

My psychiatrist asked me how I'd feel if *she* began to cry. I tried to imagine the situation and to be accurate, I 'd want to know *why* she was crying. She asked me if I'd ""feel bad"" and I didn't know how to answer the question. She is a psychiatrist and crying in front of a patient would be odd and unprofessional to be honest. I wouldn't ignore her hypothetical crying because that would be rude. I guess I'd feel sympathy in the situation, because all humans cry, but I probably wouldn't make another appointment with her (hypothetically).

autism,VoidByte,2018/01/29,"Help interacting with friend that is Autistic Hello,

First I'd like to apologise if my language or terminology is inappropriate. I'm doing my best to try and be mindful of how I'm saying things, but this is outside of my normal bailiwick.

I'm part of a social/support group for something completely unrelated to Autism. One of the members, D, has Autism and despite wanting to be friends with her and talk with her I struggle with several of her conversational quirks.

When she explains something she will repeat it four or five times. Basically retelling the same piece of information in different sentences. How can I politely cut her off at one or two explanations? I feel bad because it makes it hard to converse with her because we get stuck in these cycles. I'm really not a blunt person and feel really terrible saying things like ""Yes D I understand that foobar shop is on Baz street."".

Second is that we are often chatting in group settings. There will be multiple conversations going. I'm trying to listen to what another person is saying and D will burst in and start talking. This is fine and normal, but tie it in with the above problem and one person can get stuck in very long windy conversation when I'm trying to hear something that is important.

What tips do you have for interacting with D. How do I make it clear to her that I understand what she is telling me without being rude? How do I also indicate to her when I am trying to hear something else? Do I just need to be more blunt and forward? Tell them right out that I am trying to listen to person X?",5.5372081541646745,6.899127036789303,6.3013186813186834,75.24487179487184,67.92976588628763,9.039719700589263,31.29495142538621,9.362217197678863,2.8969473164516635,1260,51,223,25,21,414,158,299,0.08,0.812,0.109,0.7384,1,0,4,0,0,0,27.0,2,1,1,2,11,12,2,1,5,1,29,0,0,6,1,49,54,23,0,6,9,0,3,2,2,3,0,7,0,4,19,19,0,0,6,2,1,2,2,6,0,8,2,10,28,6,40,44,5,23,0,0,0,0,44,13,0,5,11,161,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08144875437448018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679774814846116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08503981306738294,0.12417263253181215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688443334185478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678692999286986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641071812276888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08508192290014023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10299601370188742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663286252645808,0.0,0.0,0.15737685136100452,0.0,0.10642398827626454,0.0,0.05788323747772405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123686221926622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295828614935649,0.0,0.06826736007937324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995167318471361,0.0,0.0,0.09013332142410738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13597024025823615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283864029373026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07551987822913374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19958114826147044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20704692563140006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102927394173557,0.0,0.0,0.3557231102898174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974559125318005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304943884956991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697864528184565,0.0,0.24298367333277596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11506058590371047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382241529484516,0.0,0.3136339060737158,0.0,0.0,0.07208937552315768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10647487928104273,0.0,0.0,0.11557724522903745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16372502968197564,0.1780413492178265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532814234382448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05938907731145952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457445464951361,0.0,0.09949185194747076,0.21205718158186385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403624199576411,0.06007328660548826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817897734463998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,Gnuggetrizzle,2018/01/29,"Are people with High functioning Autism Doomed to live a hard, unfulfilled life. I would like to get this out of the way, I have Autism.  I've been trying to get gainfully employed for over 13 years, yet nothing ever comes of it.  I practiced doing Graphic Design for the same time, yet when I show it to people, they say I'm not qualified.

I used to goto nonPareil Institute, a school/tech company for people with Autism.  The CEO had a point when he said ""People on the spectrum, face challenges, in a way that makes it hard for Corporate America to easily accommodate their needs.  Business is business.""

The more I look back at that, the more I realize how true it is.  They don't call it a learning disorder for nothing.

So I have long since accepted the fact that prosperity will never happen in my life.

Governments have tried giving incentives to companies who hire people on the spectrum, but nothing has worked.  We are still bullied, mocked, heck, even cast out of society.  And I feel like that is never going to change.

My whole life I will struggle, work minimum wage job after minimum wage job, live off Disability insurance and eventually Welfare, and never be able to be a part of a society that wants me.

A dear friend of mine pointed out that apparently the PECS tools out there might be a bit outdated or expensive. I thought I'd try my hand at developing something in html5 using what I know of eLearning software. This is still in the very early stages, It should work in any browser, on a mac, PC, chromebook or phone. Please comment with suggestions and opinions as to how useful you find it and how I can make it more so but again, VERY EARLY STAGES so be gentle ^.^ - http://lusorystate.com/PECS/index.html 

and even after it is finished, it will remain free and available to anyone that might find it useful for themselves or their loved ones.

autism,Meriadah,2018/01/30,"Got a job as groupleader at a after school daycare I am a graduate in social work abd i have pdd-nos. I also have 6 years of xp in this type of daycare and i know im good at it. Unfortunatly, after quitting my former job because of my studies and my dad passing away and needing time to process, i never seemed to be able to land a job back at the job im the best at.

I was forced to mention my autism at my job interviews. And even though i learnes to live with my autism in such a way that it isnt a hinderance anymore, and in some cases even benificiary, most applications quickly let me know not to be interested.

But i kept at it, even though i felt i wasnt wanted in the one field of work i knew i was the best (an excageration, i know). And this week Ive finally landed a job in the after school day care, after 6 years...

Ive already been working at this job for a day and everyone is happy about my performance. Amd im just glad im back where i belong.

Pediatrician had prescribed Clonidine. I am objecting to this medication because it can cause cardiac arrest and death. But she is going ahead with it and i cannot stop her. Just reaching out to the community for feedback and experience: have you used it for your children? is it safe? What happens if the course ends abruptly? What happens a doze is missed? Any information is helpful thanks.

The pediatrician who prescribed it is not particularly useful - ""see how it goes, i cant really tell you what to expect"" she tells me.

autism,Ya_wut,2018/01/30,"Odd question, my step son is autistic, brilliant and loved. We raised him agnosticly, if not atheistic. Has anyone here been raised in a religious or ultra religious environment? I'm simply wondering if autistic kids across backgrounds naturally develop on the technical side eg. Computers Lego ect. Or if those raised in a religious environment take a more theological path. A more devoted and technical view of their religion?

autism,OCDont,2018/01/31,"Mom of a 6yr old with autism here, are any of you on stimulants? Hi all, 

  Looking for opinions from this community to see if stimulants are a good option for my son. He is 6 (almost 7) and has trouble with attention, focusing, and sitting still. He's always fidgeting. It was never really an issue and just a quirk of his, but its starting to affect his schoolwork and my ability to get him to do homework or pay attention to me to complete tasks, etc. I am constantly repeating myself even when I know he heard me he just is so distracted. 

I just want to do what is best for him and whatever will make his life and learning better and more smooth.

autism,kaleb444,2018/01/31,"Autism and Cold Temperatures I have HFA and have always had difficulties regulating temperatures.

For example.

I sleep with the window open (in Canada in the dead of winter)
I happily go outside without a coat and in a t Shirt 
I bring my coat with me but never wear it.

It's not to say I never feel cold, because I do.

But my question is if I feel cold differently does my body still react to it normally. 

Like if I were to stand outside in the negatives for long periods. Would I start to get frostbite or hypothermia even though I don't feel cold.

On the flip side I'm always dying of heat in the summer. And sweat a LOT.

autism,Brucie-Magik,2018/01/31,"Aspergers + depression/Anxiety 25M aspergers.

Just wondered if this is a common thing with Aspergers.  Not exactly going down to the pits of hell at the moment but it's getting that way and I just wanted to know if this is a common thing and there are more of us out there who suffer from similar things. 

I know it's a big topic, we could go on for hours but sometimes I just feel that maybe if I wasn't autistic that I wouldn't suffer as much or as badly with anxiety and or depression.

Also anyone in the UK able to tip me off about some good autism support for this kind of thing based in the Midlands?  Only reason I ask is I have help before, and it's good, but I feel there's something lacking everytime.

autism,Lisa_Pearson,2018/01/31,"Catatonia and Autism... When we walked into UTSW on November 27th I truly thought that either there were issues with my girls medications or the issues were caused by the multiple seizures she had with the last one being on Oct 3rd. In December when my daughter was in a medically induced coma and all the medical testing were coming back negative, I started to surf the net looking at different possibilities. I came across multiple articles on Autism and Catatonia. The more I researched the subject the more it seemed to fit my daughter and the symptoms she had been displaying prior to the coma. Catatonia in Autism presents differently than it does with someone who has a mental illness and Catatonia. When I brought it up to the Neuro ICU team I was basically shut down. I was told that she already takes Ativan and that is a treatment for Catatonia. I brought up that 1) she has been on 1mg four times a day for years and 2) in some subjects it took doses as high as 20mg to 30mg a day before there were any signs of improvement. Again I was dismissed. I continued my research and came across an article that stated besides using Ativan you could also give the patient 5mg to 10mg of Ambien and if there was improvement you had your diagnosis and if there wasn't the worst that would happen is the person would sleep. I waited a couple of days and brought it up again. The team again shut me down. I brought up that 1) some research has shown that as high as 18% of individuals on the Autism spectrum develop some form of Catatonia in adolescents and as adults and 2) the new DSM5 now specifically added on Catatonia NOS for the individual that has Autism and develops Catatonia. In sure frustration I am sure at my insistence, the director said fine I have no problem giving her an Ambien right now. At that point angry myself, I pointed out that he might want to wait till she was brought out of the medically induced coma as it would be pointless to give her an Ambien right at the moment. Let's just say no one wanted to explore or discuss Catatonia with me again at UTSW. Yesterday my daughter saw her psychiatrist (who has been treating her since 2012) for the first time since she had been discharged from the hospital. I updated him on what had transpired since the 27th of Nov till her discharge on the 22nd of Jan. I brought up to him my thoughts on the possibility of Catatonia and why I had come to the conclusion... WHAT DO YOU KNOW...he agreed with me saying it was a sound medical diagnosis. Beware that if you have a loved one on the spectrum and they start to decline in their functioning level and there is no underlying medical condition that can be found to account for the decline, the first thing that should be ruled out is Catatonia. Till I started my own research I was not aware that there was a correlation between Catatonia and Autism. I hope this will help prevent someone else's family from going through hell....and I can't help but wonder again if doctor's would have let their ego go and seriously looked at Catatonia as a possible diagnosis instead of dismissing me because I don't have a M.D. attached to my name would my daughter be in better condition today than she is....truly disgusting that a doctor's ego is more important than a young woman's life...",6.77549669994923,7.385706295819942,7.0898256896259975,73.38600440006772,64.81993569131834,10.791741411406331,35.1787104416991,10.65788864234165,3.8732951768488753,2644,117,472,66,38,859,276,622,0.036000000000000004,0.906,0.058,0.7837,2,0,0,0,0,0,54.0,1,5,3,6,20,12,2,0,46,0,59,17,1,4,3,77,97,40,0,15,10,4,0,0,0,8,15,4,0,4,29,33,0,3,9,2,1,15,8,5,0,6,39,7,61,7,90,42,11,99,0,0,3,1,48,48,0,13,35,353,90,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08276410186332862,0.05997728221899003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051002409708915786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057670187176916576,0.0,0.045719158521403534,0.0,0.06381927308998242,0.0,0.0,0.06633119430455951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17155949410928548,0.0,0.0770454147522852,0.0,0.12921130729406385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059881206815650324,0.08298580964251563,0.0,0.14510592488282306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15671757587920598,0.0,0.15353086792741974,0.06563279675139047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626526770201282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07070310038635541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758951773033794,0.0,0.08223336741054177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158398160080804,0.08524818572395587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06632204145270743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054151848659536,0.15848273171133426,0.0,0.0744916858997926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15656053102759082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04121790753750055,0.06113481575228101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533846751589121,0.052974549592862234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259618210674137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06769021298971957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4533262163503298,0.0755821195154188,0.07956289489597962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243523706306422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1524653383165748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0654868989143011,0.0,0.0,0.14179803346981934,0.2536528866965713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176464286923982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280987731527349,0.07134194801153444,0.11928564131733364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06827696612576407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861217333537258,0.0,0.07505392548599649,0.0,0.127094109164515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15925565175117906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14137277536002835,0.07795346915161455,0.056390486853986274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04982650899858538,0.0,0.0,0.11908286624026455,0.08746592818983323,0.0,0.07109100446234842,0.0716654862101226,0.08332749468688827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477571358672456,0.0,0.0,0.08847360508409588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06767561933685871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08133404213093336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663883938024966,0.0,0.0,0.04829738747774747

I am working on a data science project and am considering working with autism data as there are some great datasets available. I’ve worked as a behavior interventionist and know that so much data is collected. I want the project to add value (obviously) to the lives of those with autism or those that know someone with autism.

So I’m asking anyone who is willing to answer, what problems need to be solved in terms of understanding or treating autism? What questions do you find yourself asking in regards to autism?

We have had plenty of issues through out the years. Mainly swirling around her alcohol intake, lack of communication or consideration for my thoughts and feelings. She carries a hearty amount of shame and embarrassment surrounding her ASD, her family has really disabled her in my opinion. 

Not only have they made her ASD into a hush hush embarrassment, they also do EVERYTHING for her because she an only child adopted into a super rich family. 

When I came into the picture her mother was cleaning her house and buying her groceries. To this day her mom parents pay for everything. Whenever her parents are in town and tip her into meltdown mode they IMMEDIATELY buy her whatever she wants to make the melt down stop. 

It’s a vicious cycle and one that is really exhausting to keep up with. 

I work with severely disabled children in a rough neighborhood that drains every ounce out of me. After this job I go to my second job that is very physically demanding. 

I’ll come home to a dirty house.dogs who haven’t been taken out or feed and a drunk partner sitting on the couch playing video games asking me what’s for dinner. 

I was more of a mother and housekeeper than partner at this point. I kind of lost it and left two weeks ago.

Don’t get me wrong. These are issues that have been expressed a million times that she admitted to ignoring.

So on to my posted question. 
Have any of you guys found therapy or life coaching to be helpful? I have mothered all I can and am trying to figure out my life a second at a time. She keeps telling me how sorry she is and she’ll do anything to get me back. That she sees how strong and capable I am of figuring out a life on my own and she “wants that”. But I am no life coach. I am barely anything at this point lol

So yay or nay?

autism,a-really-big-muffin,2018/02/01,"""Autism friendly barbers near me"" I don't get my hair cut very much, mostly because I like it long, but every few months or so my mom will insist that I get the ends trimmed or some such and I'll begin the hunt for a barber that won't try to scalp me when I go in there (I'm super paranoid about that after this one lady I went to actually reduced me to tears, LPT guys don't get your hair cut at Wal-Mart). 

So I got the brilliant idea (if I may say so myself...) of looking up autism-friendly barbers in my area and this sweet little list pops up with this one company that specifically trains their stylists to cut hair for autistic people. Needless to say, I'm super excited so I go check out there website to see what their hours are- and they're for kids. 

Every. Single. One. On the list was for children. I can't find a barber anywhere who works specially with autistic adults. It's like as soon as we hit 18 we don't need haircuts or just magically stop having sensory issues and anxiety. I just want a haircut that doesn't feel like murder, is that really too much to ask?

autism,pegem,2018/02/01,"Those colour-changey sequin pillows Dealing with my ASD sucks about 75% of the time. 

But the stimmy feelings that flood my brain when I touch one of those pillows? Tactile and visual nirvana. The subtle click noise of the sequins flicking against each other, the soft glint of the colours under the light, the slight feeling of rotary give where the thread helps the sequin rotate, the fact that it's lined up so perfectly- so many Good things.

(Except I get mad when other people ruffle them too hard and make the sequins stick to the wrong spot. The buffoons. The barbarians. The absolute fools. Caress the pillow, lest you tug on the thread too much. Feel the thread loops and move with the sequin, not against it. Uncultured fiends.)

autism,FlyingArmbarMMA,2018/02/01,"Did you or your child outgrow Autism? Well this post is for any parents or people with Autism.  I have a 6 year old that is Autistic.  Looking back the signs were always there, me and my ex wife didn't see them till around 3.  

By then my niece was 2 and she was speaking full on sentences and my son was hand flapping running around the house, not speaking.  Spinning a lot, we enrolled him in speech therapy, Occupational and Physical.  

By the time time he was 4, once we knew he was autistic.  His mother and I got divorced and she moved to California and I stayed with him.  I like to think we had our issues and that was the reason she left... she is involved in his life and spends summers with him, anyways.  

So it's me and him and he's 4 not really speaking but would point at the food he wanted when he was hungry... stuff like gold fish.  (His diet is extremlyyyyy picky).  So I started to tell him I wasnt going to give him the food unless he ""used your words"".  

It started with me saying stuff like ""Goldfish dad""  and having him repeat it.  I was going through so much at a time but most important was the worries I felt about having a non verbal child.  He was about to be 5 and severely behind I didn't enroll him in school because I was so fearful of him not being ready so we decided to wait.

Now I know you can't ""outgrow Autism"" this is something he's going to live with forever.  But by this time sentences were ""Dad can I eat Goldfish""  I would always tell him to stop spinning and flapping his hand I know some of you might not agree but he stopped doing that as well.  

He went from 4 a nonverbal kid that would just run all over the house and spin and hand flap to now using very small sentences and not much stimming.

He's 6 now and started school, now his sentences consist of ""Dad can I have some goldfish""  we can have conversations to a certain degree on things.  Specially if he likes them.

The most amazing thing he started to read really well... like his teacher is shocked and tells me hes reading better than most kids.  Doing math and hes acing his homework.  His teacher tells me he sees a lot of potential, that he is extremely intelligent and can achieve success like many autistic kids that have gone on to become doctors and such.

However we are struggling with his comprehension. His teacher thinks this might be a life long issue.  I don't agree I seen him come this far.

When I ask him how his day went he usually just says ""I had fun""  I try to get him to tell me more, like what he ate and what he did in school but he will get frustrated with me and tell me "" I don't know "" sometimes.

Sometimes he does tell me stuff that he did and games he played but those are rare days.

I need tips from parents or people that have overcome those great odds.  I feel like he only shares things that he enjoys sometimes.  He also sometimes tells me things like ""Ashley got a timeout because she wasn't listening""  So i know its in there.

He's considered high functioning now but still will freak out at the sound of a Vacuum and is terrified of the blender. Any tips how we can overcome that as well?  I know I expect a lot of him but if I dont who else will... Also he likes to watch a lot of Youtube and that concerns me but at the same time I feel that has been part of the success of him talking.  

Hes very friendly, loves kids and isnt too shy.  We never had that issue, he isnt violent at all, but is very short tempered with me at times ... if he's hungry and asked me for food and I'm taking too long cooking he will scream ""Dad IM HUNGRY!!"" sometimes says funny things like ""I'm going to die!""  if his phone is dying "" Dad I need the charger!!! ""Or will start crying when the battery gets low, a mini tantrum and i tell him to relax...  Btw the way he learned to read was mostly between me and him texting back and forth.  I monitor what he does on the phone he only had me and his mom and apps like ABC mouse.  Hes under my child account on youtube and i see his history.  Hes also allowed only a certain amount of time.  

I know im all over the place in this post but I wanted to share as much as I can so people with similar stories that have had success can hopefully know where hes strong and where he might need more help.   And people that were wondering if their 4-5 year old will ever speak can have some hope I know every case is different but I would endlessly search for stories with success hoping he would one day talk.

Feel free to message me and we can talk more or exchange info, looking forward to speaking with other parents with similar stories.

autism,MsRealLoser,2018/02/01,"No one takes my Autism seriously. I'm 18 and was ""pre-diagnosed"" with Autism when I was 17. Growing up my aunt always suspected I had Autism but my parents brushed it off as me being ""quirky"" and different. I was bullied relentlessly and couldn't get my emotions across correctly, on top of being emotionally abused by my parents. Now at almost 19 I'm still so confused about myself and who I am. I was always told growing up that I needed ""work through my problems"" and I thought I was the way I was because of myself, and it was my fault. Even now my sister tells me I'm in the position I am mentally due to other mental illnesses I have is my fault because I'm not working through them. 

I feel so hopeless. I feel like no one will take me seriously, and no one will respect my boundaries.

autism,DoomKey,2018/02/01,"What kinds of video games do you like to play and why? I like a lot of different kinds of video games and I wonder if any of them may have anything to do with having mild aspergers.

I really like the Rhythm Heaven series for one, which you tap and flick along to the music of mini games. This is a game that rewards pattern recognition so that is why I think my aspergers may factor into why I enjoy it. Other casual games I have enjoyed include Pokemon, Super Mario Galaxy (too old to properly enjoy that one anymore though). You may have noticed these are all Nintendo games, but at the moment I can't make a connection between Nintendo games and autism.

 Recently, I have been enjoying the newly-released Subnautica, which is a unique underwater survival game with Portal vibes (I love portal and like most things valve, too). The aspects that I enjoy are exploring underwater and building my own custom base. I really enjoy organizing my resources into categories, and I do attribute that to my aspergers.

As for more competitive games, I really have only been playing Overwatch recently. But I liked to play Counter Strike competitively about a year or so back.


I'll finish this post by listing most of the game genres I like and some I explicitly don't like, and you can make with it what you will!

Genres I like:

* Roguelikes!! (Like Binding of Isaac, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and Spelunky. Procedural generation definitely relates to recognizing patterns.)

* Action/Adventures 

* FPSs

* Top-down shooters (Loved Jamestown.)

* RPGs

* Rhythm games!!!


Genres I don't like:

* MMO's or MMORPGS (I attribute this to just not wanting to spend a long time playing them)

* RTS's (never liked the genre, closest I got to liking an RTS was Supreme Commander which I gave up on pretty quick. Though I have heard ""Tooth and Tail"" is a fun new take on the genre.)

* Any card games, though I was into Hearthstone for a while, I quickly grew to hate it as it updated.

* Visual Novels (just figured I'd throw this one in here even though it doesn't really count haha)


**TLDR**: I wonder if pattern-based games or games that include categorization attract me due to my aspergers. What games do you like to play, and do you attribute any to where you are on the spectrum?",3.728295519001701,6.551592304878049,4.418360748723766,80.36782473057289,77.17073170731706,7.228587634713558,26.85195689166194,8.283103749626381,2.200476460578559,1775,71,303,35,43,566,207,410,0.015,0.746,0.239,0.9983,1,0,0,1,0,0,77.0,0,8,2,3,17,37,1,0,19,1,32,3,1,5,3,51,45,28,1,3,10,0,0,13,0,4,0,1,0,0,24,19,0,0,6,26,1,3,6,1,0,3,7,1,41,36,43,34,7,33,1,0,0,2,29,11,0,14,31,207,65,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19291935665555998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09378162504800458,0.0,0.0,0.07781773886329699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07271352779782858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09879877600485908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062458328550573074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563110418277533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09336192153405642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1969467571943244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6005866191648289,0.0,0.0,0.08368576014758536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08039454295491964,0.17069457981017333,0.0,0.12624379900435911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07293323430997062,0.09133005945636384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10766122089780257,0.09922853147410833,0.0,0.1922361129482352,0.07191983593476736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056573477754194,0.09620511982204667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423193093012116,0.0,0.1867401817080699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07110001604141923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282381633378126,0.0605925002875334,0.3716328049707657,0.0,0.055140762603073296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05577602794075477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2559866684387471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20510025796360135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06089582154731366
autism,elliote3,2018/02/01,"Is anyone willing to record (or has recorded) a video of themselves about autism? Or in written form? Hello. I have to do a 10 minute presentation in school, and chose to do it about autism, because I have autism and feel it is important to talk about. I will present it in a video format.

I need to interview others for my presentation, but because I am not close to anyone I know in real life who also has autism, I have come to the internet. I will include a few short clips in my video presentation of people with autism talking about their experiences.

If anyone is willing to record themselves talking about their experience with autism, how it affects them, and any other information they want to include on the topic, that would be great. The clip does not have to be too long, around 1-3 minutes would be great.

Other things you can do:

If you have posted a youtube video on the topic and would allow me to use a part of it in my presentation, that would be great too! You can email me the link or leave it in the comments. 

And if you are not willing to record yourself, then you can also send me an email writing about it, and I can read off it in the video.

autism,JSir11,2018/02/02,"Seeking book recommendations Hey yall. Hope all is well. I am stuck in my search for a good book to gift a autistic male. I am not looking for a book about autism, rather a book that can be enjoyed by a mid 20’s autistic man. He has been gravitating lately towards reading about careers, business, and self help. His reading comprehension is around a ninth grade level. Any recommendations would be really appreciated, Thank you ",4.1569230769230785,7.0208710384615385,4.853525641025644,77.63105769230769,75.7948717948718,6.976923076923077,28.98076923076923,8.07648339933343,2.2225076923076923,343,15,60,6,8,110,60,78,0.024,0.701,0.275,0.9646,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,2,0,0,5,5,0,0,6,0,10,0,0,0,1,7,14,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,1,6,5,9,9,1,6,0,0,1,0,9,5,0,1,1,37,7,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18836575473401646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465838262539484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23232983998309964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1856635707990962,0.0,0.0,0.2751180329715054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124618547076229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23260561244508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5541389060765181,0.0,0.17744976595833256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2889656679077006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2550193150542078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2490513161618639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19676894145735985,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,lhpcwshc,2018/02/02,"What does a meltdown feel like? I know everyone is different but I'm curious, what do people's meltdown feel like, consist of?

For me before a meltdown the world around me seems to shrink, so my personal space zone etc and everything gets louder. I have to hide and get away from the place I'm in. If I'm lucky and caught myself in time I just step away and can sit and breathe for a few minutes but if I'm not I end up sitting somewhere and crying :(

My place of work doesn't have a prayer/quiet room at the moment which means the only place I can go to hide for a few ... A toilet cubicle which is accross the hall from my office and through a big open plan area, so in order to get to it I have the leave my shared office which was noisy and crowded then enter and cross a much larger and also noisy area ... Fun times.

I'm in discussion with work for some noise cancelling headphones and to see if the lights can be changed or dimmed.

So that's my meltdown, what about you guys?",2.8242350746268663,4.281033000000001,3.5163401741293536,92.22734608208958,74.72139303482588,6.418034825870647,23.507773631840802,6.9077264865688965,0.6020669154228862,767,22,167,7,16,242,115,201,0.098,0.809,0.093,0.466,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,3,7,5,0,0,15,0,12,1,1,0,0,29,28,22,0,3,8,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,8,14,0,0,5,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,2,4,15,5,26,25,5,33,0,0,1,0,6,20,0,7,7,105,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12468290496876935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387948854299494,0.0,0.0,0.2929692295907026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13266977207804884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649344012540978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17126219623026698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16289503206345834,0.0,0.0,0.13643978949078114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13809190427248152,0.0,0.1738832816055262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14898075864878418,0.14012380394040622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1576677542484081,0.2227673689241666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24437301930312544,0.0,0.08860847846165522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1543775594754938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568525045442185,0.0,0.0,0.1650884746986126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15234162038439594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16983405891764505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461338346834607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11857822995718502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10808986659412688,0.1361364918840216,0.488685096190375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12424181242630362,0.14193658272030116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818272787466398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2270118314169141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Spenny10,2018/02/02,"Please share your opinions on the new Netflix series, ""Atypical"". Recently, a Netflix series called ""Atypical"" was released about a highschool-aged boy on the autism spectrum. It is a sort of comedy/drama. I watched a few episodes, finding it entertaining, but then I wondered to myself what the impact of a show like this might have on individuals with autism, or their loved ones. Perhaps it makes autism seem glamorous or always comedic (in some ways the lead character is sort of charming and 'quirky'). 

My question is, in your opinion, is this show harmful, helpful, annoying, offensive, or what? I do not want to support something that is unhelpful to the autism community. Please share your opinions, and I apologize if anything in my post has ignorant language (please feel free to correct anything I have said).",8.249277777777777,9.638463721428577,7.165238095238094,71.39753968253969,61.78571428571429,9.936507936507935,41.98412698412698,9.994966539143718,4.638103174603175,651,37,99,13,9,198,91,140,0.087,0.6609999999999999,0.253,0.9811,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,3,1,1,1,14,2,0,10,0,11,1,0,2,1,26,19,8,0,2,6,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,8,3,0,1,5,6,1,1,1,4,0,1,2,3,12,11,15,16,2,12,0,0,1,1,13,6,0,14,4,68,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15252817143505534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016961650496192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18717947364435814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09268678059272104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675415431942747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12286848001002194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08955575229074257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16544396199288247,0.0,0.12236050088726642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19446238943306784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1770414374294714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12421524729387555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6036562845668867,0.0,0.0,0.1755598097966097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2053485692166638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18099599623732487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743692923098217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16687806537727712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14112059289416878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20801742485027072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081206803052127,0.14550253235374422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1987913108957317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,bellsxo11,2018/02/02,"What did I do wrong? So there’s a girl in some of my classes with autism. She’s very intelligent in most classes, except math. We’re in the same math class. Often times she gets very angry, probably overwhelmed because she can’t copy down the notes fast enough. She yells “SLOW DOWN!” To the teacher when she’s trying to copy down the notes. She had expressed that she doesn’t learn in class. She just copies down the notes and teaches herself at home. 
One day I noticed she was getting more and more frustrated. I’ve noticed from the years that I known her, she likes going on walks to cool her down. Makes sense. So I said “hey, if you ever want to go on a walk, you can copy my notes when you get back so you don’t miss anything.” And she got very angry with me and said “do you think I’m stupid? I’m not stupid!” And I feel bad. I know she’s not stupid. What did I do wrong? Did she think I was being demeaning? By the way, I spoke in a normal voice, not that idiotic voice as if I’m talking to a child. I hate that. Anyway, what could i do better? I don’t want her to be angry with me, and i want her to be able to get through school.

autism,casperwoudenb,2018/02/03,"Please help me to make a plan for my brother live Hello, i'm writing this post because I need some help on the situation with my brother. Let me first introduce my brother and his problem, and then to my question. 

My brother is a 27 year old male with autism and ADD. His iq, social skills and fine motorskills are slightly below average. He also suffers from depression and a really bad case of loneliness. He now works in a social workplace which is a cafetaria the dutch government created to put people like my brother to work. he is very unhappy in this place and has the feeling he's less of a person because he works there. Me and my family are trying to do everything to give give some meaning into his life by finding him a hobby or voluntary work but the things we tried failed because of his lacking abilities. Per example he really like to help people so he became a volunteer at the red cross and he really liked that but he just didn't had the motorskills to band aid a wound. He strongly started to indentify his entire being with this voluntary work and when he got laid off this really hurted his self esteem and left him without a purpose. I think this would be way less of a problem if he had friends or anyone except for his family who likes to be around him and could help him cope with these problems. he has a awfully hard time making and maintaining friends, mostly because of his loneliness (he's so desperate to find a friend that when he finally has some decent social interaction that he ruins it by claiming too much and having too high of a expectation). It feels like everything we try with him fails because he's not smart enough to work with his brain and too clumsy to work with his hands. My brother isn't an hopeless case but he's just a tad too bad to really function well in a normal corporate environment

My family and I really think there should be a place where he could be happy and feels like he belongs. I was wondering if anyone on here has had the same issues or knows anyone with the same issues, and if you would help me by telling me about how you tackled this situation. I'm really starting to get a bit hopeless so anywords, even the slightest hint would be very much appreciated!

autism,NoraGaKill,2018/02/03,"I don't understand pleasantries This is probably an autism thing and might not even be the right place to ask, but I feel like this might helps others.

 I don't understand why people say things that are obviously supposed to be kind or polite but just drag out conversations to double or triple the length, purely for no reason. They repeat themselves or just da things that neither of you actually care about and I end up feeling rude because I say ""yes OK sure fine"" a lot. I swear it's a trap to just annoy someone like me who wants something with a bit of politeness and the rest is just information and doesn't actually care about the conversation. And it's always the same things too ""what are you doing at school?"", ""what's your life plan"", all that kinda thing.

autism,An_Unwelcome_Arrival,2018/02/03,"ASD UK employment rate. I posted this /r/aspergers a few days ago. I thought it also might be of some interest here:

So, this is not new information, but I recently came across [this survey](http://www.autism.org.uk/get-involved/media-centre/news/2016-10-27-employment-gap.aspx).

According to the survey, only 32% of people with ASD in the UK are employed in any capacity. If one excludes part-time work, then the number drops to a mere 16%.

Assuming that this survey at least approximately describes reality, I must admit to being slightly shocked. I didn't expect the employment rate for people with autism to be very high, but this seems really low.

Anyway, I thought this information might be of some interest to a few of the people here.

autism,Sogolan,2018/02/03,"Not wanting to work. Hey everyone, I was only recently diagnosed (I'm 25 now) so I'm kind of new around here. I have someone that is helping me get my life on tracks but was wondering about something and I don't really have anyone else that I could talk to about this.

So right now I'm in the process of quitting my study (chemistry) and looking for another one, after nearly 5 years I finally realized that this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. The thing is, I'm not sure if there is anything I want to do for the rest of my life. Everyone around me always speaks of wanting to finish university so they can finally start working, but I have never in my life felt a single urge to get a job. I've had a part-time job once, because a good friend offered it to me and I couldn't find a valid reason to decline it.

To be honest, I'm not sure if I would even be able to function in a working environment. I have difficulty handling being told what to do, so working for a boss is troublesome. I can't handle people that don't follow the rules, this to the point where I have trouble handling my emotions. Working for myself wouldn't work either, as I have difficulty doing things without being told if I'm not interested in it. All I feel like doing is play games and hang out with friends.

Do others feel this way too? Thinking I'm the only one seems a little naïeve to me, so if there's anyone out there that can grant some insight in whether this is the case, or even if they know of a way to deal with this that would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. I'm apologizing in advance for my messages, I've been told that I have a very direct and sometimes even rude style of typing which can come over as aggressive or angry. I really aren't, I just want to try my best to improve, because right now my life feels like it's falling apart before I've even completed the tutorial.",5.131175607001693,5.141614174025975,6.140338791643143,80.85361377752683,68.29870129870129,8.98136645962733,30.76510446075664,8.716276077567194,2.2581462450592884,1487,54,305,22,23,496,180,385,0.101,0.7829999999999999,0.116,0.9196,2,0,1,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,2,9,23,16,2,0,19,0,41,6,0,2,4,57,71,22,0,15,17,0,4,2,2,3,6,1,0,0,23,12,0,0,12,2,0,5,13,3,0,2,8,6,34,13,50,53,7,38,0,0,1,0,16,19,0,10,14,215,57,10,0.08494001571264241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07067689747570767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906701253110763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11878406788003056,0.08703108384426332,0.06989839557312585,0.1512292446266817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10355729038740874,0.0,0.07227769724369111,0.0,0.08913930610789278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07316830243345264,0.08905799042327933,0.0,0.0,0.0678176909145616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756942649616034,0.0,0.08621232797504763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095648386315451,0.09554608506316324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22440831715933252,0.0,0.0,0.16232765007567052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12884467231866892,0.12136232839385876,0.0815557354573558,0.18609527075606452,0.0776336355432248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13124889087353686,0.0,0.08875530487998481,0.0,0.0,0.07124365522801476,0.0,0.09364666718778568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056933502073496525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685797182707276,0.0,0.0,0.08845195544293928,0.046680811262351185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29997822536267704,0.08299480238255813,0.0851322102868563,0.0,0.0,0.07132822050901412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06551097650345956,0.08203559647000971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09045834459174043,0.11511510582354252,0.1292014189863263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09198175967268607,0.0,0.0588867119497667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029576988782029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034416218359327,0.0,0.0,0.10882949815785166,0.0873324828922364,0.08386801827638614,0.0,0.0,0.14507661862847127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07732620018090347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196939967255253,0.06539097388929914,0.08400784745038127,0.0,0.0601209803052699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16010991917074022,0.0,0.0,0.06827156715921175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11286074434072801,0.05442613234114869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24349147511350575,0.0,0.057668695059818316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07008440860100441,0.2504991099361929,0.13484286168080206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08187914405545807,0.09211382374187484,0.3710240584170499,0.0,0.0,0.12067790022830745,0.0,0.0,0.054698585251135
autism,bequietbestill,2018/02/04,"My 9 year old son Trace says Hi! This is Trace.  Trace is 9. He reads these posts from time to time with me and says hello to everyone. Trace is on the spectrum. He is extremely high functioning. This year (3rd grade) is his first year at a new school. He has dealt with more stress than I would ever wish on him due to things outside of anyone's control. The school was an anticipated move, but he has reverted a bit socially and is having meltdowns again. To help, we've been researching service dogs. Any of you have one? Success stories? Pointers on where to start!? We look forward to hearing from you guys and I hope this will become a community he can turn to for support. Against every fiber of my being, this boy is super tech talented and loves computers more each day. I hope he will use this sub someday as a resource! 


Edit: the darn pic won't load to imgur to link- will update asap w the pic he wanted me to post along with this. Mom fail.

Well- I got it!

autism,Batstronaut,2018/02/05,"Propioceptive Sensory Issues Does anyone else have to seal with the less obvious, but very real, issue of propioceptive sensory processing? I can tell where my body is in relation to my head, but I sometimes struggle with specific body parts like my hands. This really only affects my writing, typing, and guitar skills as I can never seem to write or play guitar without keeping an eye on where my hands are and how they're moving. 

Does anyone else deal with this?",10.040714285714287,8.969614500000002,9.87857142857143,61.641428571428605,58.76190476190475,12.685714285714289,37.66666666666667,11.698219412168324,4.6132238095238085,374,14,58,9,4,123,61,84,0.034,0.889,0.077,0.5803,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,3,3,0,1,2,0,5,6,6,2,2,18,7,7,0,0,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,1,1,3,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,3,8,2,11,7,2,6,0,0,1,0,4,4,0,2,2,39,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2367098318433717,0.3468666057594298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3760333489064413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17450609825437205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962521178499825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28280050789989664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737160326527135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3533400310848331,0.0,0.15045164355855398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269495255748834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1799032639086852,0.0,0.0,0.13054858710252984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12873463044331312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18329888219326868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926620793636208,0.10843631081300263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15409366061107702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16740867524075112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1769538634816717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479461860690422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13966240482301995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631666499283532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,zacharyjj,2018/02/05,"Late Diagnosis I’m 17 and currently waiting for my assessment referral to go through, I know im not old but in terms of detecting autism its quite late. 
My doctor is saying that I may not be diagnosed because i dont show many of the social symptoms while my sensory ones have become extremely intense since I was a kid. 
Do you think it’s possible that when someone is diagnosed later in life they may not show many social symptoms because theyve been bullied and socialised for so long into acting neurotypical? This also may explain why the biological sensory symptoms are more prevalent in late diagnosis’ because it can no longer be passed off as a bratty kid having a tantrum
Its very clear im autistic and im worried i wont get the help I need for my A-levels if im misdiagnosed.

autism,Dorketrate,2018/02/05,"Struggling with decision to hold son back Hey r/autism,

As the title says, I'm struggling with the decision to hold my son back to repeat grade one and I would like some input into the manner from other parents and anyone that has experience with education or even being someone who was held back.

Im sorry for the format I'm on mobile so, you know. Also, if you don't want to read everything here I'll post a TL;DR at the end. 

Some background, my son was diagnosed with ASD a couple  years ago, right around the same time he was being registered for school. He has a late birthday, Dec 28, which falls three days on the wrong side of the school districts cut off for the school year. At the time I registered him for school it was supposed to be for pre k, as I and his support team wanted to start him a year late to enable him to get a gradual start into the school system and allow him to be with children who were more on par in regards to maturity. The school pushed him into kindergarten instead, against the wishes of myself and his support team, and did not inform me of this until the week prior to the school season starting.

He had a rough go if it in the first couple months. He was constantly being separated from the class for outbursts and I had to come and pick him up from school on multiple occasions because the teacher ""couldn't handle him"". I switched my son to a different school in November of that year. At the new school he started doing better, was assigned a full time EA and the school took steps to address behaviour issues. Thing started looking up.

At the end of the school year, I brought up holding my son back in Kindergarten and the sxhoool pushed really hard to move him into grade 1. They wanted a more routine schedule (every day instead of every other day) and new material for him to engage with. He wasn't meeting the standards for moving into Grade 1 (knowing alphabet, counting and numbers) but I agreed with the routine for him because that's a huge stressor in his life.

Grade 1 has been so much better. His teacher is awesome, he has been doing much better with his schoolwork and he has started making friends (some in his class, but also some in Kindergarten). He still only knows six or seven letters by sight though, and about as many numbers. He can read a surprising amount for how little of the letters he know, but not anywhere close to the other kids in the class. He is every good at math functions, but cannot understand or write the answers because he doesn't know the majority of the numbers.

We are meeting with the school staff in a  couple weeks to update his IEP and discuss whether or not we will be holding him back in grade 1. The school is resistant to the idea, citing the studies that have been done showing the negative effects or grade retention on children. I have looked at these studies a bit myself and it also worries me. However, I also fear that continuing to push him through will only lead to an ever widening gap between him and his other classmates academically, as well as the widening gap in maturity and development.

My son is already the biggest kid in the class, and will be that much bigger than  the kids next year if he's held back. He has been physically aggressive in the past, but those behaviours have been lessened and he is doing much better. I don't think he should be pushed forward for reasons like this but I know it is a concern for the school.

So, my question to everyone that made it through that wall of text. Do you have any experience with situations like these? What are your opinions or experiences on the matter? What resources should be looking to to inform myself better?

TLDR son is struggling in grade 1, school thinks he should move on but my gut tells me it would be best to hold him back a year. He is youngest in class by age, biggest by physical size and not on the same level as the other kids academically or maturity wise. Asking for advice or personal experiences on the matter.

autism,fudog1138,2018/02/05,"As a parent on the spectrum, how do you deal with your children who are not? This weekend I got into an argument with my second daughter.  It was the same argument that we had a few years ago.  She is hurt by what she perceives as an Ozzie and Harriet life with my second wife and her two step-siblings.  It, of course, has not been that easy, far from it, but she has convinced herself of a narrative and I can't change it.  I don't know how to get through to her.  I am good at emulating or acting out emotions, but I fall short with some people, especially my second daughter.  I love her of course, but I can't seem to show it with any success.  My attempts always fall short or seem practiced and that hurts her.  Her older sister has said that I am too analytical in my approach, which is how I am and is how I have made my career.  I have suggested counseling to help communicate over the last ten years, she is 25, she won't go.
There is a part of me that would like to just move on and disregard the distraction, but I know that is wrong.  Any advice?  Thank you for your time,   ",3.3719691780821925,4.456178214611871,4.511595319634704,87.09561215753428,72.78995433789954,7.666780821917808,26.016267123287676,8.07648339933343,1.3702623287671236,835,27,181,12,16,274,125,219,0.093,0.784,0.123,0.8981,1,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,4,0,2,7,10,0,1,10,0,24,2,0,5,0,37,35,18,0,1,9,5,0,1,0,2,1,1,0,1,15,14,0,1,5,2,0,6,6,4,0,5,6,1,35,6,27,27,4,23,0,2,0,1,28,10,0,5,8,141,50,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707310656247666,0.15487574786929045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453782297633183,0.0,0.0,0.23762659503883965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848270245673113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801251704600711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1965326889465166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128222634553756,0.0,0.09929548536253308,0.1465440171942587,0.13973684712779716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11710887208250735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3740755251512845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19203937772080984,0.14241736996793142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340752050061912,0.08535771858180256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15768857708882975,0.1653210967592014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185696124101286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19400213775405575,0.189201080824554,0.0,0.1211265101553442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16619552180154454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31811091030099503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16085559604780175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187867012697448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170672757074849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12411367882111478,0.19102520394148148,0.0,0.2250235587124104
autism,Hububalli,2018/02/05,"Working and ever changing fixed interests. Anyone made it work? I am in my 30s, I spent about 10 years going form job to job in all different fields, full and part time. I had several jobs a year with a few months between each to recover. I had various problems; I cannot see someone as my boss, if I know better, I am doing it my way. I cant stand people not doing their jobs properly, especially when it effects something I am doing. I also have no interest in being around random people at the workplace. Fixed interests are a really big part of who I am, they are all encompassing.  I cannot do things I have no interest in and as my interests change so frequently, even if I get a job in something I like at the time, it wont last. It was the most depressing, stressful and unpleasant time in my life. Hated every second of it and it destroyed my evenings and weekends too. I almost completely lost the ability to talk at one point too.

Then I was diagnosed at 28 and it finally all made sense. Not had a job since then and have been so much happier. I would love to have more money and a career like everyone else though. I feel like I could make a success of it some how if the world was more accessible for the likes of us. I prefer this life though to the one I had in my late teens and early twenties. 

I spend 95% of my awake time learning new things (currently this is a degree in electronic engineering via distance learning). I am pretty sure I work harder at my interests than most people do in their adult jobs. 

I have made some extra money via my interests though. I like making things and am generally quite good at it so I sell them online and they often do quite well. The nice thing about that is when my interests change and I want to make something else, I can just sell that instead! I only sell small amounts and if the demand gets too high I shut it down and move on to something else.

autism,healthyhappysandra,2018/02/05,"How to support a 10-year old child who constantly asks questions and is in her own world? I am 22, I am studying to be a doctor and I really need a job, but in my city there are no available jobs at the moment and tends to be very few, if any. But there was an application to my school to be a supporter for two children. 
In my country, there is 400 free hours support-person service paid by the government. So the family decided to use that. They are always home, so I am kind of like a babysitter while they do their own things. I already met them, the children are 10-year old girl, who is in her own world, only asks questions like ""what did you eat today? what is your favorite color? etc, etc, etc. Father says that she can't keep a conversation and focuses only for 15 minutes at a time. Also, she can't retell a story after she has read it. The boy, who is 7, seems to be fine to me and the father didn't say anything about him, but he was referred also in the application. 
When I asked, what the last supporter did with them, he told me they just studied some time and then played or did something with crafts. I would spend 3 nights in a week with them, from 6 to 8 pm. 
I already was there one time, the kids seemed to be fine with me, although the boy only wanted to play cards and of course we played with the girl and she couldn't focus after 2 minutes, she kept asking questions that she already asked. She actually drew me a picture of skis and the marathon, she kind of knows what her parents tell her and she is very much into it. Tells sentences like ""I will go to the marathon next week. Are you going to the marathon? What will you offer in your marathon? I will offer tea. "" But only that topic. 
I really don't know what I should do, what exercises should I do with them or should I just be there for the girl (and the boy)? Their father, with whom I talk, doesn't really care until everything i s good and the children are happy and I do something with them. Is that normal? I don't know what to do. What should I plan, how I should approach the girl?",4.094028298670306,4.745059997613367,4.7214890896692845,87.86486575178999,70.74224343675421,7.513160586430278,26.181469485168773,7.447530270364453,1.128317354244801,1605,47,345,16,28,514,188,419,0.016,0.866,0.118,0.9908,3,0,2,0,0,0,59.0,1,5,10,1,15,17,0,0,29,0,49,4,0,3,0,58,74,31,0,11,9,4,0,3,0,9,2,2,1,12,21,23,2,2,10,10,3,3,8,0,0,2,11,3,57,18,45,47,9,35,0,0,1,0,70,12,0,9,23,250,78,7,0.0,0.0,0.07725027475825738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620702884529925,0.12661096053224774,0.06586876913271872,0.0,0.0,0.05383258330318697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514322848334078,0.0,0.3700269174350614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071049816219186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554553631430126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08102522296969637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08100205052889044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648582334934705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114531625153837,0.0,0.07462648457327131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997869092111106,0.0663969705234734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426896504870539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794055108274405,0.0,0.07795820221300558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571112901079157,0.07036244215693235,0.0,0.1648691903718897,0.13051538861158984,0.06452724646722609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11602303594108633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05819286362638465,0.05869730234244625,0.0,0.0,0.0841892295420393,0.07428777246260848,0.07756153264582998,0.0,0.0,0.16613350612100633,0.0,0.05364192968279049,0.2408237696555674,0.0,0.0,0.0878995572017902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0691208309801729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2660372317495284,0.0,0.07918299391793325,0.0,0.1521387895836763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12590491821344085,0.0,0.08011573676707033,0.0,0.14413144349968018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218848907157623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3593264537070578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06362707272322855,0.1383814056583615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05259143071242863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384792471280038,0.0,0.07503591382580505,0.07564227412759697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07732935289768116,0.0,0.0,0.0683701812832415,0.0,0.1306331742003638,0.046691545977976326,0.0,0.12699727568639674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05623410925961882,0.0,0.0,0.10195491348588713

autism,Universe13,2018/02/06,"How to approach parents about getting a diagnosis? I'll spare the long and grimy details of my life leading up to the point where I am now, believing I'm on the spectrum. Anywho, after taking the AQ and scoring a 44 I'm highly considering going to a doctor and taking whatever tests there are to see if I do land on the spectrum.

The only thing is, I'm naturally a very nervous person and was wondering if anyone had advice/personal stories on how to approach parents with the subject? I'm 14 turning 15 in May and live in the US, if that makes any difference.

As well, I'm concerned because I don't share some of the traits others on the spectrum have. For example I don't have huge sensory issues, just really bad social anxiety, but I'm worried that my trend of repression has caused me to hide my own symptoms from myself. 

Mostly I'm just wondering how to approach them about it, what to expect, and what caused you to know you were on the spectrum (if it was a later diagnosis like me) Anyways, thank you in advance :^)

Ninja edit really quick to address that I already have a cousin on the spectrum on my dad's side, who I'm sure would be supportive. The biggest fear I have is my mom's side, since I feel like she'd try to shelter me and make a huge deal about the fact. Dunno if this makes any difference but I thought it was worth tossing in.",6.827870321560361,5.864652822878227,7.678104902477598,74.49155904059042,65.05166051660517,10.399683711122826,36.33131259884028,9.606745405546679,3.3988205587770164,1069,46,203,18,14,361,151,271,0.095,0.818,0.087,0.3647,2,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,1,3,1,2,14,11,0,3,21,0,21,3,0,9,2,40,45,18,0,7,9,5,1,2,0,2,3,0,1,1,12,8,0,1,5,0,1,6,2,4,1,0,6,2,23,7,34,35,3,32,0,0,1,0,16,21,0,11,7,138,35,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13967237026025206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17214292894260527,0.0,0.09682516831777896,0.0,0.0,0.08850019767422553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10568007897314928,0.07715547070798373,0.0,0.0,0.14260025895204936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2600430731165569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304873910018977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26447595988700395,0.0,0.1295490420892123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14242565123241785,0.06399724122929562,0.0904211334461836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06612723546770648,0.0,0.0719322501687583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13372741493646054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13210546580894106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06955917738873503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939963992266492,0.12367073375880736,0.0,0.11176301104931932,0.11200984788929816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534579723929305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1482364348260048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626165633280696,0.0,0.0,0.2810804591014016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22103086208700135,0.0,0.0,0.11964889962605638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16216706956835628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008593453812238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10469943316483493,0.0,0.0,0.129021462439581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14362934210151135,0.11929006767579255,0.1315539655634167,0.190328724210216,0.0,0.0,0.11652800662295923,0.0,0.0,0.0840870190933563,0.0,0.0,0.10048188653474603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08593224669764933,0.13767105347056482,0.0,0.0,0.1522472842312399,0.0,0.0,0.10443292818249772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138010013594362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745180142481106,0.0,0.12853726830613849,0.0,0.08991119950448465,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,drea4385,2018/02/06,"Question for women on the spectrum or parents of daughters on the spectrum. Okay so I didn't know if this was an appropriate place to ask but I know no one with girls on the spectrum. So guys if you are squeamish about talking or reading about ""that time of the month"" please do not read.

I have a daughter, who is autistic, and is coming of puberty age. She's pretty non verbal and has issues understanding some things that have to deal with hygiene. 

Although she has yet to start her period I fear she is not going to handle it well. Any tips on how to help her better adjust? Or what to do in the event of getting it. Any help and advice is better than none.

autism,AppropriateCloud,2018/02/07,"I need feedback on a poem I wrote about autism! Hey guys I have an interview in a couple of weeks for a school that teaches those with autism and during it I have to give a presentation about autism. I thought I’d write a poem to give some variation but as autism is a very complex and multidimensional disorder I’d love some feedback on whether I’ve captured it well. Also the poem is very story like which I’m not sure is good.  


Mum asked me today if I loved her more than I loved our neighbour 
I didn’t understand the question and 
I couldn’t answer her because the washing machine was on and the cat was meowing
And it was all too confusing so 
I ran to my room and imagined a castle and a dragon and snakes 
I have to close the door though because I can hear Mum crying 

After playing 
I look up the word love and don’t understand it well
I ask Mum and she says ‘ hmmm.. it’s when you want to hug someone lots’
I still don’t understand 
She says ‘well think about your friends at school’
I say ‘but they’re annoying sometimes Mum I like playing by myself more
And  with the blocks and cars!’ 
I start imagining playing with them and flap my hands around as if knocking them down in front of me 
I think Mum is telling me to stop but I am too engrossed 

I hear Mum speaking to my teacher on the phone the next day when it’s 5pm  
And we should be eating dinner 
Because we always do at 5
I scream and shout to get her attention
I am so nervous 
It’s 5:01 now 
Mum! Mum!

I didn’t know much about autism until the doctor used the words autism, spectrum and Jacob in the same sentence 

I went to ask her to explain what this meant but before I did
I am overwhelmed by doubt 
I mean she could be wrong, right? And doesn’t spectrum infer we all fall on it somewhere? 
What if these are just idiosyncrasies of his
What if it’s oppositional defiant disorder , i mean hear I am myself doubting a Dr

But all I said was “are you sure?”
To which she said yes,
And explained the behaviours I told myself he’d grow out of as Autism.

Mum took me to see a strange lady today 
She showed me pictures of people and asked me to tell her how they were feeling 
She asked me about Sally and her ball and her friend Ann 

I didn’t want to talk to her
When she kept waiting I just said I don’t know
I said I want to go home
She was ok though, 
she didn’t tell me off for not looking at her like my teachers do

The next day Mum tells me I’m special 
I tell her I know, and make sure we are having the same dinner 
as it’s a Tuesday 
She laughs and says yes, but doesn’t leave 
She puts her hand on my shoulders to stop me from rocking and says Jacob you have something called autism
I say okay 
And try to remove her hands

She removes them and says
It means you are precious and capable but you are a bit different
And that different is not always bad
And that she loves me and will always protect me
I say okay and remember what she said about love and hug her
And she hugs me back too tightly

When I quickly let go of her her face is very close to mine and her mouth reminds me of my sharks, all teeth exposed
I look away 
I wonder where my sharks are. 

I tell Mum I am going to bed now
And when she leaves I take out my shark and it swims around the blue carpet
And then I take out my bricks stacking them up on top of each other until they fall over
And when I go to close the door 
I don’t need to
Because Mum isn’t crying tonight.


Thanks for reading! Also how old do you think Jacob is? And is he more likely to be high functioning or not and why? Thanks guys!

autism,morganella732,2018/02/07,"People diagnosed as adults, how did you obtain a diagnosis? I'm an 18 year old (female) college student who has already been diagnosed, when I was much younger, with ADHD, sensory processing disorder, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorder. I've always felt shocked by the similarities between me and those with autism and aspergers. However, the one time I voiced this to my mom a few years ago, she laughed at me and told me I was being ridiculous. She said if I had it, I would have been diagnosed as a child. I see a psychiatrist 3 or so times a year to make sure I'm doing okay on my medications, but I'm worried voicing my thoughts about this will make him laugh at me too and if it's incredibly improbable that I have any form of this and should save myself the possible embarrassment.

RNA sequencing revealed that treatment with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) leads to subtle but significant changes in the expression of about 200 genes, encoding proteins of extracellular matrix or involved in signal transduction of growth factors (e.g., insulin/insulin growth factor 1).""

autism,charlesnan,2018/02/07,"Verbal but not conversational I am a parent of an 11 yr old boy with ASD. He has always had words. By two, he had lots of labels and could read and spell his name. He has always been clear, you can understand his words. 
He engages in a lot of scripting (which has been decreasing) and has just started answering questions accurately. He gets his wants and needs across very clearly. He just seems to have no interest in social language. He also has a receptive delay. I know he does have a hard time understanding a lot of things. I do wonder how much he understands and how much he is just ignoring. At this point, I am getting worried this will not develop. At school, they gave him an AAC device. I knew he would not take to it because he can get needs and wants across verbally. I feel like if he had the desire to converse, he would? He gets services at school. I still have him go to ST outside of school. He did ABA for a few years but we stopped. He has seemed to make more progress without it. 
I guess I am wondering if this type of language can still develop? I know anything can happen but wondering if anyone could give me some insight?

autism,rumblingsofsvetlana,2018/02/07,"First IEP meeting Resulted in tears. My son transitioning into PreK after so many hours of ABA made some progress. School that he is transitioning to totally dismissed/rejected ABA. We had our EI people totally siding with the school. 
I feel so cheated on because thats not how these people acted before the meeting. It almost feels like they took out their mask and monsters came out of them. 
Resentment big time. Now I am picking up pieces. I will hire advocate, do neurotesting and perhaps get ABA through my insurance outside.

autism,Botterpop,2018/02/08,"Looking for advice on a good oral stim toy? Hi, I'm hoping you guys can help me. 

A few years back I got a toy that I really liked as a gag gift. It was silicone but not hard, very soft. I liked that because a lot of silicone chew stim is very hard and hurts my teeth (I don't have the best oral hygiene).

The toy was nice because it was soft and had a lot of texture to nibble on. Unfortunately it isn't a toy I can use in public because it's inappropriate.

I was hoping someone here could recommend a teething necklace or bracelet made out of really soft, textured silicone?

Thank you in advance for any help!",3.4501244444444485,4.4593844480000016,4.930666666666667,84.44977777777778,72.52000000000002,8.115555555555558,28.288888888888888,8.515128840125781,1.8849822222222223,476,18,102,8,9,160,76,125,0.1,0.6509999999999999,0.249,0.9501,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,0,2,2,9,0,0,10,0,12,3,2,2,0,13,20,5,0,3,3,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,6,3,1,0,0,4,0,1,3,1,0,0,7,6,10,8,12,12,4,8,0,1,1,0,7,5,0,5,4,61,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17260483688616982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12011727193994932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13582075034283167,0.0,0.3230235960412519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18536663200227607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410279875837012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14815233590851468,0.14127045723764453,0.0,0.0,0.17489556853903945,0.0,0.0,0.3164589891205125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23678828091133625,0.0,0.0,0.35087511133524,0.0,0.0,0.1890904996275016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17258903690284694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483281907811587,0.0,0.0,0.3003360579056453,0.0,0.16713549368150418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22631270554878855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14966153324527084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16262098415691534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525551841257554,0.0,0.2914833275124458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137465946954964

He is a pretty cool kid and we get along great. He is very focused on wrestling and these YouTube videos with a fictional character called Santiago. All we ever talk about is wrestling and Santiago. How do I go about talking about other things with him? I don't want to be annoyed with him. I have great patients but after 5 months I've lost all interest in the 2 subjects. I've gotten to were I just go along with it and I'd enjoy talking about other things. I hope I'm not sounding selfish but I need help or some insight. I asked my girlfriend about it and she sayed that's how he is and she has learned to deal with it. She said oh so your getting annoyed with him? I said no I just want to know how I'd go about talking about different things. She just cut me low with that statement because his father ignored him all his life and I don't want to be put in that catagory.

autism,TheShyPig,2018/02/09,"My son has been diagnosed with ASD aged 14. Help asked from other UK based parents So he has been through various assessments in school, we have had home visits, assessments in the local centre, we did a day of interviews with us in different rooms....and on Tuesday I get the FULL report but the person I talked to on the phone said he has been diagnosed with ASD, no idea of severity. So..The council are debriefing me on tuesday.

What should I expect, any idea ? Should I have a game plan?

Has anyone else done this with a functioning ASD child ( was called Aspergers)?

Does anyone know what should happen now and what should I expect?

What help should I expect from the school and does the fact that it is an academy impact?

autism,meatieboxes,2018/02/09,"What should I do when someone has an ""autism breakdown""? I don't know if that's the proper term but that's what my bf calls it. He's high functioning but has said that a breakdown (for him at this point in his life--late 20s) is rare but inevitable at some point. When things get to high stress he says he ""shuts down"" to avoid a full breakdown of crying, stuttering, etc. I'm starting to learn he ""shuts down"" if he thinks I'm upset but it's been difficult. I'm trying to understand. I've never had experience with a breakdown and don't know what to do if one were to happen. Obviously everyone with autism is different and so is there experience but I was just wondering if anyone had some advice or anything.

autism,jesh_wa415,2018/02/09,"My friend, who is on the Autism Spectrum, just stopped being able to answer questions. Any help? My friend is first off, a fun loving guy. He loves pokemon and playing games, he gets along with people well enough, even though he has a hard time with certain cues, he is generally loved everyone. He is always asking others how they are and gets people food. I am saying all this to just give a little context into how he is.


He got into an accident last month, where he hit a pole that he didnt see. It was a bad one because his car was totaled. This definitely shook him up a bit, but he was ok. He has been in the process of getting a new vehicle, but about 4 days ago, he just kind of... I know this sounds messed up but all I can think of is ""malfunction"" He would just stare when you ask him a question. Apparently, at night, he would just stand and mess with his hair for hours. He takes a long time to answer questions, and when he does, he mumbles and it is really hard to understand. If you don't ask him a direct question, you wont get an answer. He doesnt joke around or anything anymore. 

His roomate was nervous about how he was acting so he called his nurse friend to do a ""check"" to see if it was a stroke or something. According to him, there were no signs of a stroke, it was all mental.

I am not the best at explaining these things... I just am worried for him, and I want to know if there is anything we can do to help him.

autism,skittles_rainbows,2018/02/10,"Soft Chewy I thought I could ask you folks if you had any suggestions.  I teach a self-contained autism class.  I try my best to meet the sensory needs of all of my students on a limited budget.  One of my new kids likes to chew on things.  He brings [something like one of these](https://www.amazon.com/Stretchy-Climber-Scorpions-Alligator-Birthday/dp/B075M8VJBV/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518298348&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=stretchy+alligator) but bigger.  Which is fine, except when he doesn't bring it or when he drops it and we pick it up and its covered in hair and other unknown bits.  I don't even know its non-toxic and he's been taking pieces off of it.  I understand the importance of it.  I tried traditional chewies and he threw them at me.  I kind of expected that.  I then gave him [some of these.](https://funandfunction.com/spaghetti-chewy-fidget.html)  He liked them for about 3 minutes, then he took them out of his mouth and threw them at me.  So that was a no go.  Edited to say, he's noverbal and doesn't really understand picture communication or functional sign or I'd try that.
  
I was just wondering what I can get him so I can have something available in the class in case he forgets his.  We managed to get through the day he forgot his, but he was obviously anxious all day (I even called home to see if they could bring it but got no answer).  I really don't care the cost.  I just want him to be happy and comfortable in the classroom.",3.81892442257756,6.506539188191887,3.8690938909389097,85.2001749350827,75.93726937269372,7.262047287139537,26.27319939866065,8.285830014693849,1.8011261719283862,1164,44,222,22,27,357,159,271,0.056,0.8390000000000001,0.104,0.9032,0,0,2,0,0,0,69.0,2,2,5,2,9,9,0,0,9,0,16,3,2,1,3,42,39,22,0,7,11,0,2,3,0,0,0,1,1,1,15,11,1,2,6,0,2,7,6,0,0,2,12,4,35,9,30,24,6,27,0,0,1,0,33,12,0,7,10,140,50,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4431295728642144,0.0,0.0927067901263392,0.0,0.0,0.1540102995086403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274470057754692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430663981284273,0.0,0.1488333827289235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392047418022298,0.0,0.1389940953042028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21769145828417444,0.0,0.0,0.17583880972129315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18008492015401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14245008558402414,0.0,0.07747757123307464,0.0,0.1090328677854904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451222433992248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1367467354426306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14196321718413038,0.074921556164393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19980693072506184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010844762659066,0.0,0.13166511854013874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18475691902305186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17466867301752004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10841241598001064,0.0,0.0,0.10863468191196636,0.0,0.14221841738836444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20990181577425832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10250066731613117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056936209138583,0.0,0.0,0.10822812442770964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514639132891906,0.2776705197925353,0.0,0.0,0.28384168037969104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08040898444861196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478404259130751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,YourDadsNewGF,2018/02/10,"13 year old austistic getting violent Hi all,
I have posted on here before as our needs have changed, but here is our most recent challenge. Our 13.5 son (my stepson) has been ""cheeking"" his medicine, because he doesn't like that it makes him sleepy (which honestly, I get.) The medicine he's been cheeking specifically is an anti-psychotic. And yes, we worry that he's on an anti-psychotic at 13. However, he was cheeking it and spitting it out for several days, and then attacked his mother. He got frustrated with something fairly innocuous (She told him it was time for bed) and he hit her in the head with a frying pan. He then chased her into her room (she locked the door) and was trying to bust down the door until he sort of ""came to"" (realized what he was doing) and stopped. He was and is very regretful and sorrowful for what he did, but frankly I'm a little scared. I have a four year old and a nine year old, and I myself am not much bigger than him. I don't want to treat him like a rabid animal, but I'm realizing that if my kids trigger his frustration (as frankly, they sometimes do) that he could kill them. I know that sounds dramatic, but a frying pan to the head could kill someone, and they aren't really big enough to fight back. What do I do? I love him, and don't want to treat him like some sort of rabid animal, but also...he has proven that he can be violent under the wrong circumstances.

autism,callrocks,2018/02/11,"Needed advice on life as a 24 year old male on the autism spectrum Hi r/autism long time viewer first contributor 
I currently live in small cottage with my 52 year old father and 50 year old mother 

I am high functioning in terms of the spectrum and have graduated university with a 2:1 in Radio production and Digital Photography I currently work as a freelancer for the BBC and for myself as a photographer 

I am really struggling to figure out how to be an adult on the spectrum since I graduated and moved back home I have lost all confidence in myself and my ability to cope as I used to be able to problem solve a lot of my issues and figure out how deal with life problems 

Since moving back home I now regularly find my self fighting with my self and especially my father and feel even more disconnected with him which results in large scale falling outs over small issues which affects my mum 

I want to move out but at the moment don’t make the money to do this and I want I try and save the situation before I do something to myself or before I make my parents divorce each 

Please help

autism,flozza89,2018/02/11,Undiagnosed but been mistaken for autistic many times I know there's something not quite right about me socially. But I haven't always been this way. When I was young I didnt talk properly until I was about 5. My social life was fine from then on. Until I turned about 20 I became mute for a while and never really got back to my normal self. I can't really think of any signs I had between 5-20. I was told yesterday by a random girl I miss social cues and my mum says I lack imagination and I guess I lack social skills a lot in general. I avoid a lot of social occasions too. Im sensitive and I worry about not being liked etc. It could just be social anxiety or something and I'm not overly convinced I have autism. But if I've been told I seem to on about 5 different occasions I start thinking maybe I have. I am going to ask to be assessed soon but just wondering what you guys think?,1.407377002288328,3.6088532445652177,3.514016018306638,87.11748283752866,81.77173913043478,7.134553775743708,20.55377574370709,8.20500826718156,1.1367543478260873,703,20,146,15,19,239,112,184,0.153,0.8340000000000001,0.013,-0.9699,1,1,2,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,0,2,12,5,0,1,4,0,18,1,0,0,1,35,34,16,0,5,11,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,3,3,5,0,1,7,0,0,1,7,2,0,0,12,1,26,3,22,18,5,19,0,1,0,0,16,5,0,8,13,102,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500338176268383,0.0,0.0,0.07764343451627909,0.0,0.08734414665752221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10673892639080884,0.0,0.0,0.08779411457552612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091160056685203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11928937191177467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12733615743788254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488871764751633,0.0,0.09131678832249447,0.0,0.12577747591832233,0.11305195667311822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233294173704602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274801373211432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064571842423666,0.05578051086480381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19413630253384706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575630371732963,0.1147049008233229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805938761734056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11186800653893612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143997878384233,0.0,0.0,0.14628783562670322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09750547828685616,0.0,0.09079714991128833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10394132705908693,0.11911022226585595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6983268751140298,0.0,0.17579616191766273,0.0,0.0,0.08081419315061923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177015389777987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21947765733985608,0.0,0.0,0.06657680594477593,0.0,0.0,0.21819967007010824,0.0,0.0,0.12419044442415515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09062740671827817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12381874523535435,0.0,0.11595103018093235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,MomCrusader,2018/02/11,"10 year old charged with assault after meltdown at school My son had a meltdown at school when he was restrained for kicking something.  The school immediately called the police, rather than follow is BIP to try and deescalate the situation and the Dean opted to have assault charges pressed. They restrained him unlawfully for quite a long time before I got there. 


I have started a Facebook group to bring awareness and to advocate for my son. I am simply horrified that this is happening to him and certainly we should all be aware of how children are being criminalized at school for symptoms of his disability.

autism,gomezhouse,2018/02/11,"After 34 years of feeling different, i got diagnosed with autism Hey guys,

Im a 34 year old male. I got diagnosed with high functioning autism this year. All my life i have been feeling different. I have always trying to find an answer to why i feel different. But i never touched upon the subject of Autism. I always thought artists are weirdos. apparently not. Thats me. But on the high function scale.

My biggest problems in life so far is the social aspects. Feeling emotions and caring for other people. I always felt that i care more for hobbies such as making music, more than i care for people. I feel music more than anything else in my life. I also care more for animals than people. I express myself better at writing or through music than words.

Biggest issue with my autism so far? no relationships so far. No girlfriends. Even if i constantly get shown interest by girls i push them away. Because even when i date, the girls find my interesting, but i do not. I feel socialising is draining and the dating part is especially draining. 

I feel most comfortable being at home, listening to music, doing music, working on some projects. It gets lonely pretty often. Maybe i should start dating more? I haven’t really dated for 3 years now. used to date quite a lot. Girls show interest. But not me.

Any inputs?",2.769986338797814,5.6953689221311485,3.87954098360656,81.73458469945356,83.13934426229507,6.204153005464481,25.346448087431693,7.554174236665415,1.8130080874316936,1043,42,174,18,30,337,140,244,0.042,0.826,0.132,0.9615,4,2,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,1,3,11,11,0,0,8,0,12,5,0,2,2,38,33,14,0,3,9,0,9,0,1,1,5,1,1,5,5,5,0,0,12,2,0,1,7,2,0,0,5,10,30,9,30,26,10,32,0,1,0,0,13,15,0,6,16,119,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07822433761906117,0.2441751083885396,0.0,0.0,0.06651901468107395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08049517793806793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09190243014164498,0.0,0.0,0.059628425289088925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865113180522301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3989244047182698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10570558640930892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19856469161860588,0.0,0.3065942998631161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08171367522232875,0.11003112525521387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292146069477732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3462150224258551,0.0,0.09391980150162224,0.0,0.17880620165289252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10221084476520767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15646661745183274,0.0,0.0,0.09685435494338658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20669837400957286,0.09811857459524873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10565930494681944,0.10209568843254596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072734325026341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316064094041864,0.0,0.0,0.06529370560538429,0.0,0.09827047231222097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544261448784985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10264264182197692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10592643867145,0.0,0.2034422815166877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951520503869718,0.0,0.09359779978722248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10404057705481884,0.0,0.0,0.06266416952276224,0.0,0.0,0.1050190095086518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997122636045492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06923548055435512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07765588893651623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06641142235432088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08448260910894065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882647612517086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712120484709836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25196414404931033

autism,OneNationAbove,2018/02/11,"Is it possible to escape from a seemingly endles vicious circle after decades? Since I was twelve I started to change, I used to be an extravert with Aspergers, (it's possible), but as I grew up I became more and more introvert, and when I reached about 22 my situation got a lot worse, to the point of severe social anxiety.

Now at 35 I feel like at an absolute depth, my social anxiety is worse than ever before and I feel I'll never escape this endless flood of negativity.

I was wondering if anyone was able to climb back out of that pit themselves, or know people who were able to get themselves back on track and managed to stay there?

And how.

I think cognitive therapy and mindfulness can perhaps get me a long way, but at this point everything feels hopeless.",7.341506849315068,7.1042029794520545,7.853527397260276,71.26193493150687,63.72602739726028,11.409589041095893,36.05821917808219,10.9516,4.055235616438357,609,26,108,15,8,202,99,146,0.172,0.775,0.054000000000000006,-0.9643,0,0,0,0,0,1,16.0,0,0,0,1,8,3,1,0,6,0,8,0,0,2,2,25,20,13,0,1,4,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,0,7,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,5,3,13,1,22,14,3,22,0,1,0,0,3,9,0,5,10,77,19,1,0.287844164839765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22019999823829475,0.0,0.0,0.10063366638307657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22133439520184006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224670917770686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15225047981312936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13018576324350298,0.0,0.0,0.12934788752954393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2183139877386461,0.10281796443775587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15038669579899458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11510763684362067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909581261034693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031305968516874,0.0,0.0,0.12736651397778276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12235740777101227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14532027567026148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100158247715704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09977745046977636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27210577522986623,0.3245010464763341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13102125849967206,0.0,0.16259098734241448,0.0,0.11905383382748952,0.1617744507388178,0.0,0.2934208769837092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186879069968573,0.1534017904171975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16458744418099153,0.0,0.0,0.09221945909567754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12430246971891183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11423865000338533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15607735907936082,0.0,0.0,0.2933377951866947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,bumpinbumpinbumpin,2018/02/11,"My brother (15) has extreme trouble sleeping He’s incredibly hyperactive and I can tell he wants to sleep. He lies in bed, tosses and turns, and before you know it he’s up and at em again. We try to help him get into bed in a timely matter but sometimes he will stay awake until the wee hours of the morning (2/3 am). 

I have tried giving him melatonin for sleep, but he ends up waking up after just three or four hours of sleep, so he’s still up pretty early while the rest of us are asleep. 

We try to lock up all the electronics before bed so he doesn’t get to them and use them while we’re unable to monitor him, but sometimes we have our days where it’s not possible due to the issues stated above.

Has anyone had issues with handling a situation like this, whether it’s with themselves or a family member? I really want him to get the adequate sleep he needs.  And yes, he does have autism.

autism,Bitl,2018/02/11,"Help with getting obsessions over people. Hello,

For a long while, I started becoming very obsessed with my best friends (checking everything they do, making sure that they are ok, worrying about them, copying what they do and like, etc) and it's getting really troubling. A couple of years ago I was obsessed with a friend I knew in real life. There were various times in which I was very worried about him, checking if he is ok, and times where I lashed out at him and doubted about our friendship. I've also have gotten obsessed with people online as well, to the point where I almost have gotten blocked or removed because of the same stuff. I'm sick of acting like this and I'm not sure how to fix it all because I've never experienced those types of social situations before It's really hurting me and I don't want to lose all of my friends because of this. It's unhealthy.",6.556745562130178,6.837673816568053,6.571414201183432,78.04954733727811,65.27218934911242,8.8901775147929,34.059763313609466,8.548686976883017,2.76878650887574,701,29,126,9,10,223,105,169,0.163,0.643,0.195,0.7988,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,4,2,9,19,0,5,5,2,10,2,0,2,5,28,20,12,0,2,3,0,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,0,11,11,0,1,1,0,2,2,3,8,1,0,6,1,17,11,23,14,6,18,0,2,0,0,14,8,0,4,10,89,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12810463748449138,0.0,0.1447118118164277,0.0,0.0,0.11556932359547235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2642866780649081,0.15960647212056156,0.12297239805622195,0.0,0.15166053500842566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15990410924907794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16117344430453606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12988158436855174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3349579082158781,0.0,0.15100719997350934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09686597037134947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15470727405871668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10207586335553352,0.1412063508439496,0.0,0.0,0.12789203555531808,0.0,0.16167634116203888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09646549426348124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145958140411588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2003782759623232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13661424967074084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644907478121576,0.18516118910933302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16244194144655594,0.0,0.1473157742168363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228910720139553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16543614551560448,0.0,0.0,0.2724090758817359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685367823377077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23848152668615616,0.0852392298994878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12993716165453678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29352584970276985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09306350997785684

autism,knobodyknows,2018/02/12,"long term denial I was always a mute and could never read people, nor know what to talk about, I just know I had a few specific interests in life and no one cared at all. That and sensitivity to crowds and clothing.

My relative taught autistic people, but somehow no one ever decided to tell me, or help me with it. Family adamantly denied any mental problems, to which I was forced to hide my long term depression and anxiety as well.

I even went to inpatient therapy for anxiety and they said 'autism is a kids disorder, we dont test or diagnose you', at a highly esteemed clinic, they said this.

I got motivated by someone to travel and 'break out of my shell', to which I never actually did, and didnt even know what that ment, until maybe 7 years later, today. I still never did, but care less about what people say. I spent some time in Vietnam, and they are very perceptive to others reactions, and multiple times people have asked if I was autistic, to which I just blame social anxiety. Maybe there's a correlation.

Only now, in reading more and more, do all the signs finally make sense. I can remember for the longest time, though, especially around family or relatives, I'd just tune out after a while, and stand like a zombie, unengaged in conversations.

But even in exploring the world, I still am so limited in social interactions, what to say and ask, it seems I can only communicate best via text. So unfulfilling to have very minimal social interaction and no one I can trust anymore. 

I wonder if others have had this sudden shift, where they realize those people in their life they thought were friends, were not, and actually putting me at the end of a lot of criticism and bad jokes.

autism,jeccap,2018/02/12,"Hoping those of you on the spectrum can help me out understanding my son. He will be 15 in May. We have his autism and teenage attitude at the same time. I have a hard time figuring out if his arguing with me is his black and white thinking or if he’s being defiant. 
Mostly it’s when speaking about things that affect how we do things in the house. 
Due to he and his sister always asking for things that we don’t always have money for, I have decided that I will be taking a small part of their allowance and putting it away to save for whatever they want to get later down the road. 
My son interrupted to tell me he could save money just fine. 
Then when I was telling them that they needed to make sure their chore list was completed and if I make them redo something they needed to do it without arguing with me. 
Of course he had to tell me that was impossible to complete any list to my standards. When I told him he just needed to not argue when I told him to redo something, he got angry and told me that he does do the things on the list. 
Basically his thinking is, he did do it and going over it again is me making him do it twice. 

It ended up with me raising my voice and him shutting down and going to his room. 

I want to be able to speak to him without him shutting down. But I feel like I don’t know how. 
Since many of you here are on the spectrum I feel like you might be able to tell me a good way to get through to him that won’t cause any kind of meltdowns.

autism,Nuka-Nuke,2018/02/13,Is it norml to be able predict what most people will do I can normally tell if I'll get caught doing something and have only been caught taking food once. Ive noticed patterns in my friendship group and can tell when they'll get sick of each other or when one of them gets overly offended. Is this normal because people always get caught doing things and can't tell they are stuck in a loop . 13 Y/O and Autistic ,5.596506024096385,5.794550578313255,5.669542168674699,83.9811807228916,67.31325301204821,7.60385542168675,27.443373493975905,6.742157984588678,1.2517248192771089,330,9,64,2,5,104,63,83,0.08900000000000001,0.8759999999999999,0.035,-0.5267,0,0,1,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,3,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,15,2,0,0,0,10,24,8,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,5,5,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,1,5,0,6,0,6,16,2,8,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,3,2,42,11,0,0.19764666935810896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16445786205051313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048357515064273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389951371243154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41304890869667105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38730354321918653,0.0,0.22502204305751125,0.0,0.2104872523769093,0.13393049829306206,0.15031919834686436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2740466289927808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15215806221447872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486056979258028,0.0,0.5182557019457298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13130766478597347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,bubbletrollbutt,2018/02/13,"How to deal with stuff the triggers my son... For a lack of a better word lately my son been triggered by certain things and been getting worse. It happened most of his life but it is worse now. 

He is 8 and talks but is it almost alway songs he likes. I know he gets upset because communication is hard for him. He listens to what you say but it is hard to see what he retains. Lately it been the American Dad theme that sets him off. He loved it before. But now it makes him run around and scream. But he keeps playing it. I don’t know if it something we don’t know but he sees/hears that’s off.  

We limited his ways to seeing it but YouTube don’t let you block certain videos. Only on YouTube kids. I hate blocking stuff but sometimes it works. I hate to see him so upset. 

What i am Wonder is the mini meltdowns might be frustration from something he can’t express? I know with him he can tell if the smallest thing is off. We can’t fix it, if we don’t know it.  I wonder if there are services that might help his communication that I don’t know of.  Like what should we try and work on? I would love for him to tell me anything and everything.

Oh I made a post about a year ago.  His little brother is almost a year next week. They get along pretty well. His little brother wants to be just like him. He adores his older brother and they kinda play together. His older brother still likes to be by himself but is ok to have his brother butt in lol.

Let me clarify that my 4yo (in april) daughter has NOT been diagnosed with anything at this point, but I have a number of ongoing concerns. She has seen a series of neurologists, physio/occupational therapists, speech pathologists, and others since about 1.5 years, with no specific diagnosis. When asked about autism specifically we were told that it is difficult to give a diagnosis until they are a little bit older. But I have an autistic nephew, and I see some common things in her that I believe it to be highly likely she is on the spectrum.

With that said. In addition to other issues, our daughter has been a ""picky"" eater since day one. I believe that some sensory issues could be playing a part in this. She cannot communicate well with us about what she likes/doesn't like. (besides toast). She has had ongoing constipation issues, and within the past 5 days or so she is really starting to get extra resistant to food of any sort, and also lethargic. We are very close to the point of taking her to the hospital just to get nutrients in her.  Naturally, we are very eager to see her eat, and have probably pushing her too hard, and making the trouble worse.

I am seeking advice from parents of autistic preschoolers, how can   we approach meal-time differently in a way that she can get the nutrition she needs without pushing her away from the idea altogether.

autism,-_-____-_--____--_-_,2018/02/13,"Help with bullying Hey guys, I usually stay quiet on this sub. Reading comments and laughing along to the latest trend in the subreddit; I enjoy watching and experiencing this sub blossom into the beautiful creation it has become. The people, the atmosphere, all my fellow spectrummers ;), all fill me with unflinching joy. And you should always cherish that. I’ve been keeping this thought and opinion for a long time, however it pains me to say this is not the case in my personal life anymore....
for the record I don’t normally speak my mind to the public (my doctor diagnosed me with social anxiety as a little kid which haunts me to this day, I also got diagnosed with High Functioning Autism Disorder by webmd) and I tend to do my dealings in a private matter, but this has to change. It is long overdue that I need to tell you all this because deep down I've been feeling horrible. I could have wrote this anywhere but nothing seems more appropriate than here and my apologies and i feel like my torture and bullying ends now.
I have been disrespected for having autism. This is my alternate account, as I have been having people come up to me with nothing but hate speech to give to me. Just the worst words ever!
 The Reddit CEO said we are a community that needs to help each other out but I feel betrayed and I don’t know how I can trust this site I once considered family. I don't know if I can do this at school either. I am getting bullied for my autism and gendered stuff. The kid (Male) with autism has never been bullied to the extent I had, so I know this is something people have preconcieved notions about. I don't know what to do anymore. My mom talked to the principal and he said that he was sorry. The man is just a horrible principal. I need serious helping please. 

p.s. A boy in my class tried to pull my pants down twice. He didn't get in trouble.

He is nonverbal and also has eplipsey, that does keep me up at night.

autism,bocake,2018/02/13,"Hello Parents of Autistic Children I'm sorry if this is not allowed, but I am receiving a grant to open a learning and resource center for children on the spectrum. Part of the stipulation is that I have to perform market research, so I am looking for parents to take this short survey about their experience with childcare for their autistic child. It only takes about five minutes and would greatly help me improve my center! Admin please delete if this is not allowed.

autism,MaterialWishbone,2018/02/13,"Possibly Autistic with no way to diagnose. One thing that's been gnawing on me for a year or two (possibly more) is that every so often, I find myself wondering whether or not I may be on the spectrum somewhere.

I have done a couple of those online tests and they tend to state it is fairly likely. Not to mention as a kid, a child councelor guessed it might be possible I have aspergers. Then years later, I had to talk to someone and it turns out they figured it might be autism instead. I've looked at sites explaining some symptoms of autism and I do fit a number of the symptoms and mannerisms. I figure at this point, it wouldn't be a bad idea to see someone about a diagnosis.

And I'm aware kind of that how I act or think isn't really normal. I am aware my brain definitely functions more strangely than others. I don't really know what's up and it's been bugging me for a while. It's actually kind of frustrating a little bit how I can tell something's up but never knowing for sure.

My problem is, I have no way to get help from a doctor. I don't have the money or the means to visit one. I saddly just don't have any chance really get help. I don't think I would have a chance.

I'm not asking someone to diagnose me, I'm just hoping to find out if there is a way I could get possibly find out whether or not I might be on the spectrum in at least some other way?",3.149069264069265,4.209777639860143,4.657092907092906,85.93054778554782,73.3006993006993,7.825241425241426,26.556110556110553,8.269060116576782,1.6004963702963702,1079,37,230,17,21,362,143,286,0.07,0.863,0.067,0.0049,0,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,2,0,9,8,1,0,17,0,34,6,1,2,2,56,54,21,0,7,15,0,0,1,0,6,5,0,0,2,16,10,0,0,13,0,1,2,13,3,0,3,4,2,26,5,35,38,6,29,0,0,2,0,12,16,0,16,7,168,42,2,0.0,0.0,0.09327961239345314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500277857099537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08936141014772858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07981157071107241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10435679423606478,0.0,0.0,0.10670726389237986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07631884158840546,0.10576575184415707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19403860299474046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09783785774688794,0.0,0.09781920087864286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08053659231689325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620957328266923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14982157226054485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530040907223412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12814057415474078,0.0,0.0,0.09493995659342133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10790665377121453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19907934595233834,0.10506478153135346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046699224717598284,0.0958037878219524,0.0,0.0,0.08026942658175129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412281111471358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3042096992421115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372297361713563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09365545591243137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295451291145787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036108513349296,0.4310421807370325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09146432916169216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1837074025533807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617086260705068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24297293842141784,0.07358792831587578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900900885383906,0.198704026849834,0.0,0.07682961257970675,0.08354768913552242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06350408833397855,0.1224972220787258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397175253555148,0.0933750991501971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30349163650851285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036605674338727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679026182294276,0.0,0.0,0.1231104334752548

So I'm a 20yo male with aspergers, and would really like to date and have a partner, ever since I was 13 really. I've had very little experience (almost none I'd say,) and have know idea what I'm doing when it comes to this, all I know is it's getting me no-where.


So with that said any dating advice would be great, general and for those with ASD. I don't want these posts to be just about me so advice for girls or older people is cool, I'd be happy if anyone gets something from this.",2.4619685039370083,3.768461535433069,4.136228346456694,88.02796456692914,75.37795275590551,7.2847244094488195,19.786614173228344,7.908726449838941,0.5820620472440945,473,9,103,7,10,159,81,127,0.01,0.882,0.108,0.9131,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,2,1,14,1,1,0,2,23,23,12,0,4,3,0,0,1,1,2,0,2,0,3,10,10,0,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,3,5,4,14,14,2,12,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,3,8,62,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.510805049816474,0.0,0.0,0.1744793047473691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849128947560225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12183483348027635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500950102503243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15761286810218236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17044319567167993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18206966613511685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19210364329886415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18548503004507355,0.0,0.0,0.1788236994321556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966992616228525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19151891220350767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512638191697541,0.1746373709744068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12079823283787308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3337534672144697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22324919532467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16574509835582033,0.13856511423953569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14413570071416926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13414085840135162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14376881350941698,0.10277310043585168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24755461134593795,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,RedditNewbieMom,2018/02/14,"My son hates school. Help! My 13 year old son (HFA/ADHD/Bipolar/Anger issues) hates going to school. He fights getting up to go, he fights getting out of the car to go in, and once there he has been refusing to do his English and Social Studies work. He gets angry and will yell or leave the classroom if he's pushed to do something he doesn't like. He even has a full-time aide and that hasn't helped with this. 

He's intelligent but has no desire to physically write or type anything unless  it's something HE wants to write about. Since he's willing to type about things he likes, it doesn't seem to be a physical problem.

Any tips to get through or over this? We can't force him to do it. He's smart enough to know that.  I have run out of ideas and am at my wit's end.

autism,Whale_Tune,2018/02/14,"Can I say I have marked impairment in nonverbal cues? Problems with ""not autistic enough"". (Professionally diagnosed.) So, I'm a girl with an ASD diagnosis, but I'm considered ""very high-functioning.""

Still, I spent most of my life with no friends and struggle with severe social anxiety and isolation. I always assumed I never had problems with nonverbal cues, usually I'm average amounts of expressive and can make eye contact, but lately, I've been questioning this:

1.) I oftentimes offend people with my jokes, and my mother says that I don't use ""joke cues"" when I tell them. She gives examples of ""joke cues"", but it sounds the same to me as when I tell them. I am at a loss for how to refine my ability to convey that I am not serious, and if I don't offend people, they often just find me strange. I still don't know what ""joke cues"" are or how to recognize them.

2.) I have a hard time understanding sarcasm. I can get it a lot, but a lot of the time, I take people at face value even when they are ""clearly being sarcastic"", and have to ask them if they're being serious. Sometimes, people are clearly not serious/joking and I am the only person in the situation who takes them completely literally. Especially in high school, I didn't understand the conversations I was in because people would be joking and I'd look like an idiot taking them seriously, (even if what they were saying was very improbable.)

3.) Going into that, I have in the past had serious problems understanding people nonverbally telling me off. I had a friend who jokingly said he wished people would tell him he was fat so he'd lose weight. (He is quite overweight.) The other guys told him he wasn't fat. I was like, ""You're really fat"", thinking I was saying the right thing, and in retrospect, the other guys were nonverbally hinting to me to back off, but I didn't get it. This has happened multiple times.

4.) I was in social studies as a sophomore and contributed something about the holocaust. I see on TV people smiling at sad things, (like if they tell someone that someone they loved has died), so I thought I was ""smiling sympathetically"" while talking. Nope. The teacher got concerned and emailed my mom. I still don't get the difference between ""sad smile"" and ""happy smile"".

5.) I hate hate hate seeing people I know on campus. Anyone but my best friend or my brother, I try to avoid making eye contact. I am usually okay with eye contact, but not when it might *initiate* a social situation casually, because I hate small talk. 

6.) Going into that, recently I learned that if you see someone and say hi to them once, then see them again a few minutes later, you need to say hi to them again, maybe kind of joking. I thought if I said hi once, it would be redundant to do it again, so I'd just not say anything and walk by the person. I had no idea that this might offend them.

The thing is, in 95% of individual situations nowadays, I might seem quiet, and a little awkward if multiple people are in the conversation, (I'm bad with pacing), but I can seem ""normal"". I have even had a counselor tell me that I am not autistic because she didn't see any traits in me. With adults, in a one on one situation, in a quiet room, with a set topic, I indeed seem ""normal"". It is with kids my age and in more complex situations that my problems, (also with sensory issues, stimming, and situational cues), come out. 

I have been thinking of starting a club on campus for kids on the spectrum, but I'm wary because I don't want people to think that I am ""not autistic enough."" I wear makeup, dress fashionably, and try very hard to look ""normal"". I learn things late, like how to compliment fashion, be self-deprecating in the light way people like, and be reciprocal. I still have almost no friends and struggle to form relationships. 

It's frustrating to me that either I am ""not autistic enough"", or ""too weird."" If I am going to be ""not autistic enough"", I'd like to have made more than one friend in my entire life. If I'm going to be ""too weird"", I'd like a community to discuss my problems with.

So to start a club for autistic kids, I'd like to be part of that community, but I'm afraid of being told that I am ""not autistic enough"", especially since in terms of fashion and superficial presentation I am in no way ""alternative"". Yet I am ""autistic enough"" that I can't seem to connect with neurotypical kids, a bit of a catch-22 if you ask me.",5.8748838896952105,6.2925777075471725,6.786273584905661,75.45415457184328,66.73584905660377,9.777793904208998,32.463352685050786,9.709735096191762,3.0150187953555876,3448,137,650,69,52,1151,322,848,0.121,0.75,0.129,0.9009,0,2,1,0,0,0,176.0,0,3,15,4,31,57,9,5,38,1,76,14,8,7,3,130,139,61,2,24,36,3,3,8,5,6,7,12,1,10,35,39,5,1,21,11,1,6,26,30,0,3,29,26,97,27,88,93,20,75,0,4,10,1,86,35,0,27,39,445,132,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04358266664692104,0.0,0.0,0.03480586167534831,0.03621517848883124,0.0,0.0,0.029597586815561083,0.0,0.033295486986540924,0.0,0.0,0.03043276072908632,0.0,0.035816270410479537,0.0,0.08137750886816766,0.0,0.0,0.033467014232860075,0.03634044490001692,0.10612649646905524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045675404500847866,0.0,0.04751657306190557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037491786241225934,0.04563373795721911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044175606981434586,0.0451706960133294,0.04547296965066952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2698295027013995,0.0,0.08624091694634163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03977984416903847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16813139014343378,0.0,0.06821796066736092,0.041751868385656137,0.09894201439634273,0.0,0.03480985336276659,0.0,0.0,0.08619054845133403,0.038487835984318194,0.04633175403898706,0.07797731544170983,0.17188244616461804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09197028997972034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049132923594673784,0.0,0.04542740171911348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04532320275027918,0.04783893951911377,0.0,0.09819318680637028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0614841078897453,0.17010772624605924,0.04362214953969789,0.0,0.0,0.07309783901910857,0.048691851709364915,0.0,0.07400453243851343,0.0392818097607811,0.041183147138681736,0.058104772881276474,0.0,0.043725374610738194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13851520167895873,0.0,0.05097439407987266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03227224842871212,0.033568136007467865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12793186143996674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927025721897332,0.08847829176980747,0.033101710861093696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047131891229493336,0.041548266031555536,0.3620859760485416,0.07600637644221232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082313619819764,0.0,0.0,0.048756469160020494,0.046292778485746464,0.0,0.0,0.027882376288455392,0.0,0.042974371539551984,0.0467281312887657,0.0,0.037168974769952436,0.08280195041425711,0.24228237463902966,0.0,0.044048275760818316,0.17341364233884587,0.1584892513074464,0.04540467801427951,0.049169356462299335,0.0,0.036003228034645965,0.2935345592600851,0.0,0.13310069576773725,0.11063238828945604,0.03350664609709879,0.04304602067349875,0.0,0.06161255262873454,0.0,0.13903223034756984,0.0,0.0,0.0910007758526641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817314552928963,0.06996535158416918,0.22824962595043746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566076459670994,0.08366462737851163,0.0,0.06910586170158828,0.07613700267625803,0.0,0.0,0.08317746011960304,0.0,0.05909942737730195,0.0,0.0,0.13592902038993912,0.0,0.03759047498667206,0.09587034292559143,0.10773475311258238,0.02567138711981712,0.06909412379615966,0.0,0.053000102432480885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05005007038588311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09275389524407872,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,ajgliebe,2018/02/14,"Question for autistic members about intensity of emotion The context: watching the second harry potter movie with his older brother, my five-year-old diagnosed ASD, would become uncontrollably distraught with every trial that Harry Faced.  To the point where I asked him if he wanted to play with me in his room to get him away from the situation, which worked. We talked about Harry Potter and the bad things that were happening to him because he had many questions and wanted to understand. Without the movie playing he was fine.

Question to you is this: is that a normal reaction? Does he have difficulty controlling the intensity of emotion?  As in, if he feels a little bit sad… He feels intensely sad.  Or, is he just five?

I’m just looking for insights on what he needs in those situations. And what, if any, tools he needs to cope.",6.238735701384709,8.01641809933775,6.2523780854906725,74.6859241420831,66.68211920529801,8.66971703792896,32.27031908488862,9.095868883498916,3.0025178807947017,667,28,109,12,11,211,97,151,0.11,0.863,0.026,-0.9235,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,1,0,2,5,7,0,2,9,0,8,2,1,1,0,28,20,8,0,9,7,1,2,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,9,7,0,1,7,2,0,0,1,4,0,2,3,4,10,3,24,16,1,10,0,1,2,0,22,9,0,7,1,72,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09942282812426848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13667975919454353,0.0,0.13736221981013627,0.0,0.12207312135846972,0.08912378975037094,0.16146936086477068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596154479088915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16397872465583918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14839263104690878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12794294049968838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3289166475787121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12318205393160855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14784892424571322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763848600302468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12928653696632006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14653348271678354,0.0,0.0,0.12277341950782462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14822655850412814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21681485242064413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143247573423523,0.0,0.0,0.1534151067182119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820877866839926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4913413465209584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32867585022736484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11751216693027207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971305565456974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15220213408551508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17246824379501385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409341552379252,0.0,0.1064372839774206,0.0,0.0,0.10385818098589047,0.0,0.0,0.0941497251101817
autism,AdministrativeMoment,2018/02/14,"Traveling by train is difficult, advice? Goodmorning, i wanted to go to a new business meeting in a different town. I would have to travel by bike, then in a busy train, then by a busy buss and then walk to the meeting. Trip would have been an hour or so.

I was agonizing all day yestoday if i would go, then because of the overthinking i felt to exhausted and stressed to go so i did not go. Because if i am stressed i faint because of sensory overload.

I am now very upset with myself because i wanted to go. The thing is, if it was in my city i would not have that much of a problem. The meeting i can handle, it is the trip to and from another city i find very difficult. 

Any advice besides taking a friend with me? (They could not go today) and i do not have a drivers licence.

autism,Toothache42,2018/02/14,"Has anyone had experience with IPAN? The International pre-Autistic Network, or IPAN, is something I came across recently in my efforts to get my son, 20 months old, a diagnosis. I am an autistic male, 36, who was only diagnosed 3 years ago, so I am still learning what it is to be autistic and what support is out there.

My son is showing a few signs that he could be on the spectrum, probably High-Functioning like myself, with his routine play style, the arm flapping, delayed speech and language, not walking unaided yet, his analytical approach to new toys and objects, and his obvious discomfort whenever we change his clothes, and more subtle things which I can't think of offhand but are the sort of things I recognised in myself - I had suspicions at 25 I could be autistic, didn't get a diagnosis until 8 years later. Because of this I would rather get things in place sooner rather than later, to get my son the support he needs if he is autistic.

I recently sent a message to IPAN but not had a reply yet. Was wondering if people here had experience of them, how good / helpful they were, and if they aren't useful where I should perhaps turn to get the right support in putting things in place for my son pre and post diagnosis. I live in the UK, so I am trying to get things rolling with the NHS but it is slow going.

autism,Momperson,2018/02/14,"Diagnosing my toddler.  Since my son was 11 months, he went from being a sweet and easy child, to having an extremely explosive personality. He was very speech delayed as well. He was delayed enough to qualify for early intervention, and we got an excellent woman who specializes in behavior. His speech has improved dramatically (20ish words by the age of 2) but his behavior is pretty severe still. He will bite us out of the blue, or pretend he is going to kiss us and bite down hard. He will pull hair, he will dig his claws into us. Hes not afraid to kick, headbutt, punch (this can also sometimes be close handed. We don't know where he learned this) grabbing us by the throat, etc. The more worrying issue is his self injurious behaviors. If I tell him no, he will hit his head as hard as he can on the nearest furniture or run into a wall or bang his head on the floor. A few weeks ago, I had to take him to the emergency room because he did this to being told no and ended up leaving a nasty cut on his scalp. My SO and I try to manage this the best we can, but we are still having upwards of 20-30 of these freakouts daily. He also doesn't do well in situations with a ton of bright noise and sound (Chuck e cheese makes him miserable, too many people being loud at once). However, he is extremely friendly, and wants to get in anyone's lap or talk to them and engage them. With our speech therapy likely coming to an end soon, his therapist wants us to see about having him evaluated for mild autism so that he maybe further help. I'm wondering 1) what this will mean in terms of help 2) if he's even on the spectrum, and 3) if he's not, what other resources are available to help him. I'm so worried about him. He's getting older and people are starting to call him a psycho and a bad kid, and it makes me furious. I'm trying to give him all the tools to help, but sometimes I fall short.

autism,whisperswithdoges,2018/02/15,"How should I respond to an Autistic client's inappropriate email? Firstly, I should mention that I don't know much about Autism.
I work for a music company that produces music packages for news stations, custom music, and more. 
A young boy, aged 14, has reached out to us in search of music for his radio show. Obviously, I am happy to help. It's always a great opportunity to help young people with their passions and give them a head start. 
So anyway, I find him on LinkedIn and discover that he is Autistic. No biggie, he's been professional so far, and I want to help him with music for his radio show so we keep up the email conversation. 
Out of the blue he sends an email saying that my email profile picture shows my beauty and he loves it.
Now, it was polite, and it made me smile, but I feel it's inappropriate in a professional setting. I'm not really sure how to respond, as I don't know what would help him understand that it was inappropriate. 
I ultimately don't want to make him upset or back track on anything he's learned so far.

My son speaks predominately about his favorite thing. Every tiny detail about these things. I use it as an opportunity to work on reading and writing, I often just let him talk to me all about them and I talk about them as well. However, I want to help prepare him for life by getting him to be able to talk about non-preferred topics.

What do you do when you're super-locked in (I feel like he's got 3 levels of focus, 3 being ""a bomb going off wouldn't stop him lol). No circumstances would cause me to prohibit thinking about these things or talking about them.

autism,tresslessone,2018/02/15,"How to deal with open plan offices? Hi all,

High functioning ASD here.

I'm a loyal and productive employee in a marketing agency, where I have a senior data science related position.

Being someone with ASD, I am unfortunately quite easily distracted by auditory and visual stimuli. I'm particularly sensitive to noise, but I will also get terribly antsy when people close in on my personal space. In terms of getting stuff done, I heavily rely on bursts of hyperfocus, during which I can move mountains and produce top-shelf work.

Unfortunately, like most modern companies we are sat in an open plan office. And with that comes a whole lot of distraction, a  very small amount of personal space and a motherload of complicated and unnecessary interpersonal dynamics and politics. From the 'tap on the shoulder' (I wish I could electrify myself) to the compulsory birthday celebrations (I don't even like cake) to the constant running into people who are apparently obsessed with how everyone's weekend was. It's a good practice ground, but there are days where I just want to cast the neurotypical humdrum aside and be myself.

So far I've gotten away with a reasonably isolated corner desk, but tomorrow is the big day. It's desk reshuffle day and I'm being moved smack bang in a high traffic aisle. It's your ASD person's worst nightmare: high foot traffic, close to the loudmouths of sales, with my back to the crowd and my screen in a position that has it broadcast practically all over. This is quite simply not going to be good for my productivity and I'm seriously concerned about my ability to keep up with my already high workload. I've already raised this with management, but they're not receptive and brushed off my concerns with a flippant ""we can't design the floor plan around you"".

There's many things this company gets right and overall I do enjoy working here, but I need a plan here. Does anybody have any tips on how to survive an open plan office environment? I've already got my noise cancelling headphones but would love it if anybody has any other tips to help me survive this.",7.449074803149607,8.478389895013128,7.697312992125987,68.15179625984254,63.43569553805775,10.96942257217848,36.87237532808399,10.864195022040775,4.377069028871391,1694,80,275,44,24,552,221,381,0.076,0.815,0.109,0.9309,2,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,2,2,0,12,18,14,0,3,23,0,23,3,2,5,2,57,40,26,0,6,10,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,3,16,32,0,1,1,1,1,5,4,6,0,0,5,2,26,8,46,28,8,52,0,0,1,1,13,36,0,3,13,178,42,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36133991469248017,0.0872849683722569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14844766397041215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09716413960693852,0.0,0.0,0.1025473778673756,0.08392745182050804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09402063959251407,0.0,0.11794933709044465,0.0,0.08714514979042724,0.0,0.0,0.2111727239953884,0.11252596020533548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551544145850012,0.11169547041767837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209068957281732,0.0,0.0,0.10429481740091924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17107470560017032,0.0,0.06203086334872169,0.18309496895978286,0.08729497859160748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07315906070200838,0.461279995130984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970150374413807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10664760754781134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279303775826807,0.09850960032410916,0.0,0.0,0.11065811928427956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23201237914207384,0.0,0.08093125835171742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15133783720218938,0.2859093487928408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23218294341806944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11222148971131868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09321110385042768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924800598518322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12494741926068816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07251254310193607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005786253033056,0.06437784054092886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12185893971254595,0.12551388186878787,0.0,0.0,0.15892090844624346,0.0,0.0,0.07753503215730997,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,rorylfc,2018/02/15,"Strange encounter I had recently I was at a coffee shop yesterday, I had just ordered my drink and I was waiting for my danish to be warmed up. Just then, some guy, probably mid-late 50s waves me over to him and starts saying something that I assumed was not in English but I believe I was wrong. He kept saying “Choo” I was trying to find out what he meant but he just kept saying “choo choo choo choo” while motioning his hands, I was super he was trying to tell me something. The barista came over and tried to figure out what he was pointing at and talking about. We eventually deduced it to my drink, he was just asking if I liked it or not. The experience was odd but I was wondering if anyone had experience with this or anything at all. The guy was there alone which is what kind of threw me off, any help would be much appreciate, thanks.",4.2273153692614756,5.416524461077845,4.817140718562875,85.31317614770461,70.8562874251497,7.7223552894211585,27.689121756487022,8.07648339933343,1.6375552894211571,663,23,135,9,12,212,97,167,0.062,0.816,0.122,0.9109,0,1,4,0,0,0,15.0,1,0,0,1,6,6,0,0,4,0,19,3,1,1,1,34,29,13,0,3,13,0,2,1,0,1,0,3,0,2,8,9,2,3,6,3,1,3,2,1,0,0,20,5,20,5,20,6,3,20,0,0,0,0,18,11,0,7,6,94,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16026059282163874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10522628694626902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10819552394597064,0.0,0.12733514968783913,0.0,0.14465796067252845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17433531379152467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17697760418116704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3031661856934478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3027244398328565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14142657383839002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3064273935545325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371677274333432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16113449949971528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07559655338325715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374930554024774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14627623129445522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668323732127201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15278385968206673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691585905489064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.238247798970334,0.0,0.0,0.1095234584968717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243715274486782,0.13524672796979398,0.14246079740251766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151682606246089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16780539007107753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10992053797221693,0.1691803303466974,0.0,0.0
autism,FML_send_help,2018/02/15,"What's the point of living if I can't form relationships and can't stand being alone? I've had major issues my whole life. Never got any help for them. Idk if my family knows and doesn't care or just doesn't care enough to know. I'm 29 now and I live in my parent's garage and have been unemployed for about 2 years now. I'm a high school drop out so I don't have many job options and there's a lot of jobs I can't do because I'm not normal. I sit in my room pretty much 247 with minimal human contact. I don't even really speak to my parents. I kind of feel resentment towards them for how they ""raised"" me. They pretty much just yelled at me whenever I did something they didn't like and never taught me anything useful or showed love. They're not bad people though, they're just really dumb and ignorant. I shut myself off to the world at a young age and never made good friends or pursued interests or hobbies. At 24 I realized the extent of my problems and almost drove myself crazy trying to figure myself out. I tried to improve myself by educating myself on things i like, reading, exercise, improving my hygiene, posture, anything I could think of. Even though I'm a much better person than I used to be I'm still too fucked up to live properly. I feel like I need to be ripped away from my life and put into some kind of rehab/ therapy program for an extended period of time. I don't have the money or insurance to get professional help and tbh I don't trust the system put in place to help people with mental health problems. I went to a therapist twice and a psychologist twice and the therapist felt pretty useless and he pawned me off on the psychologist who told me ""it doesn't matter if you're *R word*, there's no prescription for that."". It's just a job to those people. Idk how I can escape my current situation. I'm looking for a job but I know whatever job I get won't pay enough to make any real change. Then there's the fact that I can't form relationships so I'm always alone and have no support of any kind. I wish I had someone who could be like the parents I never had and guide me and support me. Or I wish I could have a job like on a farm where I can be alone and be able to support myself. Sometimes I feel like it's too late to start trying to live life properly. I think about suicide a lot but idk if I ever will, although idk if I'll ever have a life worth living either.

I'm an 18 y.o. guy from the Philippines, and as said in the title, I have been diagnosed with PDD when i was 1.5 years old. I don't know if this is the place where I can ask about PDD, but I just heard and read that PDD-NOS is under Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), so I just asked here.

My mother told me that I was diagnosed with PDD at the age of 1.5 years old. She saw some red flags (she had prior experience around children with special needs) such as my head-banging back then, then took me to a doctor for that. The doctor soon gave the diagnosis.

I am now 18, and about to graduate come May 2018. I am still struggling to know if I really have autism, since PDD-NOS is now under ASD, and my type of PDD was never specified.",4.301323763955345,4.715001684210531,5.3779904306220105,84.19320574162681,70.16959064327486,9.259117490696438,26.07177033492823,9.339509955726095,1.8259543859649123,652,18,143,13,11,216,98,171,0.058,0.92,0.022,-0.7043,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,0,0,16,2,0,1,9,0,16,5,0,0,1,21,30,13,0,3,5,1,0,0,0,1,5,2,0,2,4,10,0,0,2,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,12,4,18,1,22,17,1,28,0,0,2,0,12,8,0,4,18,93,22,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13026622046250474,0.2736007373547689,0.0,0.0,0.11252003039324833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260517863352698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4455707287425764,0.0,0.0,0.33541756867200057,0.2995533528008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13982619237514074,0.0,0.14314046314581438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14489137070722855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15017852169043627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16084013026134347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085030875115154,0.11286001366971032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3071009677425524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15288546183306562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14637128071707636,0.0,0.0937438220686134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13919493852075604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104707890959085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11686066969928155,0.0,0.0,0.1529776452943512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13982619237514074,0.16257988214948618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28269841522653416
autism,zerodecoole,2018/02/17,"Tips about empathy Hello Reddit, a few months ago I asked for tips about [becoming an actor with autism](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/5yvys0/becoming_an_actor_with_autism/?utm_source=reddit-android)

I'm a student at a Performing Arts college major and  I want to become an actor, unfortunately it has not been going so well, I have Autism Spectrum Disorder with symptoms of Asperger Syndrome and PDD-NOS and this makes it hard for me to see or understand the emotions of others. It also makes it hard for me to come up with ideas in front of others during improvisation assignments. 
I got a few useful tips about meditation and focusing on the eyes, next to that I also get coached in social skills and I will be attending the empowerment training program soon.
But the main problem has always been my empathy and interaction; during scenes I never feel or react to the emotions of the other person and this makes my performance look less realistic or convincing. This might also have been a problem in social situations outside of acting.

What are your tips on empathy? Do have some tips or tricks that helped you recognise emotions of others?

autism,peyton_montana,2018/02/17,"I really need help with a high functioning ASD adult w/lack of social reciprocity and monologue speech. Don't know what to do. My brother is in his late 60s, has an advanced degree, retired from a great job that didn't require him to work with people directly and is a Vietnam vet. He has never been to therapy and will never. In the military in the 70s he was diagnosed with what we now term as Autism.

The problem: No matter what I do, my brother will not stop talking when I call or visit him. It is always a 1-3 hour non-stop monologue, usually about the same topic. He does not pause - ever - to ask questions and even if I say at the start of the conversation that I only have 15 minutes to talk and interject that point later, it's as if he does not hear me. He also repeats the same information in nearly every conversation.

He's socially isolated and I love him. I know he needs someone to talk to. I just need to know how to handle this or what I can do to make it better.

autism,TimelordME,2018/02/17,"We can stop jumping to conclusions to avoid conflict and arguments. I can't tell you how many times I misinterpreted people's meanings and intentions!  What I discovered is that almost every time I took offense to something said to me, I was wrong.  I would defensively respond to them thinking I had been attacked and insulted.  Then they would defensively attack back, and the argument would begin!

I now know that I can't make assumptions of ill intentions! I don't ever read them correctly! Literally, not ever! So I instead ask for clarification and explanation regarding the meaning of what they said!  This lesson was very hard for me to learn. I learned it ""the hard way."" I did it the wrong way, only to find out I was mistaken dozens of times before I learned the lesson.  I hope you don't make the same mistake. I learned that 99/100 there is no bad intent.  Believe then that the majority of people are inherently kind and helpful! You'll be surprised how nice people can be if you make this assumption, and leave fear and paranoia behind! It's a generalization, but Autistics can be paranoid about others intentions.  We also don't read others intentions correctly, and see ill intentions that aren't really there.  I know this doesn't happen to all of us so if it doesn't pertain to you I apologize.  I'm writing for those who it does, and I'm betting on there being a lot of us.  Please don't complain, I'm not referring to you, but to those like myself.  It's truly a valuable lesson that needs to be said. So ask before taking offense. It will save you a lot of heartache!",4.168160535117057,6.404356468227428,5.272926421404684,77.74109531772578,72.94648829431438,8.345819397993314,29.56020066889632,9.057496981413335,2.7634187290969896,1260,54,223,28,26,415,148,299,0.168,0.727,0.106,-0.7,1,1,1,0,0,0,37.0,4,7,4,4,15,21,7,2,11,0,31,2,0,11,5,70,54,22,0,8,6,0,2,1,0,5,2,3,0,0,23,13,0,5,16,2,1,2,12,14,0,1,10,6,37,7,26,34,5,17,0,0,1,0,28,2,0,7,12,165,60,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10563287142118126,0.0,0.0,0.08436021459726882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19723758531086766,0.24001992271801464,0.0,0.08111520205843811,0.08807963896773634,0.0,0.0,0.17952822715958275,0.1188509646022639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09231490013752518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1908432619521024,0.08887976908315141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870543684475693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641583426514652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932843477143732,0.0,0.18899641461945604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707076393066288,0.0,0.0,0.10477524782256913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985147116633806,0.11594895255233803,0.0,0.0,0.11169854565547026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05153702422534339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17936743804579455,0.0,0.0,0.21124593129359706,0.10695017554384684,0.0,0.22981879769013125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821940535121892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08022980318158329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21940018988059445,0.0,0.0,0.1157962042851391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21103684329666586,0.0,0.06757951488504149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30103508302021825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406177222821283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08121125922844162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08819425868123444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931525731488631,0.0,0.0922028000461915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06759365214289624,0.0,0.0,0.18453598260177773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720313214547395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25378266101245195,0.0,0.0,0.08704019433023917,0.0,0.1674659046002761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22481094076935448,0.23067323557267905,0.0,0.0
autism,broomstickbird,2018/02/17,"Diagnosed with autism at 20 After a talk today with a therapist specializing in autism regarding me being on the autism spectrum, I have had such an amazing revelation about myself. Suddenly everything that I thought just made me strange and unlikable are actually aspects of autism. I made a list of things that I do that may be autistic in nature.

This is what I have so far:
- I HATE fire alarms 
- I hate hate hate the sound of forks on plates
- I can’t stay in my room with all the lights on. I absolutely hate it. I feel like all of the colors in the room are attacking me
- I love children’s media and cartoons and I obsess over things one at a time, not letting myself watch anything else, and seeing signs of it everywhere
- I see patterns in everything
- I struggle to read people
- I struggle to understand plots in stories
And I’m bad at noticing when people are annoyed by me. And I ramble on about things I like
I take everything literally and never use sarcasm, and struggle to understand sarcasm sometimes 
-I’m asexual
-I’m the most comfortable around children and I’m uncomfortable around teenagers
-I flake on social situations I was invited to but if I plan on doing something and I can’t or eating something and someone else ate it I get so irritated 
-I have to check my hair constantly in the mirror and my phone or I get anxious and many people have pointed this out. I also mess with my hair constantly especially when I’m nervous.",4.270686813186813,6.5820987106227085,5.227934981684982,77.84102335164836,72.88278388278387,8.359523809523811,31.155219780219774,9.075114841892004,3.0156912087912096,1160,54,202,26,24,379,147,273,0.168,0.7829999999999999,0.05,-0.9798,0,0,2,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,1,11,21,7,6,12,0,18,6,2,3,3,39,42,22,0,1,6,0,4,2,0,1,1,1,2,2,12,20,2,0,4,1,1,0,4,15,0,1,6,10,36,6,38,32,3,34,0,0,4,1,6,24,0,5,11,146,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.09705340764587993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795338605812478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123554640944845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818427161475767,0.17707147695894454,0.0,0.11314404047755043,0.0,0.0,0.08304049200383827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21495032436269332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094439262918364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017669523472114,0.1661632236341347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26815032316182896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05028726747942045,0.07105043336335468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10392191643776497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4909544632572208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169913438930683,0.0,0.09717705245485604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08976171916197209,0.18821281963232128,0.0,0.10083142144021624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07670556971388631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11322979658300356,0.0,0.0,0.06739305568436184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.206848028976297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940168060925655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09948157998644462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585049849512294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11179121173002822,0.0,0.10138150750965763,0.08426761587896639,0.15313012182194147,0.0983632078630129,0.0,0.0,0.10600544124227056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119148329221218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477753165236961,0.07993789336861186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547453285781804,0.19821978289084827,0.0,0.0,0.07895589572221258,0.05799281562025379,0.0,0.0942713945731117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20707162982063648,0.0,0.08589689934010059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,wispyRed,2018/02/18,"Anyone have any potential tips for helping out my friend when he has a meltdown? Here some more context &amp; info on our relationship among some other things to help out people who feel like answering:
I have a friend who happens to be autistic that I met a few months ago on a webcomic discord.
I don't think it would be very polite of me to reveal his name as I see people in other subreddits substituting people's real names with a different name they make up for the post so I'm going to use the name Mark to refer to my friend.
So we met there and I was a bit shy at first but he started talking to me when we saw each other around and I warmed up to him quite a bit, really enjoying his company.
Fast forward a bit and something I don't remember a lot of the context behind happened and he started having a meltdown and sending me distraught messages.
I tried my best to think of ways to calm him down but he was having a complete meltdown and wouldn't really listen to me all that much.
I didn't get mad at him I just kind of gave him ideas on how to calm himself down (maybe playing games he likes or laying down. spending time with his pet or going offline for an hour or so to collect his thoughts.)
That didn't seem to help him out so I just let him know i was there and let him vent to me but then he disappeared for a little bit then came back and seemed to be acting like nothing happened at all.
A similar scenario happened a week or two ago,
he texted me saying that he was crying and mad about being excluded from something he really wanted to be a part of.
After last time and knowing him for a few more months I think things went smoother and I tried my best to help calm him but apart from me having more of my wits about me this time to try helping better it went along rather similarly to how things went the first time but this time a mutual friend of ours helped out towards the end by telling him that the server he moderates added a D&amp;D chat which helped calm him a lot as Mark loves D&amp;D.
So now with that context, back to what i was asking originally when making this post,
how can i do a better job of consoling my friend when he's having a meltdown?
I'm not sure if I did a good job at all and want to do a better job of calming him and being there for him.
He's very very sweet and I care about him quite a bit so any advice on helping him when hes melting down will be very much appreciated. It always saddens me quite a bit when he's that upset tbh.
Also I'm sorry if my wording looks strange or clunky or messy I didn't sleep very well, also I apologize if I accidentally worded anything awkward or rudely by accident.

edit: Thanks for the advice everyone, it was very helpful to hear!",4.138570348672396,4.950581937163378,5.1043168288765015,84.57447203061514,70.74147217235188,7.730303316639893,27.2252196919588,7.85451343220497,1.5141482944344709,2157,70,442,26,38,707,240,557,0.084,0.7070000000000001,0.21,0.9978,4,0,2,0,0,0,33.0,4,0,1,10,32,35,3,3,33,0,35,2,1,7,4,87,77,50,0,8,19,0,2,3,5,3,0,3,1,0,24,27,0,0,15,3,1,10,7,6,1,3,19,9,63,29,76,46,24,68,0,0,3,1,75,25,0,16,35,311,87,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138116997331212,0.1032423246931653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09313984150384656,0.04845557360345827,0.18929040568056074,0.0,0.07920259439662647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04071875216408099,0.0,0.04792183828699293,0.05184084231005075,0.05444117680993423,0.0,0.0,0.0895571105330025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1222265368837612,0.1545104253406322,0.38146040960621097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06660448547616778,0.05937371436818361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06105751899217879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06396760572944317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084241248611754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05157827402291007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055645335866798484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029444994172702563,0.0416025706150793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09906807227081467,0.0,0.0,0.22495824375570644,0.0,0.030424999978158864,0.0,0.06619174971807709,0.04884413865035618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20598547318507465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06563424909236577,0.0,0.351298803269604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057349020712900926,0.0,0.0,0.06573939698596362,0.0,0.0,0.1733655672178834,0.0,0.0,0.06064202575966625,0.06400805827022768,0.047468698471064205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11909696309060798,0.0,0.08535096118787831,0.05836603230918137,0.0,0.0,0.048902116000015185,0.0,0.0,0.09901737940266686,0.05255869786000336,0.0,0.07774364828629017,0.0,0.058504146498762365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929640696129088,0.0,0.08561777072113648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0558773479393628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06306203420328932,0.0,0.12111692110402712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11154465703446616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18581792735743075,0.0,0.06628334277398924,0.11191908416808458,0.0,0.0,0.06252180713987475,0.06596807025389691,0.0,0.0,0.04631022495073735,0.0,0.0,0.04640516965992685,0.10602857562131553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05827632117843684,0.0,0.0,0.08966316466802511,0.0,0.06518849205722542,0.08243702511971085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05488510567182248,0.0,0.0,0.04680649640349123,0.050899314466603805,0.05361428727335537,0.0,0.0,0.1160647743392292,0.1119424970167036,0.0,0.04623150164984573,0.16978434140369664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11861173019289092,0.0,0.0568864152219316,0.0,0.0,0.05029570758756265,0.0,0.2882962049024332,0.06869615669412175,0.04622364904543814,0.04671201481738455,0.0,0.05235959796877004,0.1619512414839108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04136795109627861,0.0,0.0,0.0

&gt; Paul Gold, 45, said he lived next door to the Cruzes in 2009 and 2010 and stayed in touch with Lynda Cruz over the years.

&gt; **“He had emotional problems and I believe he was diagnosed with autism,”** Mr. Gold said of Nikolas Cruz. “He had trouble controlling his temper. He broke things. He would do that sometimes at our house when he lost his temper. But he was always very apologetic afterwards.”

 &gt; He added: “He would sometimes be hitting his head and covering his ears. One time, I sent him home because he was misbehaving at our house and he took a golf club and smashed one of my trailers.”

&gt; She said he was small of build, wore a constant smirk and seemed eager to provoke confrontations.

I feel that an incontrovertible pattern is emerging. Anders Behring Breivik, Adam Lanza, Christopher Harper-Mercer, Elliott Rodger. When is the world going to wake up and lock all of us up for society's safety? It would at least save us the trouble of going through the soul-crushing and hopeless struggle of applying for jobs (11% of people with ASD are full-time employed). We would get a warm place to sleep, three meals a day and be surrounded by fellow aspies. We wouldn't have to worry about rent, hunger, finding a girlfriend, fitting in - any of those money or social issues. If that (jail) doesn't sound like paradise, then what is?

I envy Nikolas Cruz. I really do. His life is better than mine.

autism,Philosopher_1,2018/02/18,"Gaming I already posted similar in the r/gaming form but thought I’d post here also.  What do you do as a gamer who loves playing all kinds of games from world of Warcraft to call of duty to pubg, who has a fairly impaired hand eye coordination?  I was born with bad hand eye coordination (can’t catch a ball, have difficulty shooting a gun and bow ,especially bows I don’t even come close to the target.) and of course ghat means video games, especially first person shooters.  Not entirely sure where this hand eye coordination impairment comes from but doctors generally believe either aspergers or a fetal alcohol disorder (my mental health is completely unknown every doctor has there own ideas).  What do I do?  It feels like no matter what I do I can’t get better at one of the few things in life I enjoy.  My best friend is a hardcore gamer and worlds ahead of me at almost all games.

autism,satanic-candy,2018/02/19,"anyone take stimulants for their ASD? I wanna know if any of you take stimulants to help with your ASD.

I'm just so tired all the time and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of everyone telling me I just ""need to push through it"". 
I hate that I need more sleep than usual (at least 10 hours for a good night rest. I can handle 8 hours but it's never good enough). I hate that work takes everything out of me so I can't have a social life. I've always just been tired and don't have energy for anything. 
I don't have chronic fatigue. I don't have sleeping problems (according to a sleep study). My vitamin levels are fine. My iron levels are a little low at the moment but even on a good level I'm still tired. I've been on diets before for well longer than half a year, and never felt any better from that. I have a physical job, and being physical doesn't help me have energy, it just makes me tired.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I've tried lots of things and nothing works. I'm also now getting in trouble at work for being to slow.  I'm literally about to give up and accept the fact that I may never have energy like others.

autism,robotdevilhands,2018/02/19,"Question about the future My 2y 4mo son was diagnosed with autism in December. I've read that autistic people can tend to act rigidly, demanding routine and sameness. He doesn't currently seem to act like this, though. He seems to like trying different foods, different toys, and going new places. I wouldn't say we have a standard schedule to our days. We have even taken him away for the weekend and he's been able to sleep and eat normally, and in general seems pretty happy.

He's still very young, though. Is this likely to change as he ages? Or does he just have a relatively easy-going personality?

He's currently nonverbal, and as he grows, I want to make sure he is comfortable and happy, especially if it's hard for him to communicate discomfort to us.

Thanks for any insight you can provide.",4.403830769230769,6.683130326666667,5.194000000000003,78.37546153846158,72.4,8.882051282051282,28.871794871794872,9.466822959209583,2.881164102564103,639,26,114,16,13,207,100,150,0.051,0.787,0.162,0.9565,4,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,4,1,0,0,6,10,0,2,4,0,11,4,1,1,1,27,20,13,0,4,3,1,1,3,0,1,1,1,0,1,4,10,2,1,5,3,0,4,2,2,0,0,3,2,10,8,19,16,1,18,0,0,0,0,20,4,0,6,13,63,14,1,0.1443513532786224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816387024828746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13562284816124232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15270459146239154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309468097520858,0.0,0.0,0.14651358500568626,0.0,0.3016328811135217,0.0,0.0,0.1263228420207261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14770747175888338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09534270743049353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745502293711656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16407640129296566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3073293995352017,0.12931045904231228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2115683392303213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09635564922010872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13941543650671034,0.0,0.0,0.1414336775187384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000750528329848,0.12604203379163878,0.15081644055676086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14685722153262473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1617065520312133,0.0,0.14439041680488646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147939899662382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3942361517015487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14445560209960154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11527917719455245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604944213700687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.132899331883003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2836489433687885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980050934044972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17363690448083982,0.0,0.0,0.11910498415155267,0.08514216817833209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,falling_apart522,2018/02/20,6yo always turns off my lights My 6yo girl with nonverbal ASD is obsessed with turning off the lights. I thought it was just a phase but it’s been nearly a year. She tolerated the Christmas lights in December though- so I’m thinking if there is some other type of lighting I can use around my house that would be more tolerable than normal 60watt bulbs? Something other than leaving my Christmas lights up all year long?

autism,Malfice,2018/02/20,"Help? Therapist Suggested I Speak To My GP... Yesterday, I had an appointment with a therapist to discuss gender issues. As part of this, the doctor was asking me about my past and my life in general, and trying to get to know my personality a little.

Several times throughout the session he mentioned autism, and at the end he suggested I should consider contacting my GP and speaking to them about looking into it further.

Its not something I've ever considered before. Growing up, my only two close friends were autistic, and I definitely don't feel I am like them? However, on the other hand, I've done several hours reading, I feel like there may be something to this and that I tick a lot of boxes for traits of an autistic person, and I can't get it out of my head.  

At 25, is there any point to me going and speaking to my doctor about this? Why does this scare me so much? Getting a result either way could at least put my mind at rest. But on the other hand, I've gone 25 years without knowing and done ok for myself. I've got two kids. Is this something I should know if I have, for their sake?

I dont know what to do...",4.115625000000001,5.2377321696428565,5.357500000000002,81.5875,71.05357142857143,8.278571428571428,29.17857142857143,8.660442795831766,2.219326785714286,882,34,172,15,16,294,130,224,0.036000000000000004,0.8740000000000001,0.09,0.8954,1,0,3,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,3,0,7,5,0,1,11,1,18,6,3,1,1,33,32,13,0,4,5,0,4,2,1,3,3,3,0,3,12,13,0,0,6,1,0,4,5,1,0,2,7,8,27,4,32,20,6,26,0,0,1,0,19,14,0,3,9,124,39,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08210668632238337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128747021838738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10274002869330508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09640029741102374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24716304358294405,0.10565954601131564,0.2471159116398969,0.141505253601815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693895063693504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10921537252999244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220985710743572,0.17251198608931498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328268143938873,0.0,0.18924349248374728,0.0,0.0686187778649755,0.0,0.09656603860292308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391308644934078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08092883226370287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890363164089955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12602018693737355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2654200712759618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528155338766923,0.1179739906409856,0.12101223560161985,0.0,0.0,0.10139038321919096,0.0,0.0,0.10264801264421056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219120097932895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08875708551942989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918274792922346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074861248235656,0.11525907390863065,0.0,0.21084934214165976,0.0,0.0,0.11413741744443524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12137608177902087,0.0,0.0,0.12077171194015578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12088084037544415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272801492424438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2788524312424538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2803746587183023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07040390415634944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819738814474801,0.0,0.2358889925873912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958370286166126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894820225706163,0.0,0.0,0.11638812428235325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775198204277782

autism,Jxnbury,2018/02/21,"Planning for the Future Sorry for the long post - My DD is 8 years old now. She is high functioning. We did not get a diagnosis until late and I wasn't the advocate I should have been for her early on as she was my first. I was completely unprepared. Fast forward - I had her repeat kindergarten because better early than late. We found that she loves gymnastics and art - we are pushing her interests while attempting to expand [bought her a pen tablet for drawing on the computer]. We have been discussing getting her into a montessori school, as well as finding a child psychologist early on. We pushed for ABA at her current school with several rounds of speech and OT, as well. I read A LOT trying to give her the best life I can and to be aware of her needs. I'm not the best parent - but I am always actively trying to be better.

I guess my questions are - thoughts on the montessori school? And the therapist? Are there things I should be looking into, like art therapy or something else altogether? What can I do and who can I talk to in order to make sure I'm supporting my DD in the best way possible? Any other tips or food for thought?

autism,daestae,2018/02/21,Does anyone else get this overwhelming feeling of largeness sometimes...? I suddenly become acutely aware of how tiny tiny tiny I am in comparison to the universe and how much I don't know in comparison to what I know and how much I am dependent on my senses and how nonsensical everything is and how dependent I am on my mind to construe and interpret and see meaning and I just feel like crying or screaming or tearing off my skin at the fact that there are no certainties anywhere anywhere anywhere. It makes me want to wrap myself tight in my duvet and shut my eyes and reduce the world to a tiny black tunnel made of just me.,10.32743801652893,7.516455132231407,9.841388429752069,67.60753719008268,59.66115702479339,12.985785123966945,42.38181818181818,11.20814326018867,4.669339173553718,505,22,91,10,5,164,74,121,0.066,0.8740000000000001,0.06,-0.4019,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,1,4,0,6,2,2,9,1,32,16,16,0,1,4,0,4,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,9,0,1,6,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,8,15,1,15,15,2,10,0,1,3,0,0,9,0,4,2,66,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16879947100895587,0.2473530529209547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666183561826847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2651775271827798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112595002452164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2016670611559277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21696372373037887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441282787932977,0.17246333787784465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612675066921766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2653452230752737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794072209092828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2284279600322078,0.1611430361636708,0.0,0.0,0.2629662398737617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24375526145136014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549282244322452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923724985262768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387606429600881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14238986086298958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,hypomnema,2018/02/21,"support options? Hi, I was recently diagnosed as an adult and I've been having a lot of intense loneliness/dating/relationship issues that I can't seem to find help with. I would say it's at a crisis level at the moment. I try talking to psychologists or mental health hotlines/warmlines or NT people I know, but I just don't feel understood at all, plus everyone's advice is totally contradictory and making me feel extremely insecure and lost, so I'm spinning out even more. Is there anything kind of like 12 step program sponsorship, where I could ask a peer for perspective? Would anyone be willing to talk with me? I'm nervous about posting everything in public. And I can delete this if it's not really the right kind of thing to post here.

autism,ereanon,2018/02/23,"Advice for handling rage outbursts/emotional dysregulation? Hi! I’m posting in hopes that someone has some advice. I am working with my therapist but I would like to hear from others with similar experiences. So far we have discussed DBT but I find it doesn’t really work with my “triggers”. If it helps, I’m 25/F.

The main issue is that my rage/anger is caused by physical stimulus. I can be happy as a clam but if I stub my toe/hit my head/anything that startles me with pain... I lose it. I have trashed rooms in response to suddenly tripping a bit. (This isn’t my only trigger. Frustration can do it too, like if my arms are full and stuff is falling, or if it’s really windy out and my hair is whipping around my head. So also physical, but that’s more a slow burn resulting in an explosion instead of a sudden jarring KABOOM).

Does anyone else get like this? What do you do to calm down? I’m terrified I’m going to start screaming at people or my pets, which I never have (I always direct my anger at inanimate things). Also, I sometimes hurt myself more because I’m kicking the fridge or something, and it just feels so horrible trying to come down. I’m all of 100 lbs but I know it’s still not fair exploding around my partner. It must be scary. 

How can I keep calm when I suddenly cut my finger? I should note, if I seriously hurt myself, I don’t explode, I just laugh! How can I laugh off the small stuff? Why am I this way. Any tips and help would be amazing.

autism,whoisearth,2018/02/23,"Autism and Extroversion I'm recently the proud papa of 2 kids on the spectrum.  My oldest was just diagnosed and would be your typical pre-DSM5 diagnosis of Aspergers.  My youngest is more your traditional mid-high functioning Autism.

What I have noticed is that Autism tends to gravitate around people that are introverted.  It makes sense because in and of itself Autism maintains many aspects of being a social affliction.

That said, what we've noticed is despite all his shortcomings our youngest is a very, very gregarious kid.  Unfortunately it's hard to find information not just on people with autism that are extroverted and/or how to deal and nurture the behaviour.

Anyone here have experience as being someone on the spectrum and extroverted or know someone who is I'd be curious on any advice you might have.",6.67673708920188,9.400414021126764,6.8080985915492995,67.32839201877938,67.23943661971829,10.367136150234742,35.07276995305164,10.504223727775694,4.517195305164318,669,33,101,20,12,214,96,142,0.029,0.915,0.056,0.5770000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,1,3,0,1,5,2,0,0,6,0,17,1,0,2,1,19,22,8,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,2,10,7,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,2,8,2,15,14,2,8,0,0,0,0,12,6,0,2,2,69,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18499894929747376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287424472120925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13237525464821795,0.0,0.0,0.16853278495171106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154062403348394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.195178113339835,0.0,0.19215335984349147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18518892163748285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17303283946599055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16959136701842467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000244188247434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10404399156089164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637095554535924,0.19193831279669465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20083603607451325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4310786420350208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624979470351044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869282720202991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18008437303850025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1929854327376166,0.32081634443284274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3124136629096669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13448577791820213,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,empress_of_pinkskull,2018/02/24,"I would like some advice on how to pass probation in a government sector job w/o revealing I have ADD and Aspergers. I recently started a government sector job (city level) a few days ago and I am having issues. I was caught in a trance(or  partial seizure- not sure) by who I think is my boss' boss and have had trouble absorbing some of my boss' instructions. I sometimes have asked obvious questions because of processing issues. I put data on a spreadsheet that did not belong. I am worried about passing probation as I have concerns that bad impressions have been formed. I have had issues in jobs before, but I am a different person now.  I can not reveal my conditions because I said in a pre employment medical exam that I had no conditions as I was worried about not being given a chance. I am doing all the right things such as taking my meds, going to bed early, and avoiding sugar during work hours(sugar messes with my brain).

What can I do? I would appreciate any advice.

We saw huge improvements after his dx almost 2 years ago. This past fall we put him in public school to try it out. It went badly and we ended up withdrawing him and going back to homeschool. During the time he was in school and since we have seen massive regression with his irritability and ease of frustration/tantrums. I’m not sure what to do, but my main question is for parents with kids on the spectrum that are older. As your kids grew older and changed did you see changes in tantrums/behavior? Like a surge at certain times? We are trying to get in with a psychiatrist specializing in kids on the spectrum, but until then we wait and do our best.

autism,drykul,2018/02/24,"Father of recently ASD diagnosed, nonverbal 3 year old daughter. Questions about behaviors and ABA. As the title says, my 3 year old was recently diagnosed with ASD. We live in a rural area with little services so we're selling the house and packing up to move to a larger city where we have more family support systems as well as more therapy options. I've been doing a little research on ABA and how do I know if a particular company uses an antiquated form of it? I've seen so many mixed opinions of it and I don't know what to look for. I want my daughter to feel free to express herself however she feels she needs to, barring dangerous behaviors obviously. Right now she flaps her arms and spins in circles. I know I will flip my lid if I hear a therapist berating her for those behaviors but at the same time I wonder if she'll have animosity for me in the future for not allowing them to teach her when it's inappropriate to perform those types of behaviors. 
I'm not sure what I'm doing, what I need to look out for, or if I'm doing the right things and I'm scared as hell I'm going to mess something up because I love my little girl to death and I just want the best for her and to help her exceed as much as possible. And the fact that she's nonverbal and can't tell me how she feels makes it all the more horrifying that I could be damaging her while I thought I was helping her.",4.8217471535139405,5.275748349823324,6.261101295641932,78.17659108755402,69.03533568904594,9.963800549666274,31.6232822928936,9.994966539143718,3.0171477817039647,1105,45,223,26,18,377,152,283,0.125,0.787,0.08900000000000001,-0.9382,1,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,2,0,1,2,10,11,2,1,14,0,15,5,1,5,4,50,41,28,1,9,9,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,0,1,12,15,1,0,9,1,2,2,4,5,1,0,5,8,36,7,39,32,8,29,1,1,3,1,29,15,1,9,11,151,48,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07594877921128297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307492973852175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947480886416332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25291202727195833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11745216522921327,0.0,0.1889890230590756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07080724848293214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14042174755216053,0.0,0.16701981917560318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14375988921027086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20541386983213028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3746150996413735,0.11001506662177099,0.0,0.20924808869396588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244714923425728,0.0,0.08316465187312698,0.12631449130036004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13241922886575164,0.09158783068625516,0.18476350032179667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26147205141191593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14045626757692609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956907782914915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2460347727960857,0.0,0.0,0.2127979987833472,0.0,0.09907880119059052,0.1247361140434789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959153067784979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138301654351454,0.11742440204010428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10889696744376733,0.0,0.14247928227481807,0.14465834823850238,0.08277191998253759,0.0,0.0,0.09891037596081882,0.07264930811762066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760557561767692,0.0,0.0,0.1469725715842409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120211832934406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13511231194842668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16046347906040231
autism,Plaguefaced,2018/02/24,"My 10 year old brother is likely autistic and my parents refuse to take him to a doctor for a diagnosis. This is my first time posting on this subreddit. I apologize if I break any rules. I am not at all educated enough about Autism to definitively say my brother has autism, my parents like to say he has very severe adhd instead. They do sometimes claim they have taken him to a doctor and was diagnosed with autism but it is extremely hazy and they don't know where he is on the spectrum. (i suspect they're just lying to get me off their back) I hope I am not being offensive and I am not asking for a diagnosis. I am just asking some questions to see if there may be any hope for my brother in the future.


My brother is 10 and cannot read yet (he gets very very frustrated with himself and would frequently say he just 'can't do it') He learned to speak very late in development and seems to be getting better at making grammatical sentences in the last 2 years. Did anyone with autism find this to be the case with you or others you know who have autism? I am very scared he is never going to learn how to read. I have tried for nearly 5 or 6 years to convince my parents that my brother needs serious help or he is never going to learn to read. Did any medications help you ore others you know with autism? Is there any advice you have for helping him learn to read? There is nothing my parents are willing to do on their parts as they've been completely run down by him over the course of his life. They have resorted to having a sitter of sorts to watch over him and help him with homework. (I am 23 and in college. He will not listen to me at all especially if I try to get him to read ANYTHING (even a word as small as 'The' or 'It'))


My brother also makes weird noises over and over and over again (sort of like an engine noise revving up) and will do other repetitive motions. Today he would stomp around and run into walls. He'd also 'playfully' hit while making noises. Are these traits of autism you've seen in yourself or others? Does anyone know if this is something that might go away when he is older?


I just want my little brother to end up being a functioning member of society, even if he has complications here and there. I am terrified for him in middle school and high school. There is no way he is ready :(


edit: I would also like to know if getting diagnosed with autism is possible as an adult? I have heard that it is harder to diagnose and get help when you're older so I would like to know your experiences",4.819020102010203,5.482448780198023,5.496201620162015,82.91390939093911,69.11881188118812,8.33903390339034,27.58025802580258,8.391295532112219,1.7587953795379536,1994,62,400,28,33,647,224,505,0.07200000000000001,0.8270000000000001,0.101,0.9199,4,0,1,0,0,0,39.0,0,6,6,2,26,15,2,1,15,0,60,7,0,4,4,82,92,40,0,14,20,11,0,5,0,9,7,6,1,1,17,25,0,1,14,6,0,6,10,5,0,1,7,9,54,10,75,69,5,63,0,0,3,0,64,31,0,20,28,286,71,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840420970462887,0.06833464559163194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16776864086602936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902187993228318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09779316202431564,0.0,0.0575463127801466,0.06225239750809309,0.13074995036966586,0.0,0.06570140132189904,0.05377174247317167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061847274522291336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0733201231651696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21293199438174784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14315234085420467,0.06119608791771707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061937095814375585,0.07225623430267825,0.0,0.09237602024932848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684048173011256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06391462116689803,0.059482299481923774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21921277993473415,0.0,0.11922824547954115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343625408799952,0.07388473189694836,0.0,0.13891225073739058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23058971900926456,0.057002165758398275,0.07888392308967793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049393525108581936,0.17082097585618308,0.07008808658143513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14003616495760152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07044697256125253,0.0,0.07418452590837217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05185210187752761,0.10786843141362046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06709958250321173,0.0,0.0733796200241037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.310595316181738,0.07572721904117315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07883540507785967,0.06697347130360218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07833744251375686,0.0,0.3497438982499252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668330839464531,0.07001198485549967,0.14154549456475712,0.055725041094484465,0.06366151419105462,0.0,0.07900083212880002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05383541933369911,0.0691624153276726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05257854856179512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04077666118346819,0.0,0.06628532646133997,0.0,0.0,0.09495556332372024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2884972727410943,0.04124644067532447,0.05550706443852118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1987046522383845,0.0,0.0,0.13509760287131134

autism,Orlaiththebabybat,2018/02/25,"Is it normal to have low energy? This doesn't really happen when I'm off school, but when I'm in school I'll get 8/9 hours of sleep but I'll be tired all day and by 9 o'clock I'd be ready to sleep. I heard that it's normal to have low energy or be ""lazy"" with autism. Is this true? How do you increase your energy levels?",0.8587500000000006,2.0680740416666694,3.184444444444445,93.605,79.41666666666666,7.022222222222222,14.777777777777779,7.793537801064563,-0.24915555555555624,249,2,62,4,6,86,49,72,0.101,0.675,0.225,0.8725,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,2,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,9,3,2,1,2,10,14,7,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,3,1,8,10,2,11,0,2,0,0,3,5,0,1,5,33,8,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16065386766420178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301484992672739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2202851292123408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2453209198221841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.488145339203809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15958478065516804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5042206125335925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4985752341584836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863126725546946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,mcp00pants,2018/02/25,"My daughter spends hours awake at night crying. My 19 month old daughter M was recently evaluated with M-CHAT questionnaire and scored a 6 or 7 (one question the woman who administered it wasn't sure of). So she is at medium or high risk of ASD but we do not have an official diagnosis. 

I've been reading the Early Start Denver Model book, but I feel like I'm having such a hard time applying anything I learn in the book because I'm just so burned out, tired, and frustrated. I know I'm her mother and it isn't an excuse, but I am finding it so difficult not to just disconnect and let her do her thing when she isn't crying instead of actively trying to engage her.

She hasn't slept well since the day she was born and I think that is the biggest issue. I told the pediatrician before I even left the hospital after giving birth that something was wrong, she doesn't look at me, and they said she is fine. I would always tell the doctors at her check ups, she barely smiles, it's so hard to get her to laugh, she doesn't want to be cuddled, she stays awake for 2, 3, 4, 5+ hours in the middle of the night, kicks me and pushes me when I try to get her to go to bed and fights for hours, she doesn't babble very much. They tell me she is fine - ""it's just her personality"" or ""you need to sleep train her"", ""it's part of being a mother,"" ""Hire a nanny,"" ""you need to sleep more."" So I basically get her to sleep, clean up, wind down enough that I can go to sleep myself, and then I'm up for however many hours at night going in and out of her room while she cries, then her twin sister V is usually ready to get up at 6am, or even earlier so M wakes up too. So I have no down time except her nap (which she often wakes up way too early and cries for an hour because she is exhausted, but won't go back to sleep so I get no break and she is cranky the rest of the day). 

I try to get them out of the house a lot and that helps with crankiness during the day, but sometimes she just doesn't want to do anything. Like the other day I took her to the trampoline park which she usually LOVES and after 20 minutes she just kept running off the court so we had to leave, even though her sister was still playing. And even when she wants to stay, she ignores me the whole time so we don't really get to work on anything from the book.

I know she has a lot of struggles we need to work on (she never looks when I say her name, she doesn't follow my gaze, when I play with her face to face she never looks at me, if I try to get her to look at me when she is trying to get help with something, she just gets so mad and frustrated. On the rare occasion that she takes a decent nap and she sleeps through the night, we have so much easier day, she is happier, I am happier, I can be more patient and engaged. But that's so rare so we're all stuck in this cycle where things just keep getting worse. I'm not giving her enough opportunities to engage with me because I just get so frustrated when she won't look at me, and then I just give up and go look at my phone or clean something or play with he sister or just read with her in my lap instead of face to face (she LOVES being read to), and then through all this time I'm missing any chance where she might have tried to look at my face. We have no family who will help me during the day, my husband works all day and doesn't help at night (which would be pointless because I wouldn't be able to sleep with her screaming anyways, and he doesn't know what to do to calm her down....it's hard for me to explain it to him because I just try to figure it our from her behaviour, the sound of her cry, etc. but every situation is different and he can't ""read"" her, so he needs explicit instructions which is impossible).

We have tried sleep training 3 separate times. It worked perfectly on her twin sister V. She goes to sleep on her own in 5-10 minutes, sleeps through the night. She always takes a good nap 2.5-3 hours and falls asleep no problem.  M NEVER falls asleep in less than 30 minutes. 45-1 hour is more typical. She usually does cry a bit falling asleep (we put her down in her crib awake), but usually not more than a few minutes at a time (if she cries for 5 minutes I go in and sit with her). So bedtime, while abnormal, isn't a ""problem"" per-se. It's the night wakings. Last night she woke up at 10:45. I waited 4-5 minutes in case she could settle herself but she didn't. I got her some water, changed her diaper, rubbed her back and ""shush"" her for 10 minutes or so, then leave. She just keeps seeming like she is about to fall asleep, then thrashing around and start to cry again. Over and over and over. We did this until FINALLY at 2:00 am she fell asleep and stayed asleep. But then she woke up at 6:00 when he sister woke up, so she only got 7 hours of broken up sleep. When she is finally asleep all I can do is just lay in my bed and cry because people kept telling me it will get better, but that isn't true anymore. It might just keep getting worse! 

We live in Canada, and the wait for a developmental pediatrician is long. Fortunately her appointment is finally coming up in April, but I can't wait that long to get her sleep situation sorted out. SOMETHING is wrong. There is a pediatric sleep clinic run by a pediatric neurologist and I actually contacted the doctor when she was 9 months old and she said by my description she sounded like she needed to be seen, but the clinic was only accepting referrals from pediatricians. But I can't get a pediatrician to make the referral! I have asked two different ones, and they just tell me to sleep train again. We're never NOT sleep training! I don't rock her to sleep (she hates it anyways), I don't take her out of her crib, we don't let her sleep with us (she hates that too). I do go in to stay with her because we already tried extinction and that didn't help and I'm not just going to leave her to cry and assume she is ""stubborn"" and just needs to learn to self sooth. She is clearly trying SO HARD to fall asleep. she is laying down, she is closing her eyes, but they she just pops open and cries again. Not a pain or fear cry. Frustrated and tired. 

I guess this is mostly just frustration/venting, but does anyone have any ideas? Either how to get her seen at the sleep clinic, or how to get her to sleep? I've read melatonin can help her fall asleep, but it doesn't help with prolonged night wakings so I don't know if that's worth trying. I'm weary of trying anything without a doctor's advice anyways, but if I can't get any doctor's to help me I just don't know what else to try. She's so tired. 

We have two consultations set up with two different therapy offices for early intervention (ESDM) so we will be getting help with a lot of things soon fortunately, but I'm not sure how much they can help with sleep or any underlying medical issues that could be causing her to have such poor sleep. I think the therapy will go much much better if she is getting a good night of sleep before! I can already tell if I were bringing her in today for example after her night last night she would just be frustrated and crying and not want to engage with anyone or play any games because she is so tired. I want to get the most help possible from the therapy so if we could solve the sleep before she starts that would be so so great.

autism,VerticalFury,2018/02/25,"Why isn't autism research a higher priority? I haven't been following autism research much, but I wanted to know why it isn't a higher priority.  Given the alarming number of children that are being diagnosed with autism, why hasn't there been a Manhattan Project-style research effort to discover the true causes of autism.

&amp;nbsp;

Is it due to the fact that people impacted by autism (either having the disorder themselves or having to directly care for someone who does) are a minority of the population?  Or is it because further research could reveal that industrial activity is responsible and the only way to stop autism would be to cease many forms of industrial activity.

autism,LivingMagic,2018/02/25,"What restaurants will provide customers with picture menus? My son cannot read or speak or hear. The only way for him to order when we go out is to point to a photo of what he would like. This has worked out fairly well so far because kid's menus usually have pictures but as he gets older it's getting more difficult. 


Adding a menu into his communication software is time consuming and not something I can do on the fly when the family suddenly decides to choose a place he hasn't been to before. 


I took him to Applebee's this week and was able to get a book that showed pics of all the food, that is normally for the cooks. Is this common?

autism,Hactar42,2018/02/27,"Ideas for Dealing with Storms My 6 year old, has always had an issue with thunderstorms. Loud claps of thunder, especially ones that wake him up, will almost always trigger a meltdown. I don't think he is scared of thunder and lighting in the sense that it will hurt him. I think it has more to do with the load sounds and sudden light flashes. Normally, we just deal with having a sleepless night, and I will let him crawl in the bed with me, or hold him, until he calms down and goes back to sleep. 

The problem we are having now, is we've had storms almost every day for the past week. This has caused him to be completely on edge. For example, he heard my wife close the car door in the garage, and started yelling about thunder, and covering his ears. We had a break yesterday and it was a nice sunny day. Then today the clouds came back and he was immediately on edge again. His therapist texted us and told us he has had two meltdown and starting yelling in class today. Any thoughts or ideas you might have would be greatly welcome.

autism,SatchelDuck,2018/02/27,"Is it possible to be misdiagnosed with Autism? So here's the quick capture, I was diagnosed as a child at age 6, when I first get into elementary school I could not sit still, throw a lot of tantrum, and no, it is a legitimate tantrum for attention rather than autistic meltdown. Very impulsive and I had a history of running off the class to 'explore the whole school' and a lot of odd and disruptive behaviours. But I got good grades and was seen as pretty smart back then. 

Then I was diagnosed as Asperger's, put in a special ed school, for a long time I have questioned if it is right for me, nothing really feels helpful and I don't connect or relate to people there. Until I finally got myself into one of the most prestigious school in my country.

Until I left home at 18, I still had fairly lots of social problems back then, but I am improving fast.

Now I am studying abroad, 20 y/o in the UK to be exact. I have a fairly active social life and I am not afraid to meet new people. There are some difficult behaviour that I still do, but it's mostly impulse control, anger and self-esteem issues.

But I don't feel connected with a lot of experiences people describe here, maybe a little with social issues. But I just don't have 'the processing', which can be positive even if the other downsides are coped. I don't have details-orientation, logical ability, obsessive interest which for some are blessings.

Now the social situations comes pretty easy to me, I still have anxiety issues sometimes or tendency to want to say 'things I shouldn't really say but so compelled'. Generally I know what's appropriate and what's not, and I do seem to read cues well enough.

I also don't have sensory issues or stimming. My childhood tantrums never involves stimming or anything to begin with. And I feel like this is a big flag that I may not that close to the spectrum. Since it seems like sensory stuff is the more fundamental one.

A bit more for my background, my parents were busy people, they worked a lot and barely had anytime for me as a child, and I could never got much of interactions or emotional support out of them because they were tired, or will just get angry and try to beat me sometimes when I tried to ask for it. I grew up mostly with the computer screen, and they can be harsh and critical with my accomplishment, with occasion physical abuses. Some could be just disciplining, but sometimes he'd just hit me for the sake of it.

 But not to sound like an edgy teenager, they do love me as the feeling go, but they have their fair share faults. And we could have a good time as long as I look happy to them.

Due to how medical system works in my country where it deals with separate hospital, and in a third world country sense where things are much looser. I am pretty much free from any kind of 'official' Asperger's diagnosis now. I could in fact join the military if I pass their psychological interview. Yes.

Although I have a big, insecurity from the history of it. Nothing feels right, it just feel like a big, weird lies.

Here in the UK, I am free of the diagnosis too.

Then I've got to to talk with a psychotherapist in case she could have some insight into my anger and self esteem issues, along with my family relations. I mentioned that I was diagnosed with Asperger's and my feeling uneasy with it. And she told me she's worked with adult patients with Asperger's patients, while this is not her expertise. I do not seem to have it.

Nor the teacher where I was very close with in my previous school (not the special ed one) told me that he's been teaching for nearly 30 years, and I didn't seem to have it in his opinions. When I expressed the concern

Later on, my psychotherapist gave me a contact for an expert in neurodiversity/learning difficulties conditions that worked with adult with autism. I immediately contacted her for reassessment, it was very expensive to get it done in diagnostic procedures. But she is willing to give me questionnaires of EQ and AQ, along with ADHD screeners.
She's a clinical psychologist I think.

The result, I scored 12 in AQ, 40 in EQ. And later on my own accord, I scored 27 in RAADS-r. None of which above the threshold.

She told me that while occasionally she will be making extra initial interview in some cases that falls below the threshold, it would not be helpful for me to pursue further in the assessment because it is very unlikely for me to get a positive result anyway, and it lines up with my initial concern.

Although I was suspected ADHD after our talk. But no formal process is made, and I will have a trouble paying for it. Anyway.

So now I am left without a diagnosis, just like before. I could just forget about it and live my life, and better try to sort of my current problems that may be caused of something else.

**But like many of the 'Am I autistic?' threads, undiagnosing myself is equally unreliable as self-diagnosing. So I don't know how much the claim that, 'I am NT (or other conditions)'would be valid. Especially here it is well known that people could have ADHD and autism co-morbidity. But I don't feel autistic or a kind of disconnection from NT socializing.**

**And since people here are saying autism is lifelong, have I just coped and in denial of my condition?**

And I don't think I could easily get it from NHS service either, it is filled with people who has legitimate concern, my GP refused to make a referral at this point. And I can't wait years to finally get it done.

Any opinions? Especially in autism community it is viewed that misdiagnosis is nearly impossible",5.316676127404606,6.692833910122987,6.19419564806055,75.75505380006308,68.46073793755913,9.459471460107222,31.028054241564174,9.758511708439896,3.0425879255755275,4421,179,803,101,75,1459,418,1057,0.08900000000000001,0.795,0.117,0.9888,2,0,1,0,2,0,129.0,2,0,9,9,47,38,5,3,54,1,102,9,0,10,4,181,147,86,0,18,44,1,8,6,0,8,8,4,1,5,51,63,0,4,23,1,4,10,27,14,2,5,26,16,111,26,134,93,27,105,1,0,4,1,62,50,0,34,49,607,162,19,0.0,0.05515187256428099,0.0,0.0,0.16782526798168046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03722448907791747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330859195070004,0.0,0.03560915983735757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03830511018926791,0.0,0.04351617865844611,0.0,0.0,0.07158521270938432,0.0,0.0567505646827297,0.0,0.03960899437598238,0.0,0.0,0.04116800105913295,0.05081845613998208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04781770853634983,0.0,0.040097056078246485,0.0,0.0,0.05220763864641423,0.3344837448366973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04798903470734432,0.0,0.18898131756415776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526971014948002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038884954521991116,0.05236033368847126,0.0,0.0480966178910516,0.0,0.030744573053838986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04553296184599928,0.04388139460032887,0.0,0.1882888948546632,0.06650792659596068,0.0,0.10198231008829316,0.0,0.039593779790391616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14591672836409206,0.04465316742338491,0.02645435105584809,0.07808465534635384,0.14891503257613245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049551305129921716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0624004042583397,0.0,0.04669152746487011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24292055098423115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694534107448573,0.05116322354661499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114926740691332,0.0,0.06575658215145795,0.13644626708525034,0.04665341269932852,0.04110281441802365,0.08238718602084262,0.03908867040222395,0.0,0.0,0.19786759879478436,0.042011466690298364,0.04404492625861087,0.062142420252904326,0.047192455121400016,0.04676381078587348,0.0,0.0,0.04689230145410954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13687280199861473,0.0,0.07180150997732948,0.04495643335530587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932829150180177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462656710926076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05168614302042894,0.0,0.0,0.22589408240304676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04400298873909488,0.052475975130848215,0.0,0.14206841920820704,0.0,0.08908046733137387,0.0,0.04679368500971905,0.05214451148067548,0.0,0.046560684475719975,0.0,0.059639794083943265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07950362546785812,0.0,0.11105072340949364,0.0,0.2355457502034777,0.0,0.1695025240084741,0.14567942232781916,0.0,0.0,0.07701011865450615,0.05232200109034752,0.0,0.2372495683860875,0.0,0.035834992200824985,0.13811174749999308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14869345250881014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0532864241154012,0.0,0.05282221853146115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07482717969089031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06184896252005704,0.05965227039645901,0.0,0.0,0.05428512877099799,0.05350017954306871,0.0,0.13343607829470988,0.0,0.09480928856628593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153628189717322,0.027455268264007453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370464244915582,0.0,0.0,0.051969277814598605,0.0,0.0448706956651967,0.0,0.13555024951100753,0.0,0.0,0.0661328522314761,0.0,0.0,0.05995088493983559
autism,Twonicklesonedime,2018/02/27,"Should I say something to my mother in law I have worked with adults with (dis)abilities in a day program and I am concerned about my non biological nephew displaying signs of being on the spectrum or having a possible speech problem. He's still very young (approaching 2) and I know my no means it is my place to diagnosis and it's still very young . My main concern is that he isn't going to get early intervention if he is on the spectrum. I may be even thinking this because of my work experience. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with having the ""A word"", besides the way society treats people. 

Some of the signs I have seen are:
- He's non verbal (no regression, but no babbling, can hear certain sounds because he runs when the toilet is flushing or the coffee machine goes on, sounds he makes are ""eee"" or just yelling and sometimes the cause is unknown) 
-Stimming was the main red flag for me that he's been displaying for a long time  (when he plays he will spin objects and will do so endlessly, loves to looking at spinning things like ceiling fans, he also does flapping once in a while but it's not that much to be honest) 
-Eye contact (has improved drastically improved, but only with a few people for a few seconds)
-Play (does it alone, kind of like he's in his own world and does not interact or look back that much, the only time he takes interest in playing around me is if I spin objects, I brought my nephew over to play and he wanted nothing to do with him besides screaming more than usual, he does enjoy being chased around only with few people) 
-Gestures (does not respond to pointing, does not point to objects himself, no waving, no moving his head to say yes or no, does gesture to be picked up but only by a few people or if coffee is being made)
-Interactions with others (smiles but only with that few people, does not respond to his name or names) 
- Facial expressions (very late to start smiling) 

When I say he only likes a few people, it's only 5. He's around me on average 3 days a week and I try to interact with him but he has little interest besides if I'm making coffee or spinning objects. He has little interest in a lot of people that he sees quite often too.

I know I've pointed out certain things but he does have a lot of positives and is super adorable and has a lot of great qualities too. I know he's still very young and developing, but my main concern that I should say something is because of the stimming. 

I just hope he gets early intervention if my hunch isnt wrong because society is shitty and I've seen it first hand numerous times with the adults in the day program. I can't tell you how many times I went home crying because of the way some of the staff/parents/people in general. Or how many times I've wanted to punch strangers in the face because they would stare and give disgusting looks to the adults in the program when we went outside.

Is it appropriate to say something or not? if so when? How do I approach saying it? Am I overthinking this?

autism,amwolf79,2018/02/27,"Communication for young adult with autism I work as a home based (teaching skills for home and community living) technician for a 19 year old young lady with autism. She has some verbal communication- can answer simple questions, but generally with ""yes"" or ""no"" responses. Her parents would like her to be able to communicate with more information or detail when spoken to and for her to be able to express her emotions in some way. She has outbursts and her parents sometimes know the cause, but often not. They would love for her to be able to tell them how she is feeling so they can better help her and maybe prevent or lessen the outbursts. These outbursts and unexpected behavior cause them to avoid taking her out of the home regularly.

autism,georgelass,2018/02/28,"Ways you have learned how to respond to others and show interest in I work with a student is very bright and talkative but he often does not respond if he is not interested. For example, when people leave and say goodbye, he often will just ignore them instead of saying goodbye. In general he is very expressive but only if he's interested in talking with you in that moment. How can I encourage him to say goodbye to his mom when she leaves for work or respond the first timewhen I ask him what he would like to eat? 

Behavior management strategies would encourage us to wait until he says goodbye and praise him. However I know he is more motivated to play than talk and this would be awkward. This is a more casual setting so I do not want to implement a reward system. I just want to know what I can do to naturally encourage his response. I would appreciate your suggestions.",5.383662674650698,6.860080694610781,6.5129491017964085,73.15509231536926,68.40119760479043,10.11756487025948,34.275948103792416,10.317481424215053,3.905100199600797,704,34,122,19,12,236,96,167,0.08,0.6920000000000001,0.228,0.9873,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,1,3,1,6,10,14,0,1,4,0,16,1,0,3,0,34,22,16,0,8,10,1,0,1,0,5,0,4,0,0,6,7,1,2,4,3,0,0,3,2,0,1,0,5,19,12,21,16,2,12,1,0,1,0,36,4,0,5,6,92,25,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14624949850109445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369009646717448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16007631754910867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306707106699595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17194974411981193,0.0,0.0,0.3312929685215333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07642827238343736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18321965551085306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11897903192897748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845521722954582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4976268017250005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514797448079684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18817704973849786,0.0,0.0,0.25815738415519723,0.18454374159734568,0.12417412495301434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22777914586987036,0.0,0.0,0.4445195681915941,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,oceanfrankie,2018/03/01,"Diagnosing an older brother with autism?? Hi all, I've been very hesitant to bring this issue to the very surface for a long time, and i'm not sure whether I should at all.

My brother is 22 (two years older than me), but I've always felt as if he's been my younger brother. This has generated a lot of problems for me growing up, and I feel that this has almost reached boiling point for me at the moment. My family have always known my brother as being 'different' but now that he's an adult with very poor communication and social skills, I'm worried that he's going to be stuck in a child's mindset for the rest of his life without anyone helping him. He was 'almost' diagnosed with aspergers when he was younger, due to his lack of auditory processing (he also used to hand flap a lot), but our school was in a small village, and knowledge of this kind of thing was almost non-existent in the schooling system, which I think is unacceptable.

My brother has never had any kind of romantic relationship, he told me once he almost got with a girl one night, but after being in her presence for about 2 hours, he told her that he loved her! There's definitely a barrier when talking to him, he doesn't seem to understand sarcasm often, or offer up conversation when with another person. He is very kind-hearted, but this has also worried me as in the past people have exploited this- asking him for money, lifts and odd jobs etc. Myself, my friend and my brother recently went to a concert in London and I had to constantly be on the lookout, he got lost about 3 times and looked completely overwhelmed by the people and could never seem to 'let go' or speak his mind. When we were younger, he'd talk constantly, but only around immediate family. I currently live away from home, at university, and whenever we talk via social media I can't help but get impatient at him sometimes when he messages me the most basic, simple statements that barely constitutes a conversation. He doesn't seem to realise sending me the message 'watching lion king again' two days in a row isn't the best method of communication for a 22 year old to have. I guess I've just been upset that I've never had that intrinsic, yet grown-up communication siblings are supposed to have as you age, but no one else has recognised this or offered him help. 

My mother has always brushed this under the rug, we've had several other family issues regarding multiple divorces, a stepdad who has had a history of gaslighting and apathy. Consequently, this is an issue which no one will take lightly if it's brought up. Although I do love my family, I'm highly intuitive and aware of all these issues which have shaped myself (I have anxiety and depression) and my brother. I don't know what to do. Often I consider just leaving the country when I can afford to do so, just so I don't have to carry this burden of wanting my brother to function well.

Apologies for the rant all and sorry if my response to this seems apathetic, but I think I'm just frustrated because I do care. 

EDIT: also, I'm aware I will not find my 'answer' on reddit, i'd just be interested to know if anyone has been in a similar situation or whether I am possibly blowing this out of proportion.",9.134751152073733,7.197992493548392,9.356359447004609,67.4209677419355,61.16129032258064,12.341013824884794,39.56221198156682,11.062562989136584,4.361592165898618,2566,108,457,54,28,857,296,620,0.134,0.802,0.065,-0.9905,4,0,1,0,1,0,66.0,3,1,0,4,26,17,1,2,30,0,57,7,1,1,8,94,94,50,0,9,27,9,3,0,1,3,3,2,2,4,28,24,1,1,17,1,2,7,14,7,1,5,23,9,55,10,75,60,11,66,0,3,2,2,71,26,0,22,32,325,83,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743186940898916,0.0,0.0,0.1643066944274992,0.17095960218149633,0.0,0.0,0.04657339711010145,0.07181441920275823,0.05239224221425734,0.0,0.0,0.09577517649832552,0.0,0.0,0.06096780424483119,0.0640259467767715,0.0,0.06434563703163207,0.0,0.0,0.041748939658135024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187270925966457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0698268938849037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07180714470892198,0.1480198790135598,0.0,0.05468116585812749,0.0,0.0,0.04416834355583321,0.0,0.058987611639514215,0.13902539415439305,0.0,0.0715541671188802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0572119635821691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638092600843788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25825317587952823,0.0,0.03462900216734088,0.0,0.06575810289447201,0.0,0.06259572751683001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0529127597369299,0.0,0.03578154520953358,0.0,0.0778452945517087,0.0,0.10955035855532436,0.0,0.07544597131676417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115723061413672,0.13771584793503142,0.07236010260310642,0.0686978807550168,0.0,0.06744573800605536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28592985409635263,0.06796261720773784,0.0,0.0,0.213955502502042,0.07527714814838951,0.0,0.0,0.07251767078681502,0.0,0.07003243011017123,0.048374277784091466,0.0,0.0,0.06047513107617776,0.060608694856466076,0.05751169353336137,0.0,0.0747614719280018,0.11645011800063985,0.12362408709823973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915218113053467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15846381040427324,0.0,0.0,0.06427025632115813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186541383579703,0.07293624535379954,0.1392253579285784,0.05208732504323426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06537843457245697,0.09496029780847594,0.05980006368427826,0.0,0.0,0.0647421970835517,0.07720861744680699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06553265286658487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06762248840558571,0.07352923156493445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386246690858778,0.0,0.2493913738583433,0.0,0.07737063087058266,0.0,0.0,0.07698207334238369,0.0,0.13962740945178442,0.0,0.0,0.06773523217718752,0.07666540599380091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06454803258294649,0.0,0.05149357750882018,0.16514137403750384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04549961077222386,0.08776719848253438,0.0,0.0,0.07987044985595282,0.0,0.0,0.13088421380094406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338033748255089,0.07129721177222605,0.0,0.059150637179351574,0.0,0.2260352494518471,0.0403953104065157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06157789065628527,0.06348798327095695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06601886611059292,0.0,0.0,0.13910341312399527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08820655413025938
autism,FaustoFax,2018/03/01,"Question about looping anxiety and aversion hi friends,
Does anyone else experience this weird anxiety aversion where you'll avoid doing something because you're behind schedule which in turns makes you even more anxious because now you're even farther behind which makes the aversion to doing the task even worse and now you're in a circle of bad decisions. I'm able to see it happening but unable to take action to stop it. Anyone have any tips/links/something to read more into it. I apologize if it isn't the right place for it or if it doesn't make sense",7.709654088050313,7.8743679528301875,6.996226415094341,76.3693710691824,62.867924528301884,9.330817610062894,35.59119496855346,8.841846274778883,3.0927345911949686,457,19,78,6,6,141,69,106,0.191,0.7709999999999999,0.038,-0.8831,0,1,2,0,0,0,6.0,0,2,0,0,7,4,0,1,4,0,6,0,0,3,0,14,14,6,0,2,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,3,0,2,2,1,0,1,2,3,0,0,0,1,3,1,13,13,2,12,0,0,1,0,6,7,0,4,4,48,12,1,0.17521673854523773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915339064874593,0.0,0.2680806507956071,0.1979450410943488,0.0,0.2450312351658453,0.17953025479578827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14629865787721508,0.21362099502841475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153333348665702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.146371101733729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3471870099021348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1713955917533498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13537201755613806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15494358323338836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35087560067765683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830641987979951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962828474050824,0.0,0.17526415468310272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14963413734963876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139625055232941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26978081129491605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14648903911001265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317411813938552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905854967841508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17856082576235402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm taking a class that is covering educational strengths and challenges for children, young adults, and adults on the spectrum, and right now we are talking about experiences in high school and college. My issue, however, is that I work really young children and don't know high school or college students with autism.

autism,Sophistacatedgamer,2018/03/01,"I am so depressed at how people treat the idea of autism. Anyone else feel the same way? I am so tired of having to hear autism used as a derogatory slur, meant to describe anything inferior or generally undesirable. I saw a post on the front page that featured an article about a young Autistic boy in school who was arrested. I found people in the comments posting things like “This Autist got what he deserved”, “Tard’s fault”, etc. Is there not one place where I can avoid this stigma and not have to be put down wherever I go! I hear this stuff way too often, and may even hear that talk maybe two or three days in a row. I mean what even compels other people to act that way.  It’s incredibly demeaning to have to hear this, and I feel like a second class citizen and a degenerate whenever I’m exposed to it. I just want one place where people are even remotely understanding and accepting of who I am.",6.446271186440676,6.279538740112997,6.846333333333334,77.50339830508476,65.55367231638418,10.469830508474576,31.824293785310736,10.125756701596842,2.9328015819209043,715,25,142,15,10,233,113,177,0.126,0.8079999999999999,0.065,-0.8985,0,1,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,0,13,8,0,1,11,0,12,1,0,3,0,27,28,11,0,1,5,0,2,2,0,1,1,4,0,2,16,5,0,1,8,0,0,4,2,4,0,5,5,7,11,4,18,21,3,21,0,2,1,0,11,10,0,4,4,96,27,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368857064979221,0.1226344094628046,0.09849295314817368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718880142645873,0.0,0.1030870228517365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998389209637024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334836594671368,0.2371582103581131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12103560861468035,0.08550506793782081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312316173059185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06802139835219681,0.0,0.09572535657846186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5395878999512053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351130836958133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694693584283188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12024259431718198,0.1303752234094258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16220725284979806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3319061110666348,0.0,0.2500967866269665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2292558689720951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031940914724047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12113055633784588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13701402366158366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09620060961957108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07951533016941767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13756364754253314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691769826663807,0.12459933696154465,0.0,0.10337192703896377,0.0,0.0,0.0705950312487303,0.2850080795631124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,redditisgreat316,2018/03/02,"Free baseball card collection for someone with special needs I have my childhood baseball card collection I am ready to get rid of.  I never really had interest in them.  I looked in to selling them and they aren't worth very much.  I think the whole collection at full highest possible price sold by each individual card would only bring $100.  Sold as bulk its worth less then $20.  I was just going to throw them away and I thought somewhere out there some kid might want them?  If anyone has or knows of someone who could possibly benefit from these in any way, please let me know and I will just send them to them free of charge.  I would prefer to give them to someone with special needs if anyone out there wants them, but anyone who would appreciate them would work. If I get more then one response, will probably give them to who would want them most? Maybe no one wants them...? They have been in storage non smoking home. Thanks so much

autism,lilith_in_leo,2018/03/02,"/vent post/ sorry if this is annoying or not welcome sometimes it feels like the whole world just doesn’t care about us and would rather we just not exist. it’s overwhelming. i know, rationally and objectively, that this isn’t true. mostly because i know there are so many of us, and my life is full of fellow autistic people, and i am honestly v thankful for that. but the outer non-autistic world at large is so messed up. to me, it often feels like life is just layer upon layer of fake social junk, a labyrinth of bullshit, and i can’t deal. it feels like this world actively hates the truth and does all it can to suppress it. 

idk. this isn’t a constructive feeling or post. just need to vent. hope everyone is having a good day. //:",2.2754166666666684,4.71825626388889,3.149833333333333,89.57850000000002,80.1111111111111,6.062222222222222,22.1,7.3011,0.8149116666666663,578,18,115,8,15,183,91,144,0.142,0.6659999999999999,0.192,0.738,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,3,0,0,0,10,16,2,1,6,0,14,2,0,0,3,33,25,12,0,5,11,0,4,3,1,1,2,0,0,0,12,7,0,1,6,0,0,0,6,5,0,0,0,4,9,11,12,24,4,11,0,1,0,0,7,8,0,6,4,78,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980494010719752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639918326116601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10373148797197833,0.16582376360069082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407562304354275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15369394861335486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3253115360563464,0.3447223339043173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349088547827528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15880078455375066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15975502226046095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17679201797207156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2272186552692631,0.2357417030299065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630712217803706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11926426424917805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115094227779172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3080894116155128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1639608572347449,0.0,0.0,0.15907946407329426,0.18005240856859142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480841365187867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38695260094274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1795772990930312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11425941906884612,0.0,0.0,0.0

DH has adult-onset ASD with aspie tendencies (mostly, an obsession with music) and he has identified that CBT would be helpful in his therapy.  Namely, identifying patterns so that he can trace them back and learn to change them.  He’s accomplished this with smaller habits but is struggling with the larger ones.

DH has PTSD from military service as well.  He is having a hard time locating a book/workbook that does not include DBT (which is contraindicated for him).

autism,OsiViper,2018/03/03,"Clarification of diagnostic criteria One of the diagnostic criteria for ASD is ""Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus"". I read one thing that kind of clarified that as being interests restricted to 1 or 2 things with the exclusion of others. Like being interested in something and unable to focus on anything else.

And I always too this to be over a long period. But is it possible that it can be short lived interests also? There are times when I find something that interests me that I just have to research or do to the point that nothing else matters, it's all I can think about, even at work. Even my previous interests kind of ""fade out"". And this may last for a while, or it could be a couple of hours. But during this time, it seems like nothing else matters.

Is this what the diagnostic criteria means? Or is it like restricted interests over a long period of time?

autism,TheCoquer,2018/03/03,"Constantly surrounded by people and going insane. I (18M) was kicked out of my house on Wednesday and am currently in a center for people who have no where else to go. While I do have my own room, I am losing my mind by the fact that there are people here all the time. The people in charge here bring dinner to my door but I don’t even eat breakfast or lunch because I have to go to the kitchen myself which my social anxiety prevents me from doing. I really feel a mental breakdown coming due to having no alone-time whatsoever.

autism,UK-Nomad,2018/03/04,"Can hypnotism bring back sensory issues that have gone dormant? PTSD from abusive parents. Weird question but i have only been diagnosed recently(29 years) so i feel like i have to learn everything about myself again and i have no one to ask...

My question is: Can sensory traits i remember as a child be almost remembered from hypnotism that have now ceased? Basically i used to be very sensitive to touch/hearing whilst a child. Growing up in a very aggressive and loud household my parents used to beat/hit(punch,Slaps, kick) me frequently and i think they literally made parts of my autism 'switch off' through trauma or some mechanism that severally altered this part of my head. When i used to get hit i would feel the pain but a kind of magnified effect after that made it so much worse, almost like it was layered slaps over the course of a couple of minutes from only 1 initial hit. At the point of the hit my mind would go blank(I can only describe it as a blank white screen...) so i cannot remember what my brain did but i can only see fragments of before and after of being hit usually me running to hide under my bed or somewhere dark and quiet. If i try to remember now i literally can only see 'White' and a terrible feeling of fear. I am starting to think this is some form of PTSD(from what i have read) and my mind doing what it can to forget the memories to avoid any stress.
Should i go back to my diagnosis assessor and talk to them about this? I didn't even mention it as it's really something i don't like talking about.",5.0523376623376635,6.339279313131312,5.698778258778262,79.39515151515155,69.0,9.158826358826357,31.31457431457432,9.48565724429506,2.900493795093796,1224,51,228,26,21,397,161,297,0.138,0.813,0.049,-0.9796,2,1,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,2,1,13,12,1,3,12,0,28,4,2,6,0,43,51,21,0,4,6,2,3,3,0,3,2,2,1,2,16,8,0,1,13,1,0,6,4,8,0,1,7,10,32,4,41,34,6,26,0,0,5,0,12,7,0,9,16,161,48,2,0.0,0.1085681005820483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18351101109634624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06231242258003523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566289124689404,0.0,0.0,0.14091761915357334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07797148284227988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229082919523406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138828475170727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09300383531638012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06052160596670466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235229927361952,0.0,0.0,0.10311068157542667,0.13899460746712108,0.06546141525619004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047873569548558856,0.0,0.10415235286586592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404014401105873,0.0,0.1032751287081826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09563926512908033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541989284650647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13429926637296594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17340749323063734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850429730410373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735954485050635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062091736738271876,0.3484486434911249,0.09750215806785853,0.0,0.20349141790606468,0.19845552555280307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662119136152079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2142241600194231,0.0,0.2052960417848889,0.0,0.09165609144888484,0.0,0.058701353750513524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4152015778539056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14603655669495375,0.0,0.0,0.10351728122160088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07054224737485673,0.0,0.0,0.0648571020259306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049633385110074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14729952752706668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.117427267493084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062211634278176726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23742005491362386,0.10091892556138274,0.15121082909767253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09338011759937233,0.1301844854764677,0.0,0.0,0.059007549549154006
autism,whytehorse2017,2018/03/04,Autistic-type developmental coordination disorder gene? I'm trying to identify the genes which could cause developmental coordination disorder(dyspraxia). One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21473668) hinted at MAP2K5 and CHD6. Several studies have linked MAP2K5 polymorphisms to restless leg syndrome. It kinda makes sense. This gene is responsible for growth factor stimulated cell proliferation and DCD is thought to be caused by immature neurons. Is this the right gene? Are there others? What would be possible ways to increase growth factor stimulated cell proliferation?,11.577777777777774,16.696640419753088,8.838135802469136,46.12461111111114,64.55555555555556,11.635061728395062,38.96419753086421,10.577609850970193,6.484628641975307,498,25,51,17,10,146,62,81,0.054000000000000006,0.7829999999999999,0.163,0.8299,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,2,0,9,2,2,5,0,12,12,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,7,7,1,6,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,28,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5792808021657323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22511419810218608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3231392211425567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882038692070415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910566725838706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31785635383509353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407838295988973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3185233389185805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2238368710897523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19142559808392173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2237988515070484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2002892488095461,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,linckwork,2018/03/04,"New blood test can detect autism in children Scientists have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children.

Researchers at the University of Warwick said the test, believed to be the first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives.

ASDs mainly affect a person’s social interaction and communication, with symptoms that can include speech disturbances, repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty adapting to new environments.",19.70594202898551,15.445751043478264,16.635217391304355,30.41702898550727,44.0,20.092753623188408,62.18840579710145,17.122413403193686,10.171814492753622,504,29,55,18,3,158,65,92,0.08900000000000001,0.8759999999999999,0.035,-0.4767,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,1,5,0,8,4,3,2,0,8,10,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,2,1,1,12,4,2,11,0,0,0,0,9,5,0,0,5,37,5,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18911124804699755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785155286664797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3947463625552313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2833184961684476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21027255754581656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25742610225395185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21828665906017586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18172421455513046,0.0,0.0,0.4775045105469947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158499846289524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.235148688317662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25199449906164306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569407835324292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,TheBatJeff,2018/03/05,"My son  So my wife, son and I just got back from an appointment where my son (2 yr old) was diagnosed with Autism. The developmental pediatrician said he seems to be high-functioning, with the biggest being not understanding societal interactions and stuff like that, that it would become clearer where on the spectrum he falls as he gets older, but she wanted to get into groups, and support programs and what not sooner than later. I am absolutely floored at the absolute number of programs, groups, and events that are around to talk, and help with this sort of thing. Me being a big user of Reddit, this was my first thought of where to go.

 I make jokes when I get a bit nervous, so of course when my I heard the diagnosis I uncontrollably said ""See? I knew we shouldn't have gotten those vaccines."" Which I then had to clarify as a joke. Anyways, this obviously doesn't cause me to love my son any less, in fact it's quite the opposite. We now have a name to go with what has been going on with him, and resources to help. I just wanted to know if anyone had any tips or maybe things to expect with having an autistic child.

 Now, I know every child is different so no one can really comment on how my son will specifically be, and that's fine, I just mean are there any standard things that get experienced, I also know there is a social stigma around autism, a few tips would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Edit: So it's been a few hours and I'm starting to break down a little bit. I just feel like he's condemned to a life of judgement from everyone, won't be able to live a ""normal"" life, and will just lose out on so much.

autism,myokoe,2018/03/05,"Being quiet makes everyone ignore me This has been one of my biggest barriers to socializing normally it seems. Talking doesn't really come naturally to me, and I'm easily overwhelmed in even small groups of people. Typing is much easier. I never knew why this was since I wasn't diagnosed as a kid/teen. Even though I was actually mute for a period. But when you're quiet around people, there's some NT unspoken magic that makes most of them ignore you, even if they're super talkative with everyone else. Which makes it nearly impossible for me to speak. I'm constantly confused and questioning what they want, or just oblivious and in my own world. People question if I'm mute or talk to the person next to me about me like I'm stupid. And I end up baffled because I had no idea I was doing anything wrong, or didn't see the signal that I was supposed to be talking. Or if I talk I just get laughter or blank stares, obviously encouraging me not to do it again.  Yet if an extrovert talkative person comes up and tries to have a conversation with me it's possible to converse normally, well sort of normally from my perspective. I'd compare it to a person with a broken leg, and either making them crawl up the stairs themselves or helping them up.

autism,daddyssgrl,2018/03/05,"I’m a one on one para and my student attacked me and.. I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid it will happen again, it happened the last two times I saw him. 
He is a freshman (14yo) and has a severe case of autism and he doesn’t talk much outside of the cartoons/commercials he has Memorized due to his echolalia.
He is 6 feet tall and weighs at least 250 or more, I am a small 4’11” female. 
The first time was about two weeks ago and he was working on something, I was not talking to him or even facing him when he randomly grabbed me by my hair and pulled me down and was jerking me. I was off of work for about a week because I was at a conference and on my first day back I saw that he was upset and acting a little strange.Towards the last 30 minutes of school the teacher assigned something and I asked him “hey can you read this” when he grabbed me by my shirt collar and tried to pull me over the table but another para and the teacher grabbed him and he was rocking me back-and-forth. This was on Monday and he messed me up pretty bad I didn’t go to work all week because of it. After that happened The teacher asked him if he wanted to take a break and he went to our quiet area and started crying hysterically saying “No more ms.abc!” ”Bye ms. Abc””ms.abc hospital” 
Tomorrow will be my first day back and I am afraid and I don’t know what to do or if I should re-introduce myself slowly and have someone else work with him since he is a student who needs a one on one. 

He’s not really bad with transitions. I’m not sure if anything is going on at home. Admin doesn’t help much and all of our special ed coordinators and most of the higher ups are spread very thin I’m kind of on my own. 

If anyone can give advice or tips or share similar stories I’d appreciate it.

autism,jmarcstone,2018/03/06,"Scared of going to college and wasting all my time and money I am transferring to a university out of state through a program that will match my tuition closer to the in-state tuition since it is much cheaper to study there than in my home state. While I am excited to finally become fully independent and to get to know another state and area I am extremely nervous that I am going to waste my time and money knowing how screwed the academic system is. I was always against it but I have found myself with no choice because my other choices are trade school, which I would hate. I have low spatial ability and would hate working such mudane and repetitive jobs. I do think that my mind alligns more with a student, but I am fearing that it will be a bad move.

I’m a highly creative person who has to find a way to make a living in things that I am not the most interested and cut out for, but I feel as if I have no choice. I do like maximizing my options, but the academic system rips everyone off and I do not come from a family of means. To top it off I am majoring in a social science (Political Science), which is an extremely unmarketable degree with quite little value. I’m treating school as an investment and I would hate to find myself broke and unemployed after I get my degree. While I do have a passion for the subject I study, I am a realist first, and I realize that having autism and not having a financial fallback through my family means that every decision will have a large impact.

I realize that without the trade or education options I am left to work in the unskilled labor world, which is probably more miserable for me than the comfortable salaries that the former can produce, but of course extra skill and luck is needed.

For all students out there, I would like some thoughts and advice.

autism,fridgekitchen,2018/03/06,"Combating loneliness What do you do to combat loneliness, /r/autism?

I understand these thoughts are irrational but that doesn't stop them being there. Any tips on how to get out of this hole fellow autists?",5.743478260869567,7.364114072463771,5.354318840579712,81.25408695652175,67.69565217391305,9.577971014492757,32.64057971014493,9.888512548439397,3.2798962318840585,297,13,54,7,5,91,56,69,0.17,0.772,0.058,-0.5897,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,1,1,0,6,3,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,3,0,12,14,6,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,4,2,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,7,1,9,9,2,6,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,38,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23901469959654706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2142555812983464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18363090970450166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39647852362431374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1717126777138856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30689395973333616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2938484040314216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22521065545359975,0.0,0.5580629555339823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3658973300471121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,athea_,2018/03/06,"Adult Resources I am trying to figure out how to find an adult group home or residence for my brother (23). He is very hostile (and sometimes violent) toward my mom so moving back home isn’t the best option. He is not doing well on his own with family support. 

We have tried community living supports, with no true support. We are in Kentucky. All I can find in this area are nursing homes and inpatient psychiatric facilities. Or group homes for troubled teens. 

Any tips? 

If this is not the appropriate place, please let me know.

autism,dijete_u_vremenu,2018/03/06,"Some questions for people on the spectrum Hello everyone! 

I work with one children with autism (14 years old) in regular school. I am his personal (and educational) assistant. I am on this board because I want to understand more about experience of people on the spectrum and to learn/get some material that will help me to be better on my job. 

This are some questions:

1. What books would you recommend for people with autism? He is not big reader (he chose sometimes to read for himself but not too much and to often) but i think that he could learn a lot about social relationships and world from books. I think that I should start with something easy (like ""five friends"" or even something easier... dunno. what do you think?). It should be popular book that is translated in many languages because we don't live in english country. 

2. He doesn't talk to much. I respect that, because if people are asking to much questions (and boy, they sometimes do) he get overwhelmed. But sometimes, he is, like awake. It is weird, honestly. For example, there is that other kid in school (not on spectrum but he definitely has some problems) that is obsessed with dinosaurs. He makes them every day (pic). And he would come to A. (kid I work with) and ask something or whatever. And every time A. would chase him away. But today, he was like, in that ""awake"" state for few minutes when that kid approached and he actually answered question. ""That is T-rex""... Also, his voice change. Usually he talks really fast and quiet but in that ""awake"" state he is much more understandable. It is a bit confusing to me. Why does it happen? How should I understand it? Does that happen to you?

What other materials would you recommend? Give some advice or anything you think it would be useful for someone like me. 

Thanks and sorry for bad english.

autism,yesinon,2018/03/06,"Legitimate concern about having aspergers I’m not exactly positive that I have it, but I’ve noticed things about me that could resemble symptoms. I sometimes silently mutter the last word of a sentence I say, but only randomly. Things often seem different even though nothing has changed in my life, like thinking about my future and such. I’ve been depressed about a lot of things, but never want to talk. Sometimes out of the blue I get the interest of hanging out, but I like being alone. At the same time, I enjoy being sad, but I know it isn’t healthy. I try to make changes but even if they are for the better, I never feel fulfilled. My mood swings rapidly throughout the day from being depressed to being absolutely pissed for no reason. I spend most of my time on the computer alone.

autism,NorthernMunkey8,2018/03/06,"Advice on meltdowns and stimming We’re currently waiting for an appointment to begin to assessment process for my girlfriends 3 year old boy (in the UK so we’ve been told there could be “quite a wait”), in the mean time I’m trying to educate myself as much as possible in order to help make life a little bit easier for us all. 

I have some experience of working with kids with autism and other special needs through my job, but this has been exclusively in school setting where they’re comfortable etc (I’m a sports coach). But from what I know through work and what I’ve read here and other website, I’m certain he will be diagnosed. 

My girlfriends son’s behaviour is becoming more and more difficult to manage. Well I say behaviour, more so the meltdowns when he is told not to do something/doesn’t get his own way (we’ve tried wording things more positively, for example, can you please put all four legs of the chair on the floor rather than stop tipping the chair on two legs... but haven’t had much success with it). We have noticed that the meltdowns occurring more often when his routine has been broken, for example, we had really bad weather here last week from Tuesday night to Friday, this meant his Mum didn’t work the days she usually does so he didn’t spend Thursday and Friday with his grandparents as he usually does, it also meant I was stuck at my girlfriends house for 2 extra days (usually I try to make sure I’m there on the same days every week). This meant his meltdowns and his behaviour got worse as the week went on. 

Over the weekend he spends it with his Dad, when we went to pick him up on Sunday evening, his dad had apparently taken his iPad off him just before my girlfriend went to the door to get him - all hell proceeded to break loose. His dads girlfriend proceeded to “talk him round” and then drove him over to my girlfriends house, it turns out the “talking round” was a bag of sweets and his iPad back, so of course when my girlfriend went to the car to get him and took his iPad off him, the meltdown began again. It continued for around 1 hour and 30 minutes.

I’ve believed for a while that some of his behaviours are often attention seeking, and Sunday night confirmed that for me - after around 20 minutes I told my girlfriend to come and sit in the living room with me (he was in the kitchen), and not acknowledge him, low and behold he did stop crying and then began to shout “mummy!” over and over, until eventually he came in the living room, with his wellies on the wrong feet, stumbling, and my girlfriend went to him to stop him - then the crying and screaming began again!

I’ve rambled a little here, but what I really want advice on is what to do during these meltdowns? I’m aware Sunday was a lot worse than usual because it had been a very bad week regarding routine, but is it as horrible as my girlfriend feels it is to ignore him while he’s having these meltdowns? (She did join me in not acknowledging it for around a week or so last month, and the meltdowns didn’t last anywhere near as long or escalate as much as they had been before). 

She also has a habit of cuddling and kissing him when he cries or has meltdowns after being told off, which I feel he doesn’t really understand that what we are saying is a negative thing, because he receives positive contact from her straight after. (His speech is limited to parroting things he has heard people say or has heard on the TV) 

Also, in regards to stimming - when it becomes self injurious, obviously the natural reaction is to say “don’t do that!” - he has recently begun finger/arm biting, hitting himself and pulling his hair, we’ve ordered a chew bracelet in hopes he will use that instead, but in the mean time or if he hits himself or something or pulls his hair, is it okay for us to tell him he shouldn’t be doing that? From that I understand, stimming is an important relief, so it seems like it could be detrimental to tell him he can’t do that? Also, are vocal stims a thing? He’s recently begun doing this really awkward, fake loud laugh when he’s excited... and with that in mind, is stimming whilst excited a thing? Or is it always because of stress?

Sorry for the million and one questions, I’ve been lurking here for a while and haven’t felt like I should post anything - but now I’ve built up the courage, it seems I have a lot of questions!",9.574325679598836,7.040174114014253,8.80720110847189,73.57746305093694,60.82897862232779,11.96838215888097,39.065848508841384,10.190243380029422,3.7813466877804167,3452,132,657,55,36,1090,343,842,0.107,0.794,0.1,-0.9071,4,0,2,2,0,0,91.0,6,1,1,6,38,28,1,2,44,1,69,11,5,4,6,115,123,74,0,9,21,5,7,2,10,4,2,10,4,3,44,43,2,7,18,5,2,14,13,11,1,4,44,18,70,17,113,66,20,132,1,1,2,2,102,44,1,20,69,449,114,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115195840167523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18854515520398846,0.04904487434190565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04850464791218463,0.15741394071704012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045323137318116304,0.09842903600212494,0.10779238638731377,0.1301947009868598,0.1003114371356646,0.0664080030914332,0.0,0.0,0.0643499342602397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741450730763386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05077373691866775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412156582583682,0.0,0.19423667609184156,0.11403909161870852,0.0,0.0,0.0598253876906901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316194225656868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06573645826968967,0.03893095944166504,0.0,0.049661590882261616,0.0,0.0,0.05765706642864357,0.0,0.0,0.05960618900176527,0.0,0.05659403482930918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09238505644321496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04714169459536319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039507909299485035,0.0,0.0,0.058543193188137686,0.05804648062807845,0.13602344181325834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05849132739608068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03239325160427615,0.14413799147685644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04163282456838783,0.05759264765806839,0.11815172156934718,0.10409459895534666,0.05216224977126227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10022159618232232,0.0,0.0,0.07868914094972722,0.0,0.0,0.1284113046835548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05951511334967626,0.0,0.0470473340155845,0.0,0.12998853880513767,0.04370511025936486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11062706996171642,0.0,0.0,0.06710641673381823,0.0618502291675407,0.0,0.039940957382228984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04086330174548149,0.0,0.0,0.06470115508004275,0.0,0.0664488023919974,0.056450613220848475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05925348353510306,0.13205815920778444,0.06269259461116028,0.058958441729737285,0.0,0.15104027631317707,0.0,0.11639719808254978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18749373865979332,0.0,0.05965294773662905,0.0,0.10731806026185448,0.06148987304954993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0453768092833704,0.0,0.06598129304276265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14783568537495526,0.06751842435711036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555260026319511,0.0,0.0,0.09475148321555513,0.10303667035428757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1957938598757628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06873968107374305,0.0,0.0,0.22528830451038065,0.06548727633712474,0.12005424701795647,0.06411250450497688,0.05757824908138085,0.122722423812783,0.14180111868226292,0.05090738742989906,0.2596673062567462,0.04863372807704893,0.034765808371264466,0.046785805851982776,0.2364005548385824,0.0,0.05299637816665426,0.2732013986356339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12873250646820267,0.0,0.1201348679649724,0.0,0.06444436102090154,0.0,0.037957031733658005

autism,SeaTurtlesCanFly,2018/03/06,"/r/SCDsupport is up and running - a new subreddit for people with social communcations disorder and their loved ones. Hello, lovely group!  

The mods here gave me the okay to post this - thank you, mods!  

Social communications disorder (sometimes called social communication pragmatics disorder) is a new diagnosis (created in 2013) that is very similar to ASD.  Previous to 2013, some of the people with a SCD diagnosis would have received an autism or a PDD-NOS diagnosis.  There isn't a lot of information out there about this diagnosis, yet, but [here](https://spectrumnews.org/news/new-diagnosis-covers-borderlands-autism-spectrum/) is one of the few articles out there that I have found about it.

My preschool aged child was recently diagnosed with this and the neuropsych that diagnosed him described SCD as ASD minus the diagnostic criteria for repetitive movements and intense areas of interest.  That said, they did note that my son does have some very deep areas of interest that he struggles to climb out of, but it wasn't as intense as an ASD diagnosis requires.

autism,MasterMatt25,2018/03/06,"Do I have autism? Hey everyone,

So for a bit of context, autism is found in my family. My brother has it, my mum believed that my grandfather had it (I never got to meet him), and I've received conflicting diagnoses when I've been tested in the past.

When I was 6 years old, my parents had me see a psychiatrist who told them that I was autistic, more specifically had Aspergers. However the following year, I had to be ""officially"" diagnosed by a specialist from Europe who said I wasn't. And his verdict I guess had more weight so I'm recognized as I guess normal (not sure what word to use here).

In terms of symptoms, I've always had a weird twitch. As dumb as it sounds, when I get very anxious or excited, i stop breathing and appear to slap myself. Meanwhile turning flush and eyes bulging out. When I do this, it's almost trance like and I don't notice myself doing it until a bit later. I'm currently 18, and I've had this twitch my entire life, however I don't do it as often anymore. 

When it comes to social interactions I usually have difficulty, especially when it comes to new people or people I only see occasionally. I have a lot of difficulty establishing eye contact, and often starting mumbling and turning to silence due to feeling overwhelmed. When it comes to being in a room with a group of people, I feel very overwhelmed and anxious, often wanting to escape to another room to calm myself down or before I feel so awkward and anxious that I say something stupid. I also feel awkward starting conversations and maintaining them afterwards. Usually after a basic small talk question, my conversations die, leading to awkward silence and myself feeling more and more anxious. I also get the sense that I can't read people well, and I'm always trying to guess what others are thinking or what they want me to say so I respond accordingly, even if it's just an opinion or easy question. I often feel paranoid and as if everyone dislikes me and wants to see me fail, and I tend to take everything as a personal attack, even if it was nothing even close to that, and I do have a few enraged/self loathing moments when I just feel angry towards life and myself. 

There's certain subjects that I become attached to and obsessed with and serve as a protection barrier I guess. For example, I like hockey, mythology and geography. And subjects similar to them I can memorize almost instantly and keep those useless facts and knowledge for years, however I zone out very easily when it comes to studying and schooling other subjects. 

So do I have autism? Am I just an overly emotional teenager with growing pains? Do I have something else wrong with me?

I greatly appreciate you for reading this, I apologize for ranting and taking up so much time. Also I'm not sure if this is the right place for me to be posting, but I feel a bit desperate because I want to know if there's a problem with me.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please respond.

autism,ScottD84,2018/03/07,"33 and realizing I may be on the spectrum. Wondering if I should even do anything about it. Hi all, 
I could probably write a book on the experiences in my life that have led me to believe I may be on the spectrum (Asperger's is the one that really seems to describe what I've experienced.) I'd consider myself high functioning, and have wound up with a decent career in IT/Development. I have some weird social issues and ticks, but nothing I've been able to workaround (I've been doing it my whole entire life, it's a lot of work but I assumed I was just slow and shy). It wasn't until discussing the different ASDs with my wife(wanted to learn what to look out for before we had a child), that she mentioned I fit a lot of the characteristics of Asperger's. 

My questions is, is it worth getting diagnosed? My entire life I've felt like I've been on a different wavelength than the majority of people, so it was definitely a profound moment when I started learning more about ASDs and reading the different stories on this sub; some of them really hitting close to home. 

I think I'm really scared to use it as an excuse... maybe not doing things I normally push through (social situations especially) because now I have something officially diagnosed . On the other hand, having something to explain difficulties I have with everyday tasks might simply be nice and may prevent me from getting even more upset or freaking out. For instance something as simple as breaking my weekly routine will make me cringe and ruin my mood for a few hours.... but if I have something that explains the behavior might make me say to myself ""This is OK"" and that alone could help cope honestly. 

Sorry if I rambled. Like I said, I could go on and on, but as a longtime reader on here, just wanted to say hello and see what everyone thought.",6.566285714285714,7.093605330434787,7.26873706004141,72.21043478260874,65.26086956521739,10.049689440993786,34.97929606625259,9.957137785484203,3.581451345755694,1449,64,251,30,21,481,186,345,0.073,0.8220000000000001,0.105,0.9026,3,1,4,0,0,0,43.0,1,0,1,1,11,11,0,2,20,1,34,7,1,4,1,62,54,25,0,9,11,0,2,2,0,7,6,3,1,1,19,17,0,1,12,2,1,3,2,5,0,1,10,8,33,5,45,30,10,30,0,1,2,0,19,17,0,17,11,188,52,6,0.10519018485737466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894530781233423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656255935300762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412296034905852,0.0,0.08950909969042563,0.11851331689953075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519574096161104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2135316467884782,0.0,0.3297040637591243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1389542500520701,0.0,0.0,0.10051372945756083,0.0,0.10289618520447004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10099907348688576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099150600464118,0.0,0.059782006163207335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050676359596493,0.11113920564372176,0.10551433209537647,0.0,0.1035911431353577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10979122372309097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2228968152243274,0.10278122191968428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833326245516618,0.0,0.0,0.17885786705826434,0.0,0.0,0.1404305304149389,0.0,0.10567767921103992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22318032613320246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030640471692597,0.10093281936562502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712795916027385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07292562950064274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134128105525634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178370809449909,0.0,0.1052186508153,0.0,0.20216257790477166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005995410931676,0.16730291404690942,0.1053137256183492,0.0,0.08382295831218346,0.09576119362710388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118238175075666,0.0,0.21445629309950448,0.0,0.3239221737226661,0.0,0.1177517999005528,0.07445415425295998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06988368474350944,0.06740162306310063,0.0,0.08350925691908717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085054599067012,0.0,0.0,0.0620438964125928,0.0,0.08437722131844684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11744108483519053,0.0,0.0,0.11407426836495475,0.07657970738522389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Is there some kind of medical test that can objectively diagnose this?

autism,madstersm,2018/03/07,"My brother was diagnosed two years ago and is now going through a difficult time. Advice? My brother (21) was diagnosed about two years ago as being on the spectrum. Before, he was diagnosed with auditory processing disorder as a child. He currently suffers from depression and anxiety. He is getting all the help he needs - he goes to a therapist, psychologist, is on meds, and goes to two different social groups (for young adults on the spectrum) per week. 

He has had about 3-4 severe manic episodes in the past 2 and a half years, where, despite the meds, he won't sleep for days, has extreme anxiety, hallucinates, can become violently angry, sobs uncontrollably, and becomes extremely obsessive. His last episode caused him to drop out of college this past spring. 

Despite the support he receives from family and therapy, he is extremely depressed. He is unable to complete school. He is barely on the spectrum, so to speak, and therefore the groups he attends are with kids who are more autistic. He doesn't identify with these people, but his social skills tend to turn away potential friends who do not have autism. He has struggled with finding friends his whole life. 

What types of resources are out there for kids similar to him? He desperately wants friends. We are in the state of Colorado. 

Additionally, is there any literature I could read on cases similar to his or on people who are ""barely"" on the spectrum? Thank you.

autism,cbraun26,2018/03/07,"Communication and Doctor's Visits (Northwestern University Design Team Survey) Hey everyone!  My name is Christian Braun, and I am a freshman design student at Northwestern University.  I am also a member of Design for America (DFA), a student organization focused on improving the community through design projects.  My DFA team is currently centering our project around reducing anxiety that people with autism experience during doctor visits, especially for those who communicate nonverbally. If you or someone close to you is on the autism spectrum and you have a few minutes to spare, please fill out this survey below and/or reply to this post with your experiences during doctor's visits.  (What was frustrating? What went well? What could be improved on?)  Thank you so much for your time and input!

autism,Luckycharms01,2018/03/08,Looking for advice. My brother is 20 and autistic. One of his repetitive behaviors is that he picks and rips his finger nails. Down to the quicks and it’s been really bad lately as all of his fingers are red from the irritation. Advice? Additional info.   He doesn’t bite his nails it’s picking and ripping. I know his fingers hurt but he does not display pain. He has severe Crohn’s Disease and has never once even complained of discomfort. He has ripped his nails so far that 80% of his cuticle is gone.  Does anyone have any advice? Doctors recommended he wear gloves but he takes them off after 10 mins and says something close to “I’m independent it’s my body” it’s a hard argument to win.  ,1.6243117744610274,4.35850204477612,3.16407960199005,85.6370978441128,88.25373134328359,5.96285240464345,23.11608623548922,7.3871296695380915,1.357248424543947,550,21,102,10,18,180,89,134,0.139,0.767,0.094,-0.5742,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,1,3,6,0,1,3,0,10,7,5,3,2,18,15,10,0,0,3,1,4,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,6,8,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,5,0,1,2,7,11,1,13,13,1,11,0,1,2,0,18,4,0,0,6,58,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.563666826003499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307536193539418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344431773122956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16054162554602278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21357422211265295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19680164896750812,0.3365223632586817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269958493283681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17224066754231251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20583440509789067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566933255669662,0.0,0.2168946179774429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16146260636484008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14829436282400502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20476664048257656,0.13029054198740764,0.0,0.20459419702095355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12317631294140888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15290482771513975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172160642289138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14802271809889248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14456689978710266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,mrsflythe,2018/03/08,"Potty training my 4 year old with ASD My 4 year old son was diagnosed in October for ASD. He will pee on the potty if I take him at school or at home but will not tell me he has to go. He’s somewhat verbal (repeats things, says thank you etc) and when we are out and about will pull me towards the bathroom when he has to go. He just won’t tell his teacher at school or me at home when he needs to go. He has no issue peeing himself and carries on like it’s nothing. 

I’ve thought about taking him hourly at home and maybe printing pics of the potty for him to point at when he needs to go? 

Can anyone give me any tips?

autism,itchytex,2018/03/08,"Ways to connect verbally with daughter, seems like a 1 way relationship My daughter is 10 and on the spectrum.  She is mainstreamed in school and loves to read.  It is very difficult to get her to talk and converse with us.  If you don't ask her open-ended questions, she will just say ""Great.""  Sometimes, very rarely, she will share something in the car on the way home from school or at supper about her day, but most times she doesn't open up to us.  

I know school is hard for her and takes a lot of her energy as she is overwhelmed by lots of people and visual stimuli and needs time to decompress when she gets home.  Given a choice, I think she would go in her room, close the door (I would like to address this too), read and not come unless she had to.

It is hard for me not to feel like the only time she comes to me or talks to me is when she wants something: snack, computer time, etc.  I've tried telling her telling her this and that I wish she would come do things with me more and she just says ""Oh.""  

I feel like I'm already losing touch with her and she's spinning toward the teen years and will want even less to do with me, and I think that will be bad for her as I feel she needs more help and work to learn to deal with others.  But I wish I had better ideas about how to get her to realize this or even want to open up.",5.368062575210587,4.524383303249099,5.158570397111912,90.96931167268353,67.95306859205776,8.397496991576414,26.76991576413959,7.03164865440522,0.8981140312876046,1033,23,244,7,15,318,138,277,0.051,0.8270000000000001,0.123,0.9635,0,0,2,0,0,0,30.0,2,1,0,3,10,12,0,1,9,0,21,3,0,1,0,61,47,25,0,11,11,2,6,4,0,7,0,2,5,0,9,25,2,0,11,2,0,5,4,4,0,0,3,8,43,8,44,36,7,29,0,2,0,1,44,13,0,9,12,162,52,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10533806692859543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892384720700175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07970177073067708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08442307265830752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466806688390613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06156122152364853,0.09841094198576318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08454568096281992,0.0,0.10645866988973496,0.1260955721918434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14479626143586954,0.13638756740457647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14961545671175358,0.0,0.05424984317572972,0.0,0.0,0.10524057425660242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17101964862092126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06398214301251436,0.0,0.1915002970405146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077582022576928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0524601198477534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18653991488109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067908445278864,0.0,0.16230655110781556,0.08615276461401797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14155882528710975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259858752700149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06617716965035664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693256335525687,0.0,0.19096365853994784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248401792814726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15182088110441033,0.0,0.2898196969323906,0.0,0.08689955506692816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469733809001144,0.09440842235218716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177103049061455,0.15344782999753726,0.16686549845418555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06341672321145342,0.1223286977349133,0.0,0.0,0.22264463916607105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06480835642077991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296436236624985,0.0,0.0,0.15752238983185265,0.16890726155318767,0.22730558316455726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2195393725049332,0.0,0.0,0.06949310307101242,0.0,0.0,0.2034276056184816,0.0,0.0,0.061470532755959005

autism,ka7ii,2018/03/08,"I’m being bullied by a teacher To start off I am 16 in high school. I am on the autism spectrum along with other co morbid conditions like tourettes and ocd. And some others. One of my teachers this year for a class of personal finance (a required course) has been taking advantage of me and forcing me into situations that cause my anxiety and paranoia to skyrocket. I have trouble communicating my thoughts and feelings and I always have. He thinks that because of this he can do whatever he wants to. He knows that I am on the spectrum and knows my struggles everyday because my parents have emailed him about it to let him know. He has forced me to move to the front of the classroom with nobody around. He has threatened to move me outside for absolutely no reason.

autism,nothing2seehere4,2018/03/08,Help. How do I stop my autistic son from harming himself. We just found out recently that our son has a.s.d. We are selling our house because my husband got a job in Nevada and we are going to move there. He has been commuting back and forth so he isn't home on the weekends. This change has caused my son to act out and throw huge fits. It takes me 2 hours to get him dressed and to school with him fighting me the whole way. He has been head butting and punching himself on the face and also clawing himself. I have remained calm and loving through it all and am at my wits end. It has really taken a emotional toll on me. Please any advice helps.

autism,Typical_Dweller,2018/03/09,"[For those of you who are autistic, or siblings of autistic people]: How is/was the transition to independent adulthood helped or hindered by your parents? I'm 35. My brother, who is autistic (""high-functioning""), is 31. He currently lives with my parents, which is fine, and is working well for them all. I live in another city. My father is retired, and my mother is approaching retirement. My parents are in good health, but they are starting to plan for their eventual, sometime death. 

My brother will eventually have to live on his own. He can live with me in my city - which he has told me he does not want to do - or he can live on his own in their city, probably in one of those arrangements where he has a roommate with similar special needs, and someone (from the province? We're in Ontario) comes by once or twice a week to check in on them, make sure they're taking care of themselves, etc.

Thing is, I have no idea how ""ready"" my brother needs to be for this phase in his life. Certain life skills, like money management and shopping and such, he just doesn't have, and my parents have not tried very hard to teach.

He can cook a couple of meals. He sometimes buys snacks. But he's never paid a bill, or had to deal with taxes, nor has he had to deal with the myriad hiccups and incidents that can happen between leaving your apartment by yourself and taking the bus to Wal Mart.

I'm afraid that by the time my parents pass, my little brother will be unprepared for life without them.

What skills will he really need? How quickly does he need to start acquiring them?",5.404435215946847,6.338699435215948,5.372523255813956,83.34994767441864,67.93687707641196,8.41202657807309,31.993521594684385,8.548686976883017,2.4213600000000004,1234,51,237,18,20,385,160,301,0.031,0.8909999999999999,0.079,0.9161,6,0,0,0,0,0,52.0,0,3,7,5,8,9,0,1,9,0,30,8,0,5,4,40,47,19,1,5,11,11,1,1,0,3,5,0,0,0,11,14,3,0,1,2,7,3,7,1,1,2,4,1,28,8,44,38,4,24,0,0,0,0,43,14,0,5,8,156,39,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211002354230002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09928404152852012,0.0,0.0,0.08388309960907887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077476434866626,0.0,0.0,0.2007862607491332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17043345641538127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086029552210695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167660625230164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861116341280219,0.0,0.08723215901691363,0.0,0.0,0.10350896998774244,0.0,0.0,0.06527086821330058,0.1028859087402138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10992866270653626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10310994857965852,0.0,0.0,0.20634429818735997,0.04757429818481732,0.09759900719206067,0.4299357375903569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500101675608569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28882019246955776,0.0751044316290613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037051028587501,0.06598630532045144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5406374317021108,0.0,0.0,0.06751010697051547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10499067371318173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06238326796418449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825086290204568,0.0,0.19261998437188865,0.0,0.13785024421276434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177824174898663,0.0,0.14643327816542254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06469405975421194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05678228415451835,0.0,0.0,0.09304948992761973,0.0,0.06611372317169757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034759905859996,0.05743646112296918,0.0,0.07811129332840383,0.0,0.08755511684702127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09386956056493014,0.0,0.07089282976023778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,arviko,2018/03/09,"[HELP!] How can i help my autistic cousin? Hello there! I'm currently babysitting my aunts child with mild autism. I was wondering what we can do in general to help him become more and more functional so it's no too late to reduce some of the less functional habits.

Right now, he usually eats frozen pizza only except for a serving oatmeal in the morning, which we put all kinds of vitamins in to compensate. His day usually consists of watching english cartoons even though we live in Sweden. He's a kind of happy and lovely kid that's joyful and can speak to a degree but I'm always scared that there are things that we can help him with right now that might not be possible in the future. I'm asking you all here if you know anything that has increased the functionality of your or if there's any proven diet/way to help him. I'll just ask some questions but please try to help aswell, we just want his best.

Should I find a way to feed him another diet? If so, how? Is there any ""meta"" diet for autism?

Should I try to talk to him a lot to help him develop his language?

Should I teach him basic morals and ethics that he won't understand is wrong?

Should I give him another medium to spend his time with so he can develop himself more? Examples: Games/puzzles that can  benefit him?

Thanks for helping him out! Much love!

EDIT: He's about 5 yrs old!",2.75,4.948255430711612,3.6456119850187285,87.94760898876403,77.08988764044943,6.968629213483148,23.414082397003746,7.976525956113202,1.2581491835205996,1068,34,213,18,25,341,151,267,0.019,0.773,0.207,0.9949,1,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,5,3,0,1,18,11,0,1,9,0,19,8,0,2,2,42,32,16,0,8,10,2,0,0,0,6,1,1,0,2,11,13,5,0,5,0,1,2,3,2,0,0,1,2,31,9,30,24,12,21,1,0,1,2,49,8,0,10,10,140,42,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08977013355641415,0.0,0.0,0.14673291322862833,0.22625660989537616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887813207722549,0.0,0.20171845464841856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191520607683719,0.0,0.0,0.1132201285035467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06957780755298014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11039472864098088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07125795458653061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09860622183621806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349447269370997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11484708681652635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5785118778569859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22469418259814886,0.05929154803354743,0.0,0.12170056674794895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526567430450626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172116551674812,0.19474338968951888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11445042910344505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930892300788203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132086361187976,0.0,0.0,0.0820524743751466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11842687764472355,0.0,0.121625714112526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084556378623257,0.12085746725186113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842688048759801,0.0,0.0,0.10801311474299699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08671500760336355,0.0,0.09932730893763614,0.0,0.0,0.07167493519523667,0.0,0.10599784750095123,0.0,0.06290943175424457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464955775491806,0.0,0.0,0.11231355492155116,0.0,0.0,0.2376432713477789,0.0,0.06363419832474684,0.17127041698986914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699820669890408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11795685019955375,0.0,0.0

autism,sillysongs321,2018/03/09,"Looking for advice about seeking assessment/ treatment for my 3.5 year old Have a 3.5 year old with ? ASD. We saw peds today who said it was questionable if he has ASD after a 1 hr assessment.

 1) Do we pay ~$3000 for a full assessment or wait ~ 1 year for a public assessment (autism funding is $22,000/ yr until 6 where we are)

2) if he does have autism he’s high functioning (has been doing well in preschool without special supports, except for a rough patch in December). I can’t imagine doing 20-30 hrs of ABA/ week for him. Having him sitting at a table one on one with a grown up seems like it would benefit him less then going to a playground and interacting with kids etc. Other then an SLP for some speech issues and OT for feeding issues/rigidity, I don’t know what we would do with the funding.  
What are people’s thoughts on treatment for high functioning ASD?

 Any feed back would be very appreciated. Thanks :)

autism,Sunburn17,2018/03/10,"Suggestions for daily activities with little brother diagnosed with ASD. Hello, straight to the point, my little brother as the title says has been diagnosed with ASD, he is past his 4 years and he doesn't use language to communicate (he only use verses). We are on list for therapies but there is a long wait for it and he does only a psychomotricity therapy right now.
He is really precious to me so wanted to know if there is some help I can give to him daily. He is really open and cuddly, just a bit lazy and not often open to new stuff.

autism,dancinjanssen,2018/03/10,"Does anyone else have phrases that rub you the wrong way due to our ASD brains being so literal? I'll start. I have quite a few, but the reason for this post is this one: ""Did I stutter?"" (I just saw it somewhere and it reminded me of its horrendous existence in today's vernacular.) When I first heard it from one of my friends, she tried explaining it to me several times and I still just completely fail to understand why it's a thing. It's supposed to mean something in the neighborhood of ""You heard me, I mean what I said"", but what does stuttering have to do with not meaning what you say? Maybe it's because I stutter anyway due to my word processing speed being slower than average, and of course I'm generally brutally honest and mean exactly what I say even if I have trouble getting it out.

autism,aggie_fan,2018/03/10,"A Description of My Eternal Friendship Struggles **Close friends** are the most important people in my life with whom I form a deep connection; basically my true family. I can be my genuine self around them. We communicate on a regular basis and they’re often in my thoughts. I yearn to form a routine around a few close friends because they literally make my life more comfortable. With them in my life, I can more easily overcome social difficulties.


Unfortunately, it is incredibly hard for me to find any level of friend. Even worse, most of my social connections are **shallow friends** instead of close friends. Shallow friends are not far from purely superficial acquaintances in my mind. I temporarily enjoy the company of shallow friends, but I never form a real connection with them.


***The Pain of Unrequited Friendship***

I want but rarely receive the same sense of bond and loyalty that I display towards close friends. Every close friend eventually abandoned me after 3-6 months. The pain of unrequited friendship is much deeper than the wasted time/energy/money. I feel like crap for weeks as if I've suffered the most extreme betrayal possible.


NTs are never direct when ending the friendship, which makes the rejection especially painful. They awkwardly beat around the bush for weeks/months until I finally see their invisible hints. Also, I’m in denial since close friends don’t betray each other. Making conversation eventually feels like I’m pulling teeth. They stop reaching out and their responses to my texts become curt and generic and delayed. The more I see them texting/socializing with others, the more pathetic I feel. The end is particularly painful since it’s not linear. Towards the end, they occasionally reach out unexpectedly which makes my day: “OMG I WAS WRONG! S/HE CARES ABOUT ME AFTER ALL! I AM NOT ALONE, THIS HAS MADE MY DAY!” Ultimately, this is false hope.


If asked, NTs would justify their indirectness as an attempt to spare my feeling out of pity for me. But in reality, they are being selfish. Instead of open honesty, they spare themselves from directly admitting that they are doing a shitty thing to someone who cares about them. Understandably, no one wants to admit they are being shitty and hurtful. Alas, they never cared that much about me in the first place. So I end up feeling unnecessarily pathetic and lame to spare them from feeling like a shitty person.


***Self-hate***

I eventually slip into rumination and self-disparagement. Obsessively explaining each loss leads to crippling anxiety. Do humans just not care about each other? Why am I less worthy of friendship? Am I broken? Am I irreparable? What's the point? Should I give up on having friends?",4.155058043117744,7.517824970149256,4.749154228855723,74.27291873963517,82.88059701492537,7.668609334280976,29.19284529732291,8.466822672950826,3.130926462923478,2177,102,334,55,63,693,251,469,0.234,0.598,0.168,-0.994,0,1,0,0,0,0,83.0,1,0,18,5,15,40,1,3,25,0,28,9,2,6,6,81,57,19,0,8,10,0,7,3,11,2,7,0,0,3,16,30,0,3,12,0,0,3,9,18,0,2,3,9,57,22,60,49,19,55,0,8,2,0,44,32,1,8,23,236,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0701763458557179,0.0,0.054185656337578936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0460774303641371,0.0,0.05183430975716489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18095564821507806,0.06334412534113319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04130434924741714,0.07483284645543202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763331893457949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08739597713613102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24005216977531216,0.0,0.0,0.04475319637709072,0.0,0.057088624606923835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387575024737277,0.0,0.20556139791646733,0.1452179362372298,0.0,0.07422504034091383,0.0619291366900024,0.057634503467252525,0.0,0.0,0.5758421263597908,0.0,0.0,0.06499917780801069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060697420107890386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06729849607782055,0.0,0.0,0.07253581594378802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143577399609215,0.09930869059547226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06411379435369846,0.18091465651878108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841576969439724,0.0,0.10816679621641416,0.0,0.09961913238801323,0.0,0.15677630669451548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045914242414043516,0.0,0.28839507197489544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04697452602913895,0.05916324428019145,0.07079217659149298,0.0,0.06405274819627807,0.0763864118717021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712288048737978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10798792589210043,0.0,0.21205758115817894,0.0,0.0,0.11209942506382677,0.0,0.0,0.13814049726134398,0.057410718416469775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05664831241436439,0.0,0.07083486127708638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045015078930065205,0.0,0.0,0.05379189442286731,0.039509949024007895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07053795759896041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07993026997338032,0.0,0.0543509875229101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06114061384826765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06905069146611212,0.048132991108861864,0.0740822005295328,0.0,0.0
autism,redditortoo,2018/03/10,"Worthy Autism Charities? Lost a boy I had been mentoring for five years to a violent murder. He had aged out of his support system. I saw him last on the day he went missing. Thankfully, I told him how proud I was of him and how far he had come. I gave him a big hug and he rode off for the last time. He was going to be all right. I thought we had won.

They found his dismembered body last week, the day before his 19th birthday. He'd been missing a month. My friends want to help me get through this. They want to help me do a couple of fundraisers so I can donate the money to a worthy cause in his name. I want to help someone in his situation. We found Autism After 18, and of course the local children's home where he was the last two years.

Any other solid suggestions?

autism,PeripheralWarble,2018/03/11,"Is it common with autism to not be able to understand lyrics in songs? I tried smoking cannabis before listening to songs, but it doesn't help, even makes it worse because my short term memory is shot so I can't remember what the previous verse was. Cannabis helps treat most of my autism symptoms, but not this one. I've been taking advantage of the effect cannabis has of making me like music more, making me more normal since normal people talk about music a lot, and I always get asked ""what music do you listen to?"" and once i can understand lyrical songs I can engage in those conversations.",7.962886904761909,7.656028562500001,7.282857142857143,76.09547619047622,62.48214285714286,10.323809523809524,31.16666666666667,9.725611199111238,2.7677630952380947,477,14,85,8,6,148,78,112,0.059,0.805,0.136,0.8451,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,1,0,2,3,4,0,0,3,0,11,1,0,4,0,18,21,5,0,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,5,0,0,7,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,1,2,5,10,4,11,18,5,5,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,2,3,55,17,0,0.19192668364257787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15969837571668924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17942554100796124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699672494944292,0.0,0.16331547171163552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267657644422592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10027377072150688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25728882080952203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09376568303650934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.163169203069763,0.0,0.0,0.38433765499963096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3760948001526673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20439565427000744,0.1300544879378243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330577966146092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21741551869607625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15876373602476446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1994853117193012,0.14430498052872892,0.15426339825834032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13030561979491914,0.0,0.0,0.3996048926599224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19558968738709148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,carahens,2018/03/11,"Research Project for 16-24 year olds. Hello, my name is Cara Hens and I’m a MSc Clinical Psychology student at Royal Holloway, University of London. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in participating in a research study for my dissertation? 

It involves completing a 20 minute online survey focused on young autistic people’s beliefs in their social abilities, friendships, social understanding and wellbeing. I am interested in any gender differences we can identify and understanding more about the experiences of wellbeing for young autistic people. We hope that by understanding more about how these factors link together we could help young people with their wellbeing, if needed.

A link to the survey with further information can be found here: https://rhulpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0As7rpzEaEs4zFb

I would be happy to answer any questions people have on cara.hens.2016@live.rhul.ac.uk At the end of the survey, you can enter a prize draw to win a £50 Amazon voucher. This research has received ethical approval through my university. 

Thanks for your interest!

Best wishes,

autism,GotYourGunnars,2018/03/11,"Whats the point of living if you cant ""cure"" autism? Whats the point of living if you can never be ""cured"". why should i have to go through life constantly hiding myself and pretending I'm normal like everyone else. 
How can you go on knowing that every goal you set out to achieve is achieved faster and more accurately by everyone else, knowing you'll always be second best.... hell maybe not even second.

Why should a defective human like me even be allowed to exist? in my opinion it would have been more humane to have had me aborted. all i feel is pain and loss and i struggle everyday to just be a human meanwhile all my friends have jobs and wives and money. I want what they have but i can never have it, or ill have to settle for a shitty version of whatever they have. 

I'm simply not good enough and man i feel it, every hour I'm reminded of what i could have been if maybe my genetics where a little less mucky. Ive been suicidal for the last 10 years and its getting really old. I'm only 19, my life just started but i feel like i died years ago. and The pills cant help me... they cant make me not hate myself. 

The worst part is that there is no cure, or if there was it would transform the brain so drastically i wouldn't even be ""me"" anymore. The Autism is literally me, the physical structure of my brain is faulty. I want to throw myself away like a cheap malfunctioning bit of Chinese tech, because im broken...  and not very useful.

I don't know what ill do

autism,ChocolateBear-,2018/03/11,"Conversations with people you don’t know who have autism Hey, I met someone recently who I apparently knew when I was about 4 (I have no memory of this) and within a few seconds I could tell he had something. I only wanted to know- since I’ve never spoken to someone on the spectrum IRL before, should we treat them differently? I don’t mean treat them like delicate flowers but should I do anything differently, or is there anything I should take care of ? I tried to just be myself but it did get a bit awkward as he’d constantly say things like “ok what should I ask you next” or sometimes very bold/blunt statements I would not expect but I shouldn’t get angry at them for that, should I?

I'm not asking for much I think, just simple stuff like how was school, what you thinking about etc.  My son will ask yes or no questions about his needs or something immediate.  He talks a lot!! His subject matter is asking for things over and over.  Lol.  Which is AMAZING for us and him.  I'm just curious if there are any folks out here in the Reddit world who were semi verbal and went in to conversation.

autism,Imhereforgames,2018/03/12,"I think I’m actually autistic I’ve been diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression.

Recently I started pondering if I’m actually a bit autistic.

I was telling a close friend how sometimes I fake caring to avoid a bad rep.

I just don’t know what amount of empathy is normal.

Would a person telling a story about their best friend dying yesterday make a normal person feel their pain? 

I read people very well and I can always tell how people are feeling, I just don’t always feel their sorrow.

I’m a bit socially awkward, not too noticeable but definitely there.

I’ve always had tics like blinking hard or poping  my ears or something, ever since I was little.

It is high functioning autism? Or something else? Or am I just overthinking all of this?",3.6091750503018147,6.2093958732394405,4.902334004024149,77.98084507042256,76.1830985915493,8.000804828973843,27.748490945674053,8.841846274778883,2.6632096579476854,602,25,102,14,14,199,93,142,0.123,0.735,0.14300000000000002,0.6962,0,1,2,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,3,1,10,13,0,2,7,0,12,3,1,3,2,29,23,10,1,4,10,0,4,1,2,1,2,1,0,2,3,4,0,1,6,1,0,0,3,7,1,0,4,5,14,6,5,18,5,7,1,2,0,0,11,3,0,5,5,61,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.25049104930673605,0.0,0.15424490966697785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3203782215965685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09818303957118807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071621310448243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13468942650845034,0.0,0.2802374733314574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308555693684169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105427590620707,0.13026676468473686,0.13320112230007605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721519535968396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609476881384705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946842058907852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19831697837348986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497128500873445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356028014262519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07053467176719001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627025429307169,0.12863470764574628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567081805085723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25150033134627625,0.0,0.14612083824173122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136567386044592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17795555760513387,0.22413058769511135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12837903357509967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12672451444006105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616773270939307,0.0,0.0,0.1308308528900528,0.0,0.19761142769763831,0.1269357962199726,0.0,0.09084275738742416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365357302907087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08223784626761027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10589749027469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539694083508985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117210960965463,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,IvanThePohBear,2018/03/12,"Today the doctor told me my daughter may have a developmental disorder... first, my daughter. she is two this year, but she can't talk, not much anyway. she can call mama. jiejie ( her sister) and kaka ( our maid) she cant call papa yet.

her overall development is slow. she only started walking abt last december (22 months)

we were worried so we brought her to see a specialist.

the doc says that she has a developmental disorder but may or may not be autism. she doesnt have the classic signs of autism. she smiles, and she makes good eye contact. but nothing conclusive.

autism,yayokittenxo,2018/03/12,"Autistic crush with ADHD making me feel inadequate and insecure with inconsistently Hiya !! I’m 15 and interested in a 14 year old boy with autism and ADHD aswell. I’m finding things to be a bit rocky because of my constant need for attention. He can go days without texting me and he’ll be perfectly fine while I’m having a midlife crisis but he does get back to me EVENTUALLY. He says he doesn’t mean to get distracted and not keep up but it still really hurts me. I just feel like he doesn’t like me when he does that, when I’m at school he does speak to me and doesn’t avoid me and seems to enjoy talking to me i think? We went on a date last Saturday and he was so happy the entire time and it just all felt so lovely but then he started being a bit inconsistent. What should i do? I’m trying to be patient with him as best as i can

Also do you think if i remind him to text me or try to keep conversation as consistent it’ll drive him away or make him uncomfortable?

autism,Piepaws,2018/03/13,"Can I have aspergers and not be autistic? I got my aspergers diagnose when I was 11 years old. Since then, I've called myself autistic because it's on the spectrum.

Can I have aspergers without being autistic?

autism,Deranged90,2018/03/13,"Smiling Is smiling a common problem for those on the spectrum?

I have recently started a job in retail but often find my colleagues telling me to smile more. Whilst I have been diagnosed with autism and ADHD, I don’t consider myself to be a particularly unhappy human being...yet my ‘resting face’ usually looks very intense.

I was only diagnosed with autism about two years ago (I am almost 28) but I have always been encouraged to smile more. I have even been mildly derided for my neutral expression by being nicknamed “smiler” in my teens.

I’m beginning to question if I should quit my new role as I don’t want to upset customers or scare them away.",6.270409836065571,7.3207064918032785,6.993565573770492,72.08411885245904,66.04918032786885,9.70655737704918,34.92213114754098,9.827888789773867,3.692668852459017,520,24,85,11,8,172,86,122,0.122,0.72,0.158,0.4118,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,1,3,4,0,2,4,0,15,3,1,0,0,14,20,6,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,3,0,1,4,1,17,1,16,13,3,13,0,0,1,0,7,4,0,5,9,64,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.247618664622404,0.0,0.18264101352780865,0.0,0.2063181513065644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17144083301705865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19358028691488632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4182502020398439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13608672071017167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188315781012428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044617715431574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17302074621898772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19899361033361374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15670183390276224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19715135834261527,0.0,0.0,0.2308106721147961,0.21914768440857335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.203438512870992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20628083789882504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145835362239554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18008704104018675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20127002298670946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.226922690134792,0.1700036337361001,0.121527055123645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13268226754764306

autism,Serpenthrope,2018/03/14,"Remember to Spread Support for ASAN this April I’ve observed in the last few years that Autism Acceptance Month has really become a chance to bash a certain organization, that shall remain nameless.  I fully support this goal, but I wanted you all to remember that Advocacy is more than destroying your opposition, it’s about building up your base of support.  And we’ve really done an inadequate job of that, as Google Trends will show:


https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Autism%20Self%20Advocacy%20Network,Autism%20Speaks


So, for this Autism Acceptance Month I’ve pledged to ask all my friends to include a link to ASAN’s website on any posts they make on social media bashing the other organization.  I hope everyone else will ask their friends to do the same.

autism,Asd_parent_throwaway,2018/03/14,"Son diagnosed, having a hard time My 2 y/o son was diagnosed a few months ago with a ‘provisional level 1 ASD’ diagnosis and it’s been hitting me pretty hard. I’ve been lurking here for a while, and it’s been hugely helpful to read about firsthand accounts of ABA and experiences from adult autistic people.

One of the hardest things for me is that my wife and I haven’t told anyone. Keeping it quiet has made it feel like a rollercoaster of sadness, optimism on good days, and huge anxiety about the future. We’ve been concerned about how family and friends will react, and don’t want people to think less of our son or make assumptions. Mother and MIL also have some troubling tendencies (fetishizing pop culture autism savants, or referring to learning disabled relatives as ‘tragedies’). The psychologist who did the evaluation asked us to have him evaluated again at 3, so the conversation about whether to tell family may come up again then.

He has sensory issues (adjusting to new or busy places), and is verbal but speech delayed. We’ve been working with early intervention speech and OT for a few months and it’s been really helpful.

Have any parents here had experiences with a provisional diagnosis? What about discussing a diagnosis with family and friends? 

Does anyone have kids originally diagnosed with ‘level 1’ that are older now? How has it impacted their life and your life? I am grappling what what this all means long term.

Posting this partly to ask questions, and partly just to talk about it.

autism,TheAmazingBildo,2018/03/14,Just started our autism journey. After 45 min at a new daycare they are telling us they might not be able to accommodate him. My son is about to be 3 and was diagnosed with high functioning autism a month ago. Started a new daycare this morning and 45 min after I dropped him off we got a call saying they might not be able to accommodate us.  I’ve spent the whole morning calling services in our area to try and get recommendations for a facility that might be able to help us.  I feel lost. I know we are FAR from the first to have to deal with this but I’m feeling devastated. Just needed to vent. Sorry if this isn’t the place to do it. ,2.7031678321678356,4.446157330769236,3.9960139860139883,87.46262237762241,75.69230769230771,6.881118881118883,26.433566433566433,7.686295010490155,1.3219230769230768,503,19,108,7,11,165,80,130,0.069,0.903,0.029,-0.7184,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,7,0,3,2,3,1,0,0,8,0,14,1,0,0,0,20,25,5,0,2,6,1,2,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,5,7,0,0,3,0,1,1,3,1,0,1,4,3,16,0,19,14,1,20,0,1,0,0,19,7,0,4,11,73,21,1,0.3963572072139844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11711558312326105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2698166826386017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362089588836842,0.0,0.13409807402284232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336067421126318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11238041265901398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690267605762885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566768884299256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855662704806071,0.1395910503141014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07260918514944723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14422357091862328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4204723610439621,0.0,0.0,0.1054561804432907,0.0,0.0,0.09796461564174426,0.0,0.2552028403902361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380363070691172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10506638659665993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14789648107785086,0.18702911420360527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154778897520344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08970017537596793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4767689181026834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14750622237417269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,tiredApple,2018/03/15,"A gift for nephew and sister in law My nephew has just been diagnosed with autism. He is 2.5 years old. It has been a hard journey for him and his family. 

My husband and I live far away so we can't be there physically to support them. Those of you with autism or children with autism, is there a gift you would recommend for the family or for my nephew? Are there things you were given or things that were said to you that helped you out when you heard the diagnoses? 

He's a great kid and he has great parents so I know he will be fine but I'm sure you all have some great advice on things that can help.

After doing some reading over the past few months I have decided that I may have mild autism but have had a hard time finding someone who is confident diagnosing it in adults. Does anyone know someone that I might be able to contact around the Ottawa area?

autism,autismquestions1,2018/03/15,"Trying to learn more and set up the right appointments for my daughter. Can you help? My daughter is 22 months old now.  She doesn’t talk and has some other concerning traits (walks tip toes 15% of the time, doesn’t respond to name consistently, doesn’t point).  That said, she has a lot of traits that are the opposite of traditional autism. 

Because of the speech delays, we have been seeing an SLP for the past four weeks (just had our fourth appointment, 45 min each).  We have, also, been more attentive at home with playing interactively, functionally, and attempting to get her to engage with us.

That said, in the past few weeks, we have seen her imitate faces and actions well, use gestures we have taught her, make much more eye contact, turn to her name more often, etc.

She has always (before speech therapy) loved to be touched, cuddled, initiated peek a boo, initiated ball passing, kisses her brother, plays with other kids (to the extent toddlers do).

My question is this: should we still go in for an autism evaluation?  The wait is 18 months for the clinic here in Seattle.  My SLP says that the improvements in name, eye contact, imitation, etc. is a result of her work as early intervention and doesn’t necessarily mean we should have less concern about autism.  My thought though is, wouldn’t an autistic child not necessarily imitate or make eye contact, etc?  Also if she “loses” these symptoms this quickly and doesn’t have them by 18 months later when we will actually get an evaluation, won’t she be given a “no” diagnosis?

It’s worth noting we got an evaluation by another SLP before the fourth speech therapy appointment and she believes an autism evaluation is unwarranted.  With her sense of eye contact, imitation, etc, the other SLP said there is no way my daughter is autistic.  But then again, if this is the result of previous speech therapy, does that constitute autism?  

I’m just very confused with the network of options and procedures out there.  What do you think I should do?",7.884019258672995,8.342881617728533,7.5231499802136925,71.7434533702678,62.46260387811635,10.754306819680783,34.91900804643187,10.504223727775694,3.674621580266456,1588,64,276,35,21,502,189,361,0.025,0.911,0.064,0.9196,0,0,0,0,0,0,61.0,10,2,1,3,16,8,0,1,24,0,39,11,6,5,0,55,60,18,0,6,7,4,1,0,0,6,2,8,1,2,14,23,0,2,6,3,1,4,10,2,1,1,11,15,33,6,35,41,15,34,0,1,6,3,49,9,0,9,19,191,47,3,0.0,0.0,0.10365982994024747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16989545575617904,0.08838732843395095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138569419977233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06475349487679445,0.0,0.1807785229090896,0.11967868321909685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092957812559066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4738737741818029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109958779016724,0.0,0.060369855177320714,0.0,0.08495747005254692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120007140090975,0.0,0.1065518766690357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883809133841895,0.0,0.09030830700256147,0.0958717964589601,0.0,0.14181141329515656,0.0,0.0,0.11570966705484782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25436224800503904,0.0,0.07808726073951279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114647879620633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20280668983723588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10041652701819674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11899579769448235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09071517848678276,0.30313159391829586,0.08447401935778215,0.0,0.0,0.08464720705467899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483105647556873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040797181282998,0.0,0.08537926316411737,0.0,0.0,0.3644310640925151,0.0,0.0,0.06806439736945487,0.1043650732063438,0.0843304209699423,0.0619403846888712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07211949127169137,0.11554179857613985,0.0,0.0,0.1277750449710281,0.09174389847781277,0.0,0.08764637190314314,0.0,0.08431609711257727,0.1704138404908319,0.0,0.09550862033351336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07733273172108501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

In theory I can work and I could do so without any accommodations, but the issue is that there's no support to help me get into work. I've tried time and time again, I've never stopped trying to get support, but there's little available and what support there has been hasn't been suitable as they don't understand the issues I have. 

Executive dysfunction makes it impossible for me to see any steps out of unemployment and just get on with job searching. I can't even go looking for jobs because I have no idea what jobs to look for, and it's become such a mental barrier for me that I have severe meltdowns even after just ten minutes on a job search web site. I haven't applied for a job in months, I barely even go on job sites because it seems so utterly pointless. 

I'm NT-passing, I come across as highly educated and capable, so people just can't get their heads round why I'm unemployed at all let alone how it's been 10 years...I'm not even sure I understand how it's been 10 years! I'm scared to even mention it as people attack me for it, they tell me it's my fault and I chose this life. 

I try not to think about it, I try not to confront the fact I've ruined my life, when I think about it I end-up suicidal. 

Without work I'm stuck living half a life - poor so can't even afford basics like paying bills or food, no social life and thus I'm very severely socially isolated, no hope for a family or future, no accomplishments, etc. - this is the cause of my depression and it's made my autism worse too. I desperately need and want to work. 

My last job I worked 40-60 hours per week, and it was a toxic work environment too yet I still coped fine, but that was a long time ago. I've started volunteering and it's been fine but it's only 9 hours per week. 

I'd need to work full-time at 35 hours per week, and I don't think I could work something like a checkout operator - aside from it not being ideal for an Autistic person, I know due to executive dysfunction I'd struggle to find my way into a better job so for me getting a job as a checkout operator would mean resigning myself to the fact that's all I'd ever be. Going into work means giving up my disability benefits, that is a huge gamble and will make me feel trapped at work. I'm scared if I do ever get a job my autism and depression could worsen further if it doesn't work out.

Currently I've two employability coaches who are meant to specialist in autism - they don't, also as I used to be an employability coach (I know, ironic right?!!) I know they're not great at their jobs. They'll ask me to go in to answer a silly ten minute questionnaire then send me home until two weeks later, then two weeks later they go over the results of that silly ten minute questionnaire - this has been going on for a few months now, so far they've done nothing at all even related to job searching and so I'm not hopeful that they'll be of any help to me.


I don't know how to get back into work, if I ever do I'm terrified I'll fail.

autism,wenzlunch,2018/03/16,"Suggestions needed: writing about autism Hi everyone. I’m a teacher and researcher and I’m currently working with a group of students who are interested in writing about their own lived experience with autism. I’m trying to provide them with as many examples of similar writing as possible. 

I have lots of examples from authors who have written about their experiences at book length. But I’m really interested in any suggestions for bloggers or other writers I may not be familiar with who are writing in different forms.

Thank you very much.

autism,LiveSimple1,2018/03/16,"Mother hints at her belief I am on the autistic spectrum, and has felt it since I was a little boy, 32M now, also a Buddhist and have a lot to say on that, long post beware So if I am being honest, until heard it from my mothers mouth a couple of years ago, I never actually thought I was autistic, ever, I probably never even gave autism more than a minutes thought in my life, all I knew about it was there was a 'spectrum' from stronger to weaker. 


And as a background piece, from aged 21, I began meditating as a student in Manchester, during a period where living as a student of audio engineering, being a DJ and living in a student house full of other DJs and being a bartender, the party lifestyle needed to end, so it was time to hit the recreational party drugs on the head, and the love story with meditation began here.

So that's 10 years of hanging out with Buddhists, studying it more deeply on 2 year long, weekly courses, weekend retreats, 2 week festivals. It's safe to say I am no 'Buddha' but do feel a know a little bit about psychology, more than the average person, especially since, Buddhist psychology is 2,500 years old, compared to wester psychology at 100 years old, it kind of gave me a helpful edge throughout my 20s. 

So fast forward to my mother moving from a job taking care of naughty children, to a home of autistic children, and taking a course on the side about autistic children and people, she first mentioned and I forgot under what circumstances, but I had a strong reaction towards it.

Coming from 10 years of studying Buddhist psychology, I will try remember how I felt, and this will be 'how I felt' so some facts maybe wrong but it' simple how I felt and what I thought about autism at the time. So I remember thinking, no.1 that first of all, I did not know much about autism, but I was 30 at the time so I was aware of it's existence, and what my perceptions of it was, that it was labelled as a mental disorder, or disability of someckind, and so comes with 'mental limitations' so as a Buddhist who has been practicing meditation, and been into the idea that all humans have the potential to overcome their own 'mental limitations' shall we say, because in Buddhist Psychology, every single human is actually labelled as 'mentally sick', because all of us suffer from anger, jealousy, stress, anxiety and so on. So another response by the way from myself when my mother mentioned it to me, was that, 'okay maybe I am autistic, but as humans, we are all mentally 'sick' anyway to some degree and labelling myself as autistic now at the age of 30 would not serve any purpose and may only cause a challenge in how confident I feel at dealing with problems in my life'.


Anyway, continuing on, another strong belief that arose during this time, was that, as a Buddhist, and not only as a Buddhist actually, if you believe you are limited in some way, especially mentally, which seemed to be the case which labelling yourself 'autistic' in this society, that belief, in itself, will actually cause the limitation, we all know it's quite normal common knowledge that, what we believe in ourself will happen, example, if we believe we can do something we usually can, or at least, will try. if we don't believe something is possible why would we even try, hence self belief is common knowledge as being a positive human quality. 

So to summarise, even if I was autistic, I was not about to start adopting limited beliefs at aged 30 after 10 years of buddhist psychology, and learning the importance and usefulness of knowing our own potential to improve and change ourselves for the better, this belief in our ability to change, is the foundation of change itself, and as somebody who has been improving their life, not on the outside, but I mean on the inside, improving mental strength, and generosity and working on the, shall we say 'spiritual' or 'mind' side of life, I was not about to start adopting a more limited belief that seemed to come from being diagnosed with autism.

I actually began to think, maybe to an extreme, the whole spectrum and labelling was useless, since as humans, all of us, have 'mental problems' even if it's just stress or anxiety, they are there to be acknowledged and worked upon so we can overcome them and steadily abstain a stronger and stronger foundation of happiness with in our lives. 

So if I was autistic or not, actually it made no difference to my own potential to improving myself for the better, so it was a kind of pointless piece of information to me and I felt fiercely against it simply because the only thing it brought with it, was a 'stigma' that it comes with, you know, I have never associated myself as autistic and did not want to start doing so now, I felt it came with a lot of stigma in society being autistic, the same way I have been conditioned by society to view mentally disabled people, as having something wrong with them, similar to the way, as a society, we view people are sick in a 'mental institution' it's something they have and they are stuck with it. This western view of psychology where things are unchangeable completely goes against the Buddhist view, which in it's most extreme form, actually nothing ever stays the same anyway, so why do we view as mental state as in anyway 'permanent'. 

Anyway. 2--3 years on, and I have stopped fighting now, it's somewhat, I believe, affected, possibly in a negative way, the relationship with my mother, if she related to me as autistic, she may always be relating to my 'limitations' by viewing me as an autistic person. She has said actually she believes my sister is autistic also and another sister, asbergers, which did made me think, that, as far as I can remember, nobody was labelled by my mother with these until she began studying autism. When reading about autism, it reminds me a lot about Buhddism, because, it talks about our 'mental weaknesses' which in Buddhism, is 'standard experience for all humans' and with everybody having the full potential to overcome their own unique 'mental limitations'. It felt like even if a Dr asked me some questions for 10 minutes and diagnosed me with autism, felt all to quickly and unhelpful.

I don't want to sound extreme, I do know some people have extreme forms of autism, as there are others with extreme forms of paranoia or other forms of mental challenges, and so a label can be helpful in discussing these things. I do feel thought people with autism, and maybe I have it and maybe I don't, whatever difference that makes anyway, I do feel the limited belief in the potential of people with autism and asbergers, is itself, the main reason why people with it, do not progress beyond their own limitations, a self fulfilling prophecy, and that's a big problem.



Just thought I would start this discussion on a neutral playing field away from the old views that my family have of me where it can be discussed maybe more naturally and in an unbiased way here.

autism,smemmy,2018/03/16,"how are autistic savants defined and ""qualified"" for lack of a better word? to start out, i have high functioning autism. i've been called creative and talented in a lot of stuff i've tried out and i always pick them up quickly. my last two main hobbies are drawing with an etch-a-sketch (i became proficient within a few days of starting), and currently i am doing watercolor painting. i started about a week ago, have only done 9 paintings so far and have drastically improved in a tiny period of time (to put this into context, i had practically no painting experience beforehand. i did 2 acrylic paintings, decided i hated it, and then immediately switched to watercolor. so if you want to get technical, i started painting a week and a half ago, but only started watercolor specifically about a week ago, and that's the medium that i am proficient with). i've shown my paintings to a few local professional painters and have shown them around online, and by all accounts, everyone thinks they look really good. if anyone wants to see any of this, ask for a link, but that's not what this main post is about so i'm not including it here unsolicited. it's about defining what is and is not a savant, and how anyone comes to that conclusion.

i suspect that i may have savant syndrome, but the thing that throws me off is that there doesn't seem to be any hard stipulations for a diagnosis for it (i know it's not a disease, but ""diagnosis"" sounds close to what i'm trying to say). because of this, the term ""savant"" loses any meaning. the word gets thrown around so much, you'd think there is a solid definition, but as far as i can tell, if someone has a natural high proficiency at something, but they don't have autism, they're simply referred to as ""talented"". so, i suppose this just means that a savant is simply a person who is talented at something... and they also happen to have autism. so why then do autistic people get their own special word, as if being autistically talented is so different and unique from being talented, sans-autism?

i've never called myself a savant publicly and i can't recall ever being called a savant by anyone i've known, but this makes me uncomfortable even just thinking of myself with that label, privately, in my own head. it seems that it's not even a thing, but then why would the word even exist?",8.861343652585187,7.444230823927767,8.965359561431802,68.35832204665164,61.30248306997743,11.869246479630227,37.79952703429001,10.813802987103665,4.042597850155863,1857,74,330,38,21,613,214,443,0.039,0.8740000000000001,0.086,0.9668,2,0,2,0,0,0,66.0,0,2,6,3,26,10,1,0,26,0,37,1,1,4,3,75,64,44,0,8,19,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,1,30,25,0,0,14,0,1,3,10,2,0,2,4,5,31,8,50,53,11,46,0,1,2,0,17,19,0,8,23,242,61,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531219712194385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07611781424781122,0.07919988463082918,0.0,0.0,0.1941831209143136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996625094213957,0.0,0.0,0.16946610780923654,0.08898326037369694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058022676039105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08418163244668203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915774688390196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08199173023058684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06138516355886973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09944598095146516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09740526035725826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886024301858304,0.08609847682978042,0.0,0.09095143970351527,0.0,0.09310724251155653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14918757383100206,0.0,0.0,0.07983498818233663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08417001646390758,0.0,0.08526527611495563,0.0939735110687134,0.09768522283468226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20113214016338904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05231008997986167,0.07758685251051463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07992975126246796,0.10648543507889804,0.0,0.08092118658335892,0.0,0.0,0.06353539456000268,0.0,0.0,0.20736439133950552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997046014721865,0.0,0.07341100085654273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1447819279471564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598791060846146,0.08311012808189062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09115900722393497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09568520916660088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06097666993302458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756933454826418,0.0,0.0,0.0758485311394179,0.1733020648047805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064825076645914,0.14655305405023225,0.0,0.0,0.3368551021715638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10896176772920033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319414122580128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12647071745342858,0.18296827773755034,0.0,0.0,0.055501975320066725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12924602405242594,0.0,0.09297996468907506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11228280422971823,0.0,0.2290501943916561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17177571344363388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761527540776481,0.0,0.0,0.0

Thanks in advance!",1.4123497267759542,3.4589017377049203,3.850409836065573,85.5650136612022,80.80327868852459,7.3453551912568305,24.92076502732241,8.344100000000001,1.6978174863387974,230,9,49,5,6,80,40,61,0.031,0.742,0.227,0.9079,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,8,3,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,3,2,11,16,6,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,3,8,14,2,7,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,2,0,30,4,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17789545168131687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20886453001906444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5310324524921689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2733480717267597,0.0,0.4460161174029252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3506869370678323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21639637559375047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24655279889370754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2408440764781736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2836916185828825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,switchquark,2018/03/18,"Should I Seek Diagnosis? Advice? I am an 18 year old female and my mother thinks that I am autistic. I think this possible (I ""stim"" by compulsively pacing and walking in circles, I have difficulty socializing and making friends, I have difficulty processing speech, I have difficulty regulating my own speech, I get agitated/upset by swinging/spinning objects and repetitive sounds like ticking, etc.) However, given that there isn't medication that makes people less autistic, and I am deeply suspicious of the mental health institution, I don't want to get a professional to evaluate me. My mother thinks that I should. Do any of you think there would be a benefit to that? I would like to reduce these symptoms, but I don't think getting a diagnosis would actually help me do that. 
In your personal experience, was getting a diagnosis important to ameliorating symptoms? Is it possible to ameliorate symptoms of autism? How did you ""get better,"" so to speak?

autism,neonlexicon,2018/03/18,"Finally diagnosed. Relieved, but also nervous. After years of being misdiagnosed with various emotional and mental ailments, and being referred to 5 different specialists to finally find one who would accept adult patients &amp; put me on a 6 month waiting list, I'm done. I went for an interview a few weeks ago, and returned to take a 3 hour screening last week. I opted to wait around afterwards for the results. As I've suspected for awhile, I tested high for autism. Due to my IQ test results, the doctor said I'd be considered higher functioning. 

I definitely feel relieved to finally have an official diagnosis, but I don't really know what to do next. His suggestion was to go to the local board of developmental disabilities &amp; get a case worker. I had been working extremely part time over the last year, but I feel like I've been getting worse &amp; can no longer handle it. I'd attempted to apply for disability a couple of years ago (before I had the diagnosis), but the state appointed psychologist determined that I was well enough to work part time &amp; I was denied.

I have other medical issues that I haven't been able to properly treat because with my husband being the sole breadwinner, we can only afford rent, insurance, and groceries. We had to file for bankruptcy around a year ago to even get to the point where we can afford the necessities (and unfortunately, it didn't get rid of his student loans. We were only allowed to defer them for an additional amount of time.)

Would getting a case worker be the best first step? Should I get a disability lawyer? I wasn't sure if any other adults with autism here have had to deal with the various government hoop jumping. I've never been able to work a full time job, but I believe I have a long enough history of part time employment over the last 15 years that I should qualify for SSDI. From what I've found, that is what I'd have to try and apply for, so they don't include my husband's income (he makes just barely over the cut off line for SSI.)

Any advice would be extremely helpful.

autism,mount_sumInt,2018/03/18,"The thought that people think people with autism are stupid because of their terminal goals is sickening. I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo) which mentions how there is no such thing as a stupid terminal goal and it made me think about how other people look at me with confusion when I say I don't want to be happy. It's not just a ""the world is cold, why should I be happy?"" sort of thing. I think it's due to my autism (I was diagnosed with autism and I think it's the reason why I'm considered very intelligent by others).

I don't have a terminal goal to be happy. I have a terminal goal to be nice to others, so I'm approachable, show my flaws, do favours, and, when I get angry, find an outlet for the anger and then apologise. My terminal goals don't seem stable, but I usually want to be nice to others. That's why I try to be ethical.

However, it is not a terminal goal for me to be happy. Sometimes I think it might be nicer to others if I make myself feel less sad/angry/etc. Sometimes I think my emotional state is good enough and I should try to make others happy to be nicer to them than I could be if I tried to make my emotional state better.

But what upsets me is when people consider my lack of concern for myself to be stupid, when, in reality, it would be stupid of me to try to have concern for myself because it would get in the way of me being nice to others.

I thought I'd tell you this to be nice to you. I hope it worked. :) Thank you for reading. :)",3.7395558867362126,4.83258574098361,4.789277198211625,85.41849105812223,71.91803278688525,8.299552906110284,25.33904619970193,8.710501217029153,1.6154918032786882,1181,35,247,21,22,387,128,305,0.099,0.6859999999999999,0.215,0.9924,1,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,0,3,2,8,11,22,5,3,11,0,36,1,0,7,0,45,59,18,0,11,7,0,1,0,0,5,1,1,0,0,24,8,0,0,12,2,0,1,6,8,0,0,5,5,40,14,40,34,3,15,0,0,2,0,8,4,0,7,7,177,64,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11774428839499344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0854140750220072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710848485368986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09802312488404008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21727115015472684,0.0,0.0997893515147907,0.10770833766626868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048831985331964464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08826918064732114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091448101122916,0.0,0.0,0.08100379467345346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5140374544450425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09592226575548517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08109994511150515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138302902752103,0.1933967113647292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245241541122294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678159680890713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966026451265572,0.0,0.0,0.09929673723062753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680151716962695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791962768172537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19103327598928727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441212665426434,0.0889146750840033,0.0,0.0,0.12832228402669796,0.3712939686984781,0.0,0.15334192271859093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622764437765467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10636538170511647,0.07968573518521269,0.1139266557967124,0.07665793849160528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26143583668906945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07030884961085862,0.0,0.0,0.1372103637921346,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,neuractis,2018/03/18,"Oral sensory-seeking for adult i do not have autism, but i do have adhd and sensory processing issues. I'm wondering how anyone deals with oral sensory-seeking as an adult. I used to over-eat, but as i grow older, i m starting to have dyspepsia so i cant eat as much anymore.

any suggestions for socially appropriate things i can put inside my mouth, in public places? So it just looks like i am sucking on a chewy sweet. Gum is banned in my country. (And i dont like squishy textures, i like crunchy or tough textures.) I dont want to eat sweets (i've tried) because i like to chew, which makes sweets last less than 5 minutes. And also, i need to watch my weight.

i have done a search and came across https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/7w82ar/looking_for_advice_on_a_good_oral_stim_toy/ Maybe something similar, that can fit inside my mouth stealthily will be good?",5.863280397022336,8.347717045161293,4.894838709677419,81.20533498759308,68.87096774193549,7.607940446650125,28.052109181141443,8.384062270229773,1.9676997518610424,702,25,124,11,13,208,100,155,0.045,0.737,0.217,0.982,0,0,1,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,0,0,5,10,1,0,3,0,16,6,2,3,0,18,26,14,0,2,5,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,2,4,6,4,1,1,0,0,3,4,2,0,0,2,6,18,8,16,22,2,12,0,0,2,0,6,6,1,2,7,72,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873647735414539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12467534925149044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601919606676306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15461360641756272,0.1090108070869333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950368513752944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1783111792844118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16072885916194748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595426113319161,0.36543365462790667,0.0,0.0,0.4785822126610006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13076380519436218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.162721935395428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12708152526004046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30466477712754586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309190201099279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040662765329912,0.0,0.15662523748426874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11460643795867835,0.11559989180874898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16288516071173847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15672529471497426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15892319024922738,0.0,0.12002153095266176,0.0,0.0,0.11034874799125978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10357484003191923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10584771349084092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13464989435420593,0.0,0.0,0.09195546384648973,0.0,0.0,0.18984751312203213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690698500089575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,ilikegoldfishes,2018/03/18,"Why do therapists feel that all autistic kids must cry at some point in order to learn? If I made an NT child cry at daycare or school, wouldn't I get suspended or fired? But why is it an inevitability with autistic kids? I spoke to a potential therapist last week. She said my son's easygoing nature and happy disposition is bad b/c he's not ""stressed."" When I asked her how she'd react if he cried, she said that's his fault and hinted that it should be encouraged for his personal growth. WTF?!!!

EDIT: When I say cry, I mean nonstop crying for hours that could last weeks to months. I don't think NTs are treated this way. 

Thank you for all of those who posted an answer. I looked at the other options and my son can do speech therapy or get respite care instead of behavioral therapy. I assumed my husband had the right information, but the paperwork said otherwise. Thanks again /r/autism for saving my son from abuse.

autism,Dvijesa,2018/03/19,"5yr old son approved for Autism Service Dog and we need some help Greetings fellow redditors!

Story time:

To provide a little background for all you lovely folks, we're a military family. I'm currently active duty for the United States Air Force's Enlisted Corps and we've just done our fourth permanent change of station in five years. 

In October of 2015, our beautiful two year old boy Aiden  was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder just three months before his third birthday. We were stationed in Hawaii at the time and while it may sound like paradise, our three years there was very rough. I hated work and the marriage suffered. Having Aiden's diagnosis made things harder for a patch. The doctor initially made it sound like it was our fault; we were bad parents, we didn't do enough,and that it was more my fault because the genetics for Autism runs in the father's side (that's what the doctor told us). So, as you can expect, we experienced what most family's do when a diagnosis like this is given out. There were arguments, tears, and depression. We didn't know something was different since he was our first kid. My wife didn't start speaking until she was almost four , so we didn't think it odd he was going on three and only had a few words in his vocabulary. 

Following his diagnosis, we found out that Hawaii has a great services for developmentally delayed kids. So immediately we had ABA therapists come over and assess him, but it was so close to his third birthday, and because those services stop when the child is three, they didn't provide any therapies. We enrolled him into the local elementary school which was amazing. He learned his ABC's in a couple of days, he was counting to 40 in no time, and he was spending time with other kids his age getting that social interaction they say is crucial for children. Nine months afterwards we were moved to Ft. Meade in Maryland, and the services there were greatly lacking. The school went from being all day with therapy included to just a two hour babysitting in the morning. There were no speech therapies or anything of the like and it upset my wife more to take him. We ended up just keeping him at home more days than not with my wife interacting with him and teaching him by working on his sign language and teaching him new words. 

Now to the point. Aiden is a non-verbal eloper. He's five now and it still takes several attempts to get his attention. We have to constantly hold his hand while we're out otherwise he just darts off and if you've ever had a small child disappear from your sight in public you'll know the feeling when you realize they're no longer standing where they were for that split second you looked away. We've tried the backpack with the harness but he's almost pulled my wife down darting off while she attempted to get our daughter out of the car. I spent most of the last year away due to training for the military so it's a lot of work for my wife to handle our five year old with ASD and our 2 year old daughter on her own. 

Due to all these factors, Aiden was approved for a service dog to help tracking him down when he makes his getaways, to keep him from making them in the first place, and to help distract him when he starts the repetitive behaviors. Most importantly, it will give my wife and I the peace of mind when we're our that he'll be safe, and as he grows older he'll have a comforting companion to be there with him when he's placed in a stressful situation and we're not around. 

Ultimately, we're asking for help. Not donations, mind you, but information. We have to raise the funds (alot of funds) to get him this service dog as it's not covered by insurance.  We've been at it for 2 months and have very little to show. The organization has given us ideas but I wanted to reach out to the community to ask for more. As well as get some inspirational stories on how services dogs have helped others with ASD. Our biggest concern is what will happen to our son after we're gone. His sister is great and helps us keep him from darting off and shares her snacks and food with him willingly, but we don't want her to feel like she has to be alone in caring for her brother later in life. So this service dog could be a huge factor in helping him to be comfortable away from us and start allowing us to let him be more independent. 

Here is a link to Aiden's page. Again, we're not asking for donations. It has a picture of our little monkey and the story my wife has typed up for him. 

TL:DR - Our five year old son Aiden has ASD and is a non-verbal eloper . He's been approved to receive a service dog and we need information on ways to raise the funds. I'd also like to hear stories of how a service animal may have helped you or someone you love who also has ASD.

autism,justsave17,2018/03/19,"How I was able to alleviate my autism symptoms I did some digging around and found that some of these ideas had been broached before and that ""cure"" language is generally looked upon poorly, but I wanted to share my experience in removing virtually all autism symptoms from myself. A little background on me: I'm 25, was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at age 10, and have dealt with a number of other psychological issues(PTSD, anxiety, and depression) resulting from various traumas with this method as well. I also work in software, so I recognize many others may not be able to pursue some or all of methods I used. My original inspiration to try some of this was [this research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416307309), before which I just thought this was the way things were always going to be.

All that said, the sequence of events goes something like: last year I took 2 acid trips (I'm unsure how useful this was for the autistic traits, but it seems like too large a variable to leave out), and began taking a 15 strain probiotic (Hyperbiotics pro 15 to be precise), along with omega 3 supplements and a nootropic (again for precision I used NeuroIgnite). I also was exercising and using marijuana regularly ([this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/637sj2/cbd_oil_for_autism_how_cannabis_oil_reduced/) addresses the latter). Outside of that my diet consisted almost entirely of Soylent (later Huel) and the occasional take-out. Note that these products are similar to multivitamins (in fact I currently take a high quality one of those as well). I did all of this for the past 9 months (I'm a bit scared to stop, being honest), but most of the ""basic"" autistic difficulties (like sensory difficulties and lack of oxytocin related bonding) disappeared in 4 whereas more executive functioning related tasks are still becoming easier with time and practice, but are still orders of magnitude more functional than before.

While the biological changes were happening I also took deliberate steps to try to improve the areas I knew to be of deficit in myself and were influenced by the autistic traits such as theory of mind, affective (rather than cognitive) empathy, and things like sports that I never took much interest in due to sensory difficulties. In particular I watched shows like Shameless and tried to pull apart the motivations for each character and feel the way they might have felt in a circumstance.

I can't really overstate how different of a person I am now. I used to game for 8 hours a day some weeks before and now I can barely play an hour of video games without getting bored. I can feel love in a very deep and meaningful way (I assume this is from gaining oxytocin receptors). I still prefer to connect with people over my interests, but now that my sensory system is less straining to use, my set of interests has grown considerably. I still am introverted and have a preference for theoretical tasks, but now I can naturally charm the pants off of people and don't feel afraid of social situations. The strangest topic is perhaps my sense of self, which has grown from almost an atomic and logical structure to an emotional and biological one.

This experience has been totally miraculous for me and while I don't want to give false hope (biology is complicated and what worked for me may not work for all others), I sincerely believe this to have reversed most of the difficulties I faced in life as a result of various things, but especially my autism. And if it's possible that this information could help even a single other person get through their difficulties, I would consider this a success. I'm of course open to any questions or concerns, so ask away!",12.191996677740867,10.509064429457363,11.066486710963456,56.750494186046545,55.093023255813954,14.795681063122926,44.586101882613505,13.371156678226304,6.134493909191582,3027,139,461,90,28,966,343,645,0.076,0.797,0.127,0.9904,2,0,3,0,0,0,103.0,0,0,2,6,25,26,0,4,33,0,47,8,1,15,10,113,83,47,0,10,15,0,4,5,0,4,5,1,1,3,35,34,1,1,19,7,1,11,7,7,2,2,23,8,45,19,91,50,23,70,0,1,2,1,16,24,0,19,34,337,80,8,0.14902119087644544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492231965963369,0.0,0.0,0.17875828875603014,0.061998784323951873,0.0,0.0,0.05066975997518088,0.0,0.05700040156577223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.066330227103605,0.06965734854370495,0.0,0.0700051571530253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229109866134167,0.2536121150130396,0.0839479255741961,0.0,0.0,0.08134627214351356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882233022125999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059490647475089024,0.0,0.0,0.048053169949889465,0.0,0.0641758666694962,0.07562668593408374,0.0,0.07784771346110943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381439101603268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04921354556078417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14577131960176795,0.0,0.0,0.1130243875393799,0.0,0.07154185644240812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169702201177798,0.0,0.0,0.07785742161011112,0.0714773526233657,0.04234608848488768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588947347100002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04994288150629711,0.07872453499604459,0.0,0.07400583357200152,0.14675585498033322,0.0,0.0,0.08411339278890556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0607360800788492,0.0,0.07889596208841161,0.0,0.0,0.05262903709811216,0.18201056627782125,0.07467919126487196,0.0,0.0,0.06257013419511831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724872147086777,0.0,0.0,0.07554204887396468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904396694819482,0.07523446080948316,0.0,0.05947364640624364,0.0,0.05477386094608583,0.0,0.05746716463446176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10098061563661256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112879439539439,0.10331253023592654,0.13011955585802487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839995009339088,0.07136055379886659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08709889873986963,0.0,0.08346891944165802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0477333953905636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0708766390164181,0.0,0.07459810451213095,0.0,0.0,0.06783164766470333,0.07773080119911464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375303114413195,0.0,0.07595416870872539,0.0,0.05736189662667746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380170310648982,0.06229419414996184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15489007651552164,0.16806808443458254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485045862990763,0.0,0.0,0.05915308986367345,0.04344772739836363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24835203939666226,0.15176340989584267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3861193867183067,0.0,0.06147904461735688,0.08789655938484828,0.1774291274283644,0.05976790525070937,0.0,0.1339879473234806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718255550856479,0.0,0.16273380268780446,0.0,0.0,0.052930189185892096,0.0,0.0,0.04798238053638414
autism,Kimberlynski,2018/03/20,"Any tips for medicine? I have a very hard time getting my son to take medicine. He’s 7 and has a problem with different tastes or textures. He doesn’t take any medicine routinely, only a few times here or there when he’s been sick. He knows he needs it, and he really tries to take it… but his brain just doesn’t cooperate with him. There’s a lot of crying and I have to spend quite a while calming him down before he can even attempt it. I’ve tried lots of different ways. He can’t swallow small pills whole in pudding or applesauce, they always stay in his mouth and won’t go down. Crushing pills and putting them pudding doesn’t work— we get the same result with liquids— if he’s actually able to swallow it, he throws it up immediately. Last week he had the flu and his temperature got up to 104F. I was able to get him to take some chewable ibuprofen ONCE, but it wasn’t a pretty process. He already feels miserable when he’s sick and I hate adding to that. Does anyone have any tips or ideas?",3.7003135313531352,4.968469460396044,4.149128712871288,89.30098679867987,72.21782178217822,7.366864686468648,27.32805280528053,7.793537801064563,1.3642009240924096,789,28,171,10,15,248,116,202,0.147,0.813,0.04,-0.9684,2,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,2,2,7,4,1,1,8,0,14,11,2,1,0,29,27,17,0,3,8,1,2,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,6,11,3,0,3,0,1,3,6,3,0,0,5,3,14,1,20,21,6,19,0,1,0,0,23,7,0,8,7,90,20,0,0.27035963679357283,0.0,0.13191600283202826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491742910599812,0.0,0.11248043793559638,0.0,0.0,0.2757807360699205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945208721103647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150280689915842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15090538398091716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14848868295361212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824682773338699,0.0,0.0,0.11829677003974855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08928499513984642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06835097788049486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21187762731321225,0.0,0.07682580601503115,0.0,0.10811564968333362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12109456526122905,0.13346208430258205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15260156082592474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07429129293320905,0.1101895942034006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2298500950497919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10023412248395773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14396209480057076,0.0,0.10281034332666812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13752647333148926,0.0,0.12934882977247633,0.0,0.13589305440514413,0.0,0.14378037647772926,0.0,0.0,0.08659965314205925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14408370016381802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4065536003936418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15764887838893832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18355644651018346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153750735320207,0.0,0.10729944774074704,0.10843309639695382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15092343969038696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09841251777672726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,gv1gv1,2018/03/20,"Ideas for activities aimed at low functionning autistic children Hey there!

I work with low functionning autistic children and I'm constantly trying to find better ways to help them socialize, discover and learn new things. The thing is there isn't much ressources in that category and way too often it's aimed to verbal and or high functionning children. 

My question is, what are your go to activities to try with children that can't talk, can difficultly interact, need sometimes months to open up to a new game and have a high tendancy to have bursts of emotions that result in self harm or harming the people that surround them?

Also, people who have been battling  autism yourselves, what was your childhood like and how do you feel others could've helped you improve your everyday life?",7.330691244239631,7.3760586129032255,7.400829493087556,73.55338709677422,63.67741935483871,10.31152073732719,35.45622119815668,9.957137785484203,3.5486834101382474,524,22,91,10,7,169,83,124,0.018000000000000002,0.877,0.105,0.8555,1,0,0,0,1,0,12.0,0,4,1,0,5,4,1,0,4,0,16,3,0,3,1,19,20,9,0,1,0,6,1,2,0,1,3,0,0,1,6,10,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,6,1,13,3,11,12,0,12,0,0,0,0,19,1,0,0,12,60,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16350024841186614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475013979797462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14726512091316746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19015572496415986,0.0,0.37441761086928943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16684196494363446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17387927166175907,0.0,0.09326143858210753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20223551659692507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2472605290388405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20273339366672047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13027966311918954,0.18022199581271114,0.0,0.16286919546082154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3870900955353507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20480545309128212,0.0,0.0,0.2557432622230209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15257563557620865,0.20732502976118286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13102514498066592,0.0,0.0,0.35633152627987835

autism,muntea,2018/03/20,"Petition to Save Adult Day Program The San Joaquin Activity Center is a day program for developmentally disabled adults, many of whom have a dual diagnoses of autism or asperger's syndrome. This adult day program has had such a positive impact on so many lives for over 50 years, providing a space for growth, acceptance, and community. The center now faces closure due to careless and corrupt mismanagement of funds. Many of the attendees truly consider the Activity Center their family and have been distraught at the thought of never seeing each other again.

Please take a moment to sign the petition below in support of keeping the center open. Thanks so much!

autism,izukella,2018/03/21,"Help? So on mobile, you know how that goes. I manage a day program for people with severe medical and physical disabilities. Most are non verbal, all are in wheelchairs and I am struggling. Mostly what I find while researching is centered around people who can ambulate and respond in some fashion. I am working with people who cannot....for the most part. These are adults who cannot tell me yes or no for mostly anything. I want to make life as good for them as possible. Does anyone have a starting point or a success story? I am traveling with my staff to other programs that do things along the same lines but would love any advice. My individuals are in chairs, so please keep that in mind for community endeavors. My ratio, if that matters, is 1 staff to 3 individuals. Thanks so much. I appreciate it so much.",3.6231798245614018,6.230082151315795,4.664631578947368,79.66808771929824,76.17105263157895,7.211228070175438,25.92280701754386,8.238735603445708,1.963832807017544,645,24,113,12,15,210,104,152,0.044,0.789,0.16699999999999998,0.9661,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,1,2,6,5,0,1,5,1,14,3,0,2,1,28,21,15,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,12,8,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,13,4,19,20,10,12,0,0,0,1,10,8,0,8,3,87,25,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18219489960235785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12679108358962635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13036882815851736,0.0,0.15343087812470652,0.16597831474495872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12024358297428878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16316196561339705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17041016143137389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563837981232694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497221354262232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16572361454111578,0.0,0.0,0.10246698518370492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316937882716794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16827666579602465,0.0,0.12445553688642035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878268187675976,0.0,0.0,0.18825940391247328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27412157409640264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20190509442053586,0.0,0.3877788545894648,0.0,0.0,0.20466399545021785,0.17625369484624195,0.210192188587728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21063325277525166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13196890610036116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19491600868942768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16296383431259734,0.1716563360344617,0.0,0.0,0.12386781533411605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997190448172313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573641812890472,0.0,0.0,0.13244736199205226,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,lets_get_outside,2018/03/21,"I don't understand what I don't understand Male, 40 recently diagnosed with autism.  I am working with a therapist on my social skill and my inability to make friends.   As of now I have only one friend my wife.  I go to events, I take part in group workout classes, I go to autism meetups, I go to work events, however something seems to prevent me from making friendships.  I do not know what that is.  I know my therapist would be more than willing to help.  We have worked on stuff like reading emotions, increasing eye contact etc..... 

I do not seem to have much of an anxiety issue, but for some reason I seem incapable with making and/or keeping friendships.  

Any suggestions on things I can ask my therapist to help me with?

autism,BoltSlater,2018/03/22,"Diagnosed with autism after years of being treated for depression, and now sleep apnea Hi, I was diagnosed with autism this past year at the age of 31, and I'm still sort of catching up to what it is that I have.

After failing the 10th grade I was diagnosed with depression and I've been on antidepressants ever since. Recently I decided to go off of them after discovering that their side-effects were behind some long-standing issues like elevated blood pressure and acid reflux that was making it difficult to breath at night.

I was also diagnosed last year with severe sleep apnea, so I've been using a CPAP machine to sleep at night and finding that I'm still quite fatigued during the day and finding it difficult to work and concentrate.

I guess the point of this post is that I'm wondering if anyone else with autism has similar issues with sleep apnea and executive dysfunction and how best to approach them. It's really difficult to figure out what may be connected and what should be treated separately on its own.

I dunno, is any of that relatable?",13.155032632342277,8.756562487309647,12.1572878897752,58.02634517766498,56.106598984771566,15.927193618564177,45.401740391588106,13.484332010920856,5.971044089920232,858,34,142,23,7,280,112,197,0.14,0.828,0.033,-0.9628,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,3,4,7,12,0,1,5,0,17,11,6,3,1,33,25,14,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,2,5,0,0,0,16,17,0,0,5,0,0,3,0,8,0,0,7,1,10,4,32,13,3,30,0,4,0,0,4,9,0,7,18,101,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426380634543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08015837153803726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08242025124047417,0.12077585696795068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370150536070645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601898750478417,0.0,0.2030494309342998,0.4785585716027936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984686133673829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10662379400564946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2154694265108493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0669905185186761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12985151556714758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24605969180527204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608305378018517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05758728915507981,0.0,0.0,0.10431479304064777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07868181959858098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2212335541191987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11252408400970194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11142904340311853,0.0,0.11289072194878155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12537352320350575,0.0,0.0,0.07551311165403195,0.0,0.11638636831939166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13316408422591422,0.0,0.09750660239139908,0.0,0.4718365644941651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882686795617938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180530186632496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12782933992787465,0.08581368600677627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277210009401414

I mean am I right in thinking that there is only one autism genotype, although it can, essentially, develop into more severe cases under certain circumstances?",8.151896551724139,10.037297810344832,7.765000000000002,65.21750000000002,62.27586206896552,9.937931034482759,36.91379310344829,10.125756701596842,4.372158620689655,275,13,37,6,4,87,52,58,0.086,0.828,0.086,0.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,2,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,5,0,0,1,3,13,8,4,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,4,1,6,5,2,7,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,3,2,30,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791564197913411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17365721333239426,0.19490716026573734,0.0,0.0,0.2845608323018891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5741688088837118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21885573687718768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5790310766942579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16420938689509554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18204898231667768,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’m not doing a research study or anything, I just really want to try to relate to my students as much as possible. And of course help them function successfully as much as possible. I have several students with Autism and just want the absolute best for them! Thank you for your help.

autism,damnitjanet6,2018/03/23,"getting diagnosed? ok so  this has come completely out of the blue for me.  i am 20 and female, and a student at university. I've suffered from depression and a generalised anxiety disorder for literally years, really becoming conscious of it at around ten although i'm sure it was there before. While trying to sort out an inclusive learning plan with my uni's disability advisor the other day, she told me that the symptoms that I am experiencing seem to indicate that my anxiety may actually be rooted in the fact that I am somewhere on the autistic spectrum. I tend to function passably in social situations, the only visible sign of distress being hand wringing or bouncing my legs, and then completely break down when i get home, having series of panic attacks and then breaking down into a depressive state that can last up to three days after and be impossible to break. 

I've booked an appointment with her for a preliminary assesment type thing, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions over the types of questions that might be asked, the kind of things I'll need to know to get a proper diagnoses etc? I'm a little bit in a state of shock- this isn't something i've ever really thought of as a possibility for me and potentially getting diagnosed reall yfreaks me out. all of the websites i've looked at seem to completely contradict each other.

Edit: also, I'm on lexapro for depression - would that change with a diagnosis of autism?",8.833242375601928,8.523551823970042,9.348980738362762,62.00334269662922,60.722846441947574,13.02182985553772,40.79427501337615,12.28987398476788,5.437712894596041,1175,58,188,36,14,396,165,267,0.113,0.867,0.02,-0.9688,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,6,11,1,2,20,1,17,7,3,1,4,39,35,18,0,3,3,0,1,0,0,3,4,0,1,0,15,17,0,0,8,1,0,1,1,8,0,2,5,4,15,3,46,23,4,34,0,4,2,1,7,18,1,9,10,137,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.11290921607950552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09252746573073672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07868185322729628,0.0,0.1770246092380085,0.0,0.0,0.0809020690743771,0.0,0.0,0.1029999983433008,0.10816647398770016,0.1316286076322059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12778462242481795,0.09845453787374554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263174613125999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12239819214735725,0.09966769387801468,0.3639364683213023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14923743341020354,0.0,0.29896388641847776,0.3523076370786282,0.0,0.0,0.13260540182584854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290391764928267,0.0,0.10465978224755992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2417996936548789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11605931510244433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048663321137908,0.06358721812775361,0.09431320260261934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11596457471110938,0.0,0.0,0.0971611887951312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274235774883245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579214008243914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08799717259974865,0.0,0.13575227450890068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13043749184691802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961358553437885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14824431818901346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21066291801398296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13005476455881396,0.0,0.11794440623497147,0.0,0.08907364734765484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090484942250559,0.1202594829019166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15373556230892813,0.0,0.0,0.09185507760199346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055895789296348,0.0,0.07855458790770975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547472172104296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08219193023328547,0.0,0.0,0.07450879231931032
autism,ReligiousProgress,2018/03/24,Volunteering With Spectrum Teens Not so sure how to start this out but I'm a NT teenager who volunteers at a center for people on the spectrum. Most of my volunteering is with kids under the age of 8 who I understand and work with very well. However on Friday nights for 3hrs is a sort of hangout for teens on the spectrum to help them make friends. I'm currently the only one not on the spectrum so I feel more responsible for starting up the conversations. A lot of the teens are nice but shy. I'm wondering the best way to approach them so they feel comfortable.

autism,BDSMKitten,2018/03/24,"Shouting and stress response When I am over stimulated or really scared, I shout at people and my words sound really angry. I really try hard not to, because I don't think it's a healthy response, but sometimes when I'm really scared it's hard to stop it - I'm talking heading towards a meltdown and desperately not wanting to be alone but being completely unable to regulate my voice. People think I am angry at them or that i am berating them because of the tone. It couldn't be farther from the truth and usually I am desperate to just have them close to me, but I don't expect NTs to understand what's going on. I get it. I really do. 

I need to be cautious, because sometimes those shouting fits come on quick and before I know it, and I don't want to alienate the only person who can help me. Can anyone recommend coping techniques or tips that might keep me from yelling or raising my voice? Right now my only alternative is to isolate until I know I won't shout again.",6.280343853038152,6.154140538860105,7.210240226095149,74.6191097503533,65.89119170984456,10.126990108337258,34.125765426283564,9.800150414767053,3.2901025906735755,776,32,143,15,11,261,103,193,0.191,0.752,0.057,-0.9684,0,1,0,0,1,0,16.0,0,0,3,0,6,4,0,3,5,0,19,1,1,1,1,34,33,16,0,5,10,0,2,0,0,2,0,8,0,1,11,8,0,2,5,0,0,2,7,3,0,0,0,10,25,1,20,26,0,20,0,0,0,0,7,10,0,5,8,101,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14824168805141602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000812915200477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.261755996909183,0.0,0.12179487396490632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232956293981318,0.15007128246767604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07478061410235473,0.0,0.0813452702708384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2564364931642132,0.0,0.14689482705666648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593842878035944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272223860022617,0.0,0.0,0.15732331662721616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15184053792771884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10613063769513324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21771682194676195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19845955069509646,0.12497742787471253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4584704382290113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122234030378242,0.0,0.0,0.2866004011396302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2831226113301599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196648436901354,0.1639573356677507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11504415932770508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18342653907574852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09717729969799592,0.0,0.0,0.14900556275283885,0.0,0.0,0.1576397853595441,0.0,0.16884604068186693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,MisterMaxy,2018/03/25,"HFA going away to college So I may be going to stay away at college in a few months, and I'm somewhat nervous.  I'm a high functioning autistic with a long history of depression and even a few suicide attempts. 

The antidepressants never really helped, some even did more harm than good.  I've been keeping myself stable by smoking pot every so often, but I know I can't be doing that at an away campus, especially since my state doesn't offer medicinal (just for terminal patients I think).  I want to go to school, but I'm scared i could relapse if I don't have the one thing that allows me to act somewhat 'normal' (able to socialize, not afraid to speak up, capable of smiling, ect.)

I've tried DBT and CBT when in the psych ward, and months of therapy felt like a waste of time, I believe my problem is beyond positive thinking, so I was wondering if anyone had any sort of medication or something that works for them.  I've read that antipsychotics or even that electric shock therapy thing could work, but id like to consider less-insane sounding options if there are any.

autism,DuperMarioBro,2018/03/25,"Help requested with Autistic stepson Hey everyone!  My step son is high-functioning, however has a myriad of social disorders.  He has trouble ""hanging out"", and the only thing he enjoys is his tablet.  When we're doing things together as a family he'll stay for maybe 30 minutes and, every time, say ""I have to use the bathroom"" and not come back.

I've tried doing many things, from building a computer with and for him to putting him into guitar lessons.  He's wanted these things, however whenever anything presents even the slightest bit of challenge he immediately quits and wants to go to youtube (something that requires no effort).    This of course happens with guitar, as that requires learning and practice, but even with the computer -- if something is slow or doesn't work perfectly he drops it.

Has anyone else dealt with this?  What steps have you taken to get past it or what might some other solutions be?  He wants to quit everything, and my fiance and I are worried that depression could make him want to quit life down the road.

autism,tbearbee2003,2018/03/25,"Really in need of resources! Please help! I'm posting to get help for a good friend of mine. I'm not as versed on all of the symptoms, so please forgive me if some of this sounds ignorant. 
I'll call my friend ""Alice"" and her son ""Art"". Alice is a mom to precious 4 year old Art who was diagnosed at about age 3, along with Asberger's syndrome. Since then, Alice has had to quit working to be fully devoted to Art. Alice's husband, Tom, is the sole bread winner in the household, which is a bit of a strain. Art has social issues and did not begin to communicate vocally until just recently. Art is an only child. Art has been going to therapy since he was diagnosed, but the treatments don't seem to be helping Art to progress... at all. Art will make progress, and then have regressions such as pottying. Alice seems to be slipping into depression and is totally overwhelmed. Her life completely is absorbed into Art, and has no time for anything else because it is difficult to find caregivers who can deal with Art. In our city, there is not a big focus on mental health and individuals who struggle with developmental issues, although we have a HUGE population of such. I love Alice, and I want to see her have a better sense of well being. I asked Alice if she could find adequate therapy that would help Art progress, would she be willing to relocate. It's not out of the question but, it's not simple because Alice and Tom have purchased a home. PLEASE, if anyone has some resources that I can pass on to Alice, or clinical trials, or names of therapy centers that are in the southern US that have had overwhelming success with children with autism, please pass on the info.

autism,asleepyeyedghostboy,2018/03/26,"Is my social behavior similar to others diagnosed with Autism/ASD? Hi, r/autism. Even though I have been diagnosed, I have not talked with any of my counselors about it much. When they have attempted to get onto the subject, I have shut them down or ignored them. I am not sure why I seem to latch onto avoidance when working with my counselors, but I can assume that I am afraid of opening up to the point where I would be completely vulnerable.

When I was a young child, my stuffed animals took the place of friends. I never noticed being alone, but as I have been looking back recently, the realization that I never spent as much time with kids my own age as most others seem to. I was content with my life of stuffed animals, books on tape, and staying at home with my mother all of the time.

My attachment to stuffed animals has continued on into adulthood -- I am twenty-five now, and I am still very close with them. Is this normal for those diagnosed autistic?

My favorite stuffed animal is Ellis Ears. He is a brown rabbit, and he seems to be my truest friend. My few friendships have not lasted long, and everyone seems to leave me, but Ears is always a comfort. We have been watching movies and reading together for most of my life. I cannot carry him around like I used to, but I still take him to the movies or class when I can. He tends to stay in my bag, but being able to touch and see him makes me feel a pleasant sense of being protected.

This could be due to something else about me that has not been noticed by my counselors, but maybe some of the posters here will recognize this behavior.

Take care.",5.962848495039518,6.3170618242811525,5.876909366066929,82.26948209181101,66.53993610223642,9.273179754498065,31.809147469312247,9.134995656068208,2.554831309904153,1273,48,250,21,19,399,164,313,0.028,0.836,0.136,0.9906,0,2,1,0,0,0,39.0,1,0,4,2,15,11,0,2,11,0,36,7,2,2,5,51,52,22,0,3,12,1,2,1,2,2,5,2,1,2,10,18,0,3,6,2,1,1,7,3,0,0,8,8,44,8,46,35,8,38,0,0,4,0,19,16,0,10,20,187,54,4,0.1135986081848944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11765389853184972,0.0,0.0,0.0945231422045978,0.0,0.0,0.07725094902798851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10112684558808592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735031767057355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11582135199486007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11910597937789645,0.0,0.0,0.0906992450327614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3459005882272532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09489706048345532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07503080933213277,0.0,0.0,0.10854833828207143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574388695545496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17553200578023592,0.0,0.05935058416696039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11394866627381127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259802747495173,0.0,0.12028452372364418,0.0,0.0,0.1604761129419132,0.05549854187180055,0.0,0.0,0.10053119350390397,0.09539422033475364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582795307106606,0.0,0.11412507061244365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16701609567855874,0.0,0.1752284995284895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11130251675291536,0.0,0.2586655366900156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11868636732195514,0.0,0.10738740304981254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362934958158795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121649209443779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905233830619786,0.4136636257047332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11579947523444015,0.0,0.08745375850658722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2421620030986589,0.181439990475522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706534382995707,0.0,0.1708240316676345,0.09130625822021916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11161005577002173,0.0,0.13248052393683946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12621223352828184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981127240281137,0.0,0.0937307487612174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10250507475366036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08270113971149677,0.0,0.0,0.08069719195125402,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm a student currently working on compiling a resource for employers looking to hire people with ASD. I'm neurotypical, so most my information is coming from research. I'm currently working on the retention piece of it.

So for people with ASD: what would make a job more welcoming/enjoyable for you?

autism,jojopadre,2018/03/26,"California schools My son is going to be 8 yo and is still non-verbal.  Due to behavioral issues, His school has him isolated in his own classroom one-on-one with a teacher and handler. But he is still not progressing.  So they want to send him away to a school in a psychiatric hospital in South Carolina 24 hour care), a few hours away.  We are not at all convinced this is good for him.  We have a lot of family in California and would prefer to find something out there (w/potential to relocate).  Does anybody know of any high-care facilities that might be good for him in the state?  Alternatively, can anybody recommend any online resources that could help us find such a facility?

autism,a_confused_taco,2018/03/27,"Help - struggling with life Hello Reddit.

I'm a mid 30's male, with a professional job, who is struggling daily with life.  I have been in and out of mental health for depression and anxiety since my early teen's.  I have recently been diagnosed with sensory processing disorder (also being treated for it), but there's things that SPD doesn't explain about myself, and frankly, I'm scared because the more I read about ASD, the more it makes sense that I may be at the high functioning end.  The therapist I've been working with says ""you have signs but not strong signs"".

I realize that this is not the place to get a diagnosis - I am working with a therapist, but I'm looking for support and possible pointers or resources, or just something to tell me I'm not crazy... 

A few things about me:
- Been dealing with this since as long as I can remember

- Small events can trigger emotional changes for days (for example, a disagreement can lead me into despair, even if it's minor in the scheme of life)

- I am very black and white thinking.  Things must be one way or the other, I do very poorly in the grey area.  I work in IT which helps me, generally computers either work or they don't :)

- I don't like changes to my schedule and it can take me months to get used to any changes.  I am extremely apprehensive about changing plans

- When people are late to meet me I get rather upset, and if I'm late, I get really anxious. Even if I'm not late, being on time is so important my stress level will be very high

- Socially I want to talk to people and do a decent job, but I am far more comfortable alone.  I tend to play online games where I can interact with other people but am not forced to be in direct contact with them

- According to others I have a high vocab, but terrible handwriting and spelling

- I hate any form of confrontation and avoid it as much as I can.

- I feel like I'm still a child internally, like my ability to process life is not at the level of a 34 year old

I'm at a point in my life where I can barely do my job without wanting to quit, scream, or break stuff. I don't want to go be with people most of the time, but I also feel lonely.  I am not aggressive toward others - I direct this all inward.  I am not overworked, but I am not able to deal with my situation. It's been like this for years, but it's getting worse and worse.  This is a daily issue for me. 

It feels like I'm on a tightrope and managing staying balanced is such a struggle that it's almost not worth it.

autism,LizzyCorsaire,2018/03/27,"Teenager with autism starts having agressive outbursts after not having them for a few years. (advice is appreciated) It's about a family member who I'm really close with.
Can this happen randomly? Or is there a reason I should look for?

He's made great progress at school and with friends, I was really proud of him. Is there something I can do to help? His parents already have a lot on their plate.

autism,Emi2688,2018/03/27,"My boss told me that aggression a symptom of being on the spectrum. Is this true? I hope that my question doesn't offend anyone here. I tried looking for reputable sources (mainly studies), but could not find an answer.

Without going too much into it, my boss told a few of my colleagues and I that the harassment and threats we were receiving from a coworker is due to said coworker being on the spectrum. My boss further stated that we were harassing said coworker for reporting their behavior to him and that we should be more understanding of ""their condition."" 

I'll admit that I don't know much about autism and ASD, but my boss's claim doesn't seem correct to me. I have a hard time believing that everyone who is aneurotypical is verbally and physically aggressive.

autism,DontGoPokingMyHeart,2018/03/27,"Anxiety management -low functioning 17f Hello! I'm the nanny/caregiver for a low functioning 17 year old and our current struggle is managing her anxiety. She's actually become anxious about her schedule (whereas before I started working with her she was in desperate need of a schedule!) But now, she feels the need to have everything done because that means she can go to bed (that's another issue -trying to keep her active but not overstimulated). I feel that her anxiety is our major obstacle at this point. She has a lot of anxiety about being separated from mom and about doing anything engaging that requires her to think (homework, working with the therapist, etc). I thought the schedule was helping but even that had turned into a source of anxiety... When I come over she knows I'm going to make her get out of bed and do things so that had become a source of anxiety, when mom leaves she knows she's going to be left with a caregiver who is going to ask her to do things so that had become a source of anxiety... If it were up to her she would lay in bed all day staring at the ceiling and anything that doesn't allow that causes her anxiety... Any suggestions?",6.9756108597285085,7.308454796380088,7.5386425339366525,71.29312217194574,64.38461538461539,11.143891402714932,36.90950226244344,10.891193690592663,4.268802714932127,934,44,161,24,13,309,120,221,0.103,0.861,0.035,-0.8331,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,2,0,0,3,9,4,0,1,12,0,20,0,0,3,1,32,42,12,0,4,5,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,14,10,0,2,7,0,0,5,2,3,0,0,8,3,25,1,31,31,4,28,0,2,1,0,28,12,0,2,11,120,39,6,0.0,0.0,0.0988701883148038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06889862418372222,0.10623907609586752,0.6200541305465102,0.11445868993854375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16674952387515582,0.0,0.0947171543993513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06176153516941672,0.3356880010746378,0.08621279146221165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407984850897643,0.0,0.08727510476808799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06534069430831461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10368185033703926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11299456433077427,0.06691852461905916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910566446205938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10245722898609166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05293363570358526,0.0,0.23032177279703075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679102451884518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574799554410376,0.0,0.09005466877775442,0.0,0.0,0.11136168417427628,0.0,0.0,0.10727943539115342,0.1100805616867093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861355775412827,0.0,0.0,0.06762948166981685,0.0,0.0,0.1103632581507276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373210790857865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15024964906156016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10631451530097467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577674343022362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07171226720306716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591789619489272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763614576907787,0.13462022431776452,0.06491945616089416,0.0,0.08043390199242081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06878718291656645,0.11020314609853203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14751908724081825,0.0,0.0,0.07197226145295313,0.0,0.0,0.06524443781924344
autism,celestial-teapot,2018/03/27,"How to make ""April Fools"" less difficult To be fair, my anxiety surrounding April 1st has diminished as my peers have grown up, but in recent years I've met adults who also take part in pranking other people on this day. I am not good at laughing at myself or being the center of attention. Why do people take such an issue with this? It takes zero effort to leave me alone!!! In the past, my requests that people respect my space by not pranking me have yielded mixed results. Does anyone else have experience/advice?

Bedtime used to be the best time with good, deep cuddles and a calm, ordered sequence of events that have my husband and I time to breathe and then sleep before starting the next day. Now, bedtime is essentially a horror show as we wait for the next time she climbs out of bed.

It really just made everything so awful, it felt like everything was so loud and I was having a panic attack and then U just.... couldn't talk. I was lying on the couch meditating bc its the only thing that helps my anxiety and the bird was screaming so I couldn't meditate my anxiety away and it just all piled up and I start sobbing but i cant even tell my boyfriend what's wrong so I have to skype message him and then ask him to explain it to my mom.
I think my parents have absolutely no idea how fucking awful sensory overload is. 11 days of the loudest fucking bird in the world. It's been horrible.
Idk what exactly I'm looking for, maybe advice but mostly support or something.",3.461571960875645,5.361259004424781,4.660451793199815,82.8352934326968,74.0,7.766744294364232,27.823940381928267,8.532816995589336,2.132207079646018,909,36,173,17,19,299,130,226,0.239,0.701,0.061,-0.9934,2,0,2,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,0,13,13,3,1,10,2,23,2,0,2,4,35,36,22,0,2,9,3,1,1,0,1,0,3,1,0,12,10,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,10,0,0,14,5,18,3,19,17,2,26,0,1,1,2,16,12,3,5,14,117,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13369927132784573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20933440030179185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279085662860086,0.15565291040524748,0.12854723114320146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116424048224169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14785420176966246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.176475625394551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14294815443925454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903685567443256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459306329058069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13136900094964704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2529764344266273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917078025967984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15445353149395888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14247734942758822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06684351635030639,0.13712994372869552,0.0,0.0,0.1148946424826848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294627318756637,0.0,0.0,0.13745444053438974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14514477937038767,0.0,0.16024235085930386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21104859115629665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10405804839063336,0.0,0.16052921170817347,0.15192281708572078,0.0,0.1306105142239064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12933946351524575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15327011490433293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08765062546903282,0.0,0.13509359839390506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1545680613174565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106619936118028,0.0,0.0,0.0968421543196857,0.0,0.10926491544557508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15526212201296008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997102191129167,0.11958702437850285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089736698056916,0.17533792298270798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12968970235933694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29918316832111796,0.0,0.0

autism,OhGoOnYou,2018/03/27,"I'm looking for headphones for my daughter, but I don't know the terms. Your help is appreciated with recommendations and terminology. I am in the process of having my daughter assessed for kindergarten. She is currently 4.5 years old. It is likely that she has a sensory processing disorder and potentially autism. She may have a sensory processing disorder called hyperacusis and phonophobia. Basically, as I understand it, she interprets sounds over a certain loudness and in a certain range as pain.

I am looking for headphones that she can wear to school. She currently has a set of, what I consider, huge Snug brand ear muffs. These muffle all sounds, but I want her to be able to interact with people while ""throwing away"" louder, treble sounds: women raising their voices, babies crying, bathroom hand dryers, auto-flushing toilets.

I have found these headphones which are made by Vibes:

http://www.discovervibes.com/how-they-work-1

I have purchased a pair and tried them out myself. They were originally made for concerts, I guess. They have a cut-off that allows you to hear people and music while limiting sound above a certain range. They are actually pretty cool; however, they don't make a size small enough for my daughter's ears. I have modified them so they might work, I am also worried that:

* They will be easily lost
* They will fall out of her ears easily and easily lost
* They have no loops to tie them together to avoid the first two bullet points
* I am reinventing the wheel

So, what does everyone here use as a headphones that allow you to hear but limit loud noises? Any help you can give with terminology so that I can google search is helpful as well.

autism,Twisplet,2018/03/28,"Got my diagnosis today (at 35!) Good&amp;Bad (AFAB and 35)

Diagnosis confirmed. I am, indeed, autistic. 

I'm in the UK, SWEngland. If anyone has links to this area specific for adult support or communities I would be grateful. 

I'm so relieved and happy, there's a huge amount of peace of mind from this. I have a label, a thing that explains why all of x happened/happens. It's so nice. It also means I can now access support to get back into work, which is something I desperately want and need, because I'm going mad not working, but getting into work is a process that I can't do unsupported. 

But my mother... 

Basically she spent half an hour yelling at me, kicked me out of the car in the middle of nowhere, picked me up again 5 mins later, gave me a blow by blow of how my undiagnosed autism has hurt her over the years, yelled some more and kicked me out of the car again in the estate where we live and drove off. 

All because when I tried to talk to her about the diagnosis and the appointment I had just finished she said 'you're not autistic you're aspergers, it's a spectrum' and I tried to correct her. 

(She's done the 'everyone's a little autistic!' and 'it's a spectrum, everyone's on it!' dismissive stuff before, when she first found out I wanted diagnosing she was constantly saying 'you have some traits but I don't think you are' and 'if you are you know it's going to be very high functioning, just a little bit autistic'  like no Mum, you're wrong on many levels here including *not being in my head so not knowing my difficulties*)

I was low on spoons anyway and just said I didn't want to argue with her and she just started ranting. And that made me shut down and then she started ranting about my lack of response. 

Yes she's tired and depressed and has chronic pain. But none of that excuses this. *I'm* depressed and tired and in pain, I'm not taking it out on anyone.

I'm just tired and upset by this whole thing, especially as it's such whiplash from how I felt after getting the diagnosis. 

TLDR; Got diagnosed yay! Mum threw a horrendously wobbly.

autism,ladystardust6969,2018/03/28,"Advice on having an autistic partner, please? I'm dating a 29 year old with autism, and have been for about a year now. He's a great person, very smart, and very enthusiastic about everything he does. Sometimes, though, he gets angry at me over things I don't understand.

Example, two nights ago I was encouraging about a program he'd been designing, I took his hands in mine and said he could do, he was definitely smart enough, and if he needed some extra time to himself that I would understand and support it. Well, apparently that had been bugging him and last night he ended up screaming at me for trying to make him choose between me, and his computer. This was not my intention at all and it totally blindsided me. Apparently, in his eyes, what I did was so aggressive, he felt compelled to delete his life's work.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have a four year old son with autism, and I understand him, and how to work with him during his hard times. I just don't know how to ha deal it when it's your partner, and an adult. I'm not sure how much of his anger is because of being on the spectrum, and since I'm closer to him than anyone, I get the brunt of the stress and outbursts, and how much, if any, is him actually hating me. 

If anyone has any advice on how to understand a partner with autism, I would really like to know. I want to understand him more, so badly.

autism,just_some_mom,2018/03/28,"Discipline- Am I too lax? We have a 4.5 year old who is very bright and HFA. I want to reiterate that he is a very smart kid and add that he has many of the challenges typical of kids with Aspergers/HFA.

Our son is currently in ppcd. We have been hoping to mainstream him, which would not be a problem if it weren’t for the hitting.

Aggression is currently the great potential impediment to our son’s academic future, and it is frustrating. Frustrating for me, my husband and my son’s teachers. And most notably frustrating to our son, who does not want to hit. He frequently laments that he can’t stop hitting and he doesn’t know why. His teachers agree that it’s an impulse thing and we all keep trying to use the same language and use other normal strategies to decrease the hitting. We’ve tried a number of systems at home, too. The most recent is screen privileges; if he hits at school he gets none and if he doesn’t he can get a cartoon after school. If he has more non-hitting days than hitting days in a week he gets pizza and a movie on Friday.

Well yesterday he did not hit but today he hit the aid in his class a couple of times. My husband was talking to my son about it and apparently after he reminded our son that we don’t hit teachers or there are consequences our son smiled. My husband asked our son if he was smiling because the consequences weren’t bad enough and he said our son said yes. So he asked our son what a hard punishment would be and he said “leaving me in my room for six days.” Then he started crying because he is afraid to be left in his room (he thinks a cat-monster will attack him). So my husband told him the next time he hits he’s going to be kept in his room for three days without toys and will be let out for school and food and therapy. When my husband solemnly told me about this new plan I laughed at him (it’s not going to happen) and told him to not say stuff to our son like that since we would never follow through on it. But this brought to light the dramatically different ways we view behaviors and best consequences. I know lots and lots of kids with HFA and adhd and even some NT kids struggle with impulsive hitting and the standard advice is to not react/enforce natural consequences in the moment and perhaps do some other work (social, emotional, diet, sleep) on the side. So I guess I would ask parents here if they have done anything about aggression outside of that which would look more like traditional discipline, and how did that go for you? I would also ask anyone on the spectrum who struggled with hitting as a child if they have any advice about what they found most helpful. And everyone- do you think I should work with my husband to find some more “discipline-ish” ways to respond to hitting?

autism,SingingSnakess,2018/03/29,"Therapist thinks I might be autistic, but I don't think so I'm a 20 years old woman from Norway, currently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (bpd), anorexia, depression, general anxiety, and other dissociative identity disorder-1b (osdd-1b).
Recently my therapist has been wondering wheather or not I might be autistic, but I strongly feel like this is wrong. Havent been diagnosed yet, but she's thinking about it.
The reason she thinks so is because I said during therapy one day that I am extremely clumsy, that I've always been doing everything my own way (for example; I never crawled as a baby, I sat on my but and used my hands to drag myself around) and feel uncomfortable and anxious when I have to do things not my way. I've also been having a hard time getting friends. I also have intense ""obsessions"" that I just can't get rid of (like music, crystals, a tv show, and such). Also, my therapist is testing/checking if I have executive functioning problems, which I believe I have, after taking the test and reading about it. She said that autistic people may struggle with executive function.So there's quite a few symptoms I can relate to to some degree.
However, there are several reasons why I don't think I am autistic. There are three main big ones. 1) I understand sarcasm and irony extremely well. I comunicate with it everyday, it's how I am. 2) I don't really struggle at all with expressing myself verbally. I can describe how I feel very well, to the point of people being blown away and realizing stuff they didn't think about before. Past therapists tell me that they use what I've said in therapy with other patients, and that they found my words/way of explaining things extremely helpful, and many of them started crying because they finally felt like my words had perfectly explained how they felt. Comunication is my greatest strength. And 3) I am extremely empathic. I am a hyper emotional being (one reason I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder). And with empathic I mean that I am able to tell what everyone else is feeling, even when they might not know how they're feeling themselves. It almost feels like I am feeling their feelings myself. I am very good at picking up small signs and signals in tone of voice, facial expressions, and in peoples body language.
My question is; what do you think? I know you can't diagnose me, but I would like some insight from someone else who is autistic. How does this sound to you? Could I be autistic, from your perspective?
Thanks in advance :)",7.014114244396239,8.19103728416486,7.373498915401303,69.56798517715116,64.44468546637745,11.005668835864064,37.92631959508316,10.93419730881044,4.651334866232827,2032,104,327,56,30,663,239,461,0.087,0.773,0.14,0.9806,2,0,0,0,0,0,75.0,0,4,8,5,25,19,0,3,9,0,51,8,3,11,3,88,89,34,0,4,11,0,12,5,1,5,5,5,0,3,24,22,0,0,31,3,0,1,11,6,2,4,14,17,63,13,38,64,7,31,0,1,0,0,31,13,0,11,20,242,87,2,0.06754205327081847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06763360992134365,0.0,0.0,0.16204006679520547,0.0562003990023976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05166948588144666,0.0763032951149075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06012674715788097,0.0,0.0,0.06345798239636825,0.0,0.0,0.08234601754243527,0.0,0.057473312626181626,0.07609676486625462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502399491791055,0.0850668516729321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05392683358985367,0.0,0.07419177398750645,0.04355903674502356,0.0,0.0581738715118158,0.27421504928331475,0.0,0.0,0.15481808923486426,0.0,0.05910650597515822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284543740158115,0.07597571901783635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044610889181100115,0.0,0.0,0.0645393263513716,0.060702442343075626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732103323628473,0.0965041127044262,0.1297019262967156,0.0739890179286999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405637520856669,0.052182822811727085,0.0,0.0705758702771163,0.0,0.0,0.056651069772550015,0.054019550084663116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050441311936969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045272014582050636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07423869220070017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16498817773615784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06847704087215918,0.0,0.07357309664333231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21495433481449847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05209259531796187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07087402311143236,0.0,0.13730472989515308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06447653238962515,0.1404754662011148,0.1179502313952732,0.0,0.0,0.0638490718618661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06462862322663335,0.0,0.0,0.07566255738836968,0.07183928756918632,0.06756033110966063,0.0,0.04326916883840419,0.2083334396264656,0.06668962927091304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19274387890535166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763032951149075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0572281625541172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04780661294212568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14121923806132045,0.0773194917004201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020205473868678,0.0507832183474127,0.0,0.11806946319040101,0.062183648090726365,0.15448044852698248,0.3136861186028853,0.08974387798837077,0.3029475435515299,0.0,0.0,0.039384314421018585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0703136594533658,0.0,0.11666929619535862,0.0,0.11145853504894744,0.0,0.16083521418772434,0.0,0.0,0.12145683472994682,0.0,0.06094619758256499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07324647562110685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047979936767410414,0.07384663232248583,0.0,0.04349486785320533

autism,grimtuesday25,2018/03/29,"Advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. First post here, sorry if this comes off as ignorant or intolerant but I'm at my wit's end. 

I've been watching my 11 year old cousin after school to avoid disciplinary action at the after school program he was in. He's diagnosed ASD. He's a great kid, mostly, the best description of him would be that he's all ID, pure impulsiveness and desires. Unfortunately his desires *never* lie in stopping whatever he's doing to use the restroom. He understands what his body is telling him and chooses to BM in his underpants. 

Has anyone else had an issue with their child/a child in their care? How did you resolve this issue? So far I've tried to have him use the restroom at regular intervals (every 45 minutes) and while that cut down the incidents, it doesn't solve the problem of making him recognize it himself and take responsibility for his own bodily functions. 

Its to the point where I am about to resort to spanking him when he does it, but, I don't want to resort to that, and I don't know that his parents would approve.

autism,Lalalaura4368,2018/03/29,"Bringing toy on school bus? My little sister (6 years old + in Kindergarten) takes the bus to school each morning. Picking one of her small stuffed animals to take on the bus is part of her morning routine and without it, getting her on the bus is a challenge / might not happen at all. 

Her bus driver doesnt seem to understand children with special needs. She asked us not to send my sister with a variety of other small toys because they were too distracting for the driver. The stuffed animal was working for the past couple of months and this morning, the driver said no more stuffed animals because theyre now distracting her too. She says my sister throws the stuffed toy, but has never mentioned this before so we never got the chance to tell her not the throw it? 

So now we dont know what to do tomorrow. We dont want to driver to be distracted because that's not safe for anyone. However, my sister screaming for 30 minutes on the bus has got to be more distracting than her dropping a toy...

Does this sound like something we should mention to her team at school? We are worried we wont be able to get her off to school in the morning 

Edit: I just wanted to add that it's never been a problem for her to bring a toy on the bus the last 2 years with 2 other bus drivers",5.297633399209488,5.824227150197633,5.548416501976284,83.44697257905139,68.01185770750988,8.06413043478261,31.6227766798419,7.8658589789855275,2.1274666007905143,1011,40,196,11,16,321,128,253,0.094,0.871,0.036000000000000004,-0.9162,1,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,7,0,1,3,7,10,0,4,19,0,18,0,0,1,4,35,35,5,0,5,7,4,0,1,0,3,0,4,0,1,11,13,0,1,3,6,0,5,13,6,0,1,6,4,25,4,38,23,5,31,0,0,0,0,33,13,0,2,13,135,36,8,0.1257616226402952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793545065346732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11757014059752212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22998935365303366,0.0,0.10701387808570503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391528434271945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11005484346514187,0.0,0.29478337022146817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314105144199974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20116611633662296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11121058756667612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911529885253916,0.1025125076320176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061440776357118275,0.1260461846492966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13341320767692355,0.0,0.0,0.1003817273556171,0.0,0.0,0.09325064966804457,0.2909853490149193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13196566757899367,0.0,0.08521933023743981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13618758193877906,0.12005369903437857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033688838863435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962810225272585,0.10001069002548707,0.0,0.5091099048182937,0.0,0.11448865797550467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968174412654768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18911417799690586,0.0,0.10992120135551732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13092228439038178,0.15127574741609487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483549268090677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122971641127507,0.0,0.09155595909583154,0.12771703240565493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619727234471748
autism,1000bambuz,2018/03/29,"Question, do you have experience with anxierty and depression meds for persons with autism? My son who is a autistic young man, lives by himself, he goes through bouts of owerwhelm, anxierty and depression in some periods, he is not taking any medicine. 

We talked about it today and he explained that his doctor didnt really know about his situation, so I thought to have a talk with him soon and look into possibilities of handeling theese owerwhelming emotions based on the experience of others in a similar situation. (He did some theraphy on and of over the years but is not motivatet to take that route at the moment)

He lives by himself and has a flexible job where he can come 2-3 times a week. 

So my question is, does anyone on here have experience with meds for anxierty, and depression for persons with diagnosed autistism?

autism,tev81,2018/03/29,"What is everyone's opinion on ABA therapy? Long story short, my son is 4 and diagnosed with high functioning autism.  He is in early education and has been doing ABA in home therapy for about four months.

It's been very exhaustive for him and I think he is getting burnt out from therapy everyday.  (8:30am to 11:30am, school from 12:30pm to 3:30pm) and every other day more ABA from 3:45pm to 6:30pm.  

Just curious what everyone's thoughts are on this?  I'm brand new to the sub and this brought me here.

My son can't bear to be away from me for more than an hour or two. He shadows me around the house constantly and he worries about me going anywhere without him. Mostly, I am happy and to be his safe place; we have positive strategies in place to assist with separation anxiety and he is progressively more confident saying goodbye.

No one really knows why so many children with autism are picky eaters. But there's no doubt that it's a common phenomenon. Children with autism tend to select down, eliminating one food from their diet at a time.

autism,hibroka,2018/03/30,"Sensory rooms Correct me if this isn’t the right sub but I couldn’t seem to find one more fitting. 

I’m moving this weekend, and it’s going to be very stressful for me because it’s a big change from the house and neighborhood I’ve lived in for the past 7 years. 

However, my room has a pretty large walk in closet that happens to be the kind of size I find soothing and safe and I was wondering if anyone has done “DIY” sensory rooms and had any tips on how to make one. 

I’m already getting some lights with calm colors (like slowly changing ones or wave patterns). 

I have to keep a certain budget, so nothing fancy but the things I’m thinking I should get other than the lights would maybe me some spray that smells nice and not overwhelming, and maybe buying an app with sounds. 

What else would you recommend for a temporary/quick fix sensory room? If you or your kids have one, what’s some things that you all put in there?",4.347168399168397,5.4170129891891925,4.5027027027027025,88.12698544698547,70.45945945945945,7.638253638253639,26.66320166320166,7.882392219407189,1.389195426195426,733,23,151,9,13,228,120,185,0.026,0.845,0.129,0.9591,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,4,0,0,3,8,0,2,11,0,14,0,0,2,3,36,26,16,0,7,8,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,5,1,12,9,0,2,5,1,2,4,3,2,0,4,3,5,13,6,17,17,5,18,0,1,1,0,5,11,0,10,4,94,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16505899066978175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017156723597622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10458584811702663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117912222712446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3164596129662265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15306646893868991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12495015832805507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2734164525800452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15629282615802767,0.0,0.08500653770920016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322680845304233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17258869261342707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13294853550978575,0.0,0.155758645796714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307446151155196,0.0,0.13207687220917805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984202559755673,0.0,0.3005350338477856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15897383972931906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14352060203661074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4054217434545523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14278562104124118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15217086481304531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503635126385675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12773565909978327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361668508567109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17133688769778538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19874107490434464,0.09584119002183993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12341448553048827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622069786173046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21250662264078396,0.0,0.0,0.09632096343205264
autism,squeemom,2018/03/31,"Managing Parental Expectations My 9 year old son appears to have high functioning asd. His formal evaluation is scheduled for Monday but we feel like we already know. 

He's always been very smart and we just chalked up his odd behavior to being a young child. He talked in full sentences before age 1, scores 99th percentile and is in the gifted program.  Over the last two years things have started to point to ASD. Food issues, problems with certain sounds, issues with transitions, lack of any close friends, obsessed with certain subjects, talks loudly all the time, talks in a weird voice when having communication issues, outbursts at school when things don't go his way, refusing to do things he doesn't immediately understand. 

His dad is of a mind that our son can do anything anyone else can do and that he's capable of controlling his behavior. I agree to a certain extent but I realize he does and will have some certain limitations.

For instance, last night baseball practice ran late and was supposed to be over at 7. My son did really well and dealt with a lot of new and frustrating things (dear lord putting on catcher's gear!!!) but at about 715 he just walked off the field and quietly left. His coach thought he was mad but he told me he was tired, hungry, cold and frustrated and he couldn't ""take it anymore."" I explained that its ok to feel that way but he needs to communicate that to someone before he leaves. His dad says that it's simply unacceptable. He can and should power through those things and stick with it. He signed up for the sport and needs to listen to his coach and stay until he's told to leave. He was clearly overwhelmed and upset and if he had stayed he would have melted down. I'm proud of him for recognizing his triggers and walking away while dad is disappointed. 

How do we get dad to see that encouraging him to do things is great but expecting him to behave ""normally"" all the time is just not going to work? I feel like we have a really long bumpy road ahead of us parenting this child with such different thought processes.

autism,Rorshach25,2018/03/31,"Too obsessive? Hi all, well this week seemingly all week was a good week in short. But there was an awful lot of little things that normally anyone wouldnt focus on that I did. Small stuff like my keys where did they go, where did I leave my screw driver? Or why did this person say that thing this way? And It would get into my head and I would obsess about it and that whole thought would take over my brain and I would shut down and not be able to function for a while.

And It would frustrate me and I would pace back and forth. Thinking ""why am I focusing on this ive got work right now"" THen that thought would come back into my head quickly and it would start all over again.

autism,radmemethrowaway,2018/03/31,"ABA therapy abusive? Looking for info. Long post, TL;DR at end Hi everybody I’m 19 and I’m prof. dxed with ASD and some other things, and I have 2 younger brothers who are also autistic, “lower functioning” than me, and were dxed when they were like 3. They have been in ABA therapy ever since, along with some other types of therapy, and now they are 17. That’s some background info for you.

Everything I’ve heard about ABA therapy is very polarized. Autistic advocates online say that it is abusive and traumatizing. My dad says that no other therapy ever worked for my brothers, it was all ABA that got them where they are today. They have made a lot of progress — they used to literally be incapable of sitting still for ten seconds and they were totally nonverbal and used diapers for many years. But now they can talk (though one of them usually doesn’t want to, and you can’t get the other one to shut up!) and they’re potty trained and can do structured activities. They go on outings with their therapists to buy things at the store or get fast food at restaurants, and they’re learning how to prepare their own food (they usually don’t want to, but let’s be real, who does?). I think I went off on a tangent here but hopefully this gives an idea of the progress they’ve made under ABA. Also some other types of therapy; OT (occupational therapy?) and some others that I don’t recall. 

Some things about ABA always rubbed me the wrong way. For instance, my brothers were trained to say “good” when asked how they’re doing — I get that generally that’s what you’re supposed to say when casually asked how you’re doing, but what if they’re really being asked if they’re doing ok and they’re not? I feel as though they are being taught social norms but not how to actually communicate, if that makes sense. They were also taught gender roles such as “nail polish is for women” and I think that’s not very feminist but whatever. Again, they’re being taught to go along with societal norms instead of advocate for themselves. Rubs me the wrong way

A complicating factor is that, since I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 17 or 18, I never went through any of these therapies. A lot of the Autism Mom Stuff that my mom tried affected me by proxy (detoxing in sauna or with foot baths, hyperbaric oxygen, GFCF diet [which was before good gluten free food was invented so it was hellish] to name a few), but I was never in therapy like this. (I see a therapist now, but it’s more for like depression and anxiety, learning to cope with strong emotions and whatnot.) And because they were diagnosed so young, and I was also so young, I wasn’t involved in therapy matters and didn’t know much about it, so I’ve grown up pretty detached from what goes on between them and their therapists. 

Anyways I’d like to find some in depth, nuanced info about ABA so I can get a grasp on what it really is and form my own opinion, but I don’t really know where to look. Anyone got any recommendations?

TL;DR: need info about ABa therapy please, also here’s my entire life story.",5.920149638565313,6.574851979557074,6.297126939546023,78.17236659146374,66.68313458262351,9.75310097149961,30.68598922602329,9.77003265185595,2.8078779778074496,2420,87,456,50,37,781,259,587,0.054000000000000006,0.855,0.091,0.9728,1,0,0,0,0,0,73.0,0,2,19,4,38,15,1,0,14,1,47,9,1,10,6,96,84,59,0,7,18,6,3,4,0,0,4,5,1,2,37,30,4,0,14,2,3,5,14,4,0,4,27,11,47,12,69,51,17,51,1,1,3,0,46,20,0,17,26,311,84,9,0.0,0.12958789658853526,0.05336563148391128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21866180679395386,0.04550311919065066,0.0,0.0,0.07437668827392106,0.0,0.041834627801891705,0.0,0.0,0.03823771127300215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15337203791257506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033336068049525686,0.0,0.046533744263970465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04710095757631228,0.1110102445258129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047856072805030986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06151437106196534,0.048435549844466484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09893320606666536,0.0,0.0,0.049148235922359416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027650876457953527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04998199832613013,0.0,0.19837952545947665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428467748303775,0.05245977854757173,0.062158609482324184,0.09173601703533234,0.08747475355194133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05431552090174265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06173381912788482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060107972892191976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05592012335986137,0.03862632750106038,0.10686723724159136,0.0,0.0,0.04839537465317141,0.09184490648006294,0.0,0.0,0.09298413540158493,0.0,0.10349039994241467,0.03650331872280849,0.055443004105646766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12809512620256588,0.0,0.0,0.0402004902247574,0.04054896394490663,0.08435440373305628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07411327559664604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0600287881431967,0.0,0.0,0.05237405572428635,0.055635305327097935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224462166689379,0.10509972430179534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1739539564983171,0.0,0.0,0.04357764874229688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047362155146686,0.0,0.0,0.05574547355188564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04367229717505417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06260236775996281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04395452218096983,0.0,0.0,0.6879200704441114,0.19048392578090145,0.10899281275285516,0.07008114038555903,0.10745740253927856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051835918225758885,0.0,0.0,0.037128193208794014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09446226334514543,0.12045777000207533,0.09024332736376484,0.06451042003079584,0.08681437677961007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138890941798412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03981204739628137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11958107671993128,0.0,0.03521598051326235

autism,digitalbydesign,2018/04/01,"Potty Training Our son is diagnosed ASD and is 4.5 years old. We started potty training this weekend. The strategy we chose is to keep him naked and accept any/all accidents and reward peeing/pooping with his favorite things. First day went great actually, no accidents. Second day he actually pooped once but now is starting to fight going potty or pooping on day three. I know we need to stay the course but he’s starting up with self-injurious behavior because he is refusing to go potty now. Any and all suggestions, tips, insight would be appreciated.

autism,WeathersRabbits,2018/04/02,"I was scared of coming out as Autistic but I just posted my video anyway. It may seem small to other people but I've been struggling with telling anyone since my diagnosis. At first, I was excited and then I was depressed and felt shame. I'm not sure why except maybe it was because I feel like being Autistic is looked down upon. Then I could not stop thinking about trying to teach the next generation about what Autism really is and how it might benefit research if people were less negative about it. So, I posted my coming out video. No going back now! 

Anyone else doing something similar today? I'd love to see your work. 

Here's a link to my video if you are inclined to see it. https://youtu.be/q0nOlJK6qFo",3.683863247863247,6.219642525925927,4.193333333333332,83.4946153846154,75.5925925925926,6.524216524216524,22.97720797720798,7.61054688173877,1.1947891737891745,571,17,101,8,13,180,94,135,0.159,0.721,0.12,-0.7108,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,2,0,2,10,9,0,3,2,0,14,1,0,1,1,27,26,12,0,3,8,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,1,5,3,0,3,4,4,0,1,7,5,13,5,17,15,1,19,0,1,3,1,4,6,0,5,9,75,20,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2364464782761693,0.17324034816114928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001051275336886,0.0,0.10306835356344046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.291291378391058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13499499106029214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14562659703717026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14124293787654724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549089553313159,0.12078932661704225,0.1623413541586292,0.0,0.0,0.1438176242708286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09609089964686414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260294957402099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.141982900923178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15259945788247256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1698615339247547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793649937330022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17981632594240934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344347336521268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32385989162983386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10831566905915373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16927653133959752,0.0,0.2694664830514334,0.15392222237849848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139863033642388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301644720804602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14135674327470604,0.0,0.17675699193301134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593539739826004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14778158726234353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833832809341587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16026613393759614,0.0,0.0,0.11479283456976735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525665582443014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12309076676434133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,D-Philander,2018/04/02,"Au2gether: A New Peer Support Group for Adult Autistics in Sydney, Australia Hi Everyone!

[Au2gether](http://www.reddit.com/r/Au2gether) is a very new peer support group for Adults on the Autism spectrum and run by Autistics! Many Adult Autistics know that there are hardly any support groups or services tailored to our needs and we are often a forgotten demographic. Au2gether aims to bridge the gap by helping create social opportunities, being supportive of each other, sharing information about available services and helping each other self-advocate and reach our personal goals.

Our group meets up in real life at an autism friendly location in Hornsby every second Sunday of each month. We’re a friendly bunch of people. We welcome those who suspect they are autistic and seeking diagnosis, self-diagnosed and the neurodivergent. So if you live in Sydney (or the Central Coast) and are interested in finding support, please come along and meet others on the spectrum!

For more information please visit r/Au2gether.

Hope to see some new faces next week!",9.437235067437378,11.682104433526016,7.6983959537572275,65.5465920038536,59.578034682080926,9.234874759152216,40.42822736030829,9.516144504307137,4.4699175337186885,869,45,112,15,12,259,112,173,0.021,0.735,0.244,0.9902,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,5,1,1,2,4,12,0,0,10,0,6,2,1,0,0,28,16,12,0,3,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,4,6,15,0,0,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,2,7,12,22,15,6,19,0,0,1,0,29,9,0,6,7,72,13,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807668368725964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10230877950547354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205478022600682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006781182175108,0.11348865018658988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855250479842636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18352091534351875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10639349003839016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592164070065584,0.0,0.0,0.11796418792309522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06527221033889924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388989519877582,0.0,0.0,0.10487500052726764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12041289205659847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09480009970176324,0.0,0.0,0.08806553860611713,0.0,0.3441228566899054,0.12631193510731836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233931126324105,0.10370430950400683,0.0,0.2607448894075702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351848629197229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09464333325242977,0.0,0.24780346082161214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12106980488749378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6738869679334238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09799667435025014,0.0,0.0,0.09526914388316304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,thirdeyecenter,2018/04/02,"Common Symptom of Autism Impaired social interaction is the trait that most children with autism share, but there is a wide range of autistic behaviours, and kids can have varying combinations of symptoms. In addition to the well-known symptoms such as lack of language skills, failing to make eye contact, and lack of response to their name, there are a number of symptoms that may indicate having ASD as a child gets older. An inability to make friends or interact socially with other kids Lack of normal conversational skills -- i.e., starting or continuing a conversation Repeating phrases or repeating things from memory instead of coming up with original statements Obsessive-compulsive tendencies, such as having to line objects up in a certain way, or being incapable of deviating from a routine. http://www.thirdeyecenter.org/",16.269924812030073,13.547172984962408,13.681744360902258,44.348781954887244,48.47368421052632,16.955789473684213,56.67518796992482,14.83674596321566,8.48785834586466,689,40,83,21,5,213,90,133,0.13699999999999998,0.777,0.086,-0.8573,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,3,5,4,0,0,9,0,9,5,1,3,1,24,14,10,0,4,5,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,0,4,4,7,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,3,26,12,4,14,0,1,1,0,15,5,0,6,7,65,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16228070372214765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455491084618284,0.0,0.09842563552774533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515026457293911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18458151846366688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3840783407174643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13334291855791236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7832344766989546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12515748216843306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.149534660212809,0.0,0.0,0.16938460837314664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,sammy1215,2018/04/02,"4 things you can do to support autism acceptance month **1. Listen to as many autistic people as possible.** The best way I have found to do that is by reading blogs written by autistic people. emmashopebook.com, rhemashope.wordpress.com, autismspectrumexplained.com, daretolisten.org, kayliespeaks.blogspot.com, idoinautismland.com. Another way is to read books by autistic people. Some books are [Anatomy of Autism: A Pocket Guide for Educators, Parents, and Students by Diego Pena]( https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Autism-Educators-Parents-Students/dp/1544038089) and [The Reason I Jump by Naoki Higashida](https://www.amazon.com/Reason-Jump-Inner-Thirteen-Year-Old-Autism/dp/081298515X).

**2. Change your and other's assumptions about autistic people.** The reason I dislike the terms ""high functioning"" and ""low functioning"" is because these labels are based on a person's ability to communicate and need for support. Many of the blogs I cited are by people who are considered ""low functioning"", people who cannot speak and require lots of supports. Also, in the way you encourage neurotypical children to become parents one day, do the same for autistic children.

**3. Act to end discrimination.** If you work in HR, review and change your hiring practices to make sure the interview process accommodates people of different neurotypes. If you don't work in HR, you can bring this subject up to superiors. If you work at a school, you can ensure children have an age appropriate curriculum. If you make policies for your school or district, you can create policies to ensure all autistic children receive an age appropriate curriculum. You can call your government to change laws, such as how CPS deals with autistic parents.

**4. Make sure people are aware of autistic causes.** We must have a public discourse on autistic issues. Politicians should not ignore them.",7.640509246088192,11.841032021052635,5.88001896633476,66.62517780938833,74.40350877192982,7.431958274063537,31.913229018492174,8.358175599149588,3.512155049786628,1526,69,187,31,37,446,155,285,0.023,0.85,0.126,0.9797,5,0,0,0,0,0,102.0,1,14,1,5,4,12,0,0,14,0,23,0,0,7,4,36,34,17,0,7,6,3,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,5,7,9,0,2,4,6,0,4,3,3,0,1,2,2,20,9,38,30,6,23,0,2,0,0,34,10,0,7,6,124,27,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07213626317683552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945869648504365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054987640808426164,0.09962344780969323,0.0,0.0,0.09466373884129983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09210856983767496,0.0,0.0,0.09266455747105508,0.2862722370502888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058174244194919865,0.09299656551377312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424418613018362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798941438819159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09890424530716828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09530568592596972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09414974513246288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668838194637,0.0,0.0,0.1806360043958919,0.1829057938430012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07200012887405971,0.0,0.0,0.06688526856988082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465413001888524,0.0,0.06112469790363074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30048325507272305,0.0,0.0,0.5002898554752813,0.07876282485539401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169167787840913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804572136371705,0.0,0.0,0.2782348117967099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18258292481916646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3070879589181703,0.1700327749459399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05992765982928936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2147996770467578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19700918766026207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058088544944860626

autism,SpectrumThrowaway007,2018/04/03,"Echolalia and dealing with it? Our family is starting to look into the possibility the 8-1/2 year old may be on the spectrum. In researching a “habit” it seemed like my step-son was doing more and more - repeating lines of dialogue from commercials and cartoons - it seems like he is displaying symptoms of echolalia. While speaking to his mother about this issue we recognized multiple signs of autism.

We are going to be moving forward with a proper diagnosis but in the meantime, how should a family deal with echolalia?

Prior to noticing this we each handled it separately. My wife would often respond with “oh that’s funny” and I would counter with “why are you repeating that, it’s not funny?” Now he’s admitted to me that he feels the *urge* to repeat some lines.

Do we call out the echolalia symptom or ignore it?

Thank you!",5.3546491228070145,7.394290078947371,5.575000000000002,77.65333333333336,69.26315789473685,8.750877192982456,31.74561403508772,9.2995712137729,3.068656140350878,660,29,113,14,12,209,100,152,0.021,0.8690000000000001,0.111,0.9194,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,5,2,0,0,4,4,0,0,9,0,13,2,0,1,0,32,21,8,0,3,3,2,1,2,0,4,2,1,0,0,11,16,0,1,4,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,1,3,12,3,21,14,4,17,0,0,1,0,19,6,0,6,12,81,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889422284175724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815275463362158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34887054748597657,0.0,0.0935596544272426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516010282146752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19312928950719505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18079827959741707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15538345998261133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19666376001629987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2106644717474094,0.19416393378175856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2086000495255716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3368992649942356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13096928355585002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846460666186471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17035609381469416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16696601874943245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2628882305922809,0.0,0.0,0.1191569812315883
autism,will0w1sp,2018/04/03,"Script Request - College Health Center/STI testing Hello. I'm a 19-year old autistic student, and I need to go to my school's health center to have some mouth issues checked out. I would also like to get some information on STI testing and get tested.          
        
However, there is not clear/comprehensive information about what to expect online, and I do not know what to say, and am therefore anxious. 

I was wondering if any of you would be willing to write/ help me with a script that I could use either during a walk in appointment (including what to say to the receptionist), or in a phone call to schedule an appointment. Also, maybe, what to say to nurse in the actual appointment.     

I would also appreciate it if anyone knows (and would be willing to share) any resources with scripts for lots of different situations. Those that I have found have either been not very extensive, or aimed at children.

Thanks in advance!",5.678000000000001,9.135005244444448,4.964444444444447,75.50000000000001,74.33333333333334,6.2666666666666675,31.222222222222214,7.554174236665415,2.694688888888889,216,10,29,3,5,65,38,45,0.0,0.698,0.302,0.9432,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,1,0,6,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,11,6,1,5,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,1,0,20,2,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2890319243532987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29718772181408903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719426916102585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3569143864568825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946591757936546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4332599869289127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3913063894308119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3670855799987085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,dudecephus,2018/04/03,"What does being diagnosed with autism actually change? I'm a middle-aged guy who is very likely on the autism spectrum.  If a doctor diagnoses it, what actually changes?  I'm very high functioning, I just have a list of autism symptoms, and a diagnosis would explain a *lot* about how eccentric I am.  But other than just knowing, what else changes?  Meds?  Therapy?  Or would it just be like ""ok, I have mild autism,"" then just keep living like I'm living?

autism,syddawg104,2018/04/03,"What do you all think about the #SaidNoMother hashtag floating around? If you haven’t seen it, it’s essentially a hashtag against vaccines. For example, “I’m so happy my child got autism from the MMR vaccine instead of a curable disease - said no mother ever”. 

Would love to hear all opinions on this! 

Edit: just wanted to add that I know vaccines don’t cause autism, but how do you feel about people talking about autism like it’s equivalent to a death sentence?",4.922043189368772,7.019592034883722,4.706079734219268,83.20453488372095,70.51162790697674,6.774750830564784,32.053156146179404,7.447530270364453,2.2095202657807302,369,17,64,4,7,113,65,86,0.078,0.8,0.122,0.4353,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,3,0,0,9,3,0,0,5,0,5,1,0,2,3,16,15,4,1,3,3,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,6,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,4,5,3,12,11,2,3,0,0,1,1,9,2,0,2,2,43,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27323705685027755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3153066012529372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27764011001825584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15519546342639168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24548380837487002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3267378150562356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34593784073410183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16868334576681146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14995284538292006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2770206515793057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2127899521083176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29196529380242536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24670257559228545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966714341971316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18103810466432355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2180376842233896,0.0,0.0,0.0

Some years ago, I started pulling out bits and pieces of my head hair, I'm still not entirely sure why I did it then, bit I was left with a sizeable bald patch and eventually stopped when it was being pointed out to me on a regular basis. Recently I have started randomly pulling bits and pieces out of my beard ( possibly stress related) and pointers on how to keep this in check?

autism,[deleted],2018/04/03,What more can i do? I am a 21 year old man with high functioning autism. I became very sensitive to sound a few years ago. I cannot read without earplugs and i cannot use ear plugs because they make me ridiculously sensitive to sound when i am not using them. i cannot further my education because earplugs needed for studying would make sound unbearably painful. I cannot work because the work available for someone unable to get post secondary education is shit and i would rather kill myself then be stuck at some shit job. People i tell this to think i am a lazy piece of shit for not improving my circumstances. How can i possibly improve my circumstances?

autism,Elisterre,2018/04/04,"I have suspected that I am on the spectrum for many years. Should I do anything about it? Hello, I have suspected that I am on the spectrum for many years, although I have never looked any further into the matter.

I guess I’ve always felt that despite the minor symptoms and behaviours I notice, I would be considered high functioning and my coping skills/strategies make me seem like anybody else.

I have been reading Flowers for Algernon, and it made me think about how maybe my experiences could help other people on the spectrum who are struggling to function “normally”.

That being said, I don’t yet know for sure if I am on the spectrum, or if it would really be beneficial to find out.

What would be your advice?

autism,madease,2018/04/04,"Something I designed to combat screen-time but could be good for autism too... Hi, Im a dad of three kids (none of whom have autism btw) but I designed something that I just launched on Kickstarter that some people have commented could be good for kids with Autism.  I know that the autistic need structure and organization in their lives and my product called TAAK is a simple interactive way to organize your day.  My initial goal was for TAAK was to help provide balance to families in which tech use or 'screen-time' has taken over, which from my research is not great for health or happiness.  But perhaps this could help with autism too?  Sorry if you feel like I am 'advertising' here.  I truly believe in TAAK so I just wish to spread the word and since I am not that familiar with autism, I would love to get some insight about your day-to-day or concerns or how TAAK could be improved to address the needs of the autistic.

autism,Driven2Crazy,2018/04/04,"Helping with anger issues My son just turned 11 and he is high functioning. He is a good kid and has gotten a little better at controlling his anger. Mostly at school (where he has stabbed a few kids with pencils over the years) has gotten better but it seems at home it is still pretty much the same. School behavior is always worse at resource or recess, less structure.
    Sometimes the sibling rivalry is more then it should be. Or if something changes or goes wrong he will get very upset and start hitting. Or he will use his words saying how he wants to hurt someone.
     He has talk therapy once a week and has for a year now. He is on two medications and we try to join social skills groups when we can. (Most groups are to far)

          How can I help him control his anger? He goes in to middle school next year and though he has a great team I don’t want him falling in the cracks of our school system. I hate to see this sweet boy struggle with his emotions.",3.191646825396827,5.058305105820111,3.37666335978836,91.89293154761906,74.66137566137566,5.994841269841268,22.92361111111111,6.6274283507984215,0.4737007936507941,751,21,155,6,16,230,122,189,0.17,0.6990000000000001,0.131,-0.8929,0,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,3,0,0,6,8,13,4,2,10,0,20,1,0,5,0,31,32,17,0,4,7,1,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,3,4,11,0,2,1,1,0,1,1,8,0,1,2,3,13,5,18,25,7,25,0,1,1,0,31,13,0,8,10,94,17,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028843131403724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21871166791929436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080226319542526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2773615291663994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390863731441222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460051945036338,0.0,0.0,0.10370934202740212,0.0,0.13632139179301053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12207593716532082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16575612299679565,0.1306399762298918,0.12402814791605962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323668046119134,0.0,0.0,0.1290554739379278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12392690248599875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245614700707872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908948638740842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13150012015250104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316801526882975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12579357803913935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832915660898707,0.0,0.500549966701629,0.09853074995449597,0.11256369871218004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12604267265811891,0.10476580773767714,0.09518959765449446,0.1222901682449258,0.0,0.08751807146259595,0.0,0.09874475372318813,0.0,0.0,0.12926282168856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09938287538168393,0.0,0.0,0.14140126335790965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12148267249307325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394828144472942,0.13449256580248958,0.12078527446652185,0.0,0.0,0.10679141622391376,0.0,0.10202182747540517,0.14586055578864693,0.0,0.09918226537197587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12600698381466446,0.0,0.13518872070471336,0.0,0.23887408365289656

I set a goal my senior year that I would go to my first concert before I was 25. Well, my favorite band, The Wonder Years is playing Nashville and I'm going alone. I'm afraid that my Autism will affect my experience. Is there any advice those who have been in the same position as me could give? Just for reference, TWY is a pop punk band with heavy indie and Alternative influences. And the punk part of their music is very focused.

autism,mrsfishpants3,2018/04/05,"What kind of doctor diagnoses autism in adults (is that possible?) I'm 21 years old, and I'm seriously wondering if I have some kind of high functioning autism. I have been wondering this because I recently (finally) got into counseling and there are symptoms that I have that go back as far as I can remember, including:

Depression (mild to severe)

A very hard time relating to people (sarcasm can be lost on me)

Not understanding how social interactions worked, being incredibly shy, etc.

Not being able to make eye contact

Severely fidgety

Anxiety (severe)

I must have everything in a certain order, or else I lose it.

I have a routine everyday and when it gets screwed up I panic

Sensory issues with some foods (I slowly grew out of it, but for a long time I would only eat one food)

I am part of a multiple birth that had fertility treatments

Terrified of loud noises, crowds, etc.

I have a very high pitched childlike voice, to the point we're most people think I'm thirteen

I used to hear the occasional voice when I was young 
(I grew out of it)

Becoming obsessed with one topic to the point where I was like a manual, then switching topic

Sleep issues (I will be awake till 4am, then sleep till 8am, and start again)

Self soothing motions (I think it called stemming?) although I will do them even when I am not self soothing.

I melt down very easily, and can't process emotional very well at all.

Even my sister said to me once she thought I was ""off"", like my brain didn't work like other people, almost like I was younger than other kids mentally, if that makes sense.

And many more, but this is what I can remember off my head.  I just want to know if I do, these issues are really becoming a nightmare in college, and Idk having a name to it would be awesome. 

Thank you!

autism,TheAshInTrash,2018/04/05,"Book recommendation for fellow autistic people! I’m autistic, and I have found a character who is also autistic!
The book in question is “The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Nighttime” by Mark Haddon. The main character is Christopher Boone.
Although I’m terrible with mathematics (which he is great at), I can relate to his overstimulation and misunderstanding of social cues. 
Also, the book doesn’t just focus on the fact that he’s autistic, it also develops a real sense of events in a weird perspective. That’s why I like it — it makes Christopher human.
I do want to warn you all that it does include swearing.
Hopefully you’ll like the book as much as I did.",5.091707317073173,7.225276747967483,6.091552845528457,73.29684146341467,70.13821138211382,8.822439024390244,30.999186991869927,9.3871,3.1285518699187005,532,23,89,12,10,176,77,123,0.08800000000000001,0.784,0.128,0.7170000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,2,0,0,4,6,0,0,11,0,10,0,0,1,2,12,16,8,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,9,3,0,0,2,4,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,8,4,15,13,3,6,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,2,3,62,17,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5801850058479431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21163104405646505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26515910128426984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26662344469407256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401962744360025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362962908073216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614264397395712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17777621980198788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676576268888534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2709100419979615,0.0,0.0,0.2752606617749788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24651986838266796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14264028307608198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21821806606350166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,redditorgirl1,2018/04/05,"bullying My little brother is non verbally autistic. He can't speak and doesn't know how to communicate with people. I fear it's making people bully him. Today he came home from school with half of his head shaved off. There was no note or explanation but just a bag of hair in his backpack. 

Are we able to sue the school? Something like this has happened before when he went to school and came back with his entire fingernail ripped off, and no one had any answers. He was crying for hours on end. 

What should we do? 

Should we put him in karate to teach him self defense? 

How has that worked for you?

autism,GrimReaper010,2018/04/05,"Your thoughts on having children I'm a 25 year old guy and have mild autism. Recently I started to think what it would be like having children in the future and how to raise them. I was diagnosed with mild autism about 3/4 years ago.

For example, if I'm out on the street and doing some shopping and see parents with young children and how these parents cannot control their kids and they start screamimg, all i can think by myself is, if someday i'm having kids, how am i able to keep my cool and the patience during their upbringing and me raising them with the norms and values I got from my parents. At this moment, I have a lot of respect for them raising me until I was an adult.

Does anyone recognize this and do you, if you have a form of autism, also is thinking of having children in the future or at this moment have children and how do you combine this.

Also, I've read the Rosie Project and it's ""sequel"" in which having a relationship and raising a child isnt that easy. I know in the end of the books everything come to a good end, but it's still kind of fiction instead of reality. 

Apologize if my English vocabulary isn't that great. I hope you can relate in some form.

autism,WhisperDove,2018/04/05,Autism and Agoraphobia I have a 15 year old daughter who is low functioning and recently diagnosed with agoraphobia. A year and a half ago she stopped attending school and suffered some sort of breakdown for lack of a better word. She appears to have an extreme sensitivity to sound so we've tried everything from ear plugs to protective headphones and even her ipod to help drown out noise. Shes' been receiving therapies and teaching at home but progress is slow. She seems to be getting worse. Does anyone have any experience with agoraphobia in children and/or teens on the spectrum? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.,6.836014271151887,9.483213376146793,6.3461773700305795,71.13488277268094,66.61467889908258,9.982059123343527,36.881753312945975,10.25414643259724,4.418051172273191,514,27,81,14,9,159,84,109,0.113,0.782,0.105,0.2823,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,2,2,4,0,0,6,0,10,2,1,0,0,18,13,8,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,1,1,9,0,2,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,1,1,2,6,2,15,9,2,15,0,2,0,0,10,5,0,4,7,49,7,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21123277377424698,0.19161617537544065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29399760734172153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15114676231729926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19117932396682716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21940171738227265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18916640721664935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14277415810495656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942740944988617,0.21144968519170584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129366691216826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383213641333637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.144890045599136,0.0,0.2168299267892705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2268275563880265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2134356846112852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2187693165984796,0.0,0.1967874144779612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18072262470100708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2472021560989216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14676103792233464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22028939022746408,0.15355656889256256,0.0,0.0,0.27840481342652285
autism,FiveEver5,2018/04/05,"My niece needs a specialist but I don't know who to see So my niece is 6 years old. She is mostly nonverbal but will get some words and phrases out but it's mostly in the form of parroting. She is not potty trained. She has screaming, crying, hitting, kicking, throwing tantrums at least once daily. She is violent and will break stuff and self harm when she is having a tantrum.

We took her to a pediatrician and he referred us to a neutopsychiatrist. We went in for the first day of testing her skills and IQ with the neuro today but she had a tantrum so bad they asked us to leave basically. We did everything in our control to soothe her and finally ended in restraining her so she did not hurt others or herself. We have not found any techniques that are foolproof - usually we speak soothingly and try to get her to laugh.

She can not go out in public or to school because of these tantrums and it leads to familial stress. I know she's suffering too. She gets frustrated when she doesn't know how to communicate.

What I'm asking is who should we be seeing? The neuropsychiatrist did not offer us any answers or solutions. There has to be some help or resources out there. As she gets bigger she might become a genuine threat to herself or others if this continues. What do we do? We need help, please.

EDITED to add: I'm in southern Nevada if that helps with anything.",3.24320754716981,5.592990679245286,4.0398490566037735,84.97864150943398,76.16981132075472,7.107924528301886,26.449056603773585,8.109356740369918,1.7613200000000009,1090,42,209,19,25,348,151,265,0.18,0.722,0.098,-0.9831,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,12,0,1,4,9,14,7,1,10,0,26,0,0,3,0,57,46,26,0,5,16,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,1,13,22,0,2,6,0,0,5,7,13,0,1,7,4,37,1,30,32,6,28,0,2,2,0,45,11,0,12,11,156,50,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1718155670429553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395767817640078,0.0,0.2362003854884596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10547910858406437,0.07700874518394099,0.13952001929762178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14168827265961936,0.0,0.0,0.13876604086661848,0.08147149944262477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11188964788154324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11353600462904755,0.0,0.1190913660149381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13838681209191572,0.0,0.10745504703939032,0.0,0.1385127951025421,0.0,0.0,0.2640059287629561,0.0,0.07179545757317518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25402620349790594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13523738464596965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082806929015091,0.0,0.0,0.13376375248530628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340146865623694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873421200884881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13256062038789956,0.1345358416074095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13867087273017456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278512928143597,0.20133508503313585,0.0,0.13178828645794702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470899042503746,0.0,0.14461602908825755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197447465037757,0.0,0.14035572859799395,0.08576883049639768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4558732728370512,0.0,0.13913311104558385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171078826430208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135147989617326
autism,TjamlsMathew,2018/04/05,"Book recommendations? Sorry to be so specific with this request, but my little dude is almost 6, pretty high functioning, and really into two things that I would like to find some books on. I thought I would turn to our friends here to see if you had any personal recommendations, but any time and attention is much appreciated.

First, pretty straightforward, he loves rocks, gems, etc..
Second, might be a long shot here, he loves numbers/mathematics and specifically the idea of infinity.

Please let me know if you know of anything that might fit these realms that you have found satisfying, or even just think might be a good fit (for the circumstances I guess).

autism,AspieResearcher93,2018/04/06,"Interests and Well-Being Hey everyone :)

Not sure if this technically counts as advertising? Let me know if I'm in violation! 

As my username suggests, I'm an aspie, currently undertaking a PhD. My first study is hoping to show how uniquely important special interests can be to well-being. Interests often get a lot of hate, because of how long we can spend on them, but I'd like to demonstrate that they perhaps have a more meaningful impact on our overall well-being than NT people might imagine. If anyone would be willing to take part I would be eternally grateful! It's just an online questionnaire that you can do from home.

It's quite a long study, but you can close down the tab and come back to it via the same link, and as long as you're using the same device and browser it will have saved your answers. You also need to make sure you don't clear your history or cookies though, as that will wipe your session. Your progress will be saved for two weeks, then your session will close.

The link to the questionnaire is here: https://cccusocialsciences.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2mAWKjs8xMVbcwJ

Everyone taking part has to be over 18 I'm afraid. 

This obviously isn't my usual Reddit account, so I may be slow in replying to any questions, but am happy to do so! I'm not sure if I'm allowed to leave my e-mail address?

Thanks all!",6.055336134453782,7.262593674603174,6.018160597572365,78.31768907563027,66.6190476190476,8.9452847805789,31.09337068160597,9.168548406835145,2.6422639589169,1074,41,195,19,17,338,150,252,0.056,0.779,0.165,0.9833,2,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,2,9,2,3,10,16,2,1,11,0,30,0,0,5,6,49,46,24,0,8,11,0,0,1,0,9,0,0,2,0,9,8,0,0,7,1,2,1,4,3,0,2,0,0,20,13,27,30,7,20,0,0,0,0,16,8,0,11,12,131,29,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10580974687825163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997660217042322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925155291251325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10173965344629934,0.0,0.08065608196405921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11397495195492628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2528593052320402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125444007788904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912748603564778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408484356174634,0.0,0.1306305694363401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13271958392969924,0.13141553164767608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07271513816631811,0.0,0.0,0.1400991557323134,0.0,0.1352978415586554,0.0,0.06464089161193827,0.0,0.0,0.3512754982598872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11248681210941616,0.0,0.0,0.08831919416809897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14036197470746792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09810756789430676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28656170201458303,0.0,0.09172838431454007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14821956452676802,0.14072995001692595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741070874561318,0.0,0.19896410506151607,0.0,0.0,0.12181498430437668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12999573095988254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292494618470039,0.0,0.0,0.11427496553519005,0.14572282124066244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10613259340357536,0.0,0.3568927572736169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18798109868754126,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,thatstupidawkwardkid,2018/04/06,"I think I may have Autism Recently I've been wondering if I could have Autism. I've always had a thing for psychology, mental disorders, things like that. That obsession led me to realising I have ADHD and getting diagnosed with it. My attention has been turned to Autism because I didn't know a lot about it and wanted to do some research. This research made me realize I identify with many symptoms of ASD. I've been wondering if I could have Autism and, while I know this sub isn't filled with psychiatrists, I'd like to know what you guys think based on your own experiences. I'm certainly not asking for a diagnosis, just if what I experience matches with what you who have been diagnosed experience.

I don't like being touched unless it is by my best friend. Sometimes I just move away from the person's touch, but other times I tense up and keep thinking about the spot where they touched me. This goes back to when I was a kid as I remember being told that I would never hug anybody as a child. 

I don't like bright lights. I stay up late a lot and when I go into the kitchen late at night I turn on the dimmest light in there. My dad likes to install bright LED bulbs in the house and I hate them.

I am a very picky eater and most of my problems with certain foods are texture based. I hate mushy foods.

I sometimes make weird noises without thinking about what I'm doing. I do the same with weird hand gestures, but not as often.

I fidget **a lot** but, again, I have ADHD.

I was apparently a weird child. I liked to stick things up my nose and I liked to run around the edge of a trampoline in circles nonstop. These two things supposedly happened all the time.

I don't like making eye contact and I remember my dad always scolding me for not making eye contact with people when I was younger. He also treated me like a human calculator, asking me what our change would be at the store. I would respond immediately with the right answer.

I'm not good with emotions. I have no empathy. I don't know how to deal with other people being emotional and I don't know how to express my own emotions face to face. My sister has even said to me before ""it's like you don't have any emotions"".

Sometimes when I'm taking I don't know how to properly explain what I'm saying so I end up fumbling over my words. I then give up and say ""I'm just gonna stop talking now.""

The sound of a baby crying is horrible to me. I know that nobody likes it, but it seriously messes with me. A few days ago at work a baby was crying in the dining room and I just couldn't function so I went and sat in the walk in freezer. 

I've never been good at anything social. I'm shy, awkward, and have never been good at talking to people. Often times I just don't respond when people talk to me even though I heard them. 

I often think about the same things over and over. Usually it's a specific song or something someone said to me or something I remember from years ago. And sometimes when I say or hear something I repeat it several times in my head. 

I don't like to try new TV shows, video games, or books. I'd rather watch/play/read the same ones again.

I don't like change, even if it's small. My family has these plastic red and blue glasses, but my stepmom is replacing them with new clear ones. I reached into the back of the cabinet to get to the old ones. I told her I wasn't going to drink from the new ones and that I wanted the ones that I'm used to. I'm currently keeping them in my bedroom so they can't be thrown away.

I am, however, very good with jokes and sarcasm. I use sarcasm all the time and make a lot of jokes. I also can read body language fairly well. I think these two could be attributed to the fact that I grew up with a dad who always jokes and that I've researched the psychology around body language.

Sorry for the long post, this has just been stewing for a while. If you actually read all of that, thank you. If it seems likely that I do have Autism, how do I go about getting diagnosed as an adult (I'm 19). Everything I see about autism seems to be about children.",2.537964866317345,4.374817571946796,3.7572979645304336,88.58264317143627,76.42442563482467,6.722618567781807,24.303523444847517,7.594959193182576,1.0842323122396889,3200,106,671,44,72,1042,321,827,0.097,0.8109999999999999,0.092,-0.7044,3,0,4,0,0,0,88.0,1,6,6,2,46,41,2,2,43,0,67,19,9,14,10,142,132,60,0,17,28,4,4,14,1,5,4,9,3,8,42,39,5,3,24,12,1,11,24,10,1,7,22,23,100,31,97,94,16,87,0,0,7,1,54,34,0,24,54,456,142,7,0.0,0.0,0.048373049026145136,0.0,0.11914671758538405,0.0,0.08788140947084823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928202482437237,0.12373832488699026,0.0,0.0,0.03370921591512858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04079178481898129,0.08825539920576475,0.09268228636903998,0.0,0.0931450616225428,0.07623235068725484,0.0,0.03021733668765401,0.0,0.04218031399721692,0.0,0.05202052727894765,0.0,0.0,0.1101219163595414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487671343473867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11873253879537934,0.0,0.10890036365775717,0.031968469596868464,0.051104366174126566,0.0,0.15093714395014038,0.0,0.0,0.05681137312242634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048559607624113474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22303775703207268,0.043904197553457903,0.0,0.0,0.09822130797955704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044550208808783534,0.14546655310078768,0.0467300680574712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988018310658426,0.0,0.03829756370188919,0.0,0.07769464381524528,0.047551942495938686,0.08451510963920585,0.166307442678768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04908197120418332,0.043834478175069504,0.0,0.0,0.09787998132904092,0.050872994306824335,0.0,0.05586885356311328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05719698222353047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08811996785015369,0.0,0.0,0.1906961547261888,0.0,0.11183395984534228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3390427297346121,0.0,0.0,0.04386778092267677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685701458171866,0.0,0.046904215793446107,0.13235311020185453,0.05025607457803199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04995477665877655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05268493403198095,0.0,0.0,0.1146940341719902,0.1436246871446652,0.0,0.046517971238578114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052015246946534664,0.0,0.16794915633133656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13746204403442766,0.0432825042525094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04747423940842451,0.0,0.0,0.04743167735324486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14874987275380694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04894427299329985,0.0,0.16845902137173166,0.042332403775754965,0.09430460807840192,0.118259866397185,0.0,0.0,0.03950077382089586,0.09025310789427117,0.0,0.055999851059619264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05053024671738416,0.04200039558737382,0.11448393832754013,0.19610350184457093,0.05548941851410498,0.0,0.052834892979341824,0.0,0.041442636434207945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05152208175971201,0.03727037815995482,0.11952716742545345,0.0,0.04563728245523852,0.0,0.0,0.16466011701372574,0.1905742523088575,0.04870215208473495,0.0,0.1445229683948053,0.0,0.0,0.09473228273358957,0.0,0.033654692362867326,0.10783558279642794,0.09684513331727056,0.0,0.0,0.08562491567804173,0.05459421590136347,0.08180067915369707,0.058475195066092174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04456927217105845,0.04595177223249148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04778359214237473,0.1075128333382458,0.036087460543067565,0.0,0.0,0.10563905433357863,0.0,0.0,0.031921375321594114

autism,Dreamingoffire12,2018/04/07,"New to all of this (as a parent) My son was recently diagnosed with autism. He turns three in a week. I was just wondering what I can do as his mom to support him and help him out. How can I make life work for him? What do y’all wish you parents did or didn’t do? Are there any resources y’all know of that will help us with this?

Sorry for all the questions, I just want to make sure that I do the best I can for him. He is sweet and clever and has a very funny sense of humor and I want a good life for him. I want him to be happy and I know a lot of that starts now.

autism,gg_snow,2018/04/07,"Question regarding weighted blankets! I am a nanny to a 7 yr old boy with ASD who really struggles with sleep at night.  I've heard of weighted blankets working for some people.  I believe these blankets might help him have better nights, but his mom is convinced otherwise.  She thinks that because he hated being swaddled as an infant he most likely won't like the weight of a blanket.  Do any of you have any input on this?  Given his need for constant human contact at night, like if you move an inch, in his sleep/semi sleep state he'll move an inch too, I think he might actually benefit from a weighted blanket.",5.5678846153846155,6.7508959914529925,5.847083333333334,79.19062500000005,67.71794871794873,7.559401709401709,32.57371794871795,7.6454224807358475,2.3774794871794867,489,21,84,5,8,156,84,117,0.115,0.792,0.093,-0.5803,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,0,2,1,8,1,1,8,0,9,6,2,0,0,12,16,3,0,2,2,1,4,3,0,4,0,1,0,3,4,2,4,0,3,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,2,5,10,6,14,9,2,14,0,0,0,0,20,6,0,6,8,50,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.1182670863349266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16483107139938308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387825325872606,0.0,0.0,0.13654324118496106,0.0,0.10718554169127732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13096680057787916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11965319982254985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08123325107014187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17762663565177828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25713367827497524,0.0,0.14194001765208608,0.0,0.2576183956625298,0.0,0.08986322631841961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3411948408063976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12717188238503255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840201091149344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13576412663940365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07763947083636136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3638421896492364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12669745235854446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553114251618625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5903226991215274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08823009708047222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,tonksloopy,2018/04/07,"Diapers and toilet training. Hey there. I need some advice regarding how to handle potty training.  My son will turn 3 this summer and lately he's been pulling off his diaper. He scratches excessively where there may be some tightness (near the groin and around the waist). He's always disliked diapers but now it's getting to the point where he can only last a few minutes and then starts tugging at it. I buy the largest size there is available (6 or even 7). 

Normally I would assume this is the right time to start training but obviously because he is in the spectrum there see some challenges with communication. I am not sure he understands yet what it means to go to the toilet. I let him join me in the restroom when I have to go so he's used to the sound of the flushing and we wash our hands together.

I have him in some normal underwear right now and is enjoying the freedom/comfort. No accidents yet.

How should I handle this when I can't explain to him the why's and how's of this bodily function? When did your kids start to go to the restroom?

autism,ashekoa,2018/04/07,"Don't know how to do anything with a degree, being autistic I managed to get a biology degree (well I had no choice but to go to college right after high school) but it was a huge struggle and drain on my mental health. And really it seems like just a label that won't help me due to all of my other issues. I wasn't diagnosed until my last year, but I've always had problems that were labeled as other things. My point being that I may be worse than I thought and only recently self aware of a lot of issues. Like I realized executive function is something I have trouble with, especially being out of school. Basically all I've done with school is get assignments, and do assignments in controlled environment to the requirements. I get average grades because I'm really good at some subjects and horrid at others. 

Other people did things like internships and networking, and a lot of self directed things like that just don't occur to me and I have no idea how to do it. Of course I'm horrible socially and have trouble talking in most situations (mistaken for ""shyness""), so professional networking seems impossible anyway. I wouldn't be able to speak all of this, typing is much easier. In 5 years of college I made exactly 0 friends. I'm realizing I think I have trouble conceptualizing abstract things in the way other people must. I have basically no concept of the future, I can see or plan about a week ahead. I have no ""goals"" or life ambitions. I have strong interests and hobbies of course, but no idea how to turn that into a job. I have trouble imagining related jobs anyway, unless I see or hear detailed descriptions. Lots of things like that are just vague and fuzzy in my head and it seems like it's not that way for others. Like a lot of jobs relating to my interests would involve moving, and I have no idea how I would even do that or what would be involved. I don't have transportation either. I've seen high schoolers with better planning and future sight than me. 

My other problem is sensory issues. This was always labeled as severe anxiety (funny how I had that since I was a kid...), but now I know earplugs help a lot. But I still being anywhere noisy or overstimulating is difficult, and can get to the point where I'm not able to do basic tasks. Like in labs if everyone was talking at once I'd become the one person barely doing anything, mainly because I felt like I was going insane. If it's quiet I have no problems and might be the one doing everything. Traffic and most public areas are stressful and it's harder to do anything or think. But I guess in stereotypical fashion I've always been really good at certain things and got a lot of compliments from professors, saying that it's already at a professional level.

autism,RegalPeacock,2018/04/07,"Explaining breathing to my autistic son So my son is 7 and has been diagnosed on the spectrum. Back before the new dsmn-5, he probably would have been diagnosed with aspergers. He doesn't have any significant physical disabilities and is extremely intelligent. He just has a much different way of thinking about things. I've been asking this question to all kinds of professionals and no one has been able to help yet. Although, I really don't think they were giving it their best effort. My son doesn't understand the difference between breathing out and in and can't hold his breath. I think I've gotten to the point where he just completely shuts down every time I try to work on it with him because it never works and he's frustrated before I even start. With most things he's trying to understand, he needs to see the behavior and then mimics it - but with breathing...it's really hard to explain. I can't do it for him and what he sees doesn't help him much. Aside from constant anxiety when it comes to water like baths and swimming, he was also recently diagnosed with asthma. He needs his inhaler, but he's getting maybe half the medication each time even with a good spacer. Every time I try to google any resources for this...it's nothing for what I'm trying to accomplish. He really likes visuals so if anyone knows of a book or something that I can show to him to explain how to control your breathing, that would be absolutely amazing.",7.14140510948905,7.450108715328469,7.281450729927009,73.3596943430657,64.03649635036497,10.937591240875912,34.278284671532845,10.686352973137794,3.7319861313868614,1164,47,206,28,16,376,151,274,0.034,0.848,0.119,0.9782,1,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,2,6,13,7,1,0,9,0,24,10,4,2,2,44,44,20,0,5,6,3,1,2,0,2,5,0,1,0,13,18,1,2,10,4,0,2,8,1,0,2,7,4,19,6,34,34,6,23,0,0,2,0,32,8,0,4,14,136,32,5,0.10806544885711708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641990040806523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14697642188996352,0.0,0.08266977258755379,0.0,0.0,0.0755618744877345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10102660691811644,0.0,0.0,0.0830956596890551,0.0,0.0658756945960659,0.0,0.18391147516201256,0.0,0.11340802146717335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09308881542162803,0.11330456709548352,0.1167803592605,0.12120458988488518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3290524674904378,0.0,0.2258107869947171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275241956120865,0.0,0.18209960297342476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056459736790926085,0.10366622557414223,0.0,0.09064017137085603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680541595862406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14486798489405667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125335354253797,0.05938994453623012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10559063942984362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10856626836052964,0.0,0.0,0.10886457066171323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15888107815978206,0.16025832207044366,0.08334673618221035,0.10437028390463833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10369171271967677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07322794490138115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021567790099146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11651283145026915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105803465978145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2076884811355041,0.0,0.10670159363351284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17222834291658642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319406213035774,0.0,0.0,0.07648928091088025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14358776476790566,0.2077319284081912,0.0,0.0,0.18904149680371246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2934773846864693,0.0,0.0,0.2249998867860112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08577732327017433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15734586764253067,0.0,0.0,0.1535331886377954,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,59616D6D69654E6F6F62,2018/04/07,"Insecure teenager uses ""autism"" as an insult In another subreddit, I recently encountered [an insecure teenager](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/87x7jw/comment/dwr4kwc) who resorts to calling people ""autistic"" as a defense mechanism when his claims about a certain basic physics concept are proven to be false (using an article he mistakenly thought supported his point, no less).

It occurred to me, somewhat ironically, that such antisocial behavior could be an indicator that this individual may himself fall somewhere on the autism spectrum.

Is it common for people who suffer from autism to be unable to understand the condition or accept that it is an issue that affects them and blame their negative interactions on others?",22.97921052631579,15.140832184210527,19.207192982456146,25.038684210526327,42.94736842105263,22.568421052631567,72.21052631578948,18.243605946275586,11.615705263157894,615,39,65,21,3,193,88,114,0.183,0.75,0.068,-0.9371,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,2,0,3,8,2,2,9,0,8,0,0,3,1,13,13,5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,11,1,0,1,3,0,0,1,2,5,0,0,1,0,7,3,13,7,2,8,0,1,0,0,11,4,0,3,3,56,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2838619849654373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764241511268809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2161391048347601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2825498585301905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375351063589577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25590750129543177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2672924741327516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3071973596479284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2149127036598179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2818176110151972,0.0,0.4676113089293423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,CurrentlyRecording,2018/04/07,"I'm on the edge about getting an autism diagnosis. Ok, so I'm not sure if I have autism. I'll explain my matching symptoms:

* Professional language used a lot outside of correct social settings.

* Enjoy repetitive tasks like swimming, bouncing and stimming.

* Hyperfocus and high intellect.

* Interests; I'll learn everything about a subject and move on to another. My current one is ICT, previous was animation.

autism,UltiMatrix11,2018/04/08,"Being lonely So my posting was only on r/aspergers, but I still come here for advice too. I figured I might as well post this here to get as much help as possible. 


So I posted on a throw away a [week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/88nsji/help/?utm_source=reddit-android). And I wanted to say thank you for that, and that I'm trying to be better by not hiding behind anything anymore.


I wanted to ask what do you do when you're lonely? Because I feel like all the answers I get are basically just ""forget that you're alone by doing something"". I've been doing that, but it's just hard. For those that did not click on the link, my gf broke  up with me because I put myself in a compromising situation that I did not know was compromising. What I have had the hardest time trying to process is this. She is physically disabled, and I did everything in my power to compromise and accommodate that. We would take breaks while walking, even if she insisted she didn't need it, I would go to see her when she was in the hospital after her surgery she had (different story, relevant for the compromising) and I even made plans to where she would be able to be included in things she had a hard time doing.


What I've had a hard time processing is this. I did all of these things to accommodate her and compromise with her disability, but when it was ""my turn"" she refused to do the same. And now I'm just lonely and I feel stupid for feeling like she'd do the same for me. Talking to family doesn't help, talking to friends doesn't help, and I've even been seeing a counselor recently and he doesn't help either. So the original question of, how can I stave off this feeling of loneliness and lack of connection? Is the only answer like I said earlier? Just forget about it and busy myself with other things?


Thanks, y'all have been a great resource. Better than you know since I normally delete the things I post on here (no more though!!!) . Thank you.

autism,hairysockcucker,2018/04/08,"Thoughts regarding ABA therapy? Hi everyone,

I've been working with children and adults with disabilities for about 9 years now and am debating working as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) performing Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy for children diagnosed with Autism. I would mostly be in client homes for 3-5 hours daily, rarely at a clinic. Are there any individuals with Autism and/or family members that would mind speaking with me about their experiences with ABA? Positive and negative comments are welcome.

autism,sierra_the_sloth,2018/04/08,"Maybe maybe not? I have reason think I'd be on the spectrum somewhere. I've been perusing this sub and the Aspergers sub as well. My question is, what are other conditions that mimic or are similar to autism? I've been diagnosed with GAD by GP (not the most solid diagnosis) and that's all so far. I've always thought to see psychologists rather than psychiatrists but I scheduled an appt with psychiatrist in pursuit of some sort of  diagnosis. I can't even hold a job down due to my serious lack of social skills and unwavering anxiety (coupled with paranoia that people always mean to harm me or don't like me). Sorry for my bad formatting.

autism,Bunny-Foo-Foo,2018/04/08,"Anyone here have a child that was mainstream until pre teen then Diagnosed? Our Daughter was Diagnosed at age 5 with severe ADHD.. we hesitatingly accepted meds and they truly helped her! great!.. she was the typical mainstream Kiddo until about 5 grade when she started acting out. we managed.. then at the end of 6th grade she had a complete break down, she was hospitalized and we learned it was a severe regression. she was Dx with Autism and Bi polar as well as the existing ADHD.. Our little Triple Threat. We have a son that was dx with autism at age 3, severe anxiety and clinical eating disorder. I understand that autism is different in every kiddo, but we never saw any warning signs that would make us think we should have our daughter looked at until it was just there..and then it was emergent. Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this. Our daughter, now 14, requires constant care, has respite and behavioral therapy and a full time EA at school.. our son, who was Dx early is thriving and only requires light/moderate care.

autism,4dolfin,2018/04/08,"DAE figure out the plot twist of a show or movie within in the first few minutes? For the longest time I have been able to figure out the plot twist of a movie or show within the first few minutes.

For example, when I saw Sixth Sense I figured out right away that Malcolm Crowe is actually dead. Last night I watched MacGyver (2017) and I figured out right away who was the bad guy. 

Does anyone else experience this? Is this another trait?

autism,beginnertocoding,2018/04/08,"Social anxiety disorder, but possible autism? I just wanted to list some issues I have that I've recently wondered if they're not actually caused by my diagnosed social anxiety disorder. Autism was brought to my attention, but I'm not sure if it sounds fitting or not. I may ask to be tested for it. I did take a test that was created by researchers and scored in the range for possible autism. 

My Symptoms:

* Eye contact. I cannot give it comfortably. In public, such as at the grocery store, I don't give it, I just look everywhere else but at people, because I can't look at people. Maybe just my anxiety?

* Lack of connection with people. I don't connect well or relate to others. I feel different, like an outsider. I don't have friends, but then again, I have severe social anxiety disorder.

* Loud noises/loud talking make me feel very anxious and upset or angry; sometimes I feel like I want to hide under a blanket and plug my ears, other times I feel like I want to scream. I hate loud noises. Also pretty sensitive to smells.

* I feel I don't have control over my facial expressions, or I cannot match them to how I'm feeling, like I don't know how to move my face to show my emotions, if that makes any sense. 

* My eyes often tear up when I'm anxious while speaking with someone. Very embarrassing.

The only thing is, is that when I'm actually comfortable around someone (very rare), I can be more myself, and eye contact, facial expressions, etc. is easier for me. So I really don't know, perhaps it's all the anxiety, but it's a selective thing?

autism,vsh1109,2018/04/08,"I told a stranger that my 3 year old son had autism today. All of our family and close friends know and we have a great support system but we've really struggled with navigating how to talk about his autism to everyone else.  We don't want it to define him but at the same time, we want people to be understanding and tolerant of his differences and we want people to know that he is a really, really amazing, sweet and loving kid.  

One of the places I always seem to struggle is at the checkout aisle. Almost every single time without fail, the well meaning cashier says to my son ""Hi! How are you?  Would you like a sticker?  What's your name?""  and so on.  And then almost every time without fail once he doesn't respond or make eye contact they say ""He must be ready for a nap, huh?""  I usually smile and nod and go on my way.  

Today was a particularly rough day and at the checkout at Lowe's our cashier looked at my son and said ""Hey buddy!  How's it going?""  My son was babbling pretty loudly, flapping his hands and rocking his head back and forth and not responding to the cashier whatsoever.  But this time the cashier didn't ask if he needed a nap.  He asked ""What's wrong with him?  Is he okay?""  I felt my blood start to boil but I took a deep breath and said ""there isn't anything wrong with him but he does have autism.""  The cashier looked embarrassed for second but then looked at my son and smiled a big smile at him and said ""It's cool buddy!  You really shouldn't be talking to strangers anyway.""  And then he packed up our items, waved and told us to have a great day.  I wanted to tell him that it meant the world to me for a stranger to look at my son and smile and talk to him like he was just an ordinary kid but I just said thank you and felt the tears well up as I walked to the car.  

I feel like since his diagnosis I find myself constantly worrying about what his life will be like and the more I think about it, I just want him to be happy.  I'm sorry this was so long and I know this may not seem like a big deal to a lot of people but I just wanted to put it out there because it was a big step for our little family today.

autism,Larry-Man,2018/04/09,"How important was your diagnosis? I’ve been depressed for much of my life and had a few different diagnoses. The other night I had another depressive meltdown. I always thought my social anxiety was the cause but it might be a symptom. I felt the need to self harm, I wanted to smack my head against the wall repeatedly. It was after a long day with no breaks from socializing. I have always found social interaction difficult. I looked up what autistic meltdowns are like after remembering someone telling me once that banging your head against the wall can be a sign of autism. Other things in my life lead me to believe I may be on the spectrum and have for some time. Long story short the descriptions of autistic meltdowns were very accurate descriptions of what I’ve experienced all of my life from when I was a kid (even before depression kicked in) 

Basically I’m trying to decide if going to get checked is worth it or if just changing the way I approach my problems and taking more self care is the best way to go.

Is your diagnosis important to you?",6.428869463869461,7.528077621212122,6.738888888888893,73.87576923076924,65.71717171717171,10.132711732711735,34.92773892773893,10.214889679676881,3.720069463869464,851,39,149,20,13,275,121,198,0.118,0.789,0.093,-0.6534,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,4,0,2,4,9,0,0,14,0,20,7,2,3,1,25,32,9,0,5,5,0,1,1,0,2,5,0,0,3,9,4,0,0,5,0,2,4,1,6,0,0,11,3,21,3,25,16,6,23,0,3,1,0,12,7,0,6,10,107,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2055215124243771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949908510631675,0.09447611647821118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10508824087234662,0.13914066878108505,0.12960419643526666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12591508744755806,0.12686711570942186,0.1306451787444859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07964640172042496,0.0,0.3191075758068828,0.12534851321924706,0.0,0.1290297865011987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156968258094427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11857805518301955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354098770444891,0.0,0.0,0.06452293870458457,0.0,0.14037423871403862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534904543368652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26169221105995105,0.06033519409538447,0.0,0.0,0.21858480846974054,0.10370774808409397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13101253365172424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078570544336552,0.0915726717797297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11589510136731405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13152201395293214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11817151325630496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13989987695998332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25767201725968203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3776739124364462,0.10463999126490632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836236682748725,0.09285560268079568,0.0,0.10794324896603634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820470043914273,0.0,0.0,0.09804411994462753,0.07201304625310248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838474653779742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018993063327178,0.07284269368606887,0.19605493352191067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,purplemashpotato,2018/04/09,"Teaching Gifted Autistic Child in Morocco, School is closing he needs to get out country or face beatings from teachers. Need Advice. Hello, 
I am teaching in a new experimental school in a small town in Morocco. It is well funded, and all the teachers are international. I have a special autistic 10 year old in my class and the problem is this school is closing down at the end of the year and the child will have to go back to his old goverment school, where he is literally beaten by teachers for being the way he is. 

The child is exceptionally bright in certain areas. He taught himself English, and reads and speaks fluently (something quite rare here). His mathematical ability is excellent and he has other skills, for example knowing the shape and capital and flag of every country in the world (as well as all US states). He’s making progress in others areas too. Last week was the first time he played football with the other kids. (Granted he changed sides every minute, but still much improved social interaction). 

His parents want what’s best for him, as do I, and that means educating him outside Morocco. In a school that understands his needs. Where he can live up to his potential. The school was on the verge of closing a couple months ago, and the child had a nervous breakdown as he thought he would return to his old school.

Does anyone have any advice as to what options there are for taking the kid to the US, UK, Canada etc? Are there any organisations that can help? 
The parents don't speak English so have asked me to help find more information and plan next steps. 

Help would be appreciated,

autism,ohhhhOkayy,2018/04/09,"Should I be concerned for my 20 month old My son is 20 months old. He does not talk, wave, or like to make eye contact. He also seems to be in his own world. Like I call him and he just ignores me and he is super focused on whatever he is doing. Although he is super affectionate towards me. 

We started speech therapy four weeks ago and so far he has learned to sign please and more. So that’s super awesome

They way he acts makes me think he could have autism but he is also super young still. So did you all know when your kid was super young or what? Is this normal behavior for a toddler that he will grow out of or should I get him evaluated now?",1.0800952380952396,3.212992570370375,2.5929365079365105,93.64750000000002,82.55555555555556,5.33862433862434,20.753968253968253,6.5431188927421005,0.18217460317460346,507,15,112,5,14,165,92,135,0.01,0.789,0.201,0.9787,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,1,2,1,5,9,9,0,0,1,0,17,1,1,2,1,25,24,15,0,4,6,1,0,2,0,3,0,1,0,1,4,6,0,1,4,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,2,2,15,8,10,16,3,21,0,0,1,0,23,6,0,4,14,70,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18160735613721074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3276733726564799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20919801220704068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635742423638177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17928554840049174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107037570549279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259272075168715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20018098134548493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27350833998934604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32705499315967346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20073182356113334,0.0,0.0,0.4299590338235438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22488878780162969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865084823574896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450100065482022,0.0,0.16361166493619392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16466897829251684,0.0,0.0,0.2342898761682372,0.0,0.0,0.13127420356603015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16261847491529896,0.16433658455559785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Luisnunessec,2018/04/09,"Help identifying what's wrong with a family member This probably is not the best place to ask this but I want to help my girlfriend's sister and try and understand her .

So since I knew the person in question something felt off ,she has difficulty in social situations and comes off as akward ,she's a very dependent person and loses focus quickly ,she never fared well academically and panics easily when confronted.
Also has a difficult time understanding directions.
What makes me wonder most if that sometimes even in the middle of a conversation she seems to be in another world,then comes back ,can't really explain it ,this woman has a daughter that shows the same trait of seemingly turning off during conversations face to face or on the phone ,but her daughter exhibits higher levels of social interaction and intelligence.

The whole family has a touch of akwardness that is hard to explain ,but on the other hand my girlfriend draws highly detailed illustrations and has a high concentration and memory.

My question is ,can autism run in the family and be so subtle that it may escape diagnosis ? 

I hope in not offending anyone by asking this ,I know these signs seem small but I'm just trying to figure out how to help",9.885047305635537,9.278975266968327,9.86536404771699,60.11693541752366,58.77375565610859,13.104236939531058,36.380501851090095,12.24349002098031,4.784697737556561,998,36,153,28,11,330,139,221,0.097,0.772,0.13,0.8749,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,2,10,9,2,1,15,0,13,3,3,3,1,46,33,21,0,3,9,3,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,14,13,0,0,14,1,0,3,4,6,1,0,2,4,14,3,26,28,4,26,0,1,0,0,29,18,0,12,5,114,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09357598317071328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12269928938952247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08181884799709753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2187844240533667,0.0,0.0,0.08997647550976186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12279888148593265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20159424817997007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07728658530825842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3309309068580662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11235170577616983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10482148130007214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352958760495676,0.2472632451287189,0.0,0.11622121723798301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06430778587096367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13090863655685667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810769490484154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902483426328101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372906137059699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20434406908709826,0.12225463292486707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12616078823836535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621647227204193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.074962108355902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3195752123180873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967951172157748,0.1315285398072229,0.0,0.23856189480086795,0.0,0.0900830262596217,0.1157297510310578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06823175310293743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588895305406013,0.12727753489288465,0.0,0.2436312182712865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654873210914958,0.06901783703847444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10520955971668884,0.0,0.0,0.13064185396859898,0.0,0.0,0.12689659611219492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12793634364807455,0.0,0.0

autism,palehuman,2018/04/09,"Does anybody have any advice on how I can get out of this? I'm a 16/F with Aspergers and I am intolerant to assemblies.. I hate them because they cause me so much anxiety. I hate the physical contact.. how we are standing so close together, the noise of everybody around me, just everything is overwhelming to me. I hate how I never have control about what assembly we have each day (because we have something each day, except for one day of the week) so I spend an excessive amount of time worrying about it. I have managed to get myself out of most.. especially when we have full school assembly, which I really can't do at all, except we had an hour long service which I had skipped and now I am considered truant, so I have to explain to my school counsellor (who is actually away) why I didn't go, so now I have to either go to my tutor teacher or somebody else.. but I'm not entirely sure about that process. It has been a big problem since I started school, but now it has became so much worse, since we started having school assemblies in a different location. I used to force myself through them when I was in a different location, and although I would feel uncomfortable, I would go. It's something about the other location we are using.. and how it is so uncomfortable to me. I believe it probably has something to do with the size of the room/the way we are seated and the noise of the room is projected. My tutor teacher told me that people can get out of them, only if they have a valid excuse and it goes through the school principal for consideration. 

Since my school counsellor is away, and I should get the truancy explained before the school week ends, I plan on just writing practically what I have written in this post, that I have Aspergers, and why it has made me uncomfortable since, and handing it to my tutor teacher and I will explain to her that the school counsellor is away. I guess the tutor teacher will then speak to my school principal/do that process, or advise me further.

I'm not sure if what I am doing is the right thing, so anybody who has any advice or has been in the same situation or has had a child in the same situation could provide me with advice, that would be good.

I think another reason is I have forced myself to go through some assemblies (but it has negatively affected my work, and made me extremely anxious) is that I am more real to myself about my current abilities at the moment and functioning. With school work, things have became more stressful, being at school all day, I am just trying to make my life easier so I can function in most aspects. It's probably a lot worse considering I have a lot of anxiety as well, maybe something I could add that too.",6.904545394606714,6.673860005736143,7.394882310278898,74.16632887189294,64.62141491395793,11.114366717215006,35.434100349442865,10.704944029454452,3.7642852113140375,2145,91,403,51,29,707,210,523,0.101,0.872,0.027000000000000003,-0.9889,3,0,4,0,0,0,60.0,8,0,5,4,29,10,3,2,27,0,64,2,1,13,5,90,93,39,0,9,17,0,2,0,0,6,1,1,1,1,31,32,0,1,7,0,1,4,6,6,1,1,11,3,70,4,60,72,18,52,0,1,0,0,31,24,0,12,21,320,101,21,0.0,0.0,0.058904388690893913,0.0,0.0,0.17695449454673615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08209615877869486,0.06329458797617599,0.09235319093054968,0.06819162860015504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053734780456743285,0.0,0.0,0.17013563414679672,0.0,0.0,0.07359196003920054,0.0,0.05136342779329694,0.06800705421198969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062008174111509676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06770086744488645,0.09638793717109644,0.0,0.0,0.15571341454777246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261304227214028,0.0,0.0,0.05282299928516948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05042452062471454,0.0,0.053462619576717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054249274518848624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030520728964187782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261461520586304,0.0,0.1372199594241157,0.05062859610340018,0.0,0.0,0.06649530445236226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17878427909765535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05944419303579671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04263530938465842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053418274648755454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263485133560034,0.0,0.11423154892904995,0.040291955979273715,0.0,0.06064151984873613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08874570527578197,0.0,0.04655472489610239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040902703402060606,0.04590785268463246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04184725707321185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057809898429328765,0.0,0.13016041331660402,0.0577580701511396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0687049190018434,0.038669301067830265,0.062061961713040965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0515486291732239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6719827683342259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19972754830970646,0.13569833656945576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18587778492013604,0.0,0.0,0.08544875524632188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914421352559047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11378052408877418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020336720327269,0.03867739047008758,0.0,0.0,0.035197438559178604,0.0,0.0,0.057678266266604425,0.0,0.04098168546587428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10426639246987154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04791237029890262,0.0968371557657988,0.0,0.054272488182733884,0.0,0.10893423315161577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788818755448823,0.06130031627008487,0.12302761863197866,0.1286378271098918,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,lyinglikelarry,2018/04/09,"I (20sF) just met someone I really like on the spectrum, what should I expect? I’m going to be a little vague since the thought of him ever seeing this post is like unfathomably embarrassing. 

I met someone who I’m casually dating (let’s call him C). We really connect and I’m like, so super excited about getting to know him better. He’s disclosed to me he’s on the spectrum. I feel a little out of my depth and some advice/experiences or even some reading would be appreciated even if they’re not directly related to my questions. 

Will trying to be accommodating be interpreted as being patronizing? I worry about asking him to go to places that are too loud/distracting and initiating physical contact (we haven’t don’t anything more than hug). 

Should I try to not rely on “body language” and instead try to verbalize what I want more than I would with someone who is neurotypical? He will verbally tell me how much he likes me/finds me attractive, but all my signals for like kissing or something are ignored, this is because he’s on the spectrum right? 

Do you have any advice for someone who is neurotypical (well I have an anxiety disorder?? But I don’t think that counts) on dating someone on the spectrum? 

I also had like a really scary experience with someone on the spectrum in high school totally ignoring my romantic/sexual boundaries and getting obsessed with me in a way that goes beyond just like dudes being creepy. That’s not something common right? I understand that someone on the spectrum could have difficultly understand a “soft no” but this guy never ever took my no for an answer. He was just a jerk and that’s not because he’s autistic right?

autism,smileypv,2018/04/09,"Any ABA therapists in here? Our ten-year-old old is level 2 autistic and he's straight up defiant and mean sometimes. He shush us, tell us to be quiet, and argue when we tell him it's time for bed or other application of the rules. Earlier, when we were doing homework, he was so rude to me that I left the table and would not return until he apologized. His response was to order me to come and sit down; I finally got him to apologise, but I don't think he understood why he was apologizing. He orders us around at times and I don't think that the visual schedules I made have helped at all. He just out and out says no to them. 

I'm at a loss. We can't afford ABA because we live in Alabama. He doesn't have ODD and he's on meds for ADHD.

autism,jcwitte,2018/04/10,"3 year old WILL NOT STOP pestering his 1 year old brother. So this is my first post in this subreddit. We have a 3 year old (4 in May) who shows signs of being on the spectrum. He has an appointment in July with a child psychologist for a possible diagnosis. He is in speech and occupational therapy.

His younger brother is just over a year old and is getting pretty good at walking. However, his older brother absolutely will not stop pestering him. I really don't think it's with malice or violence in mind - but he will constantly ""boop"" him with his hips so he plops down on his butt, he won't really ever let him play with toys, he will always need to walk right alongside him and just mess with him so he can't get his bearings right.

We're at our wit's end. We try not to yell unless it gets really out of hand, but it just seems like nothing we do can make his behavior stop. We're also not sure how much of this is just being a big brother picking on his little brother, but it just doesn't seem right. And if we do discipline him just enough, he'll have a meltdown. 

Sorry for all the pronouns!

autism,Vaidif,2018/04/10,"Anxiety Well. I need to ask about anxiety. How to start a post like this. I just did.  

All my life I have had this incessant anxiety. I cannot remember when ever I felt comfortable in whatever circumstance. I got my PDD\-NOS DX a few years ago after first getting ADHD in 2013. 

I always wanted a Yamaha DX7. Now I have a DX but it is not a seven.

So I get help at home from a business that helps with living.They provide a social worker. Making phone calls in particular is very difficult for me. I procrastinate on it, I avoid it. I have always disliked phones and have always been afraid to make calls. I also get help going to official offices. 

My fear increases my ADHD avoidance and procrastination. I am so tired of being afraid. A shrink said that this fear may be there forever. 

**How do you** all cope with fear and anxiety? Normal people, when they have a fear, are thrown in the wolffpit. Afraid of the telephone, go call a million times and the fear will be gone. With autism apparently this is not the case?

So this social worker makes calls but even when during a call needs to ask a question I get stressed. I don;t even want to be there in the room. I just want it taken care of.

But now I hear from the care coordinator that self\-reliance is what they aim for. But if I could overcome these fears wouldn't I have done it?

I think I reached a maximum. Some calls I can do, at times, like call for a dentist appointment. But even then I can delay it for weeks. But their expectations differ from mine. Some things I rather just not want to be confronted with again. They over\-ask. 

**So what is the solution** here? Is there a treatment for anxiety in autism? What helps? Even with 'help' I am still stressed. 

How to deal with the anxiety? Any tips or solutions?",0.9832920536635721,3.5815425029239805,2.2755865153078787,90.69168730650156,93.26900584795322,5.840247678018576,19.863777089783284,7.285733465282438,0.8319252837977302,1384,45,277,27,51,442,171,342,0.194,0.6990000000000001,0.108,-0.9873,1,2,0,0,0,0,60.0,0,1,4,3,30,21,1,13,23,0,33,5,0,6,3,54,60,24,0,12,15,0,1,2,0,3,5,2,2,0,19,10,0,3,4,0,0,4,5,15,1,3,9,3,37,6,36,42,6,33,0,0,0,0,28,10,0,6,20,201,56,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645010609442828,0.0,0.0606671563774867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054730744840175545,0.17084050770254072,0.0,0.0,0.04654095298651177,0.0,0.3141344672780357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19194403439007388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4891880017010187,0.0,0.13955650165732006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0546430736721756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055773440426033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715043208034853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07003698810042044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18081359069914044,0.061907108251390425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4620782680158546,0.0,0.0,0.06571229425370896,0.0,0.0,0.05821428614990828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302647577498304,0.0,0.07779106568900968,0.0,0.05473702159975154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07713586971698767,0.0,0.22936651972833866,0.0,0.0686500241958679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04834057912467697,0.0668718005558638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13705094539351048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149349041524187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06705581309559161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04744707311602642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06554576499022853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07666748485629228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752818906215764,0.0,0.06510128182807333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139693509469743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13953014171505368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04844156608344349,0.0,0.05465557493368111,0.0,0.1567935766475332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04546791467344698,0.04385302889412292,0.0,0.0,0.07981481022244777,0.07866070825972198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05646944699547792,0.16146868033360012,0.0,0.05489773919864765,0.0,0.061534994049664074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04407255368524765
autism,charliebear21,2018/04/10,"Autism related question need help. Genetics question as I'm not the brightest. My boyfriends sister has autism. Hid childhood was ruined as no one has any time for him, the main concern was his sister. Didn't take any interest in him, never even turned up to his parents evenings. No one else in his family has autism, and no one in mine does. If we were to have a child, would they be at higher risk of having autism that anyone else who doesn't have it in the family. This isn't a dig at autistic people at all, I guess I just want a little more understanding.

autism,Zeleiol48,2018/04/10,"Help finding the right stim Hey I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I’m looking for stim advice. I tend to chew/suck on inconvenient things like pens that aren’t mine and fragile headphone cords, so a while ago I got this thing that’s basically a human dog toy. I can’t even remember why I thought it was the right thing for me, it turned out to really not be. I basically never use it, and instead I’m still finding myself putting random things in my mouth. How do I find something that is actually going to be satisfying?",3.8383108108108095,4.950523855855857,5.0230518018018016,83.76268581081084,71.70270270270271,8.072522522522524,27.388513513513516,8.472884824447931,1.7370621621621614,432,15,91,7,8,143,76,111,0.044,0.8690000000000001,0.087,0.6725,1,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,5,0,8,1,1,2,2,17,18,7,0,1,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,13,3,0,0,5,1,0,2,5,0,0,0,3,2,10,2,9,13,0,14,0,0,1,0,3,7,0,2,5,58,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.1595074988389568,0.0,0.0,0.1597253303800385,0.14489208455270994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795980739910316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44818190949604897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09289465948531038,0.0,0.13072907377504597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10955975244085124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07985535468354167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13726017013543082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260657803662254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17077461206979186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15654372299804326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643163888565615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471280039162398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18516148762464865,0.4187663987727081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258348538252461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13053455374260234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15405343487412926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4343662258576034,0.0,0.0,0.1297641963401401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17779098531087756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14117175176118324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14749178672522364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

autism,sexyson91,2018/04/10,"What we need is ACCEPTANCE more than awareness Okay so i have to get something off my chest here. Cause it really pisses me off now. 
Autism. Aspergers Syndrome. High Functioning Autism. No matter what a person has...doesnt mean you know what Autism looks like or what its like. Not one autistic or aspie is going to be similar. Like drugs, autism doesnt care what you look like or where you come from. Just because you've seen Rain Man or the Accoutant doesnt mean you know what autism is like or that you can diagnose it. Autism has different symptoms and looks. Thats why its called Autism SPECTRUM Disorder. It ranges from a lot of things. Did you know there are notable people in the world who have it. Dan Akroyd, Daryl Hannah, Temple Grandin, Stanley Kubrick...even Albert Einstein. You cant judge a peron who has autism that may not be fully outblown autistic that s/he isn't autistic by something you've seen on tv or by someone you know who is severely autistic. I know several people who are and no one person is the same. There are a lot of things we deal with and unless you know someone who does have autism well enough, you dont have the right to take someone out or put someone into a stereotype. You shouldn't stereotype someone PERIOD! 
When i was diagnosed, although multiple times...i found out why i am the way I am. But it doesnt define me as person. Its only a part of who i am. Im weird yes...i have a deep interest in movies, tv shows and music. Passion for history. Good at math. And yes, even contrary to popular belief that those with autism dont have empathy...we do. Some to the point where basic emotions are very intense. I do have mental breakdowns but like a few i am better at hiding it but my real self is only seen by those who i trust and love. Im my full nerdy and weird self with them. The best part is when they join me on my weirdness and they dont look at me as autistic or blame autism for my behavior.. They just see a person with autism who is well...qwerky. Thats what we need. Not just awareness but ACCEPTANCE. So in honor of Autism Awareness/Acceptance month, i dedicate this post to all those with autism and those who have autistic friends, siblings or parents. Own your diagnosis with pride. Accept it and hopefully people will understand that we are just regular people with a different kind of brain function!",2.674221724524081,5.1848102631579005,3.2026017170586063,89.3820772676372,79.04385964912281,6.249272116461368,23.73721537887271,7.459000224883572,1.1316913587159392,1864,64,360,27,47,580,209,456,0.057,0.782,0.162,0.9945,3,0,3,0,0,0,66.0,4,12,4,4,16,29,1,0,17,2,45,9,3,1,1,73,72,31,0,4,21,1,0,6,1,3,4,1,0,7,40,25,0,0,14,3,0,3,14,4,1,2,6,9,39,25,42,61,13,31,1,0,8,2,41,21,1,14,11,243,79,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046929436760814784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08079117198303781,0.06808711465955432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594089500688208,0.0786104520902427,0.0,0.07849149769094031,0.07908496210916516,0.0,0.06631589546426345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936831579038782,0.0,0.15627662634168538,0.0,0.16086620586177855,0.08823165885871292,0.0,0.06737022911604612,0.0,0.2706780896614165,0.0,0.0892783401969333,0.0,0.0,0.0865979389754357,0.0,0.07954624593943722,0.0,0.10169593941027104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441025032678999,0.0594785408263795,0.0,0.040221566747931474,0.0,0.04375243847755494,0.06457149661070948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813390444625785,0.0,0.07646363090878416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16631435915517095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801681935439001,0.253854171566436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256663523341174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258592568509014,0.0,0.0,0.13090005382772807,0.06948210930741353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16771880847504392,0.0,0.0,0.0775829304991832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061448817317652976,0.0,0.0,0.1141670359168906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433426866907072,0.11710136097696815,0.0,0.0,0.08548290554810305,0.1667348443575204,0.0,0.21348725631275509,0.26888187627703664,0.0,0.0,0.07277585655272355,0.0,0.07373049912091408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739134557501179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876259621223954,0.049318662475656014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657449028834912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06134720230947329,0.0,0.16062461582438825,0.1739426274448069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32614636574708183,0.11853386902595422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08001705453796076,0.0578832566545773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229103416094527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801442627881239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06352081652688439,0.0,0.06110723374687595,0.0,0.0,0.13843780220920698,0.0,0.13893425866231734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We’re to use it to help focus on meal times and other activities. ,6.429142857142861,6.363889771428571,6.406428571428571,80.30107142857145,65.57142857142857,9.857142857142858,31.785714285714285,9.516144504307137,2.6232857142857147,284,10,57,5,4,90,49,70,0.055,0.8440000000000001,0.101,0.3182,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,0,4,3,0,2,0,9,8,6,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,3,0,9,6,2,13,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0,9,30,5,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23005114809059465,0.20868693976892308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122998007973601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15779805728728072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15714566768575894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5637335439793926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470352437894819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16663253706282713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26922498249161675,0.2733424863599295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13727615968943838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20332857345386568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3776818258074698,0.2866799428399335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’d really like to know for myself, but I’m worried about potential discrimination in the future at university and jobs interviews. I’m 15 at the moment, getting on fine, I don’t particularly need help so I’m not sure if it’s worth the risk of losing opportunities in the future.

autism,bradley91,2018/04/11,"Autism has me stuck at a dead end street. I wasn't diagnosed with autism, but if anyone sees me in real life, they will suspect that I have autism. I don't know why something so horrible has to exist in this world. It makes life so much harder than it should be. 

My life of 22 years has been complete misery. I have no achievements, no nothing to show for living this long. Most people my age have a job, relationship, tons of life experience, friends etc . I will never get to experience any of that stuff. I don't know anyone and can't engage in a conversation properly. People always like to tease me by calling me slow or dumb. I don't know what kind of sick pleasure people get by hurting my self-esteem. People are complete assholes.

Nothing works for me. I hoped that with time and practice I will get a better understanding of people and social skills but it never works. If anything, I have gotten worse at it since I am constantly worried about my performance in a conversation.

autism,nyx1969,2018/04/11,"Boy Scouts! Hi I'm just going to leave this pretty open ended.  My twin boys (one autistic -- he was given a ""moderate"" functioning label -- I'm sorry if that offends anyone, but I just wanted to give an idea of the level of difficulties he faces in a group of this sort -- and the other adhd).  they are about to ""graduate"" from being cub scouts to being boy scouts, and I have a lot of worries that are probably pretty predicable:  basically they are safety and bullying and or getting left out.  

If you were a boy scout, or if you have a loved one who is or was a boy scout, I would love to hear your experiences and any advice.  

Also, if by some miraculous chance you are near the Emory area in Atlanta, Georgia, I would particularly love to hear troop recommendations (or warnings!!).

autism,whereiscottoneyedjoe,2018/04/11,"How do I help my best friend? Hey everyone! I'm seeking some advice here. I have no idea where else to turn. Something is wrong with my best friend. I can see it. I just don't know what is going on. Here's some details. 

Up until about last month, Joe (no real names used) really enjoyed school and loved coming home to do his homework and play his video games. Slowly, he went from a happy guy, loving school, to pretty much a zombie. 

He gets up, often skips breakfast, his favorite meal, goes to class, comes home, rarely socializes, eats a ton of food, then goes to sleep until the next morning, often 14+ hours at a time.

The odd thing is, his whiteboards are COVERED in what I presume is some pretty high powered math, and sometimes he gets up at odd hours of the night and does more ""math stuff"" on the white boards. I dont know what any of the symbols mean but I can tell it's like a ""work in progress"". 

The only people he really talks to is his friend from school. Even then, its sparse compared to normal. 

This isn't the guy he is. What's happening to him? I dont know what to do.

Please help!

autism,DronkTum,2018/04/11,"I think my mom believes I have autism I (17/f) was looking for something in my moms room when i found some notes she had taken from at a seminar she had went to this weekend for parents who have children with depression/anxiety. But what caught my eye is have she had written down some things I had told her, along with multiple resources and notes mentioning autism.

I've asked my mom seriously before if she thought I was, just based off how I've noticed myself act. She said no because people notice autism in children when they're young. Which I've recently learned isn't always the case (this year I had met a girl who was just diagnosed  at 17).

Do I bring up the notes I saw? or just wait to see if she says anything? If I am autistic will it affect any aspects of my life? Or is it just a label? Should I feel betrayed she wouldn't talk to me about this? This is all quite shocking for me and I don't know what to expect.

autism,StarfireRoth,2018/04/11,"Where can I get diagnosed as an adult in the NY area? Hello, I am a 22 year old woman and believe I show symptoms of a higher functioning autism spectrum disorder. I’ve been “awkward” my whole life and have trouble expressing my thoughts and how I feel to others. I’ve never been in a relationship and I find it hard to read other people which is why I’ve had a few toxic friendships because I cannot tell when people are taking advantage of me or when they are cruel to me. I find it easier to type out how I feel onto paper rather than explain it. Which is why I find public speaking so difficult but writing a paper so easy. I excel at writing and literature which is now my major. I don’t know where to get diagnosed or assessed at this age. I live in NYC so any one specializing in adults or willing to assess an adult in the Manhattan or even Queens area would be great. Also how does the process work and about how long should it take? How should I prepare?

autism,yadithedadi,2018/04/11,"Gift for a child with autism Hi everyone :) 

My younger brother has autism. He's going to be turning 9 this month. He's one of the sweetest people I've ever met. He loves sea creatures, animals, music, and anything involving Disney.

He's verbal, but his speech is limited to short sentences so it's a bit hard knowing what he wants. I'm an intern for his speech therapist and we've been helping him speak in ways he's comfortable with. 

So far I've learned that he wants a cake, balloons , a clock for his bedroom , and more sea creature and animal figurines  (he has nearly 100 at this point it's a goto gift).

Do you guys have any ideas for presents for him? I've been saving up money for a few months now so I could get him something really nice.

autism,RagazzaMatta,2018/04/11,"Please Help Me My son is not officially diagnosed, but I've been suspecting it since I was diagnosed a while ago. He's 4 and goes to a Montessori preschool 3 days a week. Before this our main concern was his speech issues. He is hard to understand and his teachers mentioned last semester that it was causing him to become frustrated. He's supposed to start speech therapy soon. He also has a bad temper. Aside from this he's a very smart and sweet kid who loves math and babies. 

Today I go to pick him up and his teacher says I need to come inside because he's refusing to leave. One of his teachers is with him in the classroom and as soon as she starts talking to me he starts making noise with a chair, then running around the room. He was laughing like he thought it was funny. But what really concerned new is that his teacher said he's losing friends because of his temper and he's been making violent threats that scare the other kids. 
I told teacher we were trying to get him evaluated for autism and she thought that was a good idea. I had to carry him to the car and he was hitting, kicking, biting, pulling my hair the whole way. 

I'm not really sure what to do from here. I'm completely drained. I see my therapist (who is amazing) tomorrow night, who will be doing his evaluation, but I know from my experience it can take a while to get an appointment. 

Does anyone have any ideas? I've basically been just sitting here stimming for hours because I'm so stressed. 

P.S. Thought I should mentioned this was his second day back after spring break. He really struggles with transitions and I think that may be part of it.

autism,vmkhaze,2018/04/12,"Kids edu company seeking parents help to be more inclusive I don't know a whole lot about the community so I'm asking for help. 
I started a company dedicated to teaching kids money management and financial education. It was originally created for suggested age range 5-10 or K-3rd grade according to US federal education guidelines. Recently our products have received a little attention from the special needs community, specifically autism and ADHD. 
I would like to make our products more inclusive and possibly have them 3rd party tested. 
This means I am either looking for:
1) suggestions on companies who do that (prefered)
2) parents who would be interested in trying our products with their children and providing written or video reviews that include what they thought was good about them or how we can improve our products. (the products will be free of course.)

Note about the products, I just updated all of our products to a dyslexia friendly font.
If you want to look us up the company name is Money Munchkids.

autism,geraili,2018/04/12,"aggressive behavior of autistic child Hello all,

I have a nine\-years\-old brother who has been diagnosed with mild autism, but he is aggressive as hell. As he getting older and stronger, it is getting harder to control him. His behavior is really primitive as my parents kept him at home, and as he gets more aware and smart, he gets more aggressive because he wants more and the situation is the same. Because he beats others and shows self\-injuring behaviors other kids and grownups refuse to play or be with him. I don't know what will happen as he gets smarter and older. Is he going to be more aggressive?? What if he gets stronger, and he cause real trouble. As the doctor prescription, we give him Risperidone, Automoxetine, and some other nutrients. Are there any medication that can help his aggression?? I am the reason that my mother can control him currently, and I will leave the country soon, and the guilt is keeling me. Also in my country, there are not appropriate social care for these kind of children.

Thank you for being such a supportive and great community. Because of a very long story, I am hoping to find either a memoir or autobiography of a person with autism who attempted suicide. It was recommended to me and the recommender could not recall the title or author, or many other details. 

Separately, if anyone knows of any plays or anything like that related to autism in any way, I have a separate project where I'm hoping to use examples from plays to help people understand.

autism,MrP0tatoe,2018/04/13,"How can I elevate my confidence? (I'm an 18 year old male with autism) Hiya,

I'm an 18 year old male. I was diagnosed with ASD at the age of 4. Throughout my development, I have worked hard to sculpt my behaviour around societal convention.  Unfortunately, I have been experiencing severe social anxiety which is a major barrier for me to lead a normal social life; I have really struggled to spur an open dialogue with those I do not know well. However, there has been a shift in my composure over the last couple of days. I have been able to truly socialise like a neurotypical person without the shackles of autism and it's been really empowering. For instance, today as I walked my dog, I bumped into my neighbours and pulled off an open-ended conversation. To experience that kind of interaction with another human being is so satisfying and heart-warming. Most people would take this for granted but this is a massive change for me. However, I worry this is just a temporary state and I will soon succumb to my worrisome mind, isolating myself to close friends, relatives and the internet once again, reinforcing a state of loneliness. My question is, what can I do to retain this confidence? Why have I been able to act the way I have recently? I am desperate to find this answer. I think very much like the rest of society but when it comes to actually talking to people, the adrenaline overwhelms my mind.",5.8988396667344025,7.636700277992282,6.993497256655152,69.20203617150986,67.45559845559845,11.166917293233084,32.93659825238773,11.10113133989139,4.2861305019305025,1128,50,189,37,19,379,155,259,0.105,0.812,0.083,-0.404,3,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,0,2,9,7,0,2,18,0,26,2,0,2,0,33,32,11,0,2,5,0,1,2,2,2,2,0,0,5,11,14,0,2,5,1,0,5,2,2,1,0,6,2,28,5,34,23,4,28,1,1,0,0,13,8,0,2,14,136,39,2,0.26930628377967997,0.0,0.13140204253524804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14119555989522076,0.10300928498387077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11986984440585055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14244516974999916,0.11599175873408755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14899114035741684,0.0,0.08684013694245417,0.0,0.0,0.1366701045918181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192627165444392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171661068042506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123070532239966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040326834025299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12062276656081375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15956462146906106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1402205262945246,0.07400184529877189,0.10976028255566228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09510949628329513,0.13156944706892112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719225760256946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898555267811167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319314894829804,0.0,0.0,0.2825916426337228,0.14340120150953453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18670306834939485,0.11757392968440565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15084233573583278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725245013707733,0.0,0.13295373294013954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1521197228424955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2745238417733627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076870023480442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10124240491088678,0.10822909488069243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628029626744127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12763543393294802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110294407694538,0.0,0.1068813964443065,0.0,0.0,0.12106934575120736,0.0,0.12150351659914675,0.0,0.0,0.12980082367323192,0.0,0.09802909100698334,0.13674680180818305,0.0,0.09565372861116417,0.0,0.0,0.17342441720076915
autism,ambiguous_affliction,2018/04/13,"School bullies parents again So after years and years of attempting to have my son tested for Autism nothing came to fruition. We were told it was our fault and a disciplinary problem. Subsequently, we decided to spend our money and have him tested by a real doctor specializing in Autism. SHOCKER! He has autism.  Today we met with the school and now they want to have him tested as well by the schools psychologist. We refused....of course. During the course of this meeting it was becoming abundantly clear that they were teaming up against us. They reiterated that the reason his grades aren’t up to par must be due to home life and attendance. After said meeting I decided it would be best to pull him out of this school.

autism,confused123456,2018/04/13,"I'm so excited to see DEEJ. Consider supporting this film! Advocacy on behalf of other nonspeaking autistics on what inclusion truly means https://www.deejmovie.com/

Abandoned by his birth parents and presumed incompetent, DJ Savarese (“Deej”) found not only a loving family but also a life in words, which he types on a text-to-voice synthesizer. As he makes his way through high school and dreams of college, he confronts the terrors of his past, society's obstacles to inclusion, and the sometimes paralyzing beauty of his own senses. In his advocacy on behalf of other nonspeaking autistics, he embraces filmmaking and poetry, and discovers what having a voice can truly mean.

1. Inclusion shouldn’t be a lottery.
DJ was born into poverty. Only through the miracle of adoption and his new parents’ insistence that he be included in mainstream classes was he able to be included. To claim a place in mainstream society should be everyone’s right, and access must begin with education.

2. Communication is a basic right.
Every child deserves the chance to achieve literacy and become fully educated. Competence must be presumed. Whenever possible, children should be included in regular classes and not, as DJ has put it, in “segregated in classes of easy lessons.”

3. Redefining “normal.""
Cultural perceptions shape reality; pity hurts, not helps. We must end old myths and stereotypes that often lead to discrimination and abuse. Even “low- and high-functioning” labels are misguided and can restrict an individual’s rights. Neurological diversity should not just be accepted; it should be celebrated.

4) “Nothing about us without us.”
Self-advocacy is essential in the fight for accommodation and acceptance. While the contributions of non-autistic people are important and appreciated, the meaningful involvement of autistics remains critical. The making of Deej as well as the shaping and execution of its engagement campaign embody this principle.

5) Interdependence, not independence.
We all need support of one kind or another and we all have something to offer in turn. Creating adequate community services and supports should be seen in this light. Society will benefit with a shift away from the culturally loaded concept of independence to that of self-determination, respect and interdependence.

autism,matangi797,2018/04/13,"Why do people with autism always run to big groups? Sometimes I’m with friends, just walking to a lesson, not talking, and this guy with autism in our class will run up to us, join the walk, with nothing to say. Or if someone and their friend have to run quick to do something, the guy with autism will also run. Why is this?",4.955307692307695,5.174170338461543,4.362884615384616,92.7258653846154,68.69230769230771,6.5,27.01923076923077,3.1291,0.4718461538461538,252,7,55,0,4,75,44,65,0.0,0.871,0.129,0.8343,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,2,0,1,1,3,2,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,12,7,5,0,1,4,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,0,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,2,13,5,0,10,0,0,0,0,10,3,0,2,1,35,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921917567250476,0.1999737526627396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3713566126728282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4759288270024261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306030478086941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16661451182986767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19112000501411128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20363076823443665,0.18501772015967285,0.23769244417591776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1931680927234579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2890873125393845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4337207584803933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,iamtherealandy,2018/04/13,"Please help me help my two autistic students... I teach a wildly popular writing workshop where students create full feature length screenplays in 10 weeks. The course is hugely experiential in that after the students spend two weeks outlining, they begin writing, ad we do exciting table reads of our work.

There are 25 non-autistic students in the class and two autistic. One of the autistic cannot modulate, so all sentences are shouts. The other student cannot speak loudly enough to be heard by anyone. Or if we can hear him, he speaks so fast we can't understand. If I ask him to slow down he screams at me.

Another student has PTSD and flinches and weeps every time the shouter shouts.

I'm completely lost.

autism,realestateofmind,2018/04/13,"Neorologist vs Developmental Pediatrician for diagnosis of ASD I am a physical therapist who often refers families to a developmental pediatrician for evaluation and diagnosis of autism. Current waiting lists in my area for the evaluation are up to a year long. I do my best to advocate for necessary therapy services while parents wait for the appointment.

Would it be beneficial to see a neurologist for a diagnosis instead? Obviously, the developmental evaluation would be more thorough and provide greater insight for treatment/therapy. But, for the sake of getting the diagnosis sooner, does it make sense to send families to the neurologist in the meantime?",10.335100133511348,12.377208971962617,11.876101468624835,37.14242990654208,57.41121495327103,15.833911882510016,50.799732977303066,14.138980108339055,8.910677970627502,548,38,68,26,7,195,65,107,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.8738,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,12,0,7,0,0,1,1,13,12,4,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,1,20,8,3,9,0,0,1,0,3,4,0,1,4,55,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2487123190463439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20739649527120668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4468368239885421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12382044839819398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.209733697357414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15819644039162395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2631556289609461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1888548535550112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5420503730314511,0.27517022255049783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367098279528573,0.0,0.0,0.15261743197661434
autism,turnechGodhead,2018/04/13,"How do you explain sound sensitivity to non-autists? I guess I'm super higher functioning, considering I don't get overwhelmed by touch sensations that much (I hate very light touching and I sort of avoid physical contact) but I'm still screwed up by sound. Thankfully I have sheer force of willpower so I don't freak out, but loud noises make me MISERABLE. I hate going to concerts, I hate when someone uses the TV (they turn it up), I hate loud talking, I hate loud yelling etc. etc.

I usually just walk away, but there are times I can't and I want to know how I can politely ask someone to lower their voice? Over Easter we were eating dinner, and my relative was just talking SO FUGGING LOUD, but I was trapped at the table with people on either side of me so I couldn't leave. In situations like this I usually try covert methods of helping myself, like put my head in my hands to disguise it when I cover my ears.

Is there anyway I can ask people to quiet down a bit? How have any of you guys explained sound sensitivity in a way that no one accused you of being rude and selfish? I don't want to be rude to others, but loud noises are almost like...painful, I guess is the only word.",3.1104237288135583,4.962057161016952,4.362000000000002,84.80630508474577,74.84745762711864,6.9233898305084765,26.630508474576274,7.7348632917899725,1.537875254237289,934,35,184,13,20,307,137,236,0.249,0.6729999999999999,0.078,-0.9935,2,2,1,0,1,0,30.0,1,3,2,1,14,17,8,3,5,0,19,6,3,5,0,32,41,17,0,3,8,0,3,2,0,0,0,13,0,1,6,7,2,1,3,2,0,3,6,13,0,1,3,17,34,4,28,35,5,22,0,2,0,1,15,12,1,4,8,121,40,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11679328743643225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07931592374508348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21807630223957786,0.0,0.10958259342913178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12733541112967742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11934690978436695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601581193891538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06093706895830174,0.0,0.06628646211892616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569736063567637,0.11548716811126512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5757654787054985,0.11970134657784295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07817810431909514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06409964607230698,0.0,0.0,0.1234998175610978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709461762135328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07785489005903865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08574027941224803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07903501825830933,0.08870631213454007,0.12410805765669483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16172029972350646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172505733462705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13110283204225615,0.0,0.0,0.19764922340874785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09314500747201952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18749388339086853,0.0,0.10738200568847993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0680109129175618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918763283720973,0.12686558601099832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1007353493433052,0.2569143510342995,0.09623624065279493,0.13758890519786682,0.09257957901095304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,FilsonShmilson,2018/04/14,"Am I autistic? On the spectrum? [33, M] I know you can’t diagnose me, and at this point in life I’m not sure how helpful a diagnosis would be, but despite my charmed beginnings, my inability to connect with others, including family, has been a life-long struggle for me.

I’ve learned many techniques over the years that allow me to superficially connect, but it’s more politeness than true interaction.

I consider myself a driven and generally positive person, but I have many social shortcomings and sensory issues that distress me, and the sensory issues cause even worse social issues for me.

I don’t have a lot of time right now, but I will return to share more when I do.

Thank you for reading.

Edit:  the reason I found you and posted here today is because my wife read an article about autism and began to recognize similarities between myself and person in the article.",6.366442687747039,7.742274385093168,7.488368153585548,67.44368718238287,66.01863354037266,10.575042348955392,34.51214003387916,10.637119530657019,4.158845962732919,700,32,112,19,11,237,107,161,0.129,0.767,0.104,-0.4915,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,3,0,1,6,7,0,2,10,0,12,2,0,4,2,25,19,13,0,1,5,1,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,5,8,0,0,4,2,0,1,3,2,0,0,4,0,21,5,17,12,3,17,0,0,0,0,11,7,0,1,8,85,26,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191606855310083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15489593100795612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15304182291042998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995909133327959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421450269909628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16532604887557414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010668328608933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4721356090545168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08286652986096922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21300533471838204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334384297411822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12819052551766816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057410945162136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633162326082154,0.0,0.0,0.14253890695522234,0.0,0.14440867138876393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3016481044779428,0.0,0.0,0.15503029201334376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12876807005494986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3074090658147126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15763138952010478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14211142693550574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13882095652879994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879229245633817,0.0,0.14292488862433714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15366101163874554,0.1071120933034575,0.0,0.0,0.09709946818601303
autism,BlueSkyla,2018/04/14,"Is Autism hereditary? My son looks to be on the spectrum after finally getting him evaluated to enter preschool a few weeks back. We still need proper diagnosis but he clearly is a bit different. But other than not talking much at 5 he seems mostly normal to me. (Should I even say normal? I'm not exactly normal. I'll get to that.) 

He is a super picky eater and refuses to do things he can or has before. He used to feed himself. Now he will only eat cereal himself and of course chips. I find it strange to me he will spoon cereal but won't use utensils for anything else. I was ecstatic the other day when I got him to eat his own slice of pizza like he used to. It just feels like he refuses most of the time because he likes to be babied. He is the youngest of three boys. 

So back to my question. While he has certain qualities, he doesn't exactly fit either. He has great eye contact. He is super physical and loves to play and touch like tickling and hugs and kisses he's fine. He's shy but mostly when he's unfamiliar. Main thing is his terrible speech delay. 

So I ask about it being hereditary because of me. I have always had super sensitive hearing and taste and especially smell. (I have a super good nose for bad meats and even viruses. Like I can smell the flu on me or my kids. I know. It's weird but helpful. I got that from my mom.) Maybe touch too but that's mostly a spacial bubble thing with strangers. I have horrible anxiety at times. But I can still function in a job and life. Well mostly. I absolutely do have issues. 

I have always been a picky eater but have learned to overcome that a ton. Still picky but not terrible. It's my apatite that is the issue with that these days. Moving on. I'm semi shy in that once I get to know people I'm fine and talkative.  But I hate crowded places and small spaces. Gives me anxiety. But I push myself through it if I have to. 

The main thing that gets me is the hypersensitivity. I didn't even know it was a thing most of my life. I didn't realize my hearing was different than others. I'm not exactly sensitive to loud noises, rather than the small or inaudible. Dog whistles will give me a headache. I knew that was unusual. Most don't believe me anyhow. I can't sleep without a fan because of my tinnitus and I'll hear EVERYTHING otherwise. 

The smell thing was a big thing as a kid. When I'd get sick with the flu or a cold I'd smell this horrible death smell that made me feel sicker. Today the smell isn't so bad and only helpful. Today I just hate the candle and perfume sections in stores. Makes me queasy. I don't wear perfume and only wear men's deodorant. Smells better than women and its easier to find men's plain deodorant than women anyhow. (Antiperspirant has aluminum and is very bad for you. I originally stopped using it cause it actually CAUSED me to sweat. I only learned later the negative effects of aluminum.) So now I wonder, is my poor appetite mainly caused by my heightened smell? Maybe. 

It's not even sure that my son is on the spectrum yet. The school did classify him as such to qualify for kindergarten next year. Not for preschool though but he did qualify for the preschool through the district anyhow with his delays. People are hesitant to even say he is, that he might just start talking. And lately I see that he just might. Now that he's been in school, he says more words and attempts sentences even if they are not understood. He's also starting to eat more on his own with less assistance. 

The thing is too, his father didn't talk until 5 at all. Would scream a lot and nearly ruptured his vocal chords. My husband is not on the spectrum. Once he started talking he progressed through school normally and with honors classes and sports. 

It's like the combination of my husbands delayed speech and my hypersensitivity and anxiety has combined into my little man. Poor little man. My other two kids are above average in school. My middle son has a lisp and takes speech but it's improved a ton. 

TL;DR

My 5 year old son may or may not be autistic, doesn't fit all categories but mostly he doesn't talk much. I have hypersensitivity, maybe I'M actually on the spectrum?? His father had delayed speech but overcame it. So is autism hereditary? Cause maybe he just has a bad combo of my wackiness and my husbands delayed speech as a child, and will overcome it all. Or maybe he won't. Often I think I've done something terribly wrong as a parent or I gave him something I don't even know if I have.

autism,mypure,2018/04/14,"Is it possible to be extroverted AND have autism? My whole life, I’ve been a super social person. I’m pretty great at first impressions. Hired on the spot in job interviews, easily make people laugh, can make almost anyone engage in conversation with me and open up to me, I’m a really social person. Bubbly, social butterfly, charismatic, etc. At least, in small doses. 

But after that initial impression wears off, and I get comfortable... I’m very socially awkward, inappropriate, offensive, overbearing. I overshare, I overreact, I’m just... a lot. 

Every autism quiz I fill out says I don’t have it. 
I’m very good at reading body language, understanding facial cues, I’m aware when I’ve made someone bored or annoyed. 

I just don’t think before I speak. That’s my biggest problem. I don’t know how to maintain healthy relationships either. I didn’t get much social experience during my childhood. I didn’t have friends outside of school and grew up on the Internet. 

Could I be on the autism spectrum, or is this a different problem?

autism,n_oneall,2018/04/16,"Brain balance? Hi guys!!

I have a 6, going on 7 year old brother with autism. He has never been on any type of medicine to help with his autism. Unfortunate circumstances happened and he now lives with his maternal grandparents. They are considering Brain Balance instead of medicating him. To be honest, it seems extremely gimmicky. The special diet and the special “exercises” that he has to follow and partake in everyday seem no helpful. 

Has anyone done or know someone who has done Brain Balance? Thank you!",4.664831460674153,7.895670820224723,4.984370786516855,75.17902808988765,76.75280898876404,7.604943820224719,33.619101123595506,8.548686976883017,3.4979114606741564,409,22,62,9,10,129,67,89,0.051,0.767,0.182,0.9226,1,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,1,0,2,4,0,0,3,0,10,6,3,0,1,11,17,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,6,1,0,3,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,3,0,6,4,11,13,0,10,0,0,0,0,14,3,0,3,5,41,9,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12557459392255865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911801202955464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6184222410079533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779409649311756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049460835871963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828416483611505,0.16329352811114226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475463498365757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10148387166213424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16305746410019578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18602472529414388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14242056537051118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19376877615718294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33621361596208305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15646114800624172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17000938931580686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11891447589736903

autism,joophaha,2018/04/16,"How do you deal with social anxiety? I know this is a big question, so let me make it a bit smaller. Does anyone have tips for dealing with social anxiety?

I was diagnosed a few months ago with autism. I don't really notice it myself but it hasn't come as a shock for me since my whole family is autistic.
Now my problem is that I get really anxious when in public space. I get really self conscious about how I act and I really don't want to stand out in the way I act. Which is sad because I used to be quite extraverted.

Does anyone have tips on how you deal with social anxiety?

The earliest ones told my mother to never expect me to read or write. My special needs school years were hell and I dropped out at 13.  I know things have changed in the 17 years since I have been in school but I don’t want my daughter to go through what I did. 
I have her first IEP meeting since she started school this afternoon and I haven’t slept all night because I’m so worried about it. I don’t what her treated like I was when I was a kid. 

Do you guys have any tips or tricks you know to say to these teachers or anything that I need to know about before I go see them today?",1.1247058823529414,3.0885183333333366,2.0389803921568617,98.61141176470586,81.35294117647058,4.602875816993464,21.964705882352945,5.2151,-0.1905403921568629,567,18,131,2,15,177,90,153,0.073,0.8809999999999999,0.046,-0.5926,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,2,2,1,9,6,2,0,4,0,14,2,1,1,2,21,29,12,0,4,4,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,8,5,0,0,3,2,0,3,4,3,0,2,7,2,26,3,15,22,1,20,1,1,1,0,17,5,1,4,12,85,34,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10866561186643688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314971035706965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287196255623348,0.0,0.09740912955096034,0.0,0.1359731902624566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16904119432235346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13592096031383286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27244437022878376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15822149188939602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.263456324984214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11286744837569852,0.07806742941124623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2369709154780076,0.123243224564155,0.0,0.0,0.14995613722230722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10828076144604644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31967510959107803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12707485072379274,0.0,0.4851611248280199,0.12733537817232282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26436701261703804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131032366215489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616024063179312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15146632369313806,0.15269031312783854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09425082545474447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16227888062464513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20580459596999626
autism,djnotown,2018/04/16,"We finally received our meeting with the elementary school matriarch So I recorded the session, illegally of course. I did this only for reference purposes. After we brought them the proof stating our son has autism, by a PHD of course, the school finally changed their tune. Even if it was short lived, we caught them in a lie and now they are willing to have him tested for autism! What an absolute turn of events. However, my significant other and I have decided to pull him out of that scubas of a school and find alternatives. Any ideas anyone? I live in the Central Valley in California. Thank you all.

autism,mephitidae,2018/04/17,"Talking is so hard, even though I'm high functioning For a while now I've known two girls with asperger's (twins) and the difference between them and me is kind of striking. They seem pretty normal and seem to talk so easily, one of them is the type who talks non stop. I'm high functioning and apparently no one suspects I'm not normal (just very shy or rude), but in most cases talking is so difficult. When analyzing myself I realized it's because I get overwhelmed just from someone sitting across from me looking at me (so a normal conversation). With multiple people it's super overwhelming and nearly impossible to talk unless directly asked a question. Even then it's difficult to ""access"" the information in my head, then it takes me longer to think of how to word it in a coherent sentence. I literally can't have a conversation unless it's one on one. I guess because it's less overwhelming and simplifies the social aspect as well.  It's not even anxiety, I can be perfectly calm but my brain just isn't in the same mindset as everyone else, including these people with asperger's. And conversation often goes too fast for me to think and word a response. What's discouraging is that most people won't give me the time to think of a response, and take my initial silence (or um) as me not having an answer and then they'll go to someone else and stop trying to talk to me. I have strong interests but I don't talk nonstop about them because I can't. It takes so much effort to speak multiple sentences in a row, with a lot of pausing to think. And it's only a speaking thing, with typing/writing I have plenty of time and was always good at English classes.

I know it's a spectrum but I really wonder what the difference is in the brain between people who have no trouble physically talking and those that do - of course to the point where they may be mute. Like how some people have no sensory problems and for others it's the main problem.

autism,Random_Name10,2018/04/17,"Adults with Autism? Can you share your experience? My 2 year old son has ASD, but we are uncertain of his level at this time. He is nonverbal, doesn’t respond to his name, and seeks sensory input so it is hard to get him to focus and engage with people. 

We love him unconditionally and want to help him reach his potential. I have seen so many posts from people who identify as autistic on this board and want to hear from you about your own experiences.

What was your life like as a child? When did you learn to speak? Are there any therapies or services you feel benefitted you or hindered you? How are you doing in life now? 

I hope this post does not offend anyone as I truly just want to understand what is in store in my son’s future. Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",3.681730769230768,5.592215506410259,4.672051282051285,82.93961538461541,73.42307692307692,7.876923076923077,23.538461538461537,8.617729084823388,1.4752461538461534,633,18,126,12,13,206,107,156,0.026,0.72,0.254,0.991,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,2,11,0,0,8,10,1,1,1,0,15,3,0,1,0,26,26,15,0,5,6,2,2,1,0,1,2,2,0,2,7,8,0,0,4,0,1,0,2,2,0,0,3,5,24,8,21,21,1,14,0,0,1,1,32,6,0,5,7,85,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740038018974599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24218164876672665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12450772111627804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15582654840369795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3483649670074404,0.0,0.0,0.09003539961028728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09303201131946737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19631813137535947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595119471881041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20069305534557366,0.0,0.1193537268903662,0.0,0.0,0.17685947991072282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25154622764483553,0.08699393692750758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16071130247357154,0.0,0.0,0.18053073427301253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18685006346983374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2468967577807208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410755563946111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16393902987939482,0.2036337175803629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383157786475608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853727382034057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3150834000867359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126492808460638,0.0,0.0,0.11466851269619148

autism,the_lilypad,2018/04/17,"Looking to hear feedback on my app focused on helping individuals with autism &amp; their supporting community Hey y'all,
I posted a long time ago on a different account about an idea I was working on called [Chronaly](https://www.chronaly.com/product), and I was wowed by the interest the community had in it.

Chronaly's a mobile health startup devoted to helping improve wellness &amp; education outcomes for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. We’re looking in the future to use a mixture of data analysis (including machine learning) to provide behavioral-research-level insight for everyone, from PhDs to single parents, as part of our platform through various tools in the works. 

I started Chronaly initially as a passion project, growing up with an older brother with ASD who struggled to get proper care from schools, therapists, and doctors, who often made decisions based on 15 minute appointments rather than the holistic picture.

We recently soft-launched our first iteration for iOS and Android smartphones, which you can take a look at [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chronaly/id1202635037?ls=1&amp;mt=8) (iOS) and [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chronaly.flagship) (Android). We’re in the early stages with a scrappy team of 7 (I’m our Chief Technology Officer), and really are looking to make the app as helpful and useful to the community we care about as we can.

We’re looking to hold focus groups/1-1 chats this coming week and in the future (virtually or in-person in our LA office), as well as more regular feedback from customers to see how we can improve the usefulness of our platform.

If you’re a:

* Doctor devoted to treating ASD (Psychiatry, Neurology, etc.)
* Parent of a child with ASD
* Individual with ASD
* Teacher who has pupils with ASD (e.g. special needs)
* Therapist focused on ASD (e.g. psychotherapy, ABA, occupational therapy)

We’d love to get your input and have you try out our platform. 

If you’re interested, I’ve attached a Google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJgxEcUwe1PL5M5jKF3qlFqfcjnRoCS6tQOqAQIDA03WeUXA/viewform) and I’d love to talk to you soon!

autism,Vencorr,2018/04/18,"I'm sick of it, honestly. I was diagnosed with Autism Level 1 in August of 2017. I am currently 17 right now, and the main reason why I got diagnosed late was because of my dad. He didn't want me to be diagnosed, and I am pretty sure that is due to the fear of having him being diagnosed or pointed to because he was never diagnosed with anything. I have shown signs of autism when I was 2 years old, but he just thought a little discipline would work. He has been out of my life for 2 years now. I haven't seen him at all in that time. Now, back on topic. Since everyone in the spectrum is different, I believe I was very autistic in a way. I would constantly have temper tantrums, be socially awkward, and not understand things as clearly as everyone else. Even today, I struggle with some simple tasks and understanding people. I know it is autism, I do my research and most of the time it points to autism.

I was excited when I got diagnosed because I was always labeled ""the weird kid"" in school. I was also constantly bullied for being different. I didn't know why. I now know. For awhile after being diagnosed. I would find out something I would do or the way I react to be related to autism, which was cool. I was finding more things about me and why. Now, I pretty much know a lot about my autism, and when people point it out, it kinda gets annoying. It feels like an entirely new label was put onto me. ""Autistic"". Not saying the label is bad or anything, it just annoys me.

So, I got mad today. I live in a house with 4 people. My brother, my mother, my grandmother, and I. My grandmother and I were having a conversation about something when she brought up a behavior I had and why I did something the way I did it. She said it was because of my autism. This is the part where I got mad. I started yelling at her about it not just being autism, and not to call anything I do autistic. She kept trying to explain that it is an autistic trait, and that I need to accept that. I got frustrated and walked out of the room, yelling ""Just stop it!"". I ended up going to my bed and crying a little.

When I was first diagnosed, it was kinda awesome. Now, it just feels like a burden to carry around.

I just sometimes wish I wasn't autistic. I wish I could properly carry out a normal conversation with a human being, I wish I could stop obsessing over things, I wish I could function like a normal human being.",3.1995355587808447,4.892732069182388,4.5917400419287215,83.92642960812775,74.2201257861635,7.575745847443961,26.486534429930657,8.303829127061777,1.8080139654894367,1875,68,366,32,39,623,197,477,0.136,0.759,0.105,-0.9456,3,0,3,0,2,0,70.0,0,0,0,2,27,22,7,4,23,1,55,10,0,2,4,83,84,27,0,15,14,3,2,3,0,4,10,4,2,3,24,25,0,4,14,0,0,4,9,14,0,1,32,8,66,8,54,36,8,68,0,0,1,0,23,28,0,8,36,276,90,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05005477041558856,0.05208152758079558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1545235577783968,0.05572011757982548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04812935618564258,0.05226167486492745,0.15262191941455994,0.0,0.0,0.07051970855263998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06391339270279175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13527935219163362,0.0,0.14992376855732564,0.0,0.06875433256325503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5082362013731933,0.0,0.13079055920005525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05228755368931332,0.0,0.055437901180934605,0.0,0.0,0.0413414014229714,0.0,0.0,0.1196186064540762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07043336028378028,0.06329675461782272,0.08943142213743639,0.0,0.0,0.11441584096505107,0.053240691984919986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03270171742214386,0.0,0.035572455160422574,0.0,0.2503025545705224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722227218592227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13759562437441095,0.0,0.07060646088599784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04421055472400799,0.0917378148390476,0.12546718139666335,0.055269850308011736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05321344886494173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04601229492927575,0.04641114766706485,0.0482747807482988,0.06045170816430277,0.0,0.0,0.12265366895086052,0.0,0.0,0.06567973635351831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677809966823978,0.0,0.1301801588110853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1775089104104108,0.0,0.0,0.12735705773131206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06292221110565455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06435496292143696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05345319463849056,0.05953929048801679,0.04977564145216386,0.0,0.06334640845774236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05177671882695175,0.0,0.0,0.06380462416505225,0.0,0.1445590538826853,0.0619050521493833,0.0,0.04430291376371753,0.0,0.0,0.10465936795768037,0.0,0.06543471018520551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05899218463937224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12474995746363347,0.0,0.0,0.049691027248642286,0.07299575427147759,0.0,0.1186597249933328,0.0,0.0,0.04249583441801106,0.0,0.0,0.1303208823827358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05164492486093542,0.03691836164028208,0.14904776109016193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.225918045187228,0.0,0.2879106750256148,0.0,0.0,0.04556769472945047,0.0,0.0,0.17785413943200706,0.0,0.0,0.08061434437941029
autism,TheFeshy,2018/04/18,"She ran! Today was my daughter's second day of school, ever.  She just turned 3, and the state has accepter her into their developmentally delayed preschool, into the program specializing in autism.  She qualified for full-day schooling, so she is there for six hours a day, which is a very long time for a three-year old.  She's around more kids her age than she has ever been, in a new and different place, with unfamiliar routines and teachers she's only just met.  But since she is nonverbal, I had only a little idea how her first day went.  I knew the real test of what she thought of school would be today - how much does she fight going back?

Well, she didn't fight.  She ran almost the entire half-mile to school.  I don't need words to interpret that, she's very excited to be going back today!",3.5842481389578182,5.502627851612908,4.209677419354843,86.1175930521092,73.70967741935483,6.833746898263028,22.89081885856079,7.61054688173877,0.9237642679900744,627,17,124,8,13,199,98,155,0.053,0.914,0.033,-0.4387,1,0,0,0,2,0,24.0,0,0,1,1,12,6,2,0,9,0,13,0,0,2,2,25,23,7,0,2,3,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,7,0,1,5,0,0,5,2,2,1,3,10,0,21,4,16,10,2,31,0,0,0,0,22,7,0,1,18,82,24,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12672356823696995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11265812892717166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19462138451434585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32646233561770593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13221992631034618,0.0,0.0,0.11074652605269412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22894709575890396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764508407966172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14384485940747258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12462824833516298,0.0,0.0,0.1428618273010456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268383710574934,0.0,0.1119945558778466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09303029640867512,0.09383671974567592,0.0,0.12222473009833708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13279505728638996,0.0,0.0,0.19249702864900767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13221992631034618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14404390521463886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.51230960457912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046851391990712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10046816836452692,0.07379350092065994,0.0,0.35986955458978825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376522580934985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2088373412020204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11378546481288443,0.11731499097364922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989892448475775,0.0,0.0,0.08149535210029131

Then with the Pec cards and other parts of the movie and will he ever be able to survive on his own. ,4.113727272727271,5.3529850545454565,4.576136363636365,86.74420454545454,71.18181818181819,6.954545454545455,26.47727272727273,7.1686216300943375,1.162363636363636,218,7,44,2,4,69,43,55,0.064,0.8320000000000001,0.104,0.1027,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,5,0,3,1,0,1,2,13,7,6,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,3,5,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,2,8,4,2,9,0,0,0,1,5,3,0,2,5,36,7,0,0.31295245144495715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5661668183958775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3061275483804385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2661971953272466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824518059085476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3388970079211268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702904374723108,0.0,0.0,0.1845874641806624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.339383583934254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
autism,Raistar,2018/04/18,"Calling experienced parents of SUPER picky eaters. Hey, everyone. 
My daughter is 3 and has nonverbal autism. She is an extremely picky eater. 
She prefers:
Things she can hold; finger-foods are her favorite.
Crispy textures; her favorite chips are Pringles, Honey Mustard.
Noodles/Rice
JUNK. She loves doughnuts, candy, ice cream, just JUNK! She'll eat almost any junk food. 

I'm worried about her nutrition. I need advice on foods/styles/techniques to try. Help!?

Pictures of meals would be amazing. 

Actually, is there a thread like that? If not, there totally should be.

autism,m_b_headed,2018/04/18,"Child who acts out in violence In the past year, I have met a child with autism who is about seven. We'll call him Toby. Toby stays in his own world a lot of the time, he is nonverbal besides mimicking certain words. Toby is very affectionate, but certain things (some triggers are known, other outbursts seem to come out of nowhere) will trigger very violent outbursts. I have seen kids who bite or scratch or hit when frustrated, but Toby is different. He looks for and will target the closest person to him and run after them. If he makes contact, he will bite and scratch and try to climb up your body and continue to bite. In one instance, Toby bit a woman through her shoe, but that didn't give him a sense of release. He tried to climb up the woman's leg in order to make contact with her skin. It seems that he can only stop after he really hurts someone. When Toby comes out of this mindset, he almost collapses to the floor and then he sobs. You can tell that the outburst takes an immense toll on him. He looks devastated but it seems like he feels that he has to do this but he doesn't want to. He has an ABA therapist but these outbursts happen daily. Toby is in pain and I would really love and appreciate any suggestions or advice.

autism,ViTaLC0D3R,2018/04/19,"Autism - Flight or Fight in Social Situations. I am 20 year old male that has been recently diagnosed with ASD. I have come to terms with everything and having the diagnosis really allows me to put the pieces together. I have questions about social settings, autism, and the fight or flight response. It’s very hard finding things for adults with Autism, so I thought I ask reddit. I noticed that for me at least a few insightful information about social settings for me. First being social anxiety, I know this sounds trivial and a no brain that’s autism but it’s a bit more deep than that. So for context I am in college and I go to a University with about 30,000 students so when I walk around campus there is always a lot of people. I get really uncomfortable. I always listen to music and look at my phone and pretend to using it because I can’t stand making eye contact with people. When I do look away from phone and look at people, I am immediately afraid to make direct eye contact because I feel uncomfortable. I also feel like I’m being watched by everyone. I know that it is normal to make eye contact and look at people that’s what humans do but for me it’s scary. Don’t get me started on when people smile at me it makes me immediately remove direct eye contact from them. The second thing I noticed is whenever I get into a new situation with someone new I either try to leave or look at my phone. I am also very defensive at this point anything that I perceive as a threat I will immediately attack (verbally not physically). With this I seem to always being vigilant and on edge socially speaking as if everything is trying to get me. I am curious how this relates to the fight or flight response.

autism,fluffytuff,2018/04/19,"Buying a house, worried my son will tear it to shreds. Need suggestions! Hello everyone,  

My wife and I are purchasing our first home, and we are afraid that our severely non-verbal son will get bored and start peeling at the paint and tearing into the walls. He's done it in our current place, which is a trailer, where he lie in bed and pick at the walls into the sheetrock. To combat this, my wife is wanting to build a sensory wall in his room, and hopefully that plus watching Netflix will keep him occupied enough to not want to tear it up.  
  
My question to all of you is, do you have ideas for a sensory wall, and any type of paint that's harder to peel off? Any help is appreciated!

autism,InformalChemical,2018/04/19,"Autism advice needed My son has Autism and was just diagnosed last fall..he's 11 (12in July). He so 1 activity focused. What I mean is 1 activity and only 1 will hold his attention and he goes all out about it and only wants to do that 1 activity. Is this normal? right now it happens to be nerf guns, accessories, tactical vests and has even been caught playing gun related games on the computer (this was stopped when caught). Am i being unrealistic with wanting to have this activity stopped? I am afraid he doesn't understand how serious guns are. and he talks about them and makes noises like any avid hunter.

PS...it is a split household and the other house keeps buying everything.

I have an eye mask and some noise canceling headphones, but that precludes a lot of things I do to amuse myself (music, video games, reading, writing, etc.) What are some things I can do without my two most sensitive senses? or what are some things I can do to avoid overstim in the first place?",6.182142857142857,6.9600141587301625,6.379484126984128,77.37732142857142,66.14285714285714,8.839682539682537,31.62301587301588,8.841846274778883,2.580225396825398,528,20,95,8,8,169,92,126,0.07200000000000001,0.865,0.063,-0.2805,0,1,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,1,4,3,0,2,8,1,12,3,1,0,0,19,18,8,0,1,6,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,11,3,0,1,2,4,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,1,9,1,14,15,8,8,0,1,1,0,8,3,0,9,5,74,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16195284334383475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19975181879880446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21948837454513714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16740129930706088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13191350769530305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13900841683239396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3346312810180683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065125901601425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20561819100123416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22046541198664102,0.0,0.19685716087538327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22030585677324024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5229910729141249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880545631092104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19224881645098368,0.20487980362738156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21972452936470127,0.0,0.18971193947460546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12673526102668312

Back ground; non verbal early on, but extremely happy child diagnosed with autism during a time in the 80s when all that anyone knew about autism was from rain man.  I went from non verbal to wouldn’t shut up, and never let my autism label prevent me from band, theater, debate, choir.  I even got married and have kids, but in relationships with most people I feel i walk on egg shells and still come off negatively with them.  I just got a you come off condescending towards me and wrote a whole message that I respect them, and such to wake up the next day with people saying I was instigating somehow.  From my view point all I did was imply No ill feelings but they said its my attitude in my intentions.  I don’t want to play the Im autistic card, but I feel so hopeless right now.  Im 38 and I thought by now I would get to relax and not have to be so careful only to step in a mine field of negativity.  I am tired of losing friends when I feel I was doing everything I could to show my admiration and appreciation to only have them sense some two face nature where I claim to be nice while being cold in nature. I don’t even get where I was being mean.  I literally talked myself up on being ultra positive even though people in a political conversation were calling my views dumb.

autism,evehawksleytrio,2018/04/20,"Lazy Eye? Any families have experience with lazy eye in their child/children on the spectrum?

Our 2.5 year old is non verbal and generally a happy guy but does not tolerate things on his face or head (no sunglasses, hats, headphones), or having his head/face touched for more than a quick wipe after meals.

I've noticed for quite some time that he looks 'spacey' pretty often- eyes not focusing, turning just slightly outward- but I want to concerned. Over the past couple weeks I'm noticing it much more though and I'm concerned it's getting worse- one eye in particular is turning out just slightly. He squints and blinks rapidly off and on throughout the day and now I'm wondering if it's related to what appears to be a slightly lazy eye affecting his vision rather than just standard sensory behavior. I want to get him examined but... I don't even no where to begin in his situation. I don't want to put this off too long but he's starting to imitate language and I'm wondering if it would be worth waiting a little while to see if he actually advances in his communication enough for it to help explain something like this. I don't want to miss a critical treatment window if he does have a lazy eye but all vision and hearing evaluations so far (early intervention) have gone absolutely terribly. He's so miserable during them and doesn't understand at all what's going on so hearing test ended up needing sedation and the vision tests have kind of just been aborted.

autism,dinosoared,2018/04/20,"Input on how early intervention services worked for you or your child? Hi, everyone. 

My son was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum disorder by a developmental pediatrician at the age of 22 months. (Just this month). We were referred to EI by a previous post I made and they finished their evaluation this week. I’m looking for any personal experience on how EI helped you or your child. 

The developmental pediatrician wants him to start ABA and I’m on a waiting list for that. EI said he qualified for special instruction but I’m not sure what that means and EI wasn’t too informative either. 

Some filler information: 
During his intial intake I explained he was already being seen for speech and has been since he was 14 months. He was initially referred due to being completely non verbal and at this stage we have finally seen some progress. This last month we have seen tons of new sounds and he says about four words now. His initial diagnosis with speech was Expressive Language Delay. The care coordinator for EI told me he would need to be re-evaluated by their own providers during his intake appointment and I was fine with that. His evaluations were this week and the two providers that did them seemed incomplete? His previous evaluations they asked a lot of questions and got a really in-depth understanding of his life and day to day routines. The providers from EI only asked about his speech and barely touched on that too. When I explained he was already in speech they were upset that they weren’t told beforehand and I then explained he was also diagnosed with autism. They went on to say they didn’t see how he was diagnosed because he met their eyes twice. 

When we first arrived my son buried his head and refused to sit at the table with them. They insisted I put him in my lap and try and have him engage with them. He wouldn’t. He kept his head buried and wouldn’t acknowledge them. After about ten minutes of fighting to keep him in my lap(he doesn’t normally like to be in my lap) he wriggled down and stayed in a corner where he felt comfortable glancing up and this is when he met their eye. He immediately dropped to the ground and hid his head. 

After they were so dismissive of his diagnosis and his progress in speech I was frustrated. I explained his other issues, which they never asked ,  and then I was promptly told “well if you would have said that first we would have understood” and then was told “if he starts talking they’ll (I’m assuming the developmental pediatrician) will drop the autism diagnosis”. It was the strangest interaction I’ve had and it’s left a bad taste in my mouth. I don’t want to refuse anything that will help my son in learning skills necessary to cope or handle everyday life but I don’t want to keep pushing through this process if they won’t even help him. 

I’m sorry if this is long it was just the strangest evaluation I’ve had and I don’t know if EI is the best for him at this point? 

Any insight is appreciated. Thank you.

autism,Lexonimous,2018/04/20,"Some Hearing Issue I seem to have I've heard people talk about sensory overload due to certain sounds (potentially causing stress).

However I have a sort of sensory overload where, even though my hearing is OK I sometimes have to guess what people are saying either because they have a strong accent or some sound interference. 

Does anyone have similar experiences?",11.617688172043009,11.1236090483871,10.360322580645164,57.5938172043011,55.29032258064516,12.782795698924732,44.86021505376344,11.855464076750405,5.7933698924731205,299,15,40,7,3,94,47,62,0.078,0.7929999999999999,0.13,0.516,1,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,1,4,4,0,1,2,1,7,0,0,1,1,10,12,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,6,5,3,5,11,3,2,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,6,1,27,6,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16150371826432608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408007635151614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2372758723760301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20212856476579547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15255740217314678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22593874893986485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544459919827793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5206532474860424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2410788279786911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32025921004331914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18368130469870092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2102717825942889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22844106905518397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.264582110651017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18564967751536332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2269326469517712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
