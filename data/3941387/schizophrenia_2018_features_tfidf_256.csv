schizophrenia,Youtakethestep,2018/01/01,"Not sure if I'm experiencing thought broadcasting For a while now I've been very quiet in work and when I'm able to have a conversation it's like I'm explaining what I'm thinking but in a much more simplified way or seemingly completely different yet the same point. Or at least it feels like the same point. There's a manager that I'm a bit weird with due to how we first got to know each other. We're cool with each other but always on edge. He had time off for anxiety and things too and I can sense a somewhat paranoid personality in him. Often if I can't seem to get my words out or feel like I'm coming across as arrogant I end up thinking that he understands why Im like the way I am without sharing much at all. What's scared me also is my Nan died last week and today in work I felt a bit bad due to last night's celebrations. I rationalized looking miserable and flat by thinking ""well my Nan died so they'll understand"" even though I never told them. I've told a few and I just assume it's been shared with everyone. I really don't know what's a normal thought and what isn't at the moment. I do sometimes block out certain thoughts in fear that those thoughts will be shown through my body language or smiling/frowning/other facial expressions or the way I say something. And my final example I want to share is I always explain things according to who I think can hear me and make it as less threatening as possible. This last example is something I've noticed the most and what I feel makes me quiet and stutter the most as well as the anxiety and the inability to trust anyone.


Sorry if this is confusing, I finished work not so long ago and I'm a bit under the weather",4.831117864693447,5.3307051191860495,5.875623678646934,80.78734672304441,69.02906976744185,9.510359408033828,30.752642706131077,9.573946990214177,2.651376744186047,1347,52,276,28,22,448,183,344,0.172,0.732,0.095,-0.9829,1,0,2,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,2,4,15,20,0,4,20,1,18,2,2,3,4,75,55,35,2,5,14,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,0,1,20,22,0,1,21,0,0,1,7,7,2,1,11,11,28,13,36,41,17,42,0,1,1,0,19,17,0,16,25,178,48,4,0.08973385590761059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07954364903104788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176013214936701,0.14933151308890474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372923083139154,0.0,0.0,0.06274399846667338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07492402149718957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293898389358574,0.09967408486359616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772977712857979,0.09408424066107704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862591505666532,0.0937527805457942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07947756191462774,0.0,0.0,0.05926836552682596,0.0,0.0,0.08574454477963568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097553539300597,0.13611640124274074,0.1282117691801384,0.08615857381905713,0.09829905299056238,0.0,0.07632757199445203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04688223608340583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176836191305755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011365772658766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09692796278720382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863076092750762,0.2194352075487273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17535771745727652,0.0,0.0,0.07941163871846624,0.07535383891328261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979609122628132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13192941800377062,0.0,0.06920828159269275,0.0,0.0,0.08420914503118569,0.08792012648785785,0.0,0.10216258970280707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07835214178235267,0.0,0.0,0.1696549967563027,0.1011614397762269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05748580586111615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135996387098381,0.08983924396124922,0.0,0.0,0.16338066450071267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13816301255445468,0.0887490779813812,0.10044970506958108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08457309723635928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192303731677931,0.2299913262852044,0.08816305782555588,0.2849546328866876,0.05232453300028148,0.0,0.08505720309604366,0.17148908955927136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18683221726844215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403982881341277,0.05292735313834748,0.2136796741568181,0.07197908654633622,0.0,0.16136302612761014,0.0,0.08097084774817623,0.0,0.0,0.08650023493482112,0.0,0.19598194747741893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,speedyturtle,2018/01/01,"Questions regarding my depot. Hey guys, just a quick question.

I had my depot injection on the 28th December. After 24hours, the site of the injection (in my arm, Paleperidone) became very red and swollen. 24 hours later there was a grape sized lump which was red, swollen and painful. 

The redness has since gone down and so has the pain, but the area is still swollen. I’m worried that the fluid hasn’t gone into my muscle and is instead sitting under the skin. The last time I had my depot, I didn’t have any of these symptoms.

schizophrenia,kamalac,2018/01/01,"My NY's resolution is to be a better version of myself For the past two years I felt crippled by trauma and this terrible disease. Everything I valued about myself seemed to have disappeared. I didn't know who I was anymore. I became a black hole of negativity, a selfish person who couldn't get out of her own head. Everyday was like torture. I'd wake up in pain and go to bed in pain, and spend every moment in between thinking about ending it. The guilt, the shame, the grief, the anger, the self-disgust was overwhelming. I ended up in the hospital over and over again, but nothing changed, and it felt like nothing would ever change. I was broken and unfixable.

But that wasn't true. Something clicked halfway through 2017. Through a combination of supportive friends, family, professionals, and the right medication, I found a dim light that grew brighter each morning. More than that, I found myself again. Not the same exact person I used to be before all of this - but a new, improved version of it. My resolution is to keep improving on that person throughout 2018.

schizophrenia,Toolooloo,2018/01/01,"Does socializing make your mental health worse? Not in a work context, but say in an after-work coworker outing? Or an outing with anyone? People like me at first, they invite me out, but then they will slowly abandon me. The only people who still hang with me on a limited basis, I'm pretty sure, are people who have tagged me as a charity case. Not a genuine friendship. Plus I might have some aspergers.

I don't know what to do really and sometimes feel like I need to be fearful or paranoid to exist now since all of my voices left a year ago when I started taking the medication.  My doc has been helping me lower my dose for the past 3 months too. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this?
Thanks and hope you all have a brighter new year!",7.136930693069309,5.788152396039608,7.592950495049507,76.6032871287129,64.64356435643565,10.456237623762377,35.05148514851485,9.3871,3.0204598019801976,396,15,79,6,5,131,76,101,0.134,0.722,0.14400000000000002,0.2786,1,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,1,0,2,3,6,0,2,4,0,10,4,2,0,2,15,21,6,0,3,3,0,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,4,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,4,12,3,7,16,2,12,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,4,12,48,16,1,0.1867125372074975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16550939864459813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1851686657544477,0.13055374729820707,0.1913090590359079,0.15364850918257072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.207395537509038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597436640738155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21010351353367612,0.18881493779228395,0.13338747388796518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12514947795881634,0.0,0.0,0.185447678590096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261232749455036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20286371798945674,0.0,0.0,0.09121831446503872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038187904336776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880932380813842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14903216585751372,0.0,0.0,0.13844498051339088,0.0,0.18032813191446295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17823824372851227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11961283238288105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18693182201017536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15445054021216342,0.0,0.1868473787688948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18466347352542928,0.0,0.13215609483962173,0.0,0.0,0.15610004153945134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2807691826361577,0.0,0.0,0.17189981864015932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13592895082264375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404735047012697

But to know the full extent you have to know what happened a year and a half ago. As many of you may know I had a very serious suicide attempt in sept of 2016 that left me with serious left leg damage (on top of other things but this is what relates to the story) Well I live in Upstate New York so its snowing now so the parking lot was icy and full of snow so I slipped and fell right on my ankle that was already damaged. It hurt so bad I went into shock, all I could do was laugh (and I have a high pain tolerance)

We went to an urgent care, waited for an hour, turns out nothing is broken! But I have a serious sprain.  It hurts so bad and it reminds me of how I felt when I got out of the hospital a year and a half ago. Im stuck on crutches for at least 2 weeks.

schizophrenia,Suck_my_dipset,2018/01/02,"Is there any research or theories as to why skipping meds is so common with mental illness? I tend to skip my meds when I wake up already off the rails. Realize it after the asshole phase. I've read accounts of people stripping naked during blizzards after hypothermia sets in because our brains raise our core temp and the sensation is like burnig alive. Do you think the mentally ill brain tricks itself into skipping the meds since they are taking away from what it knows as a natural state of mind? Or is it just subconscious setting yourself up to fail because breaking your life is what you actually enjoy?

schizophrenia,ratta606adamson,2018/01/02,"A momentous year 2017 was the year in which I realized I was schizophrenic and eventually went inpatient to become medicated for the first time in my life. 

Before medication I thought I was one of the elect, chosen to perform God's will in a global moment of spiritual crisis. I was chosen but not activated yet, and so I thought that I could not die until the celestials had used me and I would make impulsive choices and put myself in dangerous situations and was drinking myself to death. I was beyond moody, freaking out over little things and being paranoid and delusional and jealous and making my husband miserable and scared. I was lashing out in a vile way against family members for wrongs I erroneously thought they were committing. I was hearing the voices of angels with a running commentary on everything I did and of my negative mind telling me I was worthless. I would see a green grid which reality hung upon. I was completely irrational and living in a delusional nightmare. 

I am so grateful for 2017 in that it was the year I got help and have had 6 months of post-medication sweetness and joy tethered to reality. I am just so incredibly grateful for what medication has done for me.

schizophrenia,AllTheMoose,2018/01/02,"I don't know what's happening anymore About a year ago, coming out of winter break for my senior year of high school, I began to feel very uncomfortable in my AP Lit class. I had this overwhelming feeling that the teacher or the class didn't like me. We had socratic discussions every Wednesday, and participation was a huge part of our grade because we had to show that we read the book we were working on, and that we could draw evidence and answer questions. This became a huge problem for me, because I started hearing a voice tell me that I shouldn't speak or else I'd say something incorrect or repeat something already said and make a fool of myself. I spoke once during our time reading the book, and immediately regretted it, because I felt like the class thought I was stupid.

We finished the book and I didn't hear the voice anymore until spring came around when preseason workouts began for the distance squad of my track team. I performed very poorly, mostly because I hadn't trained at all during the winter and the weather was really bad. I soon fell into a really dark place, questioning if I should even join the team again, or if I even had friends at that point (I had just gotten into a lot of drama with a couple friends who did some pretty bad stuff to me). The voice returned, usually telling me to quit, and that nobody wanted me there. This put me in an even worse mood and I was constantly reflecting on how bad I was as a student, athlete, and person.

The track season had begun and my mood lifted back to its usual level, and the voice left for the most part. On occasion I would hear it when I was alone, but only a few words at a time. The track season passed, I graduated, and summer went by. In August I sadly had to move from the place I grew up and loved, we was hard, but nothing I couldn't handle as I'm pretty used to moving just as I get comfortable. I was in a great mood in this new town. Just began college, and I was on top of notes and tests more than I ever was in high school. Around the middle of October, I started hearing the voice again, this time however, it was accompanied my countless others. I tried to hold out as long as I could, but I broke broke in early November. I had never felt so alone before. I would come home after an exam, knowing I did poorly, and they (the voices) would tell me the worst things on my drive home. I felt like I didn't have anybody, I felt like I would never accomplish anything, and I felt like the world would be better without me. I never thought farther than ""what would it be like if I were gone?"" but the thoughts were there nonetheless. 

On top of this deep dark pit I was in, I began eating less because I was afraid that my food was being poisoned, even though I did all the cooking. I also began to feel like people (not students or staff) would follow me from class and watch me outside my window, and were planning to either expose me or kill me. I rarely left my room at that point when I didn't have to, and covered my face with my blankets at night so the people watching couldn't see me. My step mom began to notice that I was acting very depressed, and when she told my dad, he had given me a call, asking what was going on. I was too afraid to tell him the truth, and said that I just wasn't happy and I didn't know why (which was true up to that point) but I didn't tell him anything else. At that point I began to suspect that my step mom was trying to kill me. I didn't know what to do. I was hearing voices every day, almost all day, I felt like people were trying to kill me, and I was depressed. I don't feel like my food is being poisoned anymore (most of the time) but I can't say the same for the other things. I know that they aren't true but I still can't shake the feeling, and at the same time, I feel that they are.

I'm stuck, but sometimes I'll have days where all of this goes away, which makes me wonder if all of this is even real. I feel like I've made this up to punish myself. I mean, most of the time I heard voices, they weren't even fully external, usually sounding like someone had placed a radio inside my ears, but never blocking the sounds of my environment. It was more like I heard someone in a far away room, or I could hear sounds from a different dimension.

I'm not asking you guys for a diagnosis, I just felt like I needed to rant. Sorry if I broke any rules or if it was all over the place, this is my first time posting here and I've only told one person about this.",6.0596505298057775,5.3204023106476415,6.375196128945543,82.46966441900581,66.50823271130625,8.841784090145389,29.129707206702665,7.745696148679241,1.6704705795380723,3519,96,727,32,49,1136,345,911,0.151,0.7879999999999999,0.061,-0.9977,2,2,2,1,0,3,102.0,9,1,4,11,35,50,7,4,53,0,82,9,2,5,14,156,153,65,3,24,32,3,15,13,2,9,2,26,5,3,45,45,4,2,29,12,2,18,25,24,0,2,82,45,126,23,93,53,22,141,0,8,4,1,57,61,0,24,73,510,171,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039286187790667726,0.0,0.04437915384004898,0.09180239588632744,0.04890720364552427,0.035441949946283795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03013849219514855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13185784678121135,0.0,0.0,0.072941648449396,0.07890674962121898,0.08286470890912087,0.0,0.08327846366393091,0.03407863463793198,0.11101373451279696,0.13508249023233956,0.0,0.0377122703593798,0.0,0.0,0.03919662214496072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04525473289083491,0.050689217467625496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07635392128788626,0.0,0.04789317770647896,0.0,0.10615553036903272,0.0490382158508449,0.0,0.08574641491471091,0.0,0.07634391233283519,0.0,0.0,0.04630400273668223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045349480144889605,0.07404580403761621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756339946554862,0.04008914255364472,0.07468146784880983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568633991536501,0.09498467261073126,0.29787284923995355,0.0,0.0,0.03769778434239693,0.10718160790234407,0.0,0.06848161806128376,0.0,0.02315488858325056,0.0,0.025187552850496824,0.0,0.0,0.048861938964842984,0.0,0.04388285416617773,0.03919121351513948,0.04717848168477727,0.03970118792933182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29970492543698146,0.0,0.0,0.09365107648850744,0.08891129577959231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14709747718680752,0.0,0.12178302865581628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09630561389399347,0.0,0.0,0.2814768115756338,0.0,0.0,0.039220988595086916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037678494486772116,0.03999969741668847,0.041935782344195975,0.05916665621747692,0.0,0.0,0.04827646754654212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103811934919029,0.0,0.09420833027517292,0.0,0.03286203410601254,0.13672641778144598,0.042803640834587216,0.0,0.04159045160343902,0.0,0.04252534977131548,0.05045756302528711,0.0,0.047198370695234415,0.030031753630923717,0.06741331046006929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09598648327747103,0.0,0.09217580331054467,0.07739541731763018,0.1852160109467289,0.0,0.16758341221161924,0.0,0.04244542493909735,0.09017686881675137,0.0,0.04240737136433991,0.0,0.044552913498562274,0.0992950185026375,0.047138793840816776,0.08866214094699945,0.05044481242264255,0.05678387129250676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08431518258073424,0.07048861789773997,0.0,0.08970654421928807,0.035316566439894816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510282041506151,0.06823798157436863,0.04383270048956698,0.04961157835920271,0.06273854176341212,0.0,0.03539327222279908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050734740035286365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19368413414693528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05888725105876129,0.0,0.04354326823229295,0.10555319018968053,0.18089967183853725,0.0,0.0,0.08469755484622653,0.0,0.09026923251452912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03827745295782371,0.14643360622681115,0.10970364023470698,0.026140539942346597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04108422848722038,0.0399910736929202,0.0,0.0,0.042722008796199834,0.04806214859166753,0.0322648159677856,0.0,0.04516492585143759,0.2203810055768348,0.0,0.0,0.0570800651911041

I'm not suicidal and I don't plan on jumping on moving cars but I can't shake this feeling like my days here on earth are very limited and soon I'm not gonna be here.,2.080474649406689,3.820327252427184,3.651974110032364,89.26354908306368,77.44660194174756,7.2962243797195265,24.06580366774541,8.167268648758528,1.2920062567421793,389,13,85,7,9,129,62,103,0.192,0.596,0.212,-0.4028,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,2,5,4,0,1,1,0,9,4,0,0,0,20,23,9,2,1,9,0,3,3,0,3,4,0,0,0,4,5,0,1,5,0,0,4,7,1,0,0,1,3,6,3,7,16,2,10,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,5,46,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917077837148158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13535280279203754,0.0,0.1522636798748991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836317438538322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065702297815981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676982697825044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3019190863505547,0.4265787942177176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10398924563932943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4231366029392311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10938619061852846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29172003532919144,0.19948856779456228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21154610964836576,0.1463159802301309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21553897682791345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12750896897988012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21771548797564036,0.0,0.0,0.20687690242975312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16422736176393893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,salmonnn,2018/01/02,"showing signs of early schizophrenia? hello, over the past few months I have made some big transitions in my life, changing schools, changing friends, and the change of my family. I have always been a very anxious and nervous person, only recently being diagnosed with GAD. I have just recently changed to a new school, and the stress has been debilitating. Around the time I was discovering my GAD, I started to look into other mental issues and illnesses. When I first found schizophrenia, I reminded myself that I am a very anxious person and I will blow things out of proportion. I was pretty scared when I started to match some symptoms of schizophrenia and started to think back to my early childhood. I have always heard a ringing, but not like in a medical ""painfulness"". It changes with volume and when it is very quiet it sounds electric. There has been one instance just recently where I swore it started to sound like something muttering to me in a very slowed down low pitch voice. I had had the often ""hear your name in a crowd"" thing since I was young as well. Just recently I have also seen breathing walls and distorted surroundings. I have always been very paranoid thanks to my anxiety, but I started to SOMETIMES feel as if the government or some sort of global organization such as the united nations was monitoring me in my life. Primarily though classmates and teachers, feeling like they are working for this mysterious organization. Now more than ever, I feel like my mother is part  of this organization. For example, when I am having a conversation with her, I wonder if the questions she asks, she is trying to secretly find something else out about me. I also have no connection with my dad or his side of the family, but I do know that my mom's side has a history of anxiety and depression, perhaps more. One of the most frustrating things that I think may be related to me having schizophrenia is the scrambling of my thoughts. I like to think I have always been a pretty intelligent person, but I suddenly feel like I cannot hold a steady thought in a conversation, even typing this sentence I feel this discomfort and I am misspelling easy words. Memory has also been an issue for me recently. The thing that prompted me to rant like this was, only 5 minutes ago I woke up from a nightmare I would call it of many voices talking to me. I kept having sleep paralysis throughout the night, and before I woke up for the last time, I heard a mans voice telling me something like ""none of its real"" or ""its all in your head"", keep in mind this was in a dream. I woke up in extreme terror shaking and sweating. If anyone could further educate me and give their opinion it would truly mean the world.",7.903628343767785,7.977508113545821,7.6447723392145726,72.18610557768926,62.486055776892435,10.518042117245304,36.454467842914056,10.125756701596842,3.734230848036424,2171,93,370,42,28,691,247,502,0.138,0.7909999999999999,0.071,-0.9832,1,0,3,0,0,0,55.0,0,2,2,2,22,21,1,6,31,0,46,11,4,1,2,75,79,35,0,6,14,3,5,8,1,4,7,10,0,4,23,22,0,3,17,2,0,1,4,10,1,3,25,17,64,11,59,47,10,63,0,2,2,0,31,30,0,16,40,282,87,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058410447794060114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15808458011409782,0.2193140660641017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081641092635596,0.14888137987263714,0.0,0.04607413780322938,0.0,0.0,0.058659020364964336,0.06160135439326024,0.0,0.0,0.050667891728721534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05607035762185349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06728444172387131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3485319495771441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052610450079048514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05675381548182001,0.06688032747744167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055045409268951566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043521912969980515,0.05960427569901657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12423670567501435,0.0,0.16658819917437453,0.14122259177519222,0.0,0.0,0.06022529596808932,0.05604881990627697,0.0,0.07224861857416086,0.05090901155814834,0.0,0.0,0.0632108718189489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06762555120538849,0.0,0.07426655475854009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13755100205869053,0.0,0.058569005808140215,0.0,0.0,0.0362132425543862,0.053711846224625534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09308479387850127,0.2575371616865553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055333788775623206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062349847696359886,0.0,0.06680547884130779,0.0,0.07177713710310114,0.0,0.0663805823315218,0.06640496304418765,0.0,0.0665334638742814,0.07717345390316435,0.052595415213540365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364017403995262,0.0,0.06183641220314923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930203088016801,0.10022967034200284,0.07011513277009088,0.0,0.0,0.07135603867049138,0.06290262495947398,0.0,0.17260650257613466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13407438044940267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738155929682273,0.0,0.0,0.07500101812357185,0.0,0.0,0.3253084946756229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06597070329534578,0.13337510490521462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05450763092432634,0.0,0.06594090216274077,0.0,0.0,0.15218367896471646,0.06517017322374839,0.0,0.23319813682824114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07548056947179853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06848838417561416,0.0,0.05296255044090417,0.057593661499600615,0.060665711220727316,0.0,0.0,0.17510636165724164,0.1266653264029758,0.06473984723122646,0.10462386319118157,0.07684584351840752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04473723539762981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718444280761469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059246003473133385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07145848907871957,0.04797111795914637,0.0,0.0,0.09361744052306778,0.0,0.0,0.0

I just need a way to make it to my next psychiatrist appointment ",2.8628974358974366,5.032696084615388,3.793461538461538,87.16070512820515,76.61538461538461,7.102564102564102,27.756410256410252,8.07648339933343,1.8800256410256413,521,22,103,9,12,167,78,130,0.266,0.71,0.024,-0.9889,0,0,1,0,0,1,7.0,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,1,5,0,14,2,0,2,1,19,28,7,3,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,9,5,0,2,5,0,0,2,5,2,0,0,2,1,13,0,14,26,2,14,0,1,0,0,1,5,0,0,6,70,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17747277565470765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093655221567804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124515585864932,0.0,0.26468814093256554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646097079912157,0.1407377637310119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131721409212157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840236619666364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10779662892869064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16785799261933804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838441175183581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21470192369267554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709299716347659,0.11822380658297513,0.11924861721239377,0.0,0.0,0.17103765942246876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30406045635370194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12380981831279035,0.0,0.0,0.11383172945219602,0.0,0.0,0.2689113614859633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.527744550528248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12091928743482835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10684401393934938,0.1030492307399052,0.0,0.2553518533853883,0.0,0.1848430012711572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948578907578896,0.1276542404288067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Schizocurious345,2018/01/02,"I need help I made a throwaway to seek some help. My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 years (engaged for 5). The last few months I’ve noticed what I’m sure is him becoming fully schizophrenic. It started at his work. He would come home every night crying or upset saying that the people in his office hated him and were talking about him behind his back. Thus eventually became them fully plotting against him to get him fired. He swears there were internal investigators following him... looking in our windows. He swore he heard his managers talking about what we were doing in the house. He became so depressed that I encouraged him to quit his job and find another one. I tried to convince him that they would have no reason to spend company money on investigators if he wasn’t doing anything wrong but he was convinced. Now his paranoia has transferred to the neighbors upstairs. He says he hears them talking about us.. what we’re doing. He says they are trying to call the cops on us but they don’t have any evidence of us doing anything wrong. The neighbors have weird hours and are loud. They stomp and argue but I can never understand what they are saying. To me it sounds like mumbles. He swears he hears every word and is convinced they have recording equipment looking into our apartment and watch and listen to our every move. He’s turned all the mirrors around backwards. He’s taped sheets up on vents in the bathroom where he thinks they can see through. He thinks they’ve dedicated their lives to watching us. He’s always asking if I hear what they’re saying about us. He’s thought at one point the cops had gone under our house to swab the floor boards for illegal substances. I’ve tried to go about this as logically and calmly as possible. It’s killing me inside to watch the man I have built an entire life with turn into someone totally different. The thing is too he only hears the voices when he’s at the house. He’ll think people are following him sometimes or that cars are circling him and watching him when he walks the dogs but outside anywhere else he’s totally normal other than he’s always talking about his fear of the neighbors. I don’t know what to do. I got him to agree to go to talk to a therapist, but we went to my parents house for the weekend and because he didn’t hear “them” there.. he’s convinced he’s not hearing voices or having paranoid delusions. He doesn’t have a job so he’s a home a lot and it’s driving him mad. He needs help but it’s not something I can force him to do. I’m so depressed because of it. There are so many other stresses in my life. Coming home to this everyday is bringing back some very self destructive thoughts and behaviors. Please help.

schizophrenia,8bitCannon,2018/01/02,"I did abssolutely nothing today I woke up at 4
Feel melancholic, on the verge of tears for no singular identifiable reason.

I made a list of all the things I need to take care of. Decided not to shave and stay in bed staring at my phone for 5 hours.

I would have left the house but I dont want to feel like people can read my mind. I just want to think my gross thoughts and believe they are only in my head. But they arent.

If I didnt have this illness I would be the most confident, perserverant person for having gone through it.

I hope some day it goes away.

When I walk into the living room my family can hear what Im thinking from my footsteps. I know because their faces change according to each idea. When I ask them they tell me ""your fucking crazy and you give me anxiety talking about it""

Im at a loss because I really wish someone would be able to watch me do these things and keep telling me they cant hear it.",3.2450411368735965,4.3185164397905735,4.0636985789080065,90.22729057591629,73.08376963350786,7.341959611069559,25.684741959611074,7.7094869923839395,1.1233108451757663,724,23,161,9,14,232,123,191,0.123,0.785,0.093,-0.2057,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,2,6,1,4,7,1,0,7,0,17,4,2,2,1,34,39,9,0,9,5,0,2,1,0,3,1,2,2,1,9,6,0,1,9,1,0,2,6,4,0,0,6,6,32,3,24,28,4,20,0,2,2,1,17,12,1,4,6,105,41,1,0.1303158214584018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996912467255886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218277017208016,0.0,0.12243600399469047,0.0,0.0,0.1588786304266343,0.0,0.0,0.14682130530013496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328656650710612,0.0,0.13785685984170304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840429240817432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527291722076521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285015865987703,0.0,0.13178318976338388,0.09309764888821456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12047487705712127,0.0,0.1250108104492143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337416289317212,0.0,0.2937508036980728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12943301469983778,0.1283348340132952,0.15036696142588782,0.0,0.1471107003302307,0.28152689896462085,0.0,0.0,0.11583068976253988,0.0,0.0,0.07161816742038209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14158852131350105,0.0,0.0,0.06366572785817727,0.0,0.11507125784429473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12330798116868365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315818308081634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662753038562692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125041545326477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09911105447493022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034458230711112,0.11378674878192176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13035108677042373,0.0,0.08348365215357026,0.13398636852865212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11041617263087918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13889932660288562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09798127973263304,0.10474292101268026,0.22780354371396186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17315208251108882,0.16700223293659752,0.0,0.10345620581945973,0.0,0.0,0.12352416131351104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537272957253516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14985676339526385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777178618614192,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,zero-01,2018/01/02,"I have some questions. So I have been diagnosed with bipolar for a few months now. That was my first time going to a doctor for ""mental help"" because I was taught that mental health is some fancy excuse for the rich/upper class and it's just your perception that needs to change. Nevertheless I always kindnof knew something was wrong with me and I am still so conflicted about everything. I am 80% sure I may have schizophrenia. A few rare times I've had visual hallucinations. I have voices in my head which I interpret as like 3-4 me just arguing with each other, if that makes sense? I loved my first old therapist. She listened to me and at the very least gave a shit about me. But my new counselor is just so, horrible. He actually made my life worse. He sometimes fall asleep during our sessions and then jokes about it and brushes it aside. I specifically told him not to tell my parents anything other than that I have bipolar and he actually spilled every major fucking details that we discussed. I am very non-confrontal guy and don't know how to get out of that clinic. And during this whole time, my symptoms have worsen and I am not sure if it's just early sign of schizophrenia or just my bipolar. Can anyone help me understanding these symptoms? Also what's the best way to get myself out of that clinic? Sorry for the long post. It's just I don't know what else to do.

schizophrenia,vaderchrist,2018/01/02,"Going back to college... I'm happy that I'm finally getting my shit together a bit, but I'm sort of nervous and afraid that I'm going to be paranoid again. I was fine for about 2 semesters and then snapped. I wasn't on meds but things are getting worse so I just don't want things to get rough. Anyway, class starts the 16th. I ordered a memoir about a successful woman with Schizophrenia, so I'll have more than enough time to complete it. Hopefully that will calm me down and inspire me.

schizophrenia,schizoaffection,2018/01/02,"I might be slipping... So I’ve been noticing a lot more visual hallucinations. It started out as peripheral hallucinations which I rarely get, and now it’s become frontal vision hallucinations sometimes. Those were even rarer than peripheral ever since I started olanzapine. I see things like weird colors and blurs, and faces in the mailbox and walls. And today I saw a pale demon girl with greasy hair in the corner of the bathroom ceiling, and a few days ago a stop sign appeared in the middle of the road.
My voices never really went away with medication but visual did, but now they’re back and even the frontal rare ones are more often.
I have a psychiatrist appointment next week,
Can anyone help me think of what to do? And say at the appointment?

I don’t feel particularly upset or anything but things are starting to get off... I wanna be alone again and for a while I had been so social? I feel like somethings going wrong but I need a second opinion....

schizophrenia,SoberDelusion,2018/01/03,"Felt motivated to write a story today, sat down for hours and typed away I wonder where all the inspiration and energy came from. Maybe the rivotril and a few CBD Joints I've smoked. Now I'm stuck. I need a good ending, cause how can a man who has the ultimate gift find out when the right moment for using it is..? Maybe I should just sleep on it. But I'm happy, haven't been so motivated for writing in a half year or so. Too bad it's a story about a man who finds a blue glittering ball which follows him around giving him special abilities, he denies to use on the wrong things. Turns out people demands miracles to be shared. But how can he keep his high morals if no vision is shown? How can he know if his actions are just?",2.828064876957491,4.349179630872484,3.9827013422818816,88.62402964205818,74.83892617449666,7.114317673378077,21.141498881431765,7.793537801064563,0.6722076062639823,571,13,123,8,12,186,104,149,0.085,0.7120000000000001,0.203,0.9528,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,2,13,7,0,0,13,0,11,1,1,8,1,34,26,14,0,4,7,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,7,7,0,1,8,1,0,3,2,2,0,1,5,2,7,5,16,19,2,21,1,0,1,0,15,11,0,4,7,77,14,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16037908951236074,0.0,0.0,0.16926466040641258,0.0,0.15042466159947296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20605310913391647,0.0,0.18507220875934305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15956678668412758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1729802278580445,0.0,0.3293228585434623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17282426481947485,0.0,0.15110824083274746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19178186843335532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19034714332017427,0.0,0.0,0.1774196428243097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16013298153823344,0.0,0.0,0.0990102942910998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3619864697433805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335851022820275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12489908641934692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15385421029247887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18028841574041266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11968917429783793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17076901021389976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19596050487068944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3111978675434965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19537399951566656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.196974827597704,0.0,0.11601604334990538
schizophrenia,chicken_lil_titto,2018/01/03,"The hallucinations! they are driving me crazy! First I heard the sirens. you know. like the ones from WWII. like when the japs were nuked. Yeah, those ones.

I turned around. I saw a man, tall and slender. This little motherfucker was black. Like straight outta the jungle. he was wearing nothing but a fedora. but the fedora was black, so it blended in. He didn't have a dick, but no tits either.

anyways, he was hanging out in the corner of my eye. this little motherfucker was just dancing. It asked me to join it, I said no. that's when it opened up its mouth. I started running.

I got to my living room. Or the hospital commons. I don't really know. Everybody there started crying blood. I woke up two days later in a hospital by a doctor.

THis is only my second episode, but it is all so crazy.
D: help plz...

schizophrenia,sometimesironman,2018/01/03,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me I've been suicidal for about 10 years now and for a long time I just thought I was severly depressed and tried multiple antidepressants and none of them worked. My dad has bipolar and my grandmother was schizophrenic with voices in her head and hallucinations. 

Recently I came to the conclusion I might have bipolar 2, which has low manic symptoms but high depressive ones. I do have racing thoughts and terrible spending habits and delusions of granduer to an extreme so it seemed right on top of my major depressive symptoms. I started medication for it per my doctor but it seems to have gotten worse. 

But I'm also terribly paranoid that someone has cursed me or is after me. I don't hear voices (at least I don't think), it's just my voice in my head yelling at me all the time but it feels like it's coming from me and not somewhere else. I don't see things but I feel things sometimes. 

Like I hear someone call my name and there is no one there or I feel like someone tapped me or rain falling on me but there's nothing. I have terrible intrusive thoughts about completely random things or hurting people or hurting myself. 


I don't feel like any of this is real. Like we're all in a simulation or something. I'm so logical though that I can think all of this while also thinking that I'm not well. I don't know if I'm bipolar or paranoid delusional or lightly schizophrenic and I'm so tired of none of this going away. 

It's making me so suicidal and causes me to not be able to do anything, I had to quit my job because of it. I can pass for neurotypical though as anyone who meets me thinks I'm completely normal while inside I'm screaming. 

I'm not sure if I have a light psychosis due to extreme stress, or something more. I just need some opinions or advice until I can see a doctor.

Other people have it much worse. ,1.74909090909091,4.399528984848487,3.182045454545456,86.94306818181818,84.9090909090909,5.724242424242425,26.431818181818183,7.1686216300943375,1.6075818181818191,267,12,49,4,8,87,47,66,0.117,0.812,0.07,-0.6191,0,0,1,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,1,0,5,2,0,1,2,0,6,2,0,0,0,10,13,6,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,2,7,1,5,11,1,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,34,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2589354443083979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32631039684347823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2484603110226689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3184255940979936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15734727879111876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228760840639288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21574032628999198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19935661769143845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29601344953649483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23956966820175185,0.0,0.34835231325024363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23397654535578494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2797976528934319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3171297289558126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,craigslisthottub,2018/01/03,"Suffering with schizophrenia as a child Hi, I started thinking back at my memories as a child, by random thought mostly. I remember certain situations when I was 4-6 years old experiencing delusions(very disturbing ones), thinking dreams were real but couldn’t differentiate reality, crying “seemingly” over nothing, parents assumed I was just overly emotional and bogged it down to just separation anxiety I think and overall having unreasonable paranoia, self doubt and sever depression by the age of 9-10. I am now 24 and realizing that these were very real episodes of schizophrenia, mostly because of the extreme realness of the episodes I endured. Has anyone thought about their childhood and tried to go back and think if they had suffered anything as a young child or any age before adulthood or a time before understanding of schizophrenia coherently? Its a really tough realization to make because I could have been treated a long time ago and have suffered so much. It’s really fucking with me. Just know I’m not blaming my parents, they are sweet people and I know they love me- but they lack some understanding of mental illness. Can’t blame them, they just weren’t informed and grew up in different times I suppose where you ignored those things. 

I’m extremely sad and overwhelmed with this situation alone. on top of the other stressors that are making my life a living hell. I am on anti anxiety meds and also seraquil for my schizophrenia. 

I’m terrified this is going to get worse instead of better and I really need some validation, I have so many years left in my life (I hope) and want to live my happiest life but alas, I feel I’m succumbing to my trauma (past and present) it’s like a black hole and I feel myself being sucked in slowly while I watch my body from the outside in another world or universe just getting sucked in without an option of escaping. It’s literally the worst.

schizophrenia,chrishuang1206,2018/01/03,"Is anyone a schizophrenia patient who is not on antipsychotics and is on other (psychiatric) medicines? Hello r/schizophrenia,

Recently I contacted with a famous and active YouTuber via Facebook, who is also a schizophrenia patient. She said in Facebook messenger that she is not on any antipsychotic because all of them do not work for her; all what she is currently on are Adderall and Wellbutrin SR. She said this medicines combination is to treat her comorbid depression with / after schizophrenia.

So I am curious: Is anyone a schizophrenia patient who is not on antipsychotics and is on other (psychiatric) medicines? Why your psychiatrist advice / allow you to take such medicines combination? Does such medicines combination have therapeutic effects for you and in what way?",11.419047619047625,12.328037095238097,9.410952380952383,59.650714285714294,55.03174603174603,12.5968253968254,47.36507936507937,12.031772070788634,6.399917460317463,638,37,83,17,7,192,69,126,0.029,0.887,0.084,0.7301,1,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,3,1,2,4,2,0,0,4,0,14,0,0,2,2,15,17,7,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,9,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,2,2,12,1,16,15,2,12,0,1,0,0,17,8,0,0,3,70,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2707566744385398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2215785705902715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884220261714828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3874777004151967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16890371518960126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386462228181147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2424721619581883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27358034995850683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5271278150218077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083276035478585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21993101808169946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2500191145994379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20171553239411186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,cloudflowers,2018/01/03,"I can't sleep and my daughter is leaving soon. I can't sleep. No voices, no delusional thinking just a swirling mind. I am laying next to my five year old daughter. We live a thousand miles apart. Her with her paternal grandparents and me in my home state with my family. I see her pretty frequently but it's never enough. Her trip to visit me is almost over and I can't bear that she will soon be gone. It makes me want to cry thinking of how little time I have left to spend with her. I'm always a wreck for a few days when she leaves. She goes this Friday. 

People don't realize how much this disorder takes. I lost a life I built. I destroyed my family, I lost my friends, I am emotionally scarred for life, I'm scared of my self more then anything else in the world. I didn't do anything wrong to deserve this. I'm very stable at this point and somehow that makes my past all the more horrifying. The things I did/said/believed will haunt me forever. 

My daughter begs me to ""come home"" every time she leaves. It breaks my heart. I've been symptom free for almost a year. I'm stable enough to take care of her now but there's no way I could take her. ( grandparents are really good people and they are very wealthy. She goes to one of the best schools in the country.) I could never provide the things she has with them now. Plus who knows how long stability will last. 

I don't know why I was dealt this hand in life. The pain never seems to end. It just trades up where it's coming from. I guess in a way that's life. It just bloody sucks though. Anyway thank you for reading my rant. Have a good night.

schizophrenia,eco-rp,2018/01/03,"LSD and schizophrenia What are your personal experiences with taking LSD after having been diagnosed with Schizophrenia or similar mental disorders? 

I personally have done LSD roughly 5 times since beig diagnosed and it wasn't until the last time that I became severely delusional. 

So, if you would like to share, how did your experiences with psychedelics turn out?",9.8555,11.919958216666668,8.353333333333339,61.89000000000002,58.5,12.666666666666668,38.33333333333333,12.161744961471696,5.6498333333333335,303,14,41,10,4,92,50,60,0.049,0.868,0.083,0.264,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,8,2,0,1,0,10,10,7,0,2,2,0,1,1,0,1,2,0,0,2,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,5,2,7,5,0,6,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,2,6,30,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4445537427668499,0.0,0.0,0.2509890000466829,0.0,0.0,0.22410948746235684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42844126326989335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17851140365699175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10699064419197674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22069699695732714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3824386514454898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24740374766031936,0.0,0.1811561953321515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16465813853099973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553972792949198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2382053417121385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555688538861455,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,dad_im_in_jail,2018/01/03,"Brother Refuses to take meds/accept his condition: next steps? My brother had a psychotic episode after not sleeping for a long time after abusing vyvanse which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That was a few years ago and he has been prescribed meds. He lives with my parents and now refuses to take his meds claiming he is fine. He is not fine, he still hears people speaking under their breath when they aren't. He also does not trust doctors on the rare occasions that he agrees to meet with them. It is not going well.

What can be done to help him see that he has a problem? What has worked in the past when others have refused to accept that what's happening to them is mental illness?

Thanks in advance.",4.945553359683796,6.936675413043481,4.950553359683795,81.91440711462455,70.23188405797102,7.626877470355732,30.66139657444005,8.296473431620573,2.3461507246376816,589,25,105,9,11,183,92,138,0.13699999999999998,0.7559999999999999,0.106,-0.6962,1,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,4,2,6,8,0,0,6,0,16,4,2,1,0,15,24,5,0,1,4,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,10,4,0,3,2,0,0,3,5,1,1,0,4,3,9,7,16,19,1,19,0,0,1,0,25,4,0,0,12,70,19,2,0.0,0.2154771098330288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612099729721462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14543523091028476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20842997354554071,0.1861437898048919,0.15914894102694133,0.1861082937275962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10335654698539236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16082024820494453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20497205102023164,0.0,0.1218984790256047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16058775967173808,0.16094242956443774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040160772763096,0.0,0.1832744432179904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19341263958718466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2019365834492368,0.0,0.17360816176836538,0.12608043348938885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.174017678373186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14492072255982266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18199365793075464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14523548298541275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2734756618950705,0.0,0.0,0.1674343894898888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10604538078788747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570706526592327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16351606569232266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13239793430284322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11711337093506567
schizophrenia,rocoonshcnoon,2018/01/03,"Secretly think is schizophrenic I remember when I was telling my parents of how I felt awful and was seeing things. My mother said ""well sweet you schizophrenicshould aren't all like oh there's a ghost they are like THERE'S A GHOST AHHHHHHH"". I never said anything about schizophrenia  but that's how I would end up later. I remember running away from home in fear of taking melatonin and returned to my bedroom. My dad kicked the door in striking me in the face and he grabbed me as I screamed and cried. He threw me into the car and I asked where we're going. We're going to the mental hospital I'm sick ofor your Bullshit! Stop faking and stop mimicking it!  I never went to the mental hospital. The hallucinations would continue to get worse as I had spiders crawling on me and the experience with my father triggered fear in me when we went down the route to the mental hospital by Penn Hurst asylum. I remember going for a checkup for headaches which my mom believed to be the cause of my hallucinations after observing my tantrums and talking about them being in my head. One of which happend at school. My headashes went away for a while and  we went for a second checkup my doctor told my parents that I should see a psychiatrist  because they simply wanted to believe headaches caused it even when I keep telling them I haven't had one for months.  I tell others I think it's bipolar or schizotypal pd because I can barely even say the word schizophrenia.  But I secreaky think I am.  My dad's been more understanding  and will talk to me when the room flashes in color like disco or when human arms grab me.  I don't know what I have but it's not normal. I think I'm developing disorganized schizophrenia.  I'm not looking for a diagnosis I'm looking to vent. So I wrote this. My mom said she's scared about a diagnosis because it would strip my freedoms. But the big one is that she's and ex psych nurse and said I don't want you to get a diagnosis of *schizophrenia* (she said bipolar once but brings up through first one the most) or its all in my head as usual. My thoughts are falling apart so I'll stop now.",4.123750091716194,5.9239602905569075,4.719480519480519,83.5171091055837,72.00242130750604,7.330515811871746,28.737911805708407,8.00094639256281,1.8728359967715908,1692,67,325,24,33,540,200,413,0.162,0.823,0.016,-0.9955,2,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,2,3,4,1,19,11,1,3,23,1,23,11,4,5,4,61,62,33,2,7,10,9,3,3,0,5,7,7,4,1,15,16,0,4,12,0,0,12,8,6,1,6,19,16,60,5,47,36,4,51,0,0,5,0,39,19,0,4,23,219,75,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395992691512717,0.0,0.07266110429828852,0.0,0.14604782213674253,0.0,0.0,0.14213881456931116,0.0,0.0,0.17513583572433786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15968716070111588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853757604808191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07955343110986526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06884006863754094,0.0,0.0,0.102671452234134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07602862640283786,0.0,0.17492138962777173,0.0,0.0,0.07462687571855306,0.0,0.0,0.06611168194463525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08121477992316374,0.0,0.13251639416454838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595337400536633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07796314041267144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06908433558951024,0.0,0.0,0.042714875673437534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391552233492384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13053655190038865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23498142174966305,0.0,0.0,0.1820579576000524,0.06203826178959744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989051350731902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0761526573820513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827731317938228,0.21067017904862184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17260579143498486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2641371722993631,0.0,0.3696648643360912,0.061808952017523365,0.07781491494769828,0.0786604653726029,0.12387134408984472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19494131055540728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0584384986778177,0.12494262307683762,0.20380164136134624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0516361276995832,0.19920866098685105,0.0,0.06170388224658947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426826145302838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091304231425077,0.0,0.0,0.08560160028631678,0.0,0.09168682418217518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06988287968696194,0.2882023433544993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920702144781336,0.16563791519646415,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,ThrowawaySickDad2,2018/01/03,"What are my options for my very paranoid, very sick dad? Background: My dad started drinking when he was 13 and didn't stop until about 10 years ago (about 45 years of drinking). He has attempted suicide 3 times and was/is a verbally abusive parent.

For as long as I remember, he has had untreated paranoid schizophrenia. He thinks everyone is following him and plotting against him to make him miserable. Everyone is a cop, every African American talks shit about him, people come into our house and our house is bugged, etc. he refuses to get treatment because he sees it as a sign of weakness, and thinks that doctors are unnatural and only exist to make him miserable.

He has gotten much much worse over the past month. He thinks that our dirty carpet is covered in syrup someone is pouring on it. Today showed it the worse, however. He did laundry two days ago. When I went to do laundry today, he had some underwear and socks sitting in the washer, still damp. I asked him if he wanted me to put them in the dryer. He started freaking out and saying ""someone is playing games because I didn't put it in there,"" when he clearly just forgot about it. He thinks I'm a part of it and that I'm a pervert. 

This has never happened before and it's very obvious that he simply forgot to wash them. I'm afraid that he is going to deteriorate quickly. He only works part time. What are my options if he gets very very bad? 

I have called the police on him before and they offered to take him out of there. My mom is disabled and cannot afford to live on her own at the moment. I'm finishing up my last semester of college and graduate in May. I plan to get a full time job when I do.

schizophrenia,myeyesdeceive,2018/01/04,"does anyone else feel useless or like they're a burden? i dont want this to seem mean to anyone else.
but for me, I don't work much (i have a volunteer job once a week), and I don't go to college. I feel like I'm useless and dragging everyone down with me, but I just can't go to college. I went to college orientation last year, and had a breakdown where I thought the other students were going to kill me. I don't think I could handle a job at a fast food place, or a store because of the demands and everything. 

I feel like I'm useless, and that I'm a burden. Whenever my brother comes home I hide because I'm afraid he doesn't like me anymore and resents me for being useless and jobless. My mom says he knows whats wrong with me, and he understands but I still hide whenever I don't have to be around him. I'm afraid he'll find this post.

EDIT: My brother just came home, and I asked if he felt any better cause he was sick. And he didn’t seem mad at me or resentful. I still worry, but I feel a little more at ease.",2.4224090909090883,3.2415840136363627,4.093409090909091,90.20511363636363,74.77272727272727,6.954545454545455,26.022727272727273,7.1686216300943375,1.0142272727272723,793,27,182,8,16,267,111,220,0.236,0.6829999999999999,0.081,-0.9888,3,0,0,0,0,2,25.0,0,0,0,2,6,18,4,2,11,0,16,2,0,1,0,41,42,18,1,3,10,3,5,4,0,1,1,1,2,0,5,15,1,0,13,0,1,6,8,13,0,0,8,6,28,5,17,30,2,21,0,4,0,0,13,8,0,6,10,102,33,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183488702387877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11934430256920565,0.16828814805808026,0.24660377751048304,0.0,0.1071275380809096,0.11250105094733466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467155059448817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643037893803024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13763616168760065,0.0,0.12362166509279575,0.0,0.10366169750572536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608118170455043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530977924112314,0.0,0.14103682611574314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010561765590252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11498940934336882,0.10815325144127144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24338877178442714,0.17194091643709927,0.11554465113532687,0.0,0.10998798901028088,0.0,0.14551482398210214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20517488352587684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2414203669565409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23883647945603906,0.0,0.13313766494062493,0.0,0.06613536156316924,0.09809263461994792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23516691826909786,0.12061164653609785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108483470248644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409399964474089,0.0,0.0,0.08846327128015134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12815748407537814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572901153030253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152518358277624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956986840081447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21910485567737226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19220632638180815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710859866246185,0.0,0.0955360046796785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12527751103713658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097926860685741,0.0,0.0965289706570834,0.0,0.0,0.11155578636598516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08760848261662549,0.1222104549376868,0.0,0.0,0.13157219191487748,0.0,0.07749459820324991
schizophrenia,QHWCAJXXIGEHWSJTJTH2,2018/01/04,"Not diagnosed, but not sure where else to post. Dealing with intense paranoia I think all my friends hate me. I have reasons to believe this, but i sincerely think they're trying to make my life worse on purpose. I'm afraid to call them my friends. and i'm trying my best not to involve them in my mental health due to pass incidences.

i hear their voices in my head telling me they hate me and don't care for me. i have very vivid visions of bad things happening to me &amp; they do nothing to help.

how can i deal with this on my own? i could just ask them if they hate me, but i dont want to hurt them anymore &amp; dont want to be seen as a burden. i dont have a therapist yet. i did intake in late november but they still dont have one for me. i called them but they didn't answer. im taking generic welbutrin and its helping my depression.",1.5436235955056183,3.2752941910112376,2.868974719101125,94.30829353932585,79.0,6.023033707865169,24.04634831460674,6.9077264865688965,0.6663359550561796,658,23,150,7,16,213,98,178,0.223,0.639,0.138,-0.9581,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,11,1,5,14,3,1,2,0,15,4,1,3,2,26,31,11,0,4,10,0,0,0,2,0,3,2,0,0,4,5,0,0,4,0,0,1,9,8,0,1,3,4,37,6,21,26,3,12,0,2,2,0,23,6,0,1,4,100,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2400357427556057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985281452582224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10355380875020093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248726173640856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12479842560231955,0.11624494698974595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262145135854391,0.0,0.11293610136197516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843981661454907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283953911116945,0.09540494380577427,0.11242792807015843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192805007719271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09253305938086967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17115929019674433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979524210598738,0.0,0.0,0.3280835615123505,0.11368067252943224,0.11774197893677915,0.12484440778535227,0.0,0.14849188802218394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11858021515540945,0.0,0.11964923511497914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12495195083438015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07823922897303066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07393898660831598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11162882554891228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10628558273423183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07505975735316969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10608582288715424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11388870171373275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08846004990672494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043982160014101,0.0,0.08328429872038348,0.0,0.09681675130191572,0.0,0.0,0.12861103163763624,0.07358982146008394,0.14195225754160384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504093916118746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09139580190102116,0.13066853233192469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11288279788603656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Omac18,2018/01/04,"How many of you have gotten the side effect Tardive Dyskeshia? If you haven't gotten the side effect then look away. There is no need to worry about this as it's supposed to be very rare. 

So my medication Latuda gave me Tardive Dyskeshia. While most of it has healed I have trouble eating, throat spasms, and psychological damage. I was told it was very rare. It's supposed to only happen in patients who are 60 or older and have been taking the same medication for 10+ years. I've met some others on Reddit who have had the same side effect and I'm starting to think it's less rare then we're told. 

So what I need from you is; If you have gotten this side effect, or one similar, please answers as many of the following questions as you can. 

1. What medication were you on?

2. How long were you on it?

3. Are you under the age of 60? 

4. Are you a resident of the United States? 

5. Do you still have the effects of the side effect six months or more afterwards? 

6. Were you able to take any other medications without risk of the same side effect? 

Thank you. I'm trying to figure out how rare this really is. I asked a mod a few months back for permission to do this.

schizophrenia,analogicalorganism,2018/01/04,"Falling apart. All meds cause TD...advice? I’m 26 yo male. My life fell apart last year. Since then I found work as an operations manager. Good pay. Met a beautiful girl who is now the most understanding SO I’ve ever had. 

Problem is, my psychosis is flaring up. There is no period of silence anymore. The voices rage and wail and scenes of terror envelop my environment. I’ve had to move back in with my mother for the past year.

I’ve been hospitalized several times. All atypical antipsychotics have caused tardive dyskinesia. Seroquel, haldol, risperdone, and abilify. Cogentin has not helped. I feel like benzodiazepines might be a better option but I have a history of substance abuse/rehab so that will never happen. 

I sleep every night, eat at least 2x a day. I exercise very regularly. Now I find myself on the edge and it is only getting worse.  I can’t go back to the hospital and completely uproot the foundation I’ve worked so hard on. 

I guess I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m home from work because of this snowstorm, or so I tell my boss. All I can do is sit in bed and turn up the tv loud enough to block out the world. I’m supposed to meet with my SO this evening and I don’t want her to see me like this. 

What can I do? How can I move forward? Any suggestions? How do you cope?",0.916486937187326,3.483294712062257,2.792780433574208,88.11818677042803,90.20622568093384,6.20562534741523,22.128849360755968,7.554174236665415,1.2559552862701495,1019,38,204,21,35,338,165,257,0.106,0.863,0.032,-0.9444,0,0,0,0,1,0,38.0,0,1,0,4,15,7,1,1,13,0,25,4,1,5,5,36,40,18,0,2,4,1,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,8,10,1,1,5,2,1,6,6,3,0,0,5,5,24,4,23,32,6,33,0,0,1,0,11,12,0,5,18,127,32,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13095141998676085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09113028122059896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2658005711435628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20608831643334166,0.0,0.08169025340181749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185195057482942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753270033006325,0.0,0.0,0.14050521750651934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08642430698743467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13712400912601094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13846646021078526,0.0,0.08851125896419862,0.12121823517748535,0.11290782436894263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06775865411831952,0.09573560029274716,0.0,0.0,0.1224812147228888,0.0,0.0,0.14693325159751194,0.0,0.0,0.07001383793721867,0.0,0.07616004011288798,0.11239985571418303,0.0,0.0,0.1476253185225935,0.0,0.11850315158055955,0.0,0.120045170055795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982297999566674,0.0,0.1344213130440941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0736474909059139,0.1092347005498636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465406888585083,0.13093943289364565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14885307969878372,0.0,0.0,0.14216169447633167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848593611023964,0.0,0.0,0.10335550980810156,0.0,0.0,0.1257577693725241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191939763374384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127926144495444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822790381267854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678731406250164,0.0,0.0,0.1513913046278963,0.0,0.110853101507642,0.0,0.13410514082147545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712921468327245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814135330714415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14576261593517667,0.0,0.13950743046910638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11057093279892696,0.0790416036999957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.292679049798166,0.0,0.13656596911014515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17259398244855695
schizophrenia,Paperthinpaperskin,2018/01/04,"Candy as an AP When my boyfriend goes mildly paranoid, chocolate and other sweets (cake, cookies, skittles..) really help him feel better. For example today I found an empty box of chocolates next to the bed and asked him if he was paranoid, he agreed and said chocolate makes it better. We have discovered this half a year ago when we were at a church gathering and they had cake and it really calmed him down even though he felt pressure from all the people around. Since then I try to always keep some chocolate in my backpack for him. He is really slim -and I kinda hope he stays that way even though he has his special ""medicine""- so he can afford munching away when times get a little tougher. Could it be the olanzapine he takes? Have others experienced this?

schizophrenia,Elijah_11,2018/01/04,"Do you have a second fantasy life? Everyone has this world that we live in where we might live in a small flat and work a part time job and play games or watch TV.

I was wondering if many of you have a second fantasy life where you are someone else (or maybe the same person) and you live somewhere else and have a different job/role.

I started a twitter account for my second life. The response to it has been pretty good. I just tweet the things that happen to me in this imaginary world. Sometimes the tweets are a little cryptic but it's not intentional. Probably caused by disorganised thoughts more than trying to sound edgy or mysterious.

Anyway right now the function of this second fantasy life is (1) Escapism. It helps me pass the time and helps me when I feel bad in my own reality.
(2) Story inspiration. I want to write a fictional story about this world and building it up in real time via twitter is helping me see it and the possibilities in my head.

What I want to know is whether other people do this and whether it's a good/bad thing to do. At times I know it's make believe but the nature of it makes me want to keep up the illusion. I don't want to break character while there. I want to fully invest in it and immerse my mind in that world for a while. Is there a risk it could become my first reality?

EDIT: in case it's not clear, this world is entirely set in fantasy. It isn't another persona in the real world it is a character living alone in an imaginary place where strange things occur.

schizophrenia,Rodchinko,2018/01/04,"Unrealistic expectations of schizophrenics? My boyfriend of almost a year comes to this site a lot to learn about schizophrenia and I think people here are often very high functioning and it gives him unrealistic expectations. I had to quit my temporary job after only 3 months because I couldn't handle it anymore and spent a couple months ""relaxing"" and telling him how much I was enjoying life now that I have no work. He's been really pissed at me and thinks I'm bad and lazy and just wants to be cared for. Now I'm in day treatment and looking to try substitute teach because it is fewer hours for good pay. I've been practicing my driving which is hard in itself because I get tired after a long drive without even doing anything else. I am also looking at doing some seasonal tax jobs. He was mad at me for looking for temporary work instead of steady employment again. Then I told him only 10% of people with schizophrenia actually work, so I read, in the general population. I think it suddenly dawned on him I'm not being lazy and he was unfairly mad this whole time. I graduated from Duke Unicersity. All my friends make good money now. If I was not sick, why would I be in this situation. The reality is I'm not my old self but I'm trying my best given the circumstances.

schizophrenia,nifteee,2018/01/04,"Is there any way to help someone who doesn't want help? I have a sister in her mid 30s. She's been demonstrably paranoid schizophrenic for three or four years now, and she moved in with me over one year ago. I asked her to seek therapy and she's been seeing a psychiatrist for the past half year, but her paranoia is getting worse, she stopped taking meds because she says they make her nauseous, and she refuses to talk to me about what she discusses with her doctor. She also said she stopped seeing her doctor last month because the doctor moved to another country, but I don't believe her. She refuses to talk to me about anything remotely serious, cutting me off and saying she has the right to not answer my questions. She's been unemployed for one and a half years now. She's been teaching herself photoshop during her stay, hoping that she can find a job in graphic design. She leaves the apartment once a week tops, using my second car. She has no friends. She is afraid of public transit and also thinks it's beneath her. She believes our neighbors and the police are watching us with hidden cameras. She hasn't talked with any of our neighbors even once. She just ""knows these things"" and can ""tell things about people"".

I know I'm not the warmest person in the world, but I don't know how to talk to her. I'm probably going to give up on her if she hasn't found a job by the time my lease ends in a couple months. I'm going to find a new place that she doesn't have the keys to, and she'll have to fend for herself.

Are some people unsalvageable? I feel like she's at the point already, if not way beyond it.

schizophrenia,AcclimateToMind,2018/01/04,"My girlfriends parents can't know I have schizophrenia. I was speaking to my current girlfriend about my experience with my illness, how it affected my life during highschool when it emerged, etc. She seemed really interested and non-judgmental which is great, but capped off the conversation by casually but seriously mentioning that her parents can never know. I asked why and she fairly bluntly told me she knew it would be met with some combination of ridicule and disappointment about me dating their daughter. I asked if they knew anything about the condition, she said that they don't really but they're very stubborn in general and probably wont allow themselves to be swayed. I really don't know how to feel about this, and it kind of put a damper of my newyears and my view of the future of our relationship. My condition is under control with nearly all my symptoms in remission, which makes it seem even more unfair. 

Has anyone else encountered prejudice about your condition, in the context of relationships or otherwise?

schizophrenia,mellifluoustones,2018/01/04,"WHAT TO DO about my mom who has schizophrenia :( I don't want her homeless..... My mom was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (combination of bipolar disorder + schizophrenia). My mom lives in Oahu, whereas I live in another state from her. My mom is currently at her mom's house (who speaks Chinese only) with no medication and not willing to get help. My grandmother is worried beyond belief and wants her to leave asap.

My sister and I tried helping my mom for 6 years now. My mom has been through 3 nursing homes and 1 assisted living home. My mom eventually refused medication and therefore got kicked out of the previous homes. :(

The situation is hard. Case managers have quit because it's hard. It is so unfortunate. My sister and I have done all that we could but my mom doesn't listen about getting help or taking the meds (I understand that's a part of the illness). I think because she doesn't take the meds, she started hallucinating in all the previous homes and would yell and disturb her nearby neighbors.

schizophrenia,throwaway1897777,2018/01/05,"How to help someone with Schizophrenia who is potentially violent/won't accept help? Please help! Hi everyone. I won't disclose all details, but a close friend of mine has developed (paranoid?) schizophrenia and I am worried for his health. He has a history of the disease in his family (his father has it) and has been self-medicating with psychoactive substances. His behavior as of late has become increasingly destructive (smashing windows to my apartment and car in the middle of the night for no apparent reason). I have done nothing to upset him or provoke his behavior, it just sort of came out of nowhere. I am one of his closest friends.

He currently has a warrant out for his arrest (or a bench warrant, not sure) for similar crimes he has committed relatively recently. He is homeless but has a job, and I know where he works. What would be the best way of going about getting him professional help? Should I call the police? I don't want to send him to jail or anything, I just want to get him mentally evaluated. I'm afraid if I talk to him he will run away to another city and we won't be able to find him. Please, I am so desperate and scared for my buddy as well as my own safety. Thank you all so much for reading.

schizophrenia,akromyk,2018/01/05,"Is there such a thing as mild Paranoid Schizophrenia? I don't have delusion or any issues with movement but I do find my mind often time checks out while someone is talking and I used to think it might be some form of ADD but Adderall didn't help me. And now as I thought about it more today I realized a lot of the arguments I've gotten into with my wife are over some fictional prediction I've concocted of the worst case scenarios of what she might be doing. 

I've known her to drink or have dinner with friends behind my back, but I somehow escalate it in my mind instead of being realistic. She knows I get upset over being left out, but at the same time tend to hate social gatherings. Another thing that drives me nuts is when I immediately reply to a text of hers and she fails to respond. A reasonable person would realize she's probably busy but I start think it's some intentional attack on me. Like I'm somehow the center of the universe.

Then with my colleagues at work I often times think what they're talking about relates to me from pieces of conversations I overhere. I blamed it on past bullying but it's disturbing how often I feel like I'm the center of the universe and that the universe is trying to attack me.

Just wondering if this at all relates to Paranoid Schizophrenia. I've never thought it might be that before but I figured I'd ask. There are no family members with outright delusions in my family, but there is a lot of paranoia, fear, and mistrust of the outside world.

This might just be some undiagnosed aspergers or ocd issue, but I couldn't help but question this possibility. I also just discovered I have the T;T genotype of this:

schizophrenia,Skinboyy,2018/01/05,"How do I know if I hallucinated? Hello, I've been struggling with anxiety for the past 3 months seems to come and go in a sense, but the thing I've been fixated on and one of my biggest triggers for anxiety is wondering if I'm schizophrenic, I don't think I've ever hallucinated but how can you be sure? Today I was sat in bed chilling with my girlfriend and I started to get static snow vision (from what o read this can happen from anxiety sometimes) then suddenly as I was looking at my phone it seemed as if an imprint of the letter A was floating on my phone, it wasn't really bad I could see through it but it was just a little worrying, it past after a few seconds. 
Another thing is since the anxiety started I feel like a completely different person I think completely differently and worry about stupid things. One last thing a couple of times when I feel anxious or depressed before I go to sleep it feels like my inner voice/train of though is literally screaming at me, or going really fast with random thoughts, it's not as if it's in the room with me I'm completely aware it's in my head and it doesn't disrupt any other real/exterior sounds it's just as if my mind is going really fast.

It got worse over time, at first it was only in my legs and only when I was tired, but by now it will creep up to my back and my shoulders and it can get triggered by as much as sitting uncomfortably.

schizophrenia,EpicBunnyz,2018/01/05,"Questions about receiving a diagnosis So I have been experiencing symptoms that are believed to be caused by schizophrenia. On the ninth I’ll be seeing a doctor. Currently my daily meds are Prozac, Oxymorphone, and Oxycodone. All three prescriptions are written by a Pain Management doc who has been my primary doctor for almost three years. My question is this. If I receive a diagnosis for schizophrenia will I be forced off my pain medication, or allowed to continue taking them as opiates do not contribute to any mental illness?

schizophrenia,Jakeas,2018/01/05,"Does psychosis get worse or plateau? I'm medicated, and could clearly use some more tweaking, because I'm still experiencing what I consider minor auditory, visual and tactile hallucinations... as well as some mood elevation. 

As far as I know I can tell when I'm hallucinating fairly quickly. When I'm not manic I continue to see animals, I hear mumbling, music, the TV on, knocks on the door, and feel a hand on my back or a cat climb on my lap.  I've only heard voices twice when I was deeply depressed. Surpressed. Distressed. 

I'm 31 and wondering if my ""minor"" hallucinations will get worse over time? Do the voices become more frequent? The delusions more severe?",5.092868852459019,7.269428614754107,6.384393442622951,71.01921311475411,70.22950819672131,8.48655737704918,31.872131147540983,9.120678840339163,3.1022990163934434,529,24,88,11,10,178,81,122,0.134,0.802,0.064,-0.8661,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,1,6,0,5,2,1,1,1,16,19,14,0,2,4,0,2,0,0,1,1,4,1,0,1,4,0,0,3,1,0,1,1,2,1,1,2,8,9,1,10,15,5,16,0,1,1,0,3,6,0,6,9,52,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17467579074750916,0.0,0.13847761829761188,0.2508857913607517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813726929540045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19565680076650144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19879354017613654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11486140207208365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23736857511584894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560313590310206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484389152377245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288447439478903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17276914754109576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18102101903193876,0.0,0.0,0.25663168398707503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18141418746213156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19855214064066512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13246168356584867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961975423676828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20424853200341309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463506504726349,0.0,0.0,0.4630008931385537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,William_Wisenheimer,2018/01/06,"Diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia when I was 20. Had it since about 14; I'm 28 now. I never hallucinated but I suffered from mental paralysis and delusions of persecution. I have the flat effect sometimes and I have a hard time trusting people.

I started meds when I was 21 after I got back on my mom's plan and I started at a new community college at 24 after being put on probation which is when I started my first job.

Flash forward 4 years and I graduated from community college with a 4.0 and I've been at my job since then. I now go to a university and I am going to be a senior.

I think I have a mild case since I am mostly asymptomatic with medication but sometimes I still get confused and feel indecisive.",3.136890574214519,5.3411645633802864,5.372816901408452,75.99737269772481,75.90140845070422,8.031202600216687,29.2329360780065,8.841846274778883,2.656620151679306,576,26,106,13,13,201,87,142,0.069,0.875,0.056,0.08800000000000001,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,3,8,4,0,2,7,0,12,2,0,1,1,19,22,13,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,10,0,0,3,0,0,4,1,3,0,1,5,2,20,1,16,15,1,28,0,1,0,0,1,6,0,3,20,77,22,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13268491360245455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17514070884496472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724949888574376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14677604638853092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901533885903799,0.0,0.1961351039636742,0.0,0.1380087973733198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15457628353616076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34247041053531385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916708172603334,0.17383201729993966,0.17389586350792785,0.0,0.0,0.2020955029739253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330858257912087,0.16665566113045271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962860433853975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17346644139652356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42822032177247704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34132459467416004,0.0,0.3664080771661815,0.0,0.13780344538108616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056691800130426,0.0,0.0,0.1006187919021682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11112040724005544

schizophrenia,Camerontankersley,2018/01/06,"My therapist couldn't explain this and I'm hoping someone can I'm a diagnosed schizo as of two days ago but something really weird happened to me and when I tried to look into it I had no idea where to look or how

I've lived in the same spot for over four years and I run on my high school's cross country team which is right next to my house. So the point is I've run and walked and drove in the same little area at least a thousand times but the other day during a run something unexplainable happened. The best I can explain it is if there was two overlapping universes on top of each other and the one I couldn't see was suddenly ripped from the physical one, and suddenly everything didn't aline and nothing seemed familiar. So I kept running in the direction I vaguely remember running those so many times before. But every second my brain was screaming at me bc it didn't feel like I was going the right direction. And every time I'd reach somewhere I'd try to think about being there before but I could only think of two or three times each place. But every place seemed so dirty and I was surprised to see every place bc at first I couldn't remember it. It was as if my memories had been so nice and the real place just seemed so dirty and the amount of detail seemed so unreal. If that was a memory lapse I wouldn't have have lost my direction.

schizophrenia,godtrash,2018/01/06,"Landlord Paranoia?? Hey, this is my first post on here. I’m a 21 year old student with schizophrenia living in a major city. i moved out of my parents house this september and have been living in a basement appartment. a couple days ago, the landlord came by to inspect the premises after there was a leak in the building, and ended up calling me while i was the only one home and demanding i let him in, saying
he would take the locks off the door if i didn’t and screaming at me. we told him we couldn’t be able to have him in that day and we would have to reschedule for tomorrow five different times over text/email the previous day, but he came anyways.

he comes in incredibly angry, starts screaming at me and barging through the appartment. he’s yelling about how i’m disgusting and the appartment is a mess. the appartment was messy, but it’s because we had just had a water leak a week ago (the reason he is there!) and everything is drying out on the floor.

he keeps yelling at me about how stupid i am and how i don’t understand english (i have a lot of trouble talking, especially when i’m scared). eventually he leaves, but i don’t know when he’s going to come back or what he’s going to do.
one of my biggest fears is home invasion. my psychosis was childhood-onset and i wasn’t able to sleep most nights for years and years of my childhood because i was terrified that someone would break in and kill me and my parents. i compulsively plan escape routes in bed in the event of a break in. i don’t know how to control my paranoia after this happened - i can’t feel safe in my appartment anymore and i can’t relax. i’m always thinking about him coming through the door and screaming or hurting me or my pets. he didn’t touch me when he was here but he wouldn’t leave until i let him into my room and was very scary. 

i don’t know what to do - i am scared of seeking any legal help because i’m scared it won’t work and i’ll just be in more trouble or he will be more angry.

schizophrenia,primhov,2018/01/06,"How many doses of your meds do you have to miss before it's noticeable to you? I've been on Geodon since I was in the hospital and it was working absolutely perfectly, no hallucinations or paranoia or *anything* for a few weeks. 

I recently have missed a few doses (accidentally - I keep spending the night away from home and forgetting to take them with me) and last night it became noticeable for the first time. I was hearing all kinds of voices and was freaking out a bit since it had been so long without them. When I got home, I also had what I guess was a tactile hallucination?? - where it felt like something was slamming into my body. 

I'm going to be more careful about taking my meds from now on, just curious about your experiences with this.

schizophrenia,SomethingLikeThat007,2018/01/06,"Are you Beethoven or Bundy? The spectrum is finer than you think So I found out something weird that I’ve always considered normal- perhaps you’ve experienced the same, not sure why it’s weird but did you know that seeing faces in everyday inanimate objects has a neurotic term called Pareidolia and it means you are on the shaky side of either genius or psycho? Mozart, Rembrandt, Einstein “suffered” from apophenia which is ones ability to find patterns, consistency, codes, nuance and other patterns in data or phenomena that is considered random... tell that to Rainman (idiot savant) or any creative person who is odd because he doesn’t think like a sheeple, thus nuts. Whatever- since discover the “face” anomaly I possess, it’s now a game where I’ll show a normie the pic, poster, screen grab, vid whatever I happened to see said “face” in and ask them if they notice anything extraordinary. I’ll get a “here we go again” eye roll but the ones who have been asked before are now less skeptical- looking for what they know I will point out to them... now semi-mad they couldn’t see it first?! It’s like the optical illusion lady in profile vs man in a hat... so obvio once pointed out, how is it missed? This is a different animal... and not everyone will see the faces you plainly point out (look! Here’s the eyes, nose, bit of a smile on the mouth... tell me you don’t see that...) the schizoid portion of my psyche tells me they just won’t admit less they see what I claim thus be judged crazy like they see me... of true how sad.. for them, hell I’ll never know but they will and if I’m wrong well, that’s to be expected. I find faces in flowers, light halos in photos, even swirls of hair when my girlfriend pose for bar pics... the ones I didn’t realize I even took (butt-photo is more real for me than butt-dial) are the ones that require close examination... I think it’s a fraction of the population with this “ability” to see perhaps life in something overlooked by everyone else? Idk but I stopped pulling flowers out of my garden... halloween jack o lanterns are now painted, not carved. I don’t even make gingerbread men cookie shapes- something about eating the heads *shudder*. At any rate- i use different parts of my brain to notice these “neurosis” (who says they are bad?!?) than others and I’m glad I do... it’s Beethoven genius spectrum since others don’t believe... until they see (HA) and it’s fun to point out but watch where you show your cra... er, ability as most are not as impressed as you are with yourself- thoughts? I’m going to try and follow this post with a pic or two to illustrate seeing as believing... thank you for your attention and blessings to all xoxo

schizophrenia,DavidMitchellTurtle,2018/01/06,"(Not looking for a diagnosis) How did you know you were developing schizophrenia? How old were you? Did you or others notice first? Really any information that led to your arrival at the notion or your diagnosis would be useful. I've been questioning for a while now, about ten years (hallucinations and delusions until I was about 7, dramatic stuff worsened them, then at some point they went away. A year or so ago so major life changes happened and everything but hallucinations are returning with friends), but lately i've been feelng my mind tearing itself apart and my thinking has become broken. On good days it's similar to normal, but on bad days it's like my internal monologue is on a Trump level of coherency.

Anyway, if you have the time please let me know how you became confident in your diagnosis/belief enough to get a diagnosis.",6.457878787878787,8.204677045751634,6.9561140819964375,69.96433155080216,66.12418300653596,10.008080808080807,31.55614973262032,10.230975488527342,3.5170705882352946,680,27,111,17,11,222,109,153,0.07400000000000001,0.8220000000000001,0.104,0.6994,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,9,2,1,9,4,0,0,7,0,14,1,0,5,0,26,22,18,0,3,8,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,6,4,0,0,5,0,0,2,1,1,0,2,8,1,16,3,17,11,3,26,0,0,1,0,14,10,0,6,15,84,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15992196047644452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12268451149635605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16950047743962865,0.0,0.15063423102368562,0.0,0.19924789943173798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19084911953276384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23269814911462966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864110348619218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16214024729994728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15345605966599854,0.0,0.0,0.13938377878905733,0.0,0.09425641389737234,0.0,0.0,0.15131876260948526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15953534947671508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19829646795124825,0.0,0.20350955013123428,0.0,0.0,0.1844807338545105,0.12742842496329473,0.08813887187114085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15149837598894472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18216196557126552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17676281091639506,0.0,0.2053971854653837,0.18930921377895213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198035237114708,0.1705451033262419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20209970625170606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155748181641708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20652548763291065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11559899577196632,0.0,0.0,0.10519811449878612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1558157119157834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16724122990368678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281575915666788,0.0,0.0,0.23235535038737026

schizophrenia,DormantTurtle,2018/01/06,Secretly a schizophrenic and will never tell anyone I hear voices and have hallucinations and very paranoid and terrifying delusions. I’ve almost let it slip to the people around me a few times but have so far been able to convince people it’s depression. I keep it a secret because once it’s out it’s out for good and people will always be watching me and will never take my opinions seriously. This is my first post about it just wanted to get it off my chest.,4.518904761904763,6.266678922222222,5.550952380952385,78.165,70.8888888888889,7.80952380952381,26.190476190476193,8.418075326091056,1.8597142857142857,373,12,67,6,7,123,61,90,0.121,0.81,0.069,-0.5965,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,1,4,4,0,0,4,0,9,2,1,0,2,19,14,8,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,0,0,8,9,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,3,7,2,9,8,1,10,0,1,1,0,4,5,0,2,4,50,15,0,0.21642042860399208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21671379738075627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1800791336775845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15132619570551625,0.0,0.0,0.1926600652529256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13192788453519969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18640259803265785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18408710601212847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307074152180392,0.0,0.0,0.18152318751534094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439215519943503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923644208612608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213045511802308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33383355287123034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304806932645556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4501160259622421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20727094647060734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16272122845554096,0.0,0.18916099371641296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12619649232597185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17856951897913453,0.12765037605059062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,vmkrtchy,2018/01/06,"Paranoid of becoming schizophrenic? Hello guys. Just as a background: I have a father whom I lived with many years who was schizophrenic and a mother who I do not know much about but I believe she may be mentally ill as well. Well in the past day or two I have been feeling paranoid of becoming schizophrenic as if something is just going to snap and I will start to hear voices. I was just googling stuff about schizophrenia yesterday and I got in too deep and started to be worried. I am 21 years old and have never done any drugs including marijuana, but do get drunk on special occasions and drink a beer a couple times a week.

schizophrenia,ManicPudding,2018/01/06,"Onset of visual and auditory hallucinations Hey! I'm new to this subreddit. I've finally decided to take the plunge and get myself some help. I have some abnormal visual and auditory sensations that I'm a bit confused about. Would you guys mind taking the time to provide insight?

All my life I've had dialogues with myself. I'm not sure if these voices are mine or someone elses as they tend to have my own speaking voice but I often find that I can argue with this voice. If I talk to this voice, I tend to use the term ""you"" but in reference to myself. I'll say ""you're alright"" or ""you're wrong!"" when this voice tells me, ""you're a piece of trash!"". Again, it doesn't quite feel separate from me but it does appear that this voice has different motives than ""I"" do. Am I hallucinating or am I just extremely lonely? Should I be worried? This has been going for as long as I can remember. As of recently, I started hearing regular sounds (like footsteps in my house) that aren't actually there. Should I be worried?

In the last couple of months, I've been having weird visual disturbances. Sometimes ill see flickering shadows out of the corner of my eye or sometimes I think I see a bug flying towards my face in my peripheral vision. Is this psychosis or neurological? I also tend to see little shadows moving around when it is late at night. 

I should also mention that I am diagnosed with moderate bipolar with mixed features and generalised anxiety disorder. I do not take medication. I've tried it in the past and it was completely ineffective.",3.49212832929782,5.926832410169491,4.958928571428572,78.27480932203392,75.7457627118644,8.282082324455208,27.823849878934627,9.04235418022936,2.6469104116222755,1231,51,221,30,28,411,164,295,0.118,0.858,0.024,-0.978,1,2,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,2,1,3,10,10,1,2,9,1,27,8,2,2,2,45,47,23,0,6,13,0,1,1,0,4,6,10,0,1,18,11,0,0,8,0,0,3,4,7,0,0,4,15,33,3,35,37,7,29,0,1,4,0,13,11,0,12,16,152,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.1246939458767974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20436976191246334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775064343570508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375046842665155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13950165656199962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339739301454786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138511725848182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12969307246785744,0.0,0.13350193808794708,0.14644589141952838,0.0,0.11182033054411916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067430217914072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06460894018528654,0.0,0.0,0.13997573202684704,0.11678776060153274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667592933520961,0.0,0.07261979359227333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12652137469261127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14401630541486524,0.0,0.08564762121264151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474398978208344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10415700143128606,0.14414036345533965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025414029418442,0.06242640219025284,0.12806820297530694,0.0,0.11308046133604187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12872397608526112,0.0,0.0,0.12902044109600447,0.0,0.10199203942396233,0.1358089358633509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340982789617105,0.0,0.11991200688603612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1219795865987524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13590877602233262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12616642222215702,0.0,0.14474878412861356,0.0,0.0,0.101615049955866,0.0,0.0,0.3054701400103321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10826679648300486,0.0,0.25275354704270164,0.0,0.09044268770733993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204302669790082,0.0,0.28822188867441323,0.10270398114799258,0.11168454456321808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08187567244337478,0.0,0.0,0.07450900682004029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08675360500280767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036009530319577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25953170855652,0.0,0.09077058946899466,0.13970636057121955,0.0,0.0

So I've been constipated a year on the meds,it was ok but in early November I stopped going all together and now it's January and I have only gone twice,so twice in two months.I am not bloated or Uncomfortable or anything which I don't understand.Shouldnt I be really sick by this point.I went to the hospital last week and they called me delusional because I wasn't bloated and don't believe that I haven't gone that long.I snuck out before they put me in the psyche ward.

I am not delusional,psychotic or even having any symptoms of schizophrenia at all.I have just not gone for two months except twice (not much).Should I go to the hospital again,or try and deal with this myself.I mean all the hospital can do is give me laxatives which I can take myself.They will likely put me in the psyche ward too.",3.4707059800664446,5.207777482558139,4.706079734219268,83.20453488372095,73.59302325581395,8.40265780730897,26.239202657807308,9.04235418022936,2.109869102990033,685,24,135,15,14,226,96,172,0.047,0.924,0.029,-0.5945,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,2,0,5,2,0,0,7,1,18,2,0,0,2,21,29,10,0,0,10,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,7,7,0,1,1,0,0,9,8,0,0,4,7,0,16,2,16,20,2,24,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,3,8,88,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16838806910905907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11718278498739156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048940608949613,0.0,0.14180380112458618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504402347643488,0.0,0.1466307219450399,0.19414443086995206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17595689922610627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17765325566685636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138150315048139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3306080489836357,0.29379846585491565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14046293126991222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08418632756111126,0.0,0.0,0.15249683506963355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877058374329648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375433300385221,0.0,0.12667424462477034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13105631518955352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16289709214292358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3464562493212109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103919223519194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14406634573784052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17910535338917605,0.12956239389586827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11699324567216494,0.0,0.3366611214916982,0.17939008867131115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382238556798229,0.0,0.0,0.15974137929719626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11096774455478822

I would be very pleased if you try to fill it. It is just for schizophrenics. It is all anonymous. Thank you so much if you try it.

schizophrenia,Angryhotguy,2018/01/07,"What if our delusions are true? Or what if some of them are? This idea has come up in my head many times. But usually, it has to do with facial grimacing. Whenever I get facial grimacing I think it's because someone is angey at me and I can telepathically feel it.

I hate this disease. It makes rational people irrational and nuts in general. 

I still feel like sometimes, even on my medication, that people are broadcasting thoughts to me telepathically.

One day this will be cured, I hope. 

Anyways, share some ideas on how our delusions could be true. Could telepathy exist? Maybe it's the government. 


In all likelihood it's just that our brains are fucked up.",2.9051092896174846,5.864053172131151,3.6377377049180346,83.46819125683061,82.85245901639344,7.5156284153005455,26.166120218579234,8.447377352677275,2.3125162841530056,525,22,96,13,15,166,81,122,0.136,0.765,0.099,-0.7131,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,3,0,1,0,5,7,2,0,1,0,14,6,4,2,3,26,24,7,0,5,5,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,13,4,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,2,14,5,12,18,3,13,0,0,0,1,5,8,1,6,5,69,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607537374879888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21256640174636796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640258840252702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3040621781523705,0.0,0.0,0.12280208858213948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576748188930822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19255935130504911,0.13603269817741814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17603583747159054,0.09948411307008724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18799564522732848,0.1954209892461442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18912531554902975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4299112971310327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302727668639804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710366314127472,0.1930511844935686,0.191297719951684,0.0,0.0,0.19182333947360825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290303066313609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26401992840238003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16133822996365196,0.0,0.18832555881204704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206587080191522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201040852974185,0.0,0.1511684450561995,0.11103266806810884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20971550473746844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,darkshadow2240,2018/01/07,"Hi, I'm a writer doing research for a book where on elf the main characters has schizophrenia. I need a book or something to help me learn more. It is a book to raise awareness about mental health and suicide. One of the main characters hears voices for sure and I was thinking of going with schizophrenia, unless you know of a different mental illness that causes auditory hallucinations. I mainly just need a book, whether fictional or nonfiction, that would show me what it's like to live with schizophrenia and what the person has going through their head all the time. Also, does it often lead to suicide? This will be the focus of the book. Thank you for all your help, and I apologize if any find offense in anything I said. I am writing the book to help all who deal with mental illness. 

Edit: I don't know why the title says on elf. Just a typo I guess.

schizophrenia,NotTheMafia,2018/01/08,"Anyone see other peoples faces? I did MDA once and I was seeing the face of someone I know on a stranger.

Its happened twice since then.

A few days ago I took COQ10 for the first time and it messed me up, I was awake for ages, couldnt sleep and I was delusional, my resting heart rate reached 140.
So it happened again and I was wondering if anyone else gets this?

schizophrenia,Mad_Squid,2018/01/08,"I think I might start trying again I'd given up all hope of making any improvement, and had accepted being completely miserable. Nothing remarkable happened today to make this change. I did see my doctor, and realised I'm actually not doing too bad. My mood is stable, I'm not as depressed, I'm doing more, and I haven't really had any positive symptoms for a year now. 

I'm still constantly bored (anhedonia), my motivation is still pretty low, and my social anxiety is still bad enough that I rarely leave the house. Life is hard, but I'm doing okay. I might even try to start working again this year (I haven't worked in 4 years). Probably just a couple hours a day, something I can handle.

I'd like be in a relationship as well. Haven't really been in one since high school. I wasn't at all interested in having one for years. So far I haven't had much success with online dating, barely anyone responds, but I'll keep at it.

I'm not going to fall into the trap of thinking it's all up hill from here, because every time I do I fall back down to worse than before. But I think just being in the frame of mind that I'll try and make some improvements in my life makes a huge difference. Small steps.

Now she's out and having difficulty living normally, she told me it's hard for her to leave home and still thinks there are people in her roof.

schizophrenia,throwawaybfofschizop,2018/01/08,"Girlfriend [24/f] denies being schizophrenic. Do I enable or rationalize with her? She has had several therapists and psychologist tell her she's schizophrenic but she claims that they're ""out"" to get her and make her look crazy. She keeps talking about her family and how they're out to get her. She's even starting to turn on me after 8 months of dating and she's not believing what I am saying. She thinks I am working with someone to make her look bad. I am stressed over this but I really do love her. 
It makes it really complicated that she's late for her period and we might be pregnant. The question I really just have is do I enable her by encouraging her behaviors? Like driving around before we go home to make sure no one is following us? Affirm her beliefs that that person was looking at her and be on her side? It feels the more I rationalize with her, the more she sees me as an enemy. 

It was maintainable before we realized we might be pregnant (she also wants to keep the baby if we are). I'm not sure if the fact that she might be pregnant is triggering her stress thus triggering some sort of psychosis or what.

We are a long distance relationship, and it hasn't been a week since I last saw her and she's demanding that I fly over there (roughly $600 ticket) as soon as possible.

Please, I do really love her and if we are pregnant, I'll be able to support her and the kid (graduating soon in an engineering field and have a job lined up).

I'm worried what our home life may be because if I do enable her behavior, she may not ever want to leave the house. I feel guilty because I see that there is nothing in reality even though she's breaking away from it. She won't listen to my rationality.

schizophrenia,idkimconfused1,2018/01/09,"I'm not equipped to handle bad days I'm an everyday marijuana smoker. With my anti psychotics, it doesn't make me symptomatic. I don't really have bad days, but today was different. I tried quitting before but it gave me a really bad panic attack. Today I was crying over things from my childhood and had a lot of anxiety despite having smoked prior. I've had a handful of panic attacks, and it's really unpleasant.

schizophrenia,AFriendInNeed01,2018/01/09,"How do you convince someone that they need help? Hi,

Just a heads up, i am going to be very gender unspecific on purpose. I have a friend, whose close friends (myself included) believes that this person needs help. Personally I have always known this person to have some odd behaviors that I always wrote off as personality quirks. However lately this person has been going through a tough time with some personal issues so perhaps this is amplifying those behaviors. This person's significant other has expressed concerns to me and other friends about their behavior. This persons behavior has been a bit erratic, accusing the SO of conspiring against them, watching them, etc. Personally I've only witnessed very minor things such as stopping mid conversation to ask me if i heard something or smelled something however I have no reason not to trust the other person, who i've known for a long time. I know its a pretty big leap to schizophrenia and I'm not claiming to make a medical diagnosis from a few encounters but I thought may this community could provide some advice on getting someone the help that the need. I don't know how to go about telling someone that they need help if they truly believe that everyone is conspiring against them. Thanks in advance for all the help.",8.180099812850905,9.144972515283849,7.7936525265127905,68.31983624454152,61.83842794759825,10.73499688084841,39.50124766063631,10.608840637214634,4.576377167810357,1042,53,162,24,14,330,136,229,0.039,0.8170000000000001,0.14400000000000002,0.9757,2,0,2,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,7,1,8,7,0,0,13,0,17,2,1,4,1,32,34,12,0,7,7,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,0,10,21,4,0,1,6,0,0,4,4,1,0,0,5,3,20,6,25,26,7,17,0,0,1,0,35,8,0,7,5,117,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134245109051895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13852688731105214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778193941810296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18756891692020852,0.0,0.0,0.09087795831220266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664614178221833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09283607175207167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07954064514938995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1929361039297336,0.0,0.043490152215558284,0.0,0.14192387540114193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08542960585518074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789744990104292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0868823076589042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09149450120601052,0.0,0.09389983075490106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366594565602308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05556422514693112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385686894878011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2468895257681642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06330877219992051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.726831068054716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846863446797115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08558593718948533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21159029204084195,0.12816646449762958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06959346789813409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07275657963547259,0.07663742041481487,0.0,0.0,0.05530183189812178,0.0,0.0,0.0660843071601966,0.09707736212674817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13736560770611078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,throwawy7456,2018/01/10,"Delusions of guilt/sin? I've read about delusions of guilt involving people who believe they were directly responsible for causing natural disasters and stuff, but can extreme, severe, unwarranted guilt also count as a delusion? I can honestly say that extreme guilt is starting to ruin my life. I wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7inxia/are_unwanted_thoughts_considered_intrusive/) on /r/OCD a month ago describing some of the upsetting thoughts I have, but I didn't get too deep into things. It sounds so terribly narcissistic (which makes no sense because my self esteem is very low and I deal with a lot of self-hatred), but I've been grappling lately with feeling somehow responsible (or at least partially-responsible) for some of the bad things going on in the world. Because I was praised a lot growing up for being a bright kid, I guess I have this feeling that it's my responsibility and duty to do great things, and that I could ""fix"" (or at least greatly contribute to fixing) many of the great problems in the world if I just applied myself, but because I'm such a lazy/bad/selfish person I'm not applying myself properly and therefore I'm depriving the world of my potential. I know it sounds fucked up. I just feel this huge weight of responsibility on my shoulders, and I feel like the standards I hold myself to compared to other people are irrational. But I can't shake these feelings.

The guilt I feel is all consuming. It affects me every day. The holidays this year were particularly hard, I spent every night during the week leading up to Christmas crying myself to sleep because the guilt was so intense. My social relationships are affected by it. It doesn't matter how well a social interaction goes, because I'll *always* walk away feeling this absolutely crushing guilt. I recently saw an old friend, we went on a walk together and afterwards she hugged me and said she wanted to have me over for dinner but had to check with her husband. I left feeling like the most awful friend and person. I started to go down the rabbit hole of convincing myself that she'll never want to see me again, and surely enough we ended up planning that dinner later in the week, and I was honestly surprised that I turned out to be wrong. My social anxiety worsens significantly the more I get to know someone, partially because of the fear that they're going to somehow wrong me or are lying to me/deceiving me, partially because close relationships stir up so much guilt inside of me that I can't take it. It doesn't matter if people are laughing at my jokes, smile when they see me, tell me they like me. Nothing stops these feelings. I always walk away feeling like the guilt is burning a hole in my stomach. I feel like I'm deceiving people of my true nature. I feel guilty if I make dinner and feel like I didn't give everyone equal portions. I feel like a horrible daughter even though my mother expresses her appreciation for me all the time. I feel guilty for not being open enough. Horribly, horribly guilty any time I slip up with anything social (like if I engage in a bit of gossip or say something negative about a friend I'm having trouble with to someone). A few weeks ago I agonized for days over wasting $10, and it wasn't even my money, it was my parents money. My family either jokes that I should buy myself a whip, or they get angry and annoyed at me for being so ridiculous, so now I just hide these feelings. 

I constantly feel like I'm either on the verge of punishment or deserve to be punished for being such a ""bad"" person, even though I can't rationally explain what's so bad about me. I'm not religious but the closest analogy I can think of is that I feel like a constant sinner. I feel like I don't deserve good things, I feel terrible when good things happen to me, and I'm always waiting for the people in my life to drop me, no matter what evidence I have to the contrary. As a disclaimer, I have dealt with paranoia in the past. About two years ago I went through a stint lasting 6 months to 1 year where I thought cameras were hidden in my house. Since I took a lot of psych classes in college around that time I maintained pretty good insight into these thoughts, but they did start to affect my behavior, because a part of me did believe them even though another part of me didn't, and the two parts were fighting with each other and causing me a lot of confusion and cognitive dissonance. During that time I dealt with serious social withdrawal, apathy, and various ""brain fog"" issues (loss of motivation, extreme trouble concentrating and focusing) that have gotten somewhat better with time, although I still don't feel like I've gotten back to where I was before all of this started. I've been left with some quirks, mostly surrounding fears relating to thievery and surveillance (covering cameras on every device I own, hiding my laptop whenever I leave the house even if it's for a five minute walk, putting a lock on my backpack so someone won't steal my stuff while I'm walking, avoiding all social media, paying for stuff with bitcoin, lots of complex cyber security stuff, and occasionally getting the creeping feeling that there are a set of eyes on me, such as when I'm lying in bed since my bed is near a window). I've had depression for many years, since I was a young teen I'd say, and I think I'm going through a pretty major depressive episode right now. I find myself having with suicidal thoughts, which hasn't really happened since maybe 9-10 months ago. I read about people with depression and the guilt they experience, but I have a hard time relating because I don't see any stories about depressed people who have *this* level of all-encompassing guilt. I've always been a guilty person, but it's gotten significantly worse during these last few months I'd say. I haven't seen a therapist because I always convince myself at the last minute that there's nothing serious going on (or else how would I be able to even articulate these experiences?)

schizophrenia,Jekselpeone,2018/01/10,"Am I Reading This Situation Wrong? To make a very extensive story short, a girl and I have been interested in each other for 4 years. I am almost 100% certain that she is some type of schizophrenic, but I certainly am not a doctor. I would really love it if someone could tell me if I'm over reacting or if she really could be schizophrenic.

She is paranoid about the silliest things sometimes. I once said that flowers were evil and that they planned on taking over the world. A week or so after I said that, this girl (I'll call her Sophie) began to truthfully become terrified that flowers wanted to take over the world and hurt people. I had to spend 15-20 mins convincing her flowers didn't have brains and that they couldn't take over the world.

She does/say weird shit. Just the other day she found a dead mouse, felt bad for it and decided to give him one last splendid day on this earth. She strapped him onto her bike and began to bike as fast as she could so ""he could feel the wind one more time."" She also has names and personalities for literally everything (not using that as a hyperbole.) I could provide a lot more examples but those are the ones fresh on my mind.

She sees things and she hears voices. There is one reoccurring man that is always there in her line of sight. I've asked her many times to describe him to me but she struggles to; the only thing she can say is that he has no face. She also sees many eyes. I'm sorry if that isn't helpful, but that's all she ever tells me.

She is antisocial: struggles to sleep, extremely talented in art, overly empathetic 95% of the time but the other 5% she thinks everyone in her life sucks and treats her like shit, I am the only thing she is obsessive about in her life, and she has a very poor memory. She sometimes forgets my name.

I'm rather ashamed of this, but I called her crazy a few years ago (not as an insult, more as if I was trying to state a fact) and she adamantly believes she is not crazy. She becomes rather defensive which contradicts her passive personality.

P.s. 

Sophie also is very calm and collected on the outside when she is in public, but when she is home or with people she is comfortable with she explodes with child like energy.

I hope I've given you all enough information to have a vague idea for an answer.

schizophrenia,UnoriginalSurface,2018/01/10,"Summarized history of 15 years with Schizophrenia symptoms. Current problem - Can't seem to get proper sleep, no matter what. **tl;dr** - Brother has long history of Schizophrenia/Bipolar/OCD/Psychosis symptoms (started around 19year of age, ~15 year ago). Have been taking various medicines (details below) regularly since then, and most original symptoms are under control. But the main problem in last few years has been lack of proper sleep (and sudden rage over seemingly trivial issues sometime). He has trouble falling asleep, and even after being in bed for 10+hrs feel like his sleep is not yet completed. Any suggestions, your story, medicines, anything else you can share is much appreciated.

*Current medication:* Quetiapine (Seroquel) - 300mg/day, Clonazepam (Clonotril) - 0.25-0.5mg/day. Occasionally Melatonin during night. 

**More details**

Posting this for my brother (with his permission), who was diagnosed with Schizophrenia arond 2003 (was ~19year old then). His original symptoms (during initial years) varied, and included (not a complete list):

* Feel like someone was capturing his mind and laughing inside his brain.
* Feels that ""negative energy"" was leaving his body via area around heart. He actually cut holes in his T-shirts around heart area so that ""energy"" can leave.
* Stopped eating for almost 6 months, claiming he can survive on energy from Sun. He barely ate anything during this period.
* Lack of emotions and general apathy
 
One persistent theme of all his symptoms, in particular his own belief (which he holds till date) of why he has these symptoms is [Kundalini Psychosis](https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/thread28047.html). I should note that we are from India (and Hindu), so believing in power of Kundalini/Yog/etc is part of the ""heritage"" and a very common deal. Unfortunately he takes this belief to extreme. He believes that he has ""awakened"" his Kundalini which control powers of the body and that's why has all these problems, and these are expected to last a few life-times (before he attains Moksha). If you are not aware of what ""Kundalini"" is (very likely), then just think of it as a culture specific thing he believe in, where one can tap into infinite power of one's own body at some cost (and he thinks he is paying these costs right now).

**Medicinal history:**
We have consulted several doctors over last 15 years, and tried all kind of medicines. **Different doctors diagnosed different diseases including Schizophrenia, OCD, Psychosis, Bipolar disorder, etc**. As a result we tried various medicines including: 

* Clozapine - had some pretty severe side effect. He remained very calm during the course, but became almost zombie like (couldn't even do most basic tasks).
* Fluoxetine
* Aripiprazole (Arip) - this lead to intense restlessness and he could barely sit still for 5-10minutes.
* Luramax (40mg/day) - We tried this recently, and it made him little more alert, but had  the side effect of cultivating suicidal thoughts in him. We stopped it immediately.
  * Many others .. I can find out the whole list and paste here is someone is interested.

**Current medication (going on for 4-5 years now):** Quetiapine (Seroquel) - 300mg/day, Clonazepam (Clonotril) - 0.25-0.5mg/day. Occasionally Melatonin during night. 

This current medication seem to work ok for him (at least better than alternatives) - in terms of balance between side effects vs impact. He is relatively alert during day, and can do basic tasks once he wakes up (which is usually around 1pm in the day).

Almost all of his hallucination related symptoms are gone, but his biggest residual problem is sleep disorder. He can not fall asleep without taking the medicine, and never feels that he had a complete sleep. Almost always (despite being asleep for 10+ hours) he will complain that he didn't had a full night sleep and was either dreaming too much or just couldn't sleep. He usually goes to bed around 11-12pm and wakes up at 1pm in afternoon.

This causes his entire day to be sluggish and he takes more than 3x time for every normal task (like taking a bath, getting ready, etc). 

Does anyone has experience with problems like these ? Happy to share more details if needed.

*PS: He still has several behavioral disorders: mood swings, too much remorse of even small mistakes and sudden rage (sometime over really trivial things). And in general he has a general lack of emotions and apathy toward everyone in his life. It's manageable but definitely not ideal.

I like my new boss. My co workers, for the most part, seem pleasant.

I am concerned about my ability to communicate and handle a lot of interactions. My last boss was very understanding and kept me out of most, if not all, meetings and events, letting me keep my headphones on and work. My new role, while I disclosed that I have a disability, I did not disclose which, and I'm reluctant too for all the common reasons we usually discuss here. So far it's been a LOT of meetings, and my new boss wants me to go to events and conferences. I can't handle that many unknowns in a single instance. 

Does anyone have tips in quick things I can do to help get through these occasions? My psych suggested an increase on some of my meds and potentially additional meds to help with the new change, but I already got down from 7 to 2 types a day, so I don't want to start increasing that again.

schizophrenia,Victouros,2018/01/10,"Spiritual awakening or Schizophrenia? I’m not looking for a diagnosis, but only suggestive insight.

Within these past 3 months, I’ve have had mixed  emotions of peace and anxiety after my ex-girlfriend and I broke up. As a way to cope with the uncertainty of the future, I went to a tarot card reader. She wasn’t negative by any means, but her shop focused more on Jesus Christ and Catholic beliefs.

Since then, I started buying healing crystals, and reading a philosophy book called The Law of One which challenged my religious, existential beliefs. I began questioning life in general and my own identity. As a result. I began doing online tarot card readings on myself several times a day everyday. During this period I was obsessed with the idea of the laws of Spiritual Awakening so I continued to feed this further and further to find an answer to the existential crisis I’ve been experiencing. I was also feeling as if an angel was right beside me and all of our life choices are controlled.

A few days ago I realized I was living in a loop of a problem. I needed to stop these tarot card readings and threw away my crystals. It was unhealthy. 

Currently, I’m experiencing synchronicity. I see 1111 1212 222 333 on the clock a few times a day. I disbelieve that our choices are controlled now, but that we create our own future. Sometimes I still do question reality in a sense like “am I even wearing pants?” When I clearly have pants on, but I’m unsure if that is me over analyzing things that are fueled by anxiety, or that I’m literally going insane. Spiritual awakening symptoms are just as those as psychosis.

I’ve always believed that everything happened for a reason, and have always seen everything as a learning process to grow. My parents say I’m fine, but I’m paranoid about what this is.

schizophrenia,afterthesnow,2018/01/10,"I don't want to admit it but I should be turning to people who can help me. (since 2013 Male 25)

I've always thought it best to keep a distance from other schizophrenics because I don't want to adopt triggers that I didn't possess prior.. and in all honest, I've done really well.. except they're still pretending they're trying to fix me.. and it's really exhuasting because I've lost faith in their tireless methods yet they still choose to play me at their whim.. I'm just constantly tolerating them, hoping they relieve me, or feeling like they genuinely care.. like ""it's a tough love"" kind of thing only to know the entire time it's likely just there to screw you around.

Originally, I wanted to ask what sort of support I would find if I went to the doctor (UK).. but more than that I just need someone to relate to.. but it's hard enough to measure their game let alone adopt someone elses.. i just need guidence.. advice, someone who knows the enviroment..

schizophrenia,dedoubt,2018/01/10,"Wellness checks? Update: his parents were about to do a wellness check and his mom finally got him on the phone. He had taken pills (and was probably drinking)- she doesn't know if he is coming out of something he took yesterday or he just took them. His parents called the police to go there on an emergency call and one of my friends who lives nearby is going there right now.

I feel really stupid that I didn't go over there even though he told me not to.

.....


Have any of you ever had someone do a wellness check on you (having the police come to your house to make sure you are ok)?

My partner had a very bad episode last night and would not let me come over today. I haven't heard anything from him since before 4, and his mom can't get through to him. If we don't hear from him by the morning, we might do a wellness check. I want to do it right this second but I am trying to be reasonable (he pulled all the sharp knives out last night when things were really bad- I hid them but I worry that he might have found them.)

However, I am worried that if he is ok, it might make his episode worse &amp; cause him to distrust me more than he already does right now. He has been arrested a bunch of times in the last year and interactions with the police will stress him. But I am so so worried about him.",2.9111152882205498,4.343841063909778,3.4567669172932334,92.83998746867172,74.45112781954887,6.5704260651629065,23.192982456140356,7.07126945348624,0.5695959899749372,1017,28,225,10,21,318,145,266,0.139,0.8059999999999999,0.055,-0.9814,3,0,2,0,0,0,33.0,2,4,3,0,18,13,2,1,13,2,34,2,0,4,3,39,54,17,0,5,10,4,2,0,2,5,1,2,0,1,8,14,1,0,4,1,4,9,7,5,4,2,15,4,36,8,29,32,3,35,0,0,0,0,46,11,0,7,15,156,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10299247543329176,0.0,0.0,0.10112350657624228,0.0,0.06346790831680188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680301035444419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1558540592838761,0.0,0.0,0.07941734118911399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906016544835123,0.0,0.0,0.09587608404457798,0.0,0.2411877630381894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167410815619466,0.0,0.0,0.09142831243380914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06164388382985333,0.08442273779387995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0471906811835813,0.0,0.0,0.1022389490459656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233202417653173,0.07210687628891148,0.0,0.04876130949656706,0.0,0.15912554131994008,0.0,0.07464488897411838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519020331520453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076908117026706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05129197603663798,0.2282303269556337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954367112823542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241249968336409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245976038850092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970265844788879,0.0,0.2186149965621483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17516861508064185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324313020367582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20726484575895984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10062601346701633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195797558062985,0.09595924960587472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2391110901333943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07720391497628598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07907858975777911,0.0718503422507447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690971830994876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796284720909557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06200460572190768,0.0,0.09169669597558508,0.0,0.0544217375500386,0.0,0.08846635637643085,0.08918124720424668,0.2073871341860033,0.0633652510546236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07700739788564685,0.05504871914858489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3356611422848086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2843448154480795,0.09511170480969268,0.06629927586171055,0.0,0.0,0.060101751620627364
schizophrenia,Clownsheuz,2018/01/11,"Thought Confirmation? So like you'll have a thought and hear a semi-random noise and use that as an otherworldly confirmation of your thoughts. I recall hearing horns outside or electronics or thumps or whatever and thinking of them as something telling me that I'm following the right clues.

Does anyone else experience this while delusional? I've seen other people with schizo tendencies do this and I recall doing it while delusional.

schizophrenia,schizotalk120685,2018/01/11,"Was there any case of a nearly treatment-resistant schizophrenia patient who had actual improvements only after being on an antipsychotic of daily dose titrated above the ""recommended/approved"" maximum daily dose? Hi dear r/schizophrenia!

According to my search results, the ""recommended/approved"" maximum daily doses of atypical antipsychotics are: aripiprazole (Abilify) 30 mg, asenapine (Saphris) 20 mg, brexpiprazole (Rexulti) 4 mg, cariprazine (Vraylar) 6 mg, clozapine (Clozaril) 900 mg, iloperidone (Fanapt) 24 mg, lurasidone (Latuda) 160 mg, olanzapine (Zyprexa) 20 mg, paliperidone (Invega) 12 mg, quetiapine (Seroquel) 750 mg, risperidone (Risperdal) 16 mg, ziprasidone (Geodon) 200 mg.

Does anyone know and can tell me any case of a nearly treatment-resistant schizophrenia patient who had actual improvements **only** after being on an antipsychotic of daily dose titrated above the ""recommended/approved"" maximum daily dose? When the patient begun having actual improvements, which antipsychotic and how much dose was the patient on?

""Systematic studies on dose of aripiprazole greater than 30 mg/day are not available with the exception of one report presented as a poster (Saha et al 2002). The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of aripiprazole from 30 to 90 mg/day were evaluated among 40 patients with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients were randomized to 30 mg/day (N=12), 45 mg/day (N=7), 60 mg/day (N=7), 75 mg/day (N=7), and 90 mg/day (N=7) for 15 days of treatment at that dose. Linear pharmacokinetics was observed. Incidence of adverse events was similar across dose groups, with the exception of akathisia and tachycardia which appeared higher at 90 mg/day (frequency of 57% and 71% respectively). Patients in all dose groups maintained a stable symptom profile. Thus, dosing above 30 mg/day appears generally tolerable.""",11.497324345346124,16.709986872180462,7.912981159796042,50.58332706766922,70.00250626566415,10.47102238354507,40.46327024457696,9.711379227409472,6.455721942788005,2498,134,233,77,58,704,214,399,0.006999999999999999,0.921,0.07200000000000001,0.9655,0,0,0,1,0,0,250.0,0,0,0,1,5,4,0,0,19,0,14,15,0,3,1,26,17,13,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,15,0,0,0,5,12,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,8,0,2,2,50,7,4,27,0,0,0,0,6,15,0,4,10,110,7,4,0.0,0.0,0.3303197077581014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18046147457235712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15345760465118716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889390769440961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183009304412788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8004317364065167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12931385378797422,0.0,0.0987389795257647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09597380732226024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384238364991077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062008848165591976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08294360879547008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07645705939492888,0.17162579132731665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172743868233915,0.0,0.0,0.09861907852813004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876484950377027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Ryanpt123,2018/01/11,"I think my friend is developing schizophrenia and i need help. I’m gonna try to explain this the best i can. So a little back story: my friend (let’s call him bob) who I’ve been friends with for over 7 years has been acting alarmingly different lately. I’ve known him for years and he’s always been a goofball and he’s been just a fun person to hang out with. A couple months ago he started acting strange. He started to leave All our group chats, i wouldn’t hear from him for weeks at a time. A couple days ago (after not seeing him for weeks) he comes up to me and says “yo do you believe in time travel”. At first i thought it was a joke so i laughed it off, but then he started to talk about spirits and it threw me off because he was being dead serious. I wasn’t gonna pay it any mind until what happened tonight. So me and two of my friends were hanging out, and bob calls my friend and says “yo I’m gonna see you soon be ready”. So me and my friends were like what the fuck does that mean. 5 minutes later bob is in the back yard with 4 other people who were all friends with. The first red flag was when he made us keep our phones inside because he didn’t want the government to hear what we were talking about. So we go outside and bob starts to talk to us about how we need to “raise our enlightenment” and we need to be aware of everything around us. And he said “what if i told you i saw things move without touching them” and “i had an overwhelming feeling and saw an orb of light leave my body” so we were all like alright dude what the fuck and he was literally all over the place with his thoughts he didn’t make any sense at all. And he started to talk about how the government is brainwashing us and he was saying some shit about the Illuminati and he was being dead serious. And he was talking about how he’s obsessed with the number 6. And this wasn’t like Stoner talk like he wasn’t joking around, he was being serious about everything he said. He talked for an entire 45 minutes without any of us saying a single word. Me and my friend talked about it after and we started to try to figure out what was happening and we really want to know what to do next. He’s clearly not mentally healthy and he needs help but we don’t know where to start. Please help.",2.9957777777777785,4.276370055319148,3.6867730496453923,91.88361111111112,73.97872340425532,6.754137115839244,24.33215130023641,7.1686216300943375,0.7494208037825065,1786,53,397,18,36,565,202,470,0.091,0.755,0.154,0.9821,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,16,3,1,3,25,27,3,3,21,1,39,4,2,5,6,85,84,39,2,8,8,0,2,4,8,4,0,8,1,1,19,44,0,1,11,5,1,9,11,9,0,3,33,16,47,18,60,41,8,58,1,1,5,2,85,18,3,2,35,242,66,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10946637300353818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05137675764218535,0.0,0.0,0.1259660817426801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993222010440253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495613447159956,0.0,0.0752783158336003,0.0,0.0,0.06956543219063514,0.06479753200643623,0.0,0.0,0.06858473734468679,0.0,0.0,0.12609702670057474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053187820567614376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13663925999538598,0.0,0.03982039476055408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06451034727699598,0.0,0.0,0.054033435464266616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098478743597097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031220109821969613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504047234667116,0.0,0.0,0.38163205788895976,0.114164451452872,0.0,0.0,0.03509108684800635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920173827934164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13918212737469834,0.0,0.12415904668521673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05488176241042491,0.0,0.0,0.06786683661632814,0.0,0.06965101058690831,0.1307580065436031,0.0,0.06313841064704434,0.0,0.12066188527970785,0.061884676487882026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05842457935528444,0.04121524397700002,0.0,0.0,0.06725836866511048,0.0,0.0,0.06222440272594885,0.0,0.06234481371687209,0.0,0.04928424243844662,0.06562512680596819,0.0,0.18313243841685664,0.0,0.0,0.06566647136746237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04280618471160545,0.05391332232335316,0.06451034727699598,0.06777743053317498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03955540601579453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746720342812887,0.19640829953805844,0.0,0.0,0.09840548682690232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06338031986092939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3059238310214841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3970261157540582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04102061151809328,0.03956368078626818,0.0,0.09803721136958728,0.0720079719300916,0.0,0.0,0.05899996062666508,0.0,0.08384155715515754,0.0,0.06031585946970019,0.0,0.3713579556316951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728375609028306,0.0,0.0990561739663177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903988687485124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07952346688064177
schizophrenia,goldyroll,2018/01/11,"Holy hell! I literally cannot believe that my phone decided to go awol and ditch that incredibly long yet seemingly interesting post!!! Why?!? It would have been another great read for someone unfamiliar with the way my mind takes over the ship. I stumbled upon a notebook that I had during a long strange trip to the mysterious land of delusions. Where they critique me from outside the house until morning. I know they don’t like me but they have so much dirt on me I have to be cool and calm to keep the peace. I don’t think the kids who installed the surveillance cameras, mics in my house are the only ones who remote access my devices. They destroyed my laptop with malware last week. I’m sorry wife but you might be an internet star soon. Soooo many nsfw pics and vids of her and me. Maybe some others too. Damn. Fuck internet. I’m not trying to be right about this but I’m thinking maybe since so many of my delusions have turned into realities that I’m some kind of mother fucking sleeper agent.

schizophrenia,VintageLuka,2018/01/11,"I lost my Risperdal?? I’m not 100% sure what to do?? If the pharmacist or doctor doesn’t approve it I could be without it and that would be bad. It’s been about 2 days without it. 
And in general I’ve been having more paranoid thoughts like people are poisoning me or my food/drink. And I see things. One of the things I see, I call it the darkness, it corrupts walls and makes them all black. It can talk too. 
I want to get my medicine so I don’t have to go and be hospitalized because things get so bad, plus I have school to deal with too, so I can’t be hospitalized because I’ll miss a lot of school work. Ugh.
Sorry for rambling, thank you for any responses. 

EDIT: Got it figured out with the pharmacy and my doctor and I’ll get it in a few days.

I cooked myself lunch! Fried chicken! I took my meds on time. I read and I journaled. I am also extremely proud of myself for being able to look up the news without getting super upset.

This may be silly, but I’m listening to Grimes after writing her off as terrible two years ago. She’s really good! I’m happy my music taste has broadened.

schizophrenia,Throwaway1945796,2018/01/11,"Was This a Psychotic Episode Hello all. I made a throwaway account to inquire about something that happened to me years ago that I believe was a psychotic episode but never found out for sure. Here it is;

Back in 2015, at the very start of the year in January, I dropped out of community college after only one semester. I dropped out due to severe cognitive issues and seemingly worsening depersonalization/derealization. After I dropped out, I continued to only get worse and worse. I spent nearly every day in my room literally watching my symptoms get worse overnight. I was avoiding people, wasnt really taking care of myself, had noise/light sensitivity, and pretty much never went out. Sometime around spring/summer it all came to a head and pretty much blew up. I had trouble even doing the slightest things for my mom for example when she’d tell me to go out and do something for her. It even became hard to talk and engage in conversation. Finally, at the beginning of summer, is when it really took off. At this point I started getting weird thoughts about aliens (that I knew were not true), that seemed very typical of delusional like thought patterns. I also started refusing to even eat food and my mom threatened to take me to the hospital because I’d just sit in my bed glued to the tv screen not eating or doing anything. I remember playing video games and feeling so weird. I could not even watch any cutscenes and had to skip them everytime. I also had weird thoughts when playing them like the game had something to do with my life, very confusing and scary. I felt completely mentally incapacitated and felt like I needed help with the slightest things. Ill never forget the sense of urgency and fear I had during this. I remember my mom bringing me to the kitchen table to force me to eat and it was one of the scariest moments of my life. I felt so dazed and could hardly even look at the plate and eat food. Luckily this was a brief period but Ill never forget it. I slept on the floor for about a week not doing anything until I finally felt a little better.

schizophrenia,IatrogenicPosset,2018/01/12,"Any experience going unmedicated long-term? I seriously finished going through every one of the atypicals early last year, and have been off pills entirely for nearly a year, and been entirely out of the system just as long. I'm actually more functional off the pills than on, for literally all of them. There is nothing left.
I'm pretty OK with this, actually, since I stopped hearing voices and such a while back with or without them. Memory's gone to shit, though, and I wonder if I'm racking up nerve damage like this. Could also be depression causing that, however.
Also just worried about the review on my disability claim, though I've passed two so far.

schizophrenia,Not_Astroturfing,2018/01/12,"Art as experience ""in order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience, that we do not usually regard as esthetic. We must arrive at a theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding, insight, not without exclamations of admiration, and simulation of that emotional outburst often called appreciation. It is quite possible to enjoy flowers in their colored form and delicate fragrance without knowing anything about the plants theoretically. But if one see out to understand the flowering of plants, he is committed to finding out something about the interactions of soil, air, water, and sunlight that condition the growing of plants."" 

John Dewey - Art as Experience 

Be well my artist and excuisite sculptures of experience! It's okay to take a break into the thoughts of another, and come back into your mind refreshed.

schizophrenia,MaddieBox,2018/01/12,"Prodromal Schizophrenia, Out of the hospital. Denial? Okay, first of all my name is Guy. 17, Now wait, before thinking ""oh he's young he probably thinks he has schizphrenia"", hear me out, I am not here for a diagnosis. My story goes like this:

I have been depressed for over 7 years, starting from the age of 9 or 10, can't quite remember due to memeory loss. During those 7 years I have had anxiety, anger problems, impulsivity and including delusions, might have heard voices once or twice.

I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for about 6 months now, been talking and talking with them and it was time for me to do my tests and exams for the army, in my country army is mandatory, my psychiatrist wrote a letter which says I am not fit for the army due to prodromal affective state (something like that), at first I didn't really understand what it was so I naturally being a teen in the age of the internet, started googling and ""prodromal schizophrenia"" came up.

a few months back from now I started talking to a certain classmate about my problems and started having intense mood swings which scared me since i am mostly apathic,depressed which caused me to cut ties with her, which lead to me being extremely suicidal and landed me in the hospital for about a month.

A month in the hospital went fine, normal stuff (quite boring), and I get the summary of my hospitalization, a lot of information about myself and my problems and there it is again ""prodromal schizophrenia"". Now I am not diagnosed with schizophrenia or prodromal schizophrenia since it said I wasn't there long enough for it to be decided.

Now you're probably asking, why is this thread for?

I am currently in denial of that statement/half diagnosis since... I am not sure why even, maybe it's because of the stigma, maybe it's becuase of fear, I am not sure. But one thing that keeps me in this denial is the fact that I didn't have that many ""positive"" symptoms, I had like 3 delusions in the past 3 years, each delusion about a year a part, I think I heard a voice once... not much, which is causing me to doubt my psychiatrist and that letter.So this leads me to my questions.


I am just trying to understand better what does prodromal schizophrenia is like, what it is and how it looks like. So my question is :How was your prodromal state like? could you describe it, how long did it take or last? did you have many ""positive"" symptoms? etc.

TL;DR: Got out of the hospital, got a summary letter that said they think my diagnosis is schizophrenia and that I am in the prodromal state of schizophrenia. I have (going by the list of negetive symptoms listed in the letter)  Anxiety, restlessness, irratibility, depressed, anhedonia, mood swings, apathy, boredom, fatigue, sleep disturbance, dissosiation, Increased interpersonal sensitivity, Change in sense of self, others, or the world, Social withdrawal, Impulsivity, Aggressive, disruptive behavior, Deterioration in school. Delusions. Trying to understand what prodromal schizophrenia really is like and how it manifests. 

Sorry in advance if I made any grammar errors, english is my 2nd language.

schizophrenia,soskin_,2018/01/12,"Are the people that don't see/hear things the sick ones? I feel like the people that can hear and see things and think heavily are the normal people in this world.

schizophrenia,soundandvisions,2018/01/12,"Out of hospital.. update Hey guys. Just a little update on my life right now...

I just got discharged from a little over 2 weeks at the psych ward. Suicidal impulses, not eating or sleeping, rapidly increasing substance use, and it turned out I had some delusions about being chosen by ancient beings to suffer and starve to death for the sake of ultimate truth and knowledge. I still feel those things but I am more accepting of trusting the human doctors. I am forcing myself to eat every day and to allow myself to sleep. I guess that has helped me feel better. 

I am now in a sort of half-way house. It’s not a locked facility like the ward, so they can’t stop me from leaving, but if I leave I’ll be kicked out. They manage my new meds and food and stuff. I’ll be here for a week or so then I’m staying with a friend until the end of the month. After that, I’ll be heading to a long-term inpatient treatment for co-occurring mental health disorder and substance abuse disorder. Probably 1-3 months, sounds like. 

It’s been a hard road and it’s going to get harder but I’m trying to focus on each day at a time. I had to quit my job. We’re talking about putting my stuff in storage so I’d be losing my apartment too. Going to lose most of my social group, because of substance use. 

I’m going to journal then go to bed. I hope everyone is safe and well.

schizophrenia,dawndragonclaw,2018/01/12,Telling teachers in the sticks I need to talk to someone at my school about this so something can be done to help me. I'm going to fail eleventh grade english again and have to wait to graduate till next and that would cause me to get so much flack from my parents and family I would probably just kill myself. The problem with telling anyone is the fact that I live in the Virginia mountains where everything is god or trump and can't expect anyone to understand or really help. There are a select few teachers and staff who would grasp just how bad things are and try and help but they aren't apart of the administration. What do I do because nothing isn't cutting it anymore as things get worse.,7.747668067226889,6.9739408676470624,6.823907563025213,80.74294117647061,63.117647058823536,9.830252100840337,34.86974789915966,8.841846274778883,2.727280672268908,562,21,110,7,7,171,92,136,0.106,0.843,0.051,-0.8253,1,0,1,0,0,1,5.0,0,0,1,1,9,5,2,0,6,0,16,0,0,2,1,25,23,15,1,6,5,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,1,2,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,1,0,10,0,17,18,2,9,0,1,0,0,9,5,0,2,3,77,18,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1629090825271808,0.2297191169594574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371563852957802,0.10013585881961937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16874782965924556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16810254309623754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14763291238316129,0.0,0.15485664888348674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17164583286615331,0.0,0.09335692701218896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3303148491666986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18173749712694628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14505108961161645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207554114554032,0.12180216703531653,0.0,0.0,0.17470020239479908,0.0,0.0,0.15761896355446048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823994650752567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17710799881987152,0.15718168004405325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052338780029502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16624733952728138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139183202225224,0.1264610401635697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13203188273609393,0.2871538284374108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21826387151115345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152675558076937,0.0,0.0,0.1710081163909267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16740247499432706,0.3500724613796728,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,echte_wiener,2018/01/13,"Good mental illness/schizo books? What are your guys' favorite books pertaining to mental illness either explicitly or implicitly?

My favorite is Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut which is not a book about mental illness per se but it has a lot of imagery I relate to. The main character becomes convinced by a science fiction writer that he's the only person with consciousness and everyone around him is just a machine made for him to interact with. The way Vonnegut writes about it and other ""symptoms"" he has really resonates with things I've experienced; it's also just an overall absurd book.",9.309276729559748,9.871298481132076,8.77735849056604,63.59955974842768,59.47169811320754,10.840251572327047,42.19496855345911,10.504223727775694,4.987923270440254,493,26,68,10,6,157,75,106,0.035,0.851,0.114,0.8105,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,0,0,6,2,0,0,8,0,6,4,0,1,2,18,7,5,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,8,6,1,0,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,5,2,14,6,3,2,0,0,0,0,9,1,0,2,0,52,13,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17922143098614393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19950624335023429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475129163879417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141475991526217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18797361650740899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22190505689835172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.190531099715378,0.0,0.2120591822019185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6775533226260556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17044646226404409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19568502106202365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14357120143502655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329370684165997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14888934465495068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1778888259538771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,mothmagnet,2018/01/13,"booming internal monologue does anyone else experience changes in their internal monologue (the voice that you think with in your head) that is upsetting or disturbing? 
i don't hear voices in the traditional sense where you hear it externally and you can't decipher real sounds from your auditory hallucinations; however, i hear something within my head instead. it's basically as if whatever i'm thinking is being read aloud by a different voice or often different voices at the same time that i'm thinking it. the pitch and the volume and the intensity of their voice(s) fluctuate as if to mock me. there's even often an echo. 
they usually only say what i'm thinking, however a couple times they've said things i don't think i thought (that i'm not going to specify because they'd likely be triggering). 
this is all within my head though, and i've looked everywhere online to see if anyone else experiences this with little luck. the closest i got was a post on a schizophrenia forum that described a similar thing and guess when it was posted? my birthday. needless to say it was just a coincidence but seeing as i was in a bad place at the time it upset me greatly and didn't bring me the solace i was yearning for. 
anyways, has anyone else experienced something similar? i feel so alone in it and i know that finding people who experience similar things won't make it go away but i figure it might at least make me feel less alone.",6.7292875816993485,7.576098033333337,7.386339869281048,70.39441176470591,64.96296296296296,10.649237472766883,34.771241830065364,10.59048541779884,3.9228627450980382,1159,51,197,29,17,384,150,270,0.085,0.901,0.014,-0.9586,4,2,2,0,0,0,23.0,0,5,4,0,11,9,1,3,17,0,18,3,3,3,1,41,45,20,0,4,9,0,2,1,0,2,0,12,0,0,22,9,0,0,11,1,0,3,6,6,0,0,9,18,26,3,25,31,4,26,0,1,3,0,16,16,0,10,6,137,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19594739892450488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1984327318327289,0.29077663410252297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887675634077051,0.0,0.07898433119186835,0.05766529804744223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007081366838892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10466949964758583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19766693033329308,0.0,0.0,0.0827822494717241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370703274521848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06248025824597697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776013064023033,0.0,0.0,0.09566191368772302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08645971163129004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10752302091199363,0.0,0.07565765896123768,0.10429324588025106,0.10420898011028262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29125065616396123,0.0,0.31985222181431977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05198789741349153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046215191589839916,0.09481079045741407,0.0,0.0,0.07943744142896365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12628812436693354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100352197986017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07194508765270713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06558147249534546,0.0,0.09883346516664654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18119506648519046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946223447324529,0.1076718062531907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08998316741644102,0.1504542577292642,0.0,0.0,0.15076271737854516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14565039254435444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18853762306595365,0.3030688743670987,0.09294082216933257,0.07509924937566131,0.16548036910068026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041849506513524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What does this mean, any feedback is appreciated, thanks!",6.263376623376622,9.74769693939394,6.144718614718619,67.80136363636367,72.03030303030303,8.013852813852813,35.18614718614719,8.841846274778883,3.8649419913419916,322,17,45,7,7,101,50,66,0.096,0.78,0.124,0.7133,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,8,2,0,0,1,11,13,6,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,7,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,7,2,4,1,4,5,1,5,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,2,3,35,11,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19151384520220185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16285612212752004,0.0,0.0,0.27054674324819583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2062656855901084,0.243069412734805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20957250499179145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19153580884193155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530261144325126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26086634473075937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18470345205140865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22638810585616526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2364598013821562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4556048651227002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19125081063400293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489137231921797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2204830531748695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308523146080571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,knuckleone,2018/01/13,"Isolated I’m not sure what’s happening but it’s been slowly happening for some time.  I’m approaching something ugly that hopefully when I arrive I will be able to retreat from once it’s touched me.  Whatever is happening and will happen I hope to survive and return from, that as real and as much as it feels like growth of disease or loss of health, it is simply a cycle that I will return to wicked baseline from.  I’m turning inward further and further and becoming more and more ugly to the outside world.  Not sure where to go from here but can’t seem to calm myself.   I don’t like being social with people feel very uncomfortable around others struggling with the right things to say, attempting to be normal and foster healthy back and forth, but feel as though my isolation is causing static build up throughout.   As uncomfortable as it is conforming my square into the circle, I need to force myself into awkward and uncomfortable social interaction with others, as a ground.  It’s really the shit of it all.  The healthy are drawn to others, take comfort in their company, having the inner attraction / enjoyment of activities that keep them mentally healthy.  I suppose it’s similar to the person who enjoys regular exercise, taking pleasure in activities that keep the body fit, those who take pleasure from forming relationships and being with others.

schizophrenia,tranquilschizo,2018/01/13,"Am I the only lonely one? Hey so from 1st grade to 7th grade I was the coolest kid in school. Literally the coolest kid, everyone liked me. 8th grade I had a schizophrenic episode and i never took pills or anything. It lasted for 4 months. During this time I didn’t go to school. My dad never did anything for me because he doesn’t believe in medicine. I’m now in 11th grade. Since then, I now only have 1 friend. I am not stretching the truth on this one, I only have 1 friend. And even her, she takes hours to respond and it makes me sad because she actually makes me happy. I’m just so lonely. I wish I could go out with a friend and have fun or something. Just something. Similar things happened to my brother. He was superrrrr popular in high school. At age 22, he had his episode. Except with him, he went to the mental hospital for a month and then took meds. Now he only has two friends. Some peurto rican guy his age, and an old white man in his 60s.

schizophrenia,ArktheRedKing,2018/01/13,"Weekly Megathread: What are your plans for this year? Instead of making resolutions, which are hard to follow, I like to plan things out and go from there. 

I'm planning on continuing college and unless something goes horribly wrong, all will be well on that front. I'm hoping to lose some weight, too, since I gained 20 pounds this year (but if I don't lose much, I'm not really unhealthy, so no big worries). I'm planning on getting doctors again (I lost them all 6 months ago when I became an adult) and am planning on working at a camp for kids over the summer.

What things are you guys planning to do or hoping for? Here's to a hopefully great year, /r/schizophrenia!",4.922068376068378,6.032086830769233,4.929487179487179,85.44773504273506,69.15384615384616,7.316239316239318,28.290598290598286,7.3871296695380915,1.4893418803418808,528,18,103,5,9,164,93,130,0.131,0.706,0.163,0.665,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,2,1,11,8,10,0,0,4,0,8,2,0,1,2,16,20,9,0,4,5,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,3,8,4,1,0,0,0,0,3,3,4,1,0,1,2,8,6,18,17,4,21,0,3,0,0,6,8,0,6,11,66,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14931929952785833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17241402496810626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08800731092360879,0.0,0.09573307974031788,0.0,0.0,0.1857149016005178,0.0,0.1667903508554055,0.0,0.0,0.1508966358257825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5019216617227009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229535562073674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3769012345937172,0.1838812736159101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1124405822839587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13445386663961428,0.0,0.12382891986607128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079123269869838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393422166054874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967977020539567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22381919890186214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13511910648653866,0.20512471121070114,0.1514552973403667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122632405703906,0.17106747707023118,0.0,0.0,0.18417182830188053,0.0,0.3254256456526737

schizophrenia,Semiomime,2018/01/14,"Probably Schizophrenia, afraid for medication because of the extreme side effects I've had multiple psychosis in the past 4 years caused by drug use. Been in multiple rehab clinics and last time a major psychosis was triggered by a tiny bit of weed which never happened in the past and hadn't smoke in 2 years. I did recover after a few months and quit all the medication for some time. I've been diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder in the past but that was while I was very psychotic and in a on and off drug use period. When I'm clean from drugs I'm somehow ""normal"" and don't have any borderline symptoms so I question if I have it at all. I'm really sensitive, anxious and caring for people but the opposite when I'm psychotic that's why it's really confusing for psychiatrist and they have a hard time telling me what mental ilness I have.
After the last major psychosis I had one little psychosis after a night of booze with friends but it went away when I took my old anti psychotic. Didn't continue the use of it whatsoever. 

Now I have a newborn baby since a month, and had a psychosis a hour before my wife was giving birth WITHOUT drugs (this is new.) I could talk myself out of it somehow but didn't recover because of the extreme lack of sleep I had because of the newborn. And still have paranoia/delusions.
Now the doctor said I had to take Oxazepam to get some sleep till I could contact my psychiatrist for anti-psychotics. The psychiatrist told me that I had to take  my old Olanzapine till I could get a conversation with her and quit Oxazepam but since I started the Oxazepam I feel much worse then before, depressed which I hadn't been in a while. Then I started the Olanzapine but that made it more worse, I only took 2.5 mg which is quite low but I feel extremely tired, extreme brainfog and can't function at all. So I started the Oxazepam again since that was more bareable. I always feel a lot better WITHOUT medication and always stop taking it after a while because of this. 

Now my question: Do you guys think this is schizophrenia? They always thought the psychosis were becasue of the drug use but they get also triggered by stress/lack of sleep. This is new for me and I'm afraid I'll have schizophrenia and will be put on medication.
Are there any medications out there that don't cause extreme tiredness/brain fog but energy and better mood or is that imppossible?

PS: Sorry for the confusing wall of text, I can't think really straight right now and english isn't my first language.

schizophrenia,alittlewhitehouse,2018/01/14,"Not sure if I'm hearing voices I've been diagnosed and undiagnosed with schizoaffective. I think right now I am not currently diagnosed, though I am on a large dose of antipsychotics.

I never thought I heard voices before but before I go to sleep my brain gets this explosion of words and phrases that I did not hear during the day. I figured it was my brain trying to process things.

It's boring things like ""Check the back room at Payless for shoes."" I don't work at Payless or work at all and I don't need shoes. It can be a number of things, but that's just an example.

I'm pretty sure it's just my brain trying to file, but wanted your non-medical opinion about it.

schizophrenia,DrizzlyEarth175,2018/01/14,"Text/words changing? Visual hallucination? Dyslexia? Not schiz but do have a disorder which includes psychotic symptoms. Rarely, but it happens. 

Anyway ever since I turned like 17, reading has become not harder, but more tedious. I mean even as a kid I'd do that thing where you can't tell where one line ends and the next one begins in a book or paragraph of printed text, so you end up reading the same line several times. But now that I'm an adult like I said, reading has become tedious. Words flip around now. In weird ways. 

For example there'll be one line which contains the word ""dog"" and then not quite below it will be the word ""wall"", and my brain will take the L from wall and the ""og"" from dog and make ""log"".

Example: dog

            wall

=log, make sense?

Probably not but that's the best way I can describe it. Well just now I read the title of a post on /r/space which basically said ""Cosmos renewed for 2nd season, Neil Degrass Tyson returns."" And I read it as ""Cosmos removed for 2nd season, Neil Degrass Tyson warns."" Now normally I would be like ""Yeah just my brain doing that weird thing again"" but I dunno it seemed kinda paranoid in nature. I didn't feel paranoid though I was like interested. Like ooh big exciting shit going on fuck yeah. 

I dunno. I dunno if I'm even dyslexic or not but psychosis is a concern of mine. So yeah just wondering if I should be wary.

schizophrenia,prinsmacsa,2018/01/14,"Wanting to be sick is a schizophrenia symptom? I don't want to make it long, it's just a question.. 

So if someone has schizophrenia symptoms but instead of the normal, healthy reaction (so instead of asking for help, talking about the symptoms and wanting to be healthy and recovered) he wants more of it because of some kind of deep, inexplicable desire. Ahh, it's hard to describe... Well this person almost enjoys the sickness and the illness and sometimes he feels that he's totally healthy and he's just faking the symptoms because he enjoys it. 

I mean of course he can't enjoy the nightmares and the shits but somehow, sometimes those things are almost feels good for him.",8.090368663594468,8.324421677419355,7.1153456221198175,75.60016129032263,62.064516129032256,8.376036866359447,41.10138248847926,7.447530270364453,3.4236834101382487,544,29,88,4,7,166,73,124,0.132,0.655,0.213,0.9343,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,0,9,8,1,0,9,0,7,8,1,1,1,27,16,11,0,7,5,0,3,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,9,6,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,3,3,6,13,14,3,2,0,0,0,0,12,1,1,6,1,61,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944603196769365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13745399902879885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17925728552614273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14868643323224792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12332250292913324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13171076369954826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855168090061284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15311000676885678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13011767733764915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09814423550529344,0.0,0.0,0.16015970153310566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14405901747462824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12838166882934726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16470820396888902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15092505681400686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245787638705583,0.0,0.2908345446373445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6112854098538361,0.0,0.11817782950667137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09768076490459587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3468904240803619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13219839375394116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Beagus,2018/01/14,"I’m planning on reaching out to an old friend from my childhood who I was told is suffering with severe untreated schizophrenia. Any tips on interacting with him and what I should expect? So an old friend from high school contacted me to catch up and during our conversation I was informed that one of my close friends from my teenage years had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had been dealing with paranoid delusions that the FBI was monitoring him and that he was being stalked by a group of priests who wanted to abduct him and rape him. I guess he currently has a job so it sounds like his symptoms haven’t fully prevented him from being a functioning member of society, but he’s still refusing treatment and his symptoms are prevalent.

This friend has been trying to reach me for a few years now but I never got around to getting back to him. Hearing what has become of him I feel strongly I should reach out. That’s the least I can do. I just feel unprepared and would greatly appreciate input from those of you familiar with this disease. How do I respond to any delusional statements he might make?

From what I hear, he’s pretty lucid when it comes to talking about when we were kids. That’s a topic that can be discussed without any comments about gangstalking or FBI surveillance popping up.",7.755485008818347,8.094917967078192,6.815499706055263,77.11379629629631,62.74485596707819,9.741211052322164,36.69870664315109,9.424239791934726,3.3999126396237522,1058,47,185,17,14,322,143,243,0.048,0.835,0.117,0.931,2,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,2,1,0,2,12,9,1,0,9,0,27,4,0,2,1,39,39,15,0,5,5,0,2,1,4,4,3,3,0,1,16,18,0,2,4,0,0,2,3,2,0,1,12,5,28,7,36,20,2,23,1,1,0,1,38,9,0,3,13,139,44,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28367381224530186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12378289272071305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069199275272427,0.0,0.0,0.1535684511008233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11977821026659832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14335318479367884,0.0,0.14113158299880094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14061448049176548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4297149646899765,0.0,0.07264724762379055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112100103368821,0.15330176893726044,0.15317790577154924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31343615775431705,0.0,0.0,0.1469126685588234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379844568628616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06793220944174727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09281613923229948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14750878005717272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10724298989358537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29181660456208025,0.0,0.0942230507721194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14146259644728867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14072478707773306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15708554079342896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11104453394977014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28904984291515906,0.0,0.11176214090608057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328670664495077,0.0,0.09440499304951976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08201457205822782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13403806029316628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987762625846375,0.0,0.0,0.17908570863605155

well you can die in other ways, such as in an accident or by disease, or by having someone else kill you. if you get someone else to kill you they could get in trouble unless you force them to as self-defence or if they are a police officer

you can also separate yourself from your entire life in other ways. you can do something to make sure you get sent to prison forever. it would have to be something really horrid and irredeemable though, and your dignity would be just in pieces. the last part doesnt matter as much though as you'll never see any of the people you have ever known again",6.567260273972603,6.137652130136987,6.722020547945206,79.37426369863014,65.36986301369863,9.765753424657532,30.578767123287676,9.188382445141503,2.4149616438356167,585,18,114,9,8,188,91,146,0.204,0.7440000000000001,0.052000000000000005,-0.9804,0,0,3,0,0,1,16.0,0,12,3,0,9,7,2,0,6,0,18,1,0,1,3,24,27,17,4,8,8,0,1,1,0,4,1,0,0,0,4,3,0,1,2,0,0,1,2,4,1,0,1,2,18,3,22,19,3,15,0,0,1,0,16,7,0,6,6,89,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182963882634062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005947691872061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12351205149453608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810689362817856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15352385881329098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24714642385607186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338075579887853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07479584261315071,0.10567838138384518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3091409692967334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32731645785538355,0.0,0.0,0.12057945330430178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448452572150953,0.07226918348663344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874176994716984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874264851585096,0.0,0.1140896693625243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16018946913248566,0.0,0.10255327969108052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18953039817782366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178778893948028,0.0,0.1543191049097451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2506744808613033,0.3416420417697309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12367278008200285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16180706132136236,0.0,0.13941852735843122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2906731358106366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08725060181851399,0.2348335855480171,0.0,0.0,0.13300326113124586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2101648070485442,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,silentecko929,2018/01/14,"Advice on being a supportive partner I am not afflicted by this disease, but my girlfriend might be. She has shared with me that she hears voices, that they say cruel things to her, and she suffers from a lot of anxiety if we are in public place. We recently took a vacation for New Years, and she had a difficult time at the airport on the way back home. She kept hearing voices, that crowds just seemed to multiply to her giving her a lot of anxiety. I just did what I could and played her favorite movie and held her while she watched it, and it passed. 

She’s currently seeing a councilor, has an appointment with a psychologist and should get an actual diagnosis soon. 

However, sometimes she gets very distant from me, saying she’s not sure about the relationship because things get overwhelming for her, and only for a week later tell me how much she loves me and how happy she is with me. 

Recently, she had a breakdown in my car over a disagreement, she ended up punching, kicking the door and dashboard, throwing the food and drinks all over inside. We’ve only been “officially” dating for a little over a week. But we’ve been involved for around 5 months. 

My question is how can I be supportive? Or qualm her anxieties about the relationship? I care and love her deeply, she didn’t choose this and I’m not going to walk away.

As a small child I never liked other people &amp; would always play quietly by myself &amp; but all the things I'd see, hear, or feel would be fun &amp; I was never intensely angry or sobbing as is my current per usual.

I think it's neat how it could have been an easier thing to cope with if I had been treated better growing up.",7.370099009900991,6.079234128712872,7.9434455445544545,74.09041584158419,64.14851485148515,10.852277227722773,34.061386138613855,9.888512548439397,3.180756831683169,401,14,76,7,5,134,77,101,0.13,0.6409999999999999,0.229,0.9142,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,1,10,1,0,4,0,11,2,1,1,3,16,17,9,0,4,5,0,1,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,8,1,0,0,3,1,0,1,3,3,0,0,5,5,8,7,11,8,2,12,0,1,1,0,2,3,2,3,9,52,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13064614086423545,0.6804875522245618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13109803904296088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388639069624282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253609017480755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938972898999876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08203202515916999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17696336488786396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11090186153235147,0.07670788496904453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.242193887114706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10885200028856876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12511783230209986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16117004218600714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11113354352542014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4172458392998688,0.10060662545326356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17292597812850918,0.1295509260521877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22307292079206734,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Biggun67,2018/01/15,"Seeing a therapist for the first time in in 15 years. What to do/expect? I have Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar type. I’m already seeing a psychiatrist and she suggested seeing a therapist could be beneficial for me. I’m not exactly sure what I’m supposed to talk about. Talking to my psychiatrist is easy since it’s very fact and science based which is the way my mind works. Last time I saw a therapist was in high school and that was somewhat forced, so I really didn’t get much out of it. 

I guess my question is: do you build up trust first or do you just dive right in with the heavy stuff? I’m not really sure where to start. Do they usually ask questions or prefer the patient just ramble as they listen? Sorry if the questions seem vague. I’m not even sure what to ask here, much less what to expect in a session.

schizophrenia,Lostforfartoolong,2018/01/16,"I'm scared, and need to write what happened. Hello guys, throwaway account for reasons, but I really need to write this out and see what other people think....

Last night I had a really scary uhm ""encounter"", for lack of a better word, and i'm really getting worried this will all start getting worse. Last night as I was laying in bed attempting to fall asleep, I heard a girl arguing outside my door, at first I said to myself ""Probably just mom"" that's when I realized it's not her voice, and she's asleep across the house. It was a girl probably close to my age, in her 20's, I couldn't make out anything she was yelling, just that she was very angry. This all happened in a matter of seconds, but my head is playing it out like it was 5 minutes. After it happened I realized this is the same voice I heard call my name twice earlier this week, which only made it harder for my to fall asleep.

As for a little background; I developed Depression and Anxiety after my father passed away when I was 9, my mom was an alcoholic and not the best, but she's gotten better. Uh I recently just went through my first break up, a 4 1/2 year relationship, we were co-dependent according to him, and I had to move back to my home state due to not being able to handle it mentally. I've been on the same meds for like 7 years, and I don't think they work anymore honestly but I cope as best as I can.

blah I really don't know, thank you for reading this if you did. If you want to ask me anything, go ahead i'm just extremely lost. PM me, ask here, doesn't matter. Thanks.

After years of suffering and not telling anyone because i didn't want anyone to think i was ""crazy"" i finally had a pretty severe meltdown and ended up pouring out the truth to my parents and doctors and was diagnosed with Schizophrenia.

schizophrenia,Scooby12m,2018/01/16,"Something is in my head Hello. I used to be OK and slowly getting better but it seems to have stopped now. Today I have felt there's something in my brain. It's controlling me. It controls my actions and I'm just a passenger. I just watch as it controls My actions. I feel like the only way to stop it is to dig it out of my brain. Either dig it out or kill it by smashing my head. I know this makes no sense logically. But it feels real. It has to be real. I have an appointment with my Dr in 10 days but I have his number. I don't know if I should call him and try to move up my appointment or just try to power through it. I'm scared I might get worst though, I just started university again and today was my first day. I can't get like this before. I just can't.

schizophrenia,lunarmood,2018/01/16,"Life update Hey,

deleted all my comments and posts on here so I'd just like to say I was a member of this community even if no one here remembers me. But I am having an off day and thought I'd come here to share.

I just received a diagnosis of schizophrenia for the second time. I mean if you say you're delusional, hallucinating, and paranoid over and over that's what you get. Not sure what my experience actually falls under except that schizophrenia is a large tent.

I feel really alone. That's why I'm posting. Please let me know that there is comfort. I got so used to the easy/good life of being in what I'll call normality/hypomania that I forgot how it feels on the other side. 

I trust no one.

Here's an article I found on someone caring for a person with schizophrenia. It didn't jive with me as she made him out to be hopeless and disconnected but eh. At least it mentioned race, my painful obsession.

[https://thenewinquiry.com/crazy-in-love/](https://thenewinquiry.com/crazy-in-love/)


So how goes it?


I want to jump out of a window as how can I live in my mixed up world for another day. How can I , confused and alone , impact the world. And if my goal is just to consume and live happy hasn't that gone on for long enough for it to end. No point in suffering if there isn't some end achievement. I don't need to see the light and roses once again. I don't need to see the sadness once again.

schizophrenia,JsnAnsark,2018/01/17,"I would appreciate your input. Hey, well. I wound up here because im worried I have schizophrenia. I would very much appreciate your input because you know whats going on.
So first I would like to say im a woman 25 years old. And I have diagnosed BPD and my uncle is schizophrenic plus my cousin committed suicide at 30, he had some untreated mental issues. 
So when I was 15 i started getting treated for depression and then I started having like this terrible paranoia that people want to hurt me and like I completely lost touch with reality. I was like pretty sure I live in a simulation and that nothing is real. I abandoned myself, didn’t shower for a month. I stopped school completely I couldnt get out of the house nothing. And on top of that I had this like I saw faces like going around my head and everyone was yelling alike alot of voices. 
So then I started eating antipsychotics. And i had a wierd psyhiatrist I have no idea what diagnose I got. Then I got okay and I didnt have such intense troubles anymore. 
So then again shit happened a couple years ago and I was suicidal and I got back to psyhiatrists and they wanted to put me in a hospital and I refused so i got out of it somehhow. But honestly I can’t even remember what was happening at that time. 

So like right now Im like paranoid when I go outside that people want to hurt me. Like I watch around people and their faces and what they think. And when the door bell rings I get scared shitless who it is and if they came to hurt me, so i dont even open the doors. There was a time I was hiding in my apartment. 
And im like pretty sure my phone is somehow like reading my mind and all the messengers and facebooks im like the government is spying on me so im afraid to write stuff on the internet. I do have some like wierd toughts in my head telling me stuff. But I know its in my mind. So I don’t know.
I know something is wrong with me and I will go to a psyhiatrist again, but the waiting is very long to get treated so I decided to share my toughts here. 

Im afraid i will end up like my uncle he is very very sick. 
So what do you think about that?

Thank you so much for reading all this, I really really appreciate any comments, and your time.

schizophrenia,jakeinmn,2018/01/17,"Three times now, they all said I'd be released in a year, but as I practiced this one thing I was released within a few days. Edit: I got a few direct PMs asking for more help. I can only offer anedoctal advice. If it's serious, talk to your doctor especially you're feeling symptomatic.

The last time I was in an ICU was a few years ago... and the orderlies saw my state of mind and compared it with timelines for release.

They thought that I'd be in for several months before treatment started to take hold. Without going into it, its very uncommon for them to be so pessimistic. They told my family, to ""prepare themselves for an emotional 12 months"".

This was the third time this was said to them.

The last time was back when I was finishing university stressing out and coping with it by partying instead of studying. Every time was the same: stress out about a test, do nothing about it, and fail to prioritize basic necessities like eating or sleeping over studying.

It wasn't a pretty sight.

However, the one thing I did do right was practicing mindfulness and productivity journaling effectively. No, I don't mean just shutting your eyes or journaling stream-of-mind into pages in a journal. This was a daily and structured habit that was built and maintained in the first 20 minutes of the day.

This is what helped me ""reboot"".

Let me explain.

Mindfulness isn't really talked about as often as it should be here. The effects of consistent 20-minute daily sit create as much stability as an antidepressant and as much serotonin as a 5-minute walk. 

As someone that really appreciates this sub and is heavy into self-development, I am outlining this to help return back to the community.

Anyway...

The method is completed as the first thing of your day. Do it right when you wake up. To take on this habit would be considered one of the best habits you can do. 

Its very simple.

When you wake up, get off the bed and sit down on the ground and meditate by just focusing on your breathing for 20 minutes.

Thats it.

If you want me to complicate things without you mastering the art of just ""breathing for 20 minutes"" let me expand on that.

Set a phone to ring in 20 minutes and commit to it. Obviously wake up earlier if time is an issue for you.

First thing you do, is just sit and close your eyes, count to 10 with every normal full breath. Inhale, exhale 1. Inhale, exhale: 2, etc.

What you could do is Exhale for 4 seconds, hold for four seconds, inhale for four seconds, and hold for 4 seconds, and repeat. Its an even box/square pattern.

Once I'm done meditating, I get up and reflect on my emotions and my tasks for the day and week. I have all of this up on Trello, which is a free ""sticky note"" organization app.

[I made a clean ""to-do"" board with examples that you can copy and use yourself.](https://trello.com/b/THpVVugf/daily-journaling)

I did not have Trello (or knew where I was) when I was in the ICU, but I did have the habit. I sat down and meditated. The orderlies came in and asked me what I was doing: I said I'm meditating. They were relieved to see that I wasn't comatose.

I got a pad of paper, and kept a journal. Wrote down my emotions as a short 1-2 sentences, what I was going to do that day in the ICU. There were a lot of activities and group events. The orderlies were really glad to see me document my thoughts in a structure. 

Within 3 days, they changed their 12 months to end of the week. By the 5th day, I was released.

I know that this will work for you as it helps anyone.

schizophrenia,RektMyAnus,2018/01/17,"I want to look for online tests and to better understand my disorder. I will be visiting a therapist about this. In the mean time, I'm looking for information and tests that can help me understand my disorder.

I don't have any positive symptoms of schizophrenia. I do have the main defining negative symptom of my illness that's mental fatigue, and it turns into anxiety, which seems to worsen in the evenings as my mind becomes more active and then overwhelmed. The symptoms I currently experience in the evenings are probably not illness-related, but more damage from improper tapering from sertindole 4mg (1/8 taper + caffeine, sent me to the psych unit). They are coldness in feet, legs, hands, feeling of fainting, sometimes colors will be more contrastlike (very mild), breathing not feeling right/imagined lack of breath, waking up 2-3 times each night, always having dreams, high chances of parasomnias (sleep paralysis, stopped breathing, snoring while awake), increased feelings of hunger after eating (not due to a med change). I seem to get worse any time I overexert myself mentally or drink caffeine, which I'm avoiding. Overexertion being trying to change too many things at once, trying to be perfect, playing stressful video games (PvP strategy is hell).",9.877083333333337,10.403085875000002,8.365185185185188,67.14833333333333,58.30555555555557,11.274074074074075,43.925925925925924,10.864195022040775,5.2577481481481465,1023,56,146,22,12,310,152,216,0.153,0.722,0.125,-0.8182,1,1,1,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,1,2,4,9,1,3,8,0,15,17,8,0,1,26,31,9,0,2,5,0,4,0,0,2,6,0,0,0,7,6,3,2,9,5,0,3,5,6,0,0,1,8,15,3,28,24,7,21,1,3,3,0,6,8,1,3,10,94,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925952777706046,0.0,0.0,0.16224371179389185,0.0,0.09125715938168144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13174735089482506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550304616109447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523877640945037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2734352549373153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11685960011688228,0.0,0.12206430134243187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15758093794465286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166893230640378,0.0,0.0,0.18095108568308185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062324535772982526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995812963425462,0.12603731272126295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20034850814826013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12094217943632428,0.0,0.12994268652081362,0.13250522130959766,0.0,0.24043420076458524,0.0,0.1204497335543088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11194636413185212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704084203408733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286156922520551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187371808096307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21719578501274828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11937698164702172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11798168235042047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09973247640258898,0.13664724413844934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719665478910991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385058494042589,0.07925152764153674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2086783290143617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16198128790597566,0.12975416915955346,0.0,0.2483719246662425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842742891566914,0.07036082298147454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215675483296522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,TheBananaGuitarHERO,2018/01/17,"Body sensations Hi, I wanted to ask if anyone else gets weird bodily sensations at all.
My wife tells me they're probably my brain making me feel it when literally nothing is happening in reality.

Like when I'm learning something new like an instrument or practicing something like math, I can feel my brain tingle inside my skull because I'm gaining knowledge.
Another example, when I focus too much on my internal body I can feel the blood going through my body and it feels like bugs skittering through my insides.

Does anyone else experience this?
Any weird sensations you get?",7.374725274725272,8.893222076923083,7.5639010989010975,67.29538461538462,63.80769230769231,11.712087912087913,37.93406593406594,11.491704259439757,5.097768131868131,472,24,73,15,7,153,72,104,0.032,0.845,0.123,0.8677,0,0,2,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,0,1,4,6,0,0,2,0,3,8,7,1,1,12,16,6,0,2,2,1,4,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,4,14,4,6,16,2,8,0,0,0,0,5,3,0,2,8,37,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849689567458852,0.15187849276751708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20255249032982384,0.29681358928646084,0.0,0.0,0.1354068500785959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829377303765805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4826573362516376,0.0,0.3233810760212118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126751398048612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419922598718499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14168236109856552,0.0,0.0,0.29294399167218016,0.10347449067508588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15134696390075394,0.0,0.08231651900000905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280824814979497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28304812601631585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09668254017374447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10647485344204603,0.0,0.0,0.13988840976110795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13897891483187394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15616317306594796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22301146681973055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659748093147538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08543101688389013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,misskittypickles,2018/01/17,"When did you become self aware that auditory hallucinations (voices) were not real? My step daughter is 15 and went into acute psychosis on December 1st. She is currently in recovery and has been on an antipsychotic and another medication to treat anxiety and depression. I understand that recovery is based on the individual and that medications can take a while to really kick in. She is still hearing voices and talks to herself, but not as much as she did. She has been told that she is schizophrenic and what her symptoms are. She has no recollection of the psychosis. Her cognition and working memory are impaired but slowly improving. 

She is not aware that the voices she hears and talks to are a hallucination. She believes she has a psychic link to people that she knows and is communicating with them.  She describes it as a “psychic group chat”. For those of you that suffer from this type of delusion/hallucination, is there a point where you realized you were suffering from an illness? 

I’ve read that only 50% of people with this diagnosis have the insight that they are sick. I believe it’s still too soon to tell if she will achieve this insight and self awareness, but I have hope. I’m curious if there was a turning point where you became self aware regarding your illness?

schizophrenia,grokkingStuff,2018/01/17,"I'm designing an activity to simulate schizophrenic voices for NTs. What would you like to see? Hi there!

I'm a college student designing an activity that's similar to (this article that simulates voices)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005017] while engaging students in different tasks like playing cards &amp; sudoku puzzles. The aim of the activity is to show participants what schizophrenia might be like and to increase awareness. I'm also getting a friend to record voices that are specific to the action they do (for example saying ""Draw that card"" when they choose to not pick up a card.)

While I'm not schizophrenic myself, I've been interested in schizophrenia for a while (I'm on the autism spectrum and schizophrenia is kinda the opposite of autism but show symptoms that are similar on the outside.)

How would you like to see such an activity conducted? I'd love to hear your opinion.",7.5885497835497855,10.109342292207801,7.038376623376621,67.45851731601732,64.3896103896104,10.847619047619046,37.50865800865801,10.864195022040775,4.942161904761905,739,38,108,22,12,230,90,154,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.962,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,3,2,0,5,9,0,0,13,0,10,4,0,2,0,14,20,9,0,2,3,0,0,4,1,3,3,4,0,0,8,2,0,0,1,3,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,6,6,9,20,15,1,11,0,0,2,1,10,5,0,4,8,70,14,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935273498388736,0.0,0.2622069493914073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2528385416192841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869686357009797,0.0,0.12643503616822668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272751640552995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4729159955093542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21841449037485108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2567238064990645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.192448150231996,0.0,0.0,0.3856854105871784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515307085868885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34381977957719817,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,MikeWa13,2018/01/17,"Help Need Advice with Persecutory Delusions I need advice from people who have gone through similar symptoms and experiences. 

I am experiencing the following:

When traveling alone I panic easily about being robbed/kidnapped/murdered.

I easily fantasize about organized crime pursuing me.  I have become racist in the sense that I panic when I see certain minority men, I suffer from a constant feeling of impending harm.

Constant insecurity-feeling that someone will steal my things(computer, TV, etc). When living alone I have to sleep with lights on, because I feel someone is in the dark. I block doors with objects.

If I am traveling I tend to sleep with lights on because I feel someone will try to steal my things(money).

 Any advice will be appreciated.

schizophrenia,vramp,2018/01/17,"Hospitalization and things I can take Two months ago I was put on new medication and it is not working.  I told my Psychologists that the medication is not working and I need new ones.  I see my psychiatrists on Friday and I fear she will want to commit me.  I am afraid to say no.

My last time committed was a nightmare.  They had a tv and books but I cant watch/read them due to my problems.  I spent the week walking the halls and laying in bed bored out of my mind.

What are some of the things they allowed you to bring when hospitalized?

Here are some things I want to bring but unsure if they will let me.

1:  Pillow:  I will get a new pillow tomorrow and hope they let me bring it in.  I will make sure it does not have a zipper.  Anything else I need to watch out for?

2:  Slippers or a type of shoe that does not have shoe laces.  Any suggestions.

3:  Reading material.  I like to read ""boring"" light novels and manga (think Japanese comic books).  No violence or drama type.  The ones I will bring are ones I read often but they reduce my stress and negative thoughts.

schizophrenia,Paulina1880,2018/01/17,"Hypnagogic hallucinations or stress-triggered psychosis? I'm new here...diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder about 5 or 6 years ago, but had been doing well until a particularly triggering set of events in December led to a few episodes I fear would be classified as psychotic. I'm afraid to talk to a doctor because I don't want to be labeled as crazy, and because partly I don't think I'm crazy. But these episodes scared me. The weird thing is that most of them happened at night...so I wondered if anyone else dealt with nighttime hallucinations? Mine, though, were not AT ALL like...half-dreams, or anything. They were extremely real. I would just wake up completely hallucinating. Once, I heard my husband talking and it was definitely not his voice. It was terrifying. The second time, I sat up to find a cat on the bed that looked and felt different from my two cats. The third, I woke up and saw--if this makes sense--I could see my room perfectly, but it was as if through a veil of the most amazing intricate designs. It was stunning, albeit a little scary. In the center of the designs I saw the face of the Buddha. Those episodes alone wouldn't have me afraid, but I have also started to fall back into the patterns that got me diagnosed with spd in the first place--namely, debilitating agoraphobia and paranoia in public. Plus, I heard a familiar voice in my head...a voice I used to hear when I was a kid. It's very, very deep and extremely slow. Like my thoughts are in molasses. It's not my voice, but it *is* my thoughts. If that makes sense. It sounds/feels like a tape being played realllllly slowly. Any advice would be great. Is it really that big of a deal to only hallucinate at night? (I guess I answered my own question when I said the paranoia was seeping into the day...). How do I reach out and let someone know I fear I might be psychotic without being held against my will or forced to take medication? Any advice would be helpful.

schizophrenia,apuhpleksee,2018/01/18,"Is it true the amygdala can't be shrinked? Does the amygdala enlarge during a psychotic episode? If so then that pisses me off because I was defeated on social media of all places, from observing all the crazy right vs left debates and memes the most vicious ones from racist liberal lesbians and gay American Psycho fascist types fighting (I didn't know such levels of depravity existed and my mind was creating neural pathways to mimic their thought patterns as I observed their fighting), and looking back at that episode it felt like what Jesus went through: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Michelangelo%27s_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned_edit.jpg/1200px-Michelangelo%27s_Pieta_5450_cropncleaned_edit.jpg

Is this true? Can it be fixed by compensating by enlarging the hippocampus? How is that done?

Also, remember I made a thread here a few days ago about how ""they"" are brainwashing us with movies so we are ok with never seeing a tree again, when Earth becomes a polluted waste land, and how the Russian chatter reminded me of 1984's 3 superstates battling each other? https://youtu.be/hpCgdtnMcfE Well, it just occurred to me that the scene in that movie looks like it's underwater, how lobsters live, and it makes it a point to remind us how we feel comfy on a rainy day when it's dark and cold outside.

schizophrenia,blendertricks,2018/01/18,"Help with family member showing signs Hey guys and gals,

I'm writing a little out of desperation here, looking for advice. Over the Christmas break, my wife and I went to her home town to visit family, and while there, noticed some unusual behavior from her brother. He was weirdly sensitive and easy to offend, had let his hygiene essentially disappear, and kept saying that he was tired of people telling him what to do and all of this. He's in his mid-20s, however, and my wife believed he was just trying to stake his claim to adulthood or something. I felt like this didn't adequately explain it, but she knows him better. He also spent the entire time smoking weed and engaging in fierce, nonsensical debates with their mom's boyfriend, who has some serious social disorders and is always self-medicated, himself, to deal with anxiety. 

Her brother was also very unhelpful, which is odd, and didn't want to spend any time with us, which is even stranger. 

Fast-forward to last weekend. He called my wife and spent a long time sort of just talking *at* her. He was asking her if she remembered this or that person, saying things about what people were thinking that he couldn't have known, and saying vague things about how he has to go back home and do man stuff. He apparently called many other people that same day and was just as worryingly vague and incomprehensible. Well, yesterday, he disappeared. He hadn't gone to work in two days, took off in his car, and at some point called an old high school friend from a random phone number. He had abandoned his car in a ditch, along with all his identification, phone, and keys, and says he is going to Los angeles to see another old high school friend. Nobody heard from him after that until late last night, when he called his mother from a California number and said he is back in Flagstaff where he lives, but also said he's in California, and that he needs to get to nebraska to have intercourse. He also said some things about how there is energy after him back in Flagstaff,and and started talking about numbers lining up and how it's all starting to come together.  He ended the conversation saying a truck was turning around to pick him up. Evidently, he's hitchhiking. 

I think he has schizophrenia. He's been a little off-kilter for months now, but he's now fully delusional. My wife and I live in Texas, and her mom lives in Iowa. They were going to wait until the morning to file a missing persons report, but I insisted my wife do so immediately. We have no way to know where he is, but at this rate, it's not unlikely that he'll get himself arrested, and having that report and description in the system might save him. What in the hell else can we do? How do we safely bring him out of this, and are there things we should avoid when talking to him, if he reaches out again? Most importantly, if we can recover him, what is the next step?",8.166936913451515,7.419292195255481,7.783368091762253,74.1185401459854,62.26642335766422,10.967257559958293,33.98748696558916,10.208560254849939,3.2374705943691344,2305,79,427,43,28,731,270,548,0.079,0.846,0.07400000000000001,0.3353,2,1,1,0,0,0,74.0,6,0,2,2,33,15,2,1,16,0,42,1,0,5,3,95,77,52,0,7,14,10,1,1,2,3,1,9,2,4,29,43,0,5,9,2,3,14,6,7,1,1,26,12,44,8,71,46,9,80,2,2,2,0,107,31,1,13,33,280,73,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07323196982823509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397227729244189,0.0623573343067401,0.0,0.0,0.05096279219774925,0.07858270063444486,0.05733004501319115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06671382658939605,0.07006018936379134,0.0,0.0,0.17287617086386767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08443341133973084,0.0,0.06627966974236629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3060946159279353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0645554694455522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666213993509663,0.07726139938368735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08588945557786247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626040098464471,0.0,0.06637592823752489,0.0,0.0,0.04949815623672206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14129635965402434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195559570642389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11579923932573613,0.0,0.07830768490934581,0.0,0.12777295031000171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07420387069911373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05023171006156218,0.1583596259320365,0.1503448766284789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08237178080989684,0.1221746552373796,0.08453728011056698,0.0,0.0,0.07663276471696225,0.0,0.03661263314274527,0.1502221485869218,0.19852416160759948,0.06632087227918658,0.06293198839570223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597892196137912,0.0,0.0,0.0832431159772324,0.0,0.0,0.0795010922498895,0.0,0.1755411661827055,0.05981759306790543,0.0,0.0,0.055568175225755065,0.0,0.0,0.07970113910891505,0.0703275243085253,0.0,0.0,0.08532139838357526,0.1572770027000936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15586500742502532,0.1308720603631057,0.0,0.0,0.0708439439922055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848941144326724,0.0,0.213859593629684,0.2979824573645501,0.0,0.15168960484896776,0.059718675538256924,0.0,0.07818033223002054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639342515835043,0.0,0.05769363066424714,0.0,0.0,0.10608796372345616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579009184943018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18070542521148208,0.0655021771933246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19915121960131954,0.0960389788073647,0.0,0.0,0.13109697997100245,0.08613423387204358,0.0,0.0,0.08326276778535402,0.050880361551163794,0.08151483575610452,0.07320695944156252,0.0,0.0901454013430349,0.0,0.0,0.06183458885309885,0.04420244040055925,0.059485077196529124,0.0,0.0,0.06738141171178046,0.06947152450234721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05455830705855837,0.0761067344977747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,StoryPerhaps,2018/01/18,"There was something in my room I was awake in the middle of the night last night. I wasn't in a hypnogogic state or anything and I could move just fine. I was just laying there trying to get to sleep but still feeling fully conscious when all of a sudden all the noise is my room was muted, as if the volume was turned down, then I heard this weird clicking sound for about a minute and could feel a presence near me, like a pressure, I had a sleeping mask on and was laying on my stomach so I didn't see anything. The sound really stood out because after it stopped, I noticed that I could barely hear my bedside fan which I turn on every night and then when the presence lifted, the sound came back and I could tell that things in the past few minutes where way different than they normally are. During the time I was thinking I needed protection, but I think before the presence started I was thinking about that, and when I felt it I was thinking it should go outside and watch with some guards. I can't tell if the presence felt good or evil, just that is was strong and present. It was nothing like my normal auditory hallucinations. I never really hear anything when it's silent, only voices in other people's words, and when I'm falling asleep sometimes I'll hear whispering words, usually from the fan, but this was actually hearing it. These sounds were happening.

It it worth it to go through all of that again to find another medicine that doesn't have those side effects?",4.514181415929205,5.675959389380537,4.538219026548674,87.68396570796463,70.15044247787611,8.127876106194691,33.59402654867257,8.472884824447931,2.461390265486725,453,22,95,7,8,140,70,113,0.12,0.688,0.193,0.5756,2,0,0,0,0,1,7.0,1,0,0,1,4,5,1,0,4,0,11,2,2,1,1,12,17,8,1,2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,2,0,0,5,0,2,1,6,4,1,0,2,1,12,1,10,15,1,9,0,1,0,0,2,3,0,1,4,58,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20900377006224974,0.0,0.0,0.3953425725063643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33284674713861195,0.12150325633095782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22139892025223445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17167350730524045,0.0,0.0,0.20824635021118204,0.0,0.0,0.17442575028296994,0.0,0.23360085255179106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10078187760641366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18217432078465245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1912053308284983,0.11327780843689213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19779374918580664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954072968359836,0.16247191394867436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763913969392287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553782232342132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2251741881862268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.218023072943841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15823733954598432,0.11622474512626052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532478904984752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11756374641086485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17921207805507527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Dodgeshawndra,2018/01/18,"TDCS and Improvements of Mass Proportion Little over two months ago I had a break in reality which created almost lasting insomnia, anxiety, dissociation and a overall worsening. I put myself on Rexulti which fried my mind even more by making me so lethargic and out of it that I wasn't sure whether or not in the future I would have to turn myself off.... Ahem, Suicide.

I used a TDCS machine which can be bought online. I use a swimcap to secure the electrodes on my head.

1. TDCS rewires the brain to reconnect and synchronize different portions that are over active or under active

2. It is affordable, you can purchase it at Foc.us for $129.00

3. It works on hallucinations, negative symptoms, delusions and cognition without any side effects if done properly.


I went from my worst to almost recovering to my best. I have been doing this for 3 days only at 50% capacity and recommended power using study protocols. My hallucinations are down tremendously, paranoia down, I can watch TV better, I am doing many more things, I played Frisbee today with my friend which I have never done.

It can reduce healthcare costs in this country tremendously, get people off the streets and into housing which would save overall many billions of dollars. If people can get off medication or take less of medication that costs a lot and has indirect costs due to cardiovascular effects or metabolic effects the money could be spent elsewhere at whoever is in powers discretion. Reduce even rates of dementia as the medication we take increases the risk and god knows how expensive end of life care is in which the state has to pick up the tab.

schizophrenia,suryasusarla,2018/01/19,"A neuroscience student who probably has schizo So I'am a 3rd year neuro student in college and about 3 semesters ago I took a class on clinical schizophrenia. At the time I knew I was a schizo because I showed most of the symptoms and my grandma was diagnosed when she was 25. After taking that class and basically knowing all the neurobiology of what was going on its easy to calm yourself down after a delusion and putting you back into reality. So my advice is to read up on all the papers and scientific articles on the disease to get a full sense of what youre living with. 
Also I work in a neuro clinic lab and we do a lot of research on treatments and it looks very promising!",6.253703007518798,6.602055075187973,7.12984022556391,73.55611372180454,65.9172932330827,9.356766917293234,35.421992481203006,9.188382445141503,3.242594736842104,547,25,98,9,8,183,89,133,0.0,0.931,0.069,0.8169,1,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,1,2,0,1,6,2,0,0,13,0,7,4,0,0,2,16,14,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,6,10,0,0,2,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,1,11,2,22,8,5,22,0,0,1,0,5,12,0,2,7,76,17,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24822197214733666,0.2251702900888603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2031368936391257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19532299973066447,0.0,0.1548460933578639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25782138826309337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13271313080940586,0.0,0.14436342391363585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13960081867166607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22430121265669514,0.0,0.2133098741898335,0.0,0.0,0.21595573433860527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738727369292115,0.0,0.0,0.2553567302134168,0.0,0.0,0.2540852284180863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26402039215505896,0.19098878619561468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14811905686950244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28222166458996106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20959020531655995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18492702854858734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16357828998141025
schizophrenia,HoshiYamazaki,2018/01/19,"How is living on disability? I ask about income.  
I get about 250$ in Poland per month and I pay my father about 80$, rest is for my own usage. Yeah it's little but I don't need so much money I think.  
I will probably buy stuff that I certainly not ""must-have"" need, like new phone, CPU, 4K display etc. (from work money too).  
I hope that in future we will have better support etc.  
Since we are living in technology times. I could rent simple house if I would have enough money. I now live with my parents and I don't feel bad living with them (only that I was forced to get out of energy drinks addiction).",-0.30459383753501257,1.9533770000000032,2.0037628384687203,93.8977731092437,92.49206349206352,4.869467787114846,13.760971055088707,6.522977012572876,-0.5639275443510741,466,8,103,6,17,157,89,126,0.062,0.76,0.177,0.9383,4,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,2,0,1,2,7,6,0,0,0,1,12,2,0,1,1,19,21,6,0,6,3,2,1,1,0,3,1,0,1,0,5,7,1,0,2,1,6,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,19,5,14,16,6,11,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,2,6,65,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17042508555915353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14614942829036853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13053078964506518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13826305535405234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481847642611507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15314596068574124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16153286947941087,0.3487032751688121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904621678876803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16335415996117825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15527306871168062,0.0,0.1803862761567723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07637597686515378,0.15668585349182754,0.5521765020287079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247828061552244,0.0,0.114922095513066,0.23183657121487505,0.0,0.15098653501774698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11889762134693015,0.0,0.0,0.1735883178589663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16855246577518518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12931954460280973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17896287450305454,0.0,0.17740383639829513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10017130965350564,0.0,0.0,0.09115851597197312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1138116447801046,0.0,0.0,0.11105385218568252,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,dankeesnail,2018/01/19,"Anyone have experience with Respirdal/Respirdone? I got prescribed Respirdal, 0.5mg 2x daily today. It’s my first time taking an antipsychotic drug, this is to test a theory that I’m Paranoid Schizophrenic. If it works, then it’ll answer that question. They’re hoping it also works with my depression.

Anyone have any experience with this? I’m admittedly pretty scared. :( Reading reviews can make it seem a lot scarier than I’m sure it is, reviews on medications are ALWAYS terrible. But, be honest. I’ll take the truth, whether it’s good or bad. I just imagine this is a better place to get answers than the reviews section on pharmaceutical websites.

schizophrenia,olilollipop,2018/01/19,"What keeps you inspired / hopeful? Greetings :) I've been a long-time observer of this community but I've never wanted to intrude by posting; however, I feel the need to post today on behalf of of someone whom I love and care for dearly. Some background: My wife struggles with schizophrenia, among other things, and I want to do everything I can to support her / help ease her mental discomfort. Lately, she's been really struggling with her mental health, and I wanted to reach out for some support in terms of what keeps you guys inspired / motivated when things get kinda foggy / hopeless. I can give her all the advice in the world, but it probably doesn't help as much as it would if it were coming from someone else who deals with similar struggles. My goal is to be able to glean some helpful advice here and share it with my wife, and in turn, hopefully encourage her to join this wonderful community. I hope that I'm not intruding, and I look forward to hearing from everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read my post; it's greatly appreciated. :) ",6.898350340136055,7.557092066326533,6.974897959183675,74.14748299319731,64.56122448979592,9.798639455782316,34.1904761904762,9.725611199111238,3.3491476190476184,839,35,144,16,12,269,121,196,0.069,0.583,0.34700000000000003,0.9971,1,0,0,0,0,1,29.0,0,3,0,2,2,19,0,4,5,0,10,2,0,1,2,37,34,12,0,9,4,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,15,12,0,2,5,1,0,2,3,5,0,0,3,3,21,14,32,29,6,18,0,1,1,1,23,8,0,9,7,101,36,3,0.11136473327027308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21764865692944727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11354376763944495,0.0,0.0,0.095930856804955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11481214999262328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09303094463685743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641377507054438,0.10008744142386697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05630935527728598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058183476723857715,0.10683119981729464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12278001158252146,0.0,0.11026859467599344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11837550381659702,0.1255161481378787,0.0,0.2239362997297085,0.0,0.0,0.3318309242216447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19797218366205288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562426983521724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855428450040812,0.09351832802224552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051101974590143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2244589157432584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818658927440907,0.08257553862249599,0.08589134771606861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199698912519914,0.0,0.12007001807006293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113948701486894,0.0,0.07134309978990812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887179542153667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3492677972700511,0.0,0.0,0.25275075916661865,0.0,0.0,0.08373241990718533,0.0,0.0,0.1025296840714826,0.0,0.0,0.14797156069184642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493767154135782,0.0,0.1055607456037445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211328506098729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19705741513066005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12077030273014196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911031130490945,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Fortifiy,2018/01/19,"16 male. First major symptom, very scared. Last night i was having a realllllly hard time falling asleep which is nothing new. But it was different, i had this weird energy keeping me up. My brain thinking of all these weird scenioros and shit. Then its about 3am and im listening to the wind outside trying to doze off. I start to hear what sounded like a bunch of conversations overlapping. It was very creepy. When i tried listening i heard an old ladies voice say ""its ok sweetie"" then it just stops. I was extremely freaked out. Turned on my lights and stayed up the rest of the night i couldnt sleep i was seriously scared.

schizophrenia,h-town_legend,2018/01/19,"I'm going crazy I'm not the same person I was last year (my real happy self) idk who I am anymore it's like my personality faded away and I got stuck into my head. I rarely talk anymore, I never know what to say, the whole time I'm at school or with someone I'm constantly in my head talking to myself about either what to say or trying to find myself again. I seem to be paranoid about dumb things and I have started almost becoming the exact opposite of who I really am and I hate it so much. My confidence is pretty much gone and stuck in my head, I don't express myself anymore and feel I can't be myself something just takes over and I feel empty inside. Myself won't shut up in my head instead of talking or doing stuff I'll think about it and not do it because I'm stuck in my head and feel I'm just gonna make myself look dumb in front of people. I also won't talk to anyone unless they talk to me.man I'm just tired of all this I hate it so much I want myself back I want to feel good and not have something or someone in my head anymore all I want is me back I miss that feeling of me. I used to feel mature and now I feel as I'm a little kid who doesn't know anything. What can I do to bring me back please. Also is this schizophrenia and I got prescribed zyprexa and am going to actually start taking it everyday how has zyprexa work for yall. Sorry if this isn't the right thing to post here I just need somewhere that I can relate and get some suggestions.

schizophrenia,introvert3amity5life,2018/01/20,"Husband with schizophrenic brother So my husband has a brother with schizophrenia. My husband has taken it upon himself to help him socialize a bit, he goes out to the bar with him, where his brother mainly goes to play pool and he's the designated driver. They usually get home from 3:am to 5:something. Anyway, his brother usually spends the night, of course,in the living room. But my daughter (14) has been feeling some unwanted attention by her uncle with schizophrenia.. Her room is next to the living room. Her body of course has been changing,growing into a young lady and I was also starting to notice some extra attention towards her from him, but I didnt know how to go about it, since he has schizophrenia. I didn't want to upset him, it scared me. So I told my husband that his brother cannot spend the night here anymore. My husband said that his brother would never do something to our daughter.He wanted to just talk to him about it and to continue the same routine of every other Friday his brother spending the night. And I said, totally not! I believe that prevention is better than taking a risk. And just so you know, he is a narcissist and I'm an introvert. It's just that he makes me feel like if I'm crazy and exaggerating for acting the way I did. Please people tell me I'm not crazy. I'm just trying to take care of my daughter!

schizophrenia,awakebuthalfasleep,2018/01/21,"Slowly losing it Every day feels worse than the last in ways I have trouble comprehending. I feel as if I’m slowly losing control of myself while some other “thing” existing inside of me if forcing its control over what used to be mine. For example, each day I have this deafening foggy feeling in my head that feels exactly like a migraine without any pain. It feels parasitic, leaching things from me. I don’t hallucinate much at all, just shadows out of the corner of my eye or looming things over my bed at night while the majority of my struggles come from this foggy feeling along with extreme paranoia and irrational delusions. I don’t really feel as if this post was good or not or has any kind of part where one of you could give some sort of feedback, but after too many days of this, coming back to my dark room and just laying there angry about the terrible day I just had, I felt the need to tell someone something. I’m up to 100mgs of my meds but they don’t feel like they’re working. I should give it more time shouldn’t I?",7.840882352941175,6.55647112745098,7.578745098039218,77.0613529411765,63.21568627450979,10.316862745098039,34.615686274509805,9.120678840339163,2.8743603921568632,826,29,159,11,10,263,128,204,0.117,0.8290000000000001,0.055,-0.8945,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,1,5,8,10,0,1,6,0,12,4,2,3,2,42,29,14,0,7,13,0,9,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,14,8,0,2,9,0,0,2,6,6,0,1,3,10,21,4,33,22,8,26,0,2,1,0,5,11,0,9,13,114,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16365820652574953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925269948738181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20730874222691226,0.0,0.0,0.26992255694045914,0.09607439107267968,0.0,0.0,0.31041377009593296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138392964142777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4867431400879366,0.0859643821719902,0.1155364849036406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308646289873579,0.0,0.10092780661680978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234941659546723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530606164509692,0.0,0.0980857018266671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11757514880810513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26923887994080536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12199659364924237,0.0,0.0,0.1336604459738618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08845701905158079,0.0892237994149514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11292234982993755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08153929709282719,0.0,0.12804050670057296,0.0,0.0,0.13030658270981338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152436902910855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07708702276101745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10195593739866116,0.09263656596593108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12579592942243406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105174465337329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398274065878725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016588540303698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10392721807197064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551302655528034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159946438841563,0.0,0.08760229080108316,0.0,0.12262741471692765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Yoluctku,2018/01/21,"Schizoaffective Disorder Fuck everything that you know. Fuck being normal. Fuck having a passion. Because this is what this disorder will do to you. It'll flip your whole world upside down and make you feel like the most abnormal outcast in the world. Want to be normal again? Better pray to God that the cow fattening pills do their work. Most likely not. You'll just be doped up and feel like a hollow shell of yourself. You'll constantly question yourself, wonder why this is happening to you and most definitely become 10x more self aware. Did I mention you'll hate your life? Everything will be a struggle. And when you catch a glimpse of that normality that you used to take for granted, that'll be your world. Because you'll think there's hope. Some recover, some don't. I doubt I will. I have a chemical imbalance and none of my medications ever make little to any difference.

schizophrenia,SzStarsEatArt,2018/01/21,"Sz bullshit from a few months ago is saving me from recent Sz bullshit. Been having a hard time drinking water lately. My husband just changed our water filter, and I swear the new one is full of bugs. Every time I tried to drink water from it, I was hit with the overwhelming sensation of my mouth being full of bugs. Soon, this translated to ANY liquid I tried to drink. Milk, Sprite, soup, anything. 

Then we remembered a few months ago when I was paranoid that we were going to run out of water. I had filled jugs of water and hid them in the back of the closet ""just in case."" We never emptied those jugs.

Finally, something I can drink! For some reason, I don't get bugs in my mouth from that water. Hopefully, my head will be back on straight by the time I run out of water jugs.",3.534075268817201,5.010692122580647,4.216532258064518,87.83813172043011,72.93548387096773,6.715053763440863,23.23924731182796,7.1686216300943375,0.7987311827956987,609,16,122,6,12,194,92,155,0.091,0.8690000000000001,0.04,-0.7766,0,0,5,0,0,0,23.0,4,0,1,0,6,3,0,1,8,0,13,15,3,1,1,16,17,4,0,1,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,5,8,12,0,2,4,0,4,2,1,0,1,5,1,19,2,24,8,5,30,0,1,0,0,6,9,0,2,17,85,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2700820719908347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10359705123487337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12536359885954396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2342815317860309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16115649622938302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5969444286863879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12835379754455836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668820341399304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795918443220238,0.0,0.08657885690625336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13646754367699884,0.0,0.15634573675474348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513089096138112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17184719598739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24319414170859685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11749471088624365,0.14713181216456647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10323015164231453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15663184058719162,0.15041828233877425,0.0,0.17257256800794327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727948477897247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26649365085990945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2068589727977106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,aPsychopedia,2018/01/21,"TIFU in an ice skating rink by proclaiming myself as a perverted child rapist who hits his own mum It happened a few years ago when I went through a psychotic episode before I could realize that I was going through one. All of a sudden, I found myself heavily loaded with random, bizarre thoughts when I stood still in a public session in a rink. I started shouting to my reflection in the glass, accusing myself of crimes I didn’t do by playing a game of creative word association. 

Agreeing to hospitalization, I was being observed by the medical staff for a few days. I made up detailed stories about how I murdered people, how I stole from my workplace, etc to convince others that I was a filthy criminal who was guilty of his crimes. Since the plots I claimed were somewhat inconsistent, exaggerated and absurd, the doctors concluded that I was suffering from *delusional guilt*. I would also like to call that a messiah complex because I had the thought that God’s salvation plan was only halfway completed and that I was one of those human beings being chosen to be responsible for the redemption of the fallen angels’ sin. 

In my recovery stage, a nurse told me that it was okay to go back to the rink and enjoy skating. I did what I was told but was immediately laughed at and sworn at. Obviously, the story had been spread across real quick. With the recently globally prevailing #MeToo campaign, I guess I’m going to meet a lot more haters.

schizophrenia,korbakopter,2018/01/22,"employment paranoia hi.

korba has been blessed with a job at a small company for 4-5 months now. the pay is not spectacular but korba was happy with it, considering that he's a schizo with people skills of a brick.

the first months were somewhat stressful but korba adapted and he feels OK with the work, the people and his situation in general.

and now a much better offer has become available. but that would mean working at an office, with actual co-workers.

korba is scared - he has been living almost completely isolated from normies for many years. korba doesn't feel strong enough. fears of fucking up and ending up unemployed again plague korba's fuzzy brain.

because all korba has been able to think about these past few days was - they will torture korba's fragile psyche with doom and riddles and confusion. and then they will laugh at him and kick him around until korba breaks (that's what normies do - they mess with you until you break).

schizophrenia,EgaTehPro,2018/01/22,"Not sure what I have, but need help. Voices with no relation to me in my head. Hi Reddit. First off, I've read the sticky post and I did not come up with a conclusion to my case, so I'd love if anyone could help. I'm 15 years old and have been diagnosed to have GAD and depression for 2+ years. I have been prescribed 100mg Zoloft for well over a year. It's come to my attention more in the past few weeks that I often talk to myself and/or others in my head. Sometimes it's as I wake up, sometimes it's in the middle of the day. Sometimes it will be me speaking to someone I know or even someone I don't know, but more often it's other people talking and I'm just listening: I'm not even in my mind anymore, it's just these two people talking about random stuff that I honestly have no idea how it got in my head. It's like my mind is a conference room and people just congregate to speak to each other there about anything. I've never been told to do anything by these voices, so I don't think I'm crazy, it's just been getting on my nerves recently. Any time I try to focus on the conversation it just goes away -- that is what I think is the most annoying thing to me since I can never really remember any of it once I notice I'm doing it.

Another thing that was brought to my attention (and this is something I've been doing for over 4yr) is that when I'm watching a movie or video I find myself quietly repeating words that are said. If I'm not doing that, I'm making a humming noise in the same pitch of their talking or just weird noises in my mouth that almost resemble a throat kick (a common sound in beatboxing). This could be completely unrelated, but I wasn't able to find anything online about this so I was wondering if anyone here had any answers or know anything of it.

None of these things are 24/7, but they definitely happen daily. I notice it and can't seem to stop. Any advice or anything really is much appreciated. Thank you. :)",4.010862354892204,4.678286985074628,5.274875621890548,83.76307628524049,70.94029850746269,8.542620232172473,26.33167495854063,8.735056554316923,1.7307903814262018,1536,46,322,26,27,513,191,402,0.049,0.841,0.109,0.9798,0,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,2,2,21,9,1,0,14,0,36,9,6,2,3,67,64,25,0,6,22,0,0,1,0,1,2,8,1,0,37,12,0,1,15,2,0,3,13,3,1,2,14,9,35,6,46,45,8,39,0,1,1,1,17,19,0,15,17,223,72,1,0.08615614499911019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419078775938,0.0,0.0,0.08627293398724843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343565320779792,0.09034223012423494,0.0,0.0,0.0854437449923494,0.12048475962705575,0.0,0.3544958317747907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809465343135286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1484317802605969,0.09033307884231287,0.0,0.0,0.13757734238493088,0.0,0.0,0.055563586004384144,0.0,0.07420616144189764,0.08744667360149205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11381064242791328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15749031135803335,0.07328437292335603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04501302979828657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06890693966941837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07618759448767477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26526318245256314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549729579862145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725980074198308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14204749234099626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042091540531584204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07775928462217988,0.0,0.057509895800336136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17398629218594566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06333467982744431,0.06388368983629088,0.1328978607623518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19617868424114224,0.09040638115301487,0.09175348259166234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822457891726609,0.179189468616138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251377115096913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0861794600755299,0.0,0.1103876652812144,0.0,0.08506879923184278,0.0,0.09759811714727287,0.0,0.08195422345283787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07843331860868205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126925345630036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459996441409759,0.06632720962872331,0.2556318912331297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203039503605463,0.0,0.0,0.09862817334688596,0.0,0.0,0.08120114704556705,0.0,0.0,0.2769961832540637,0.0,0.07932100287204281,0.0,0.0,0.17171494329050388,0.11041075776553776,0.0,0.0,0.0502383409983459,0.0,0.0,0.08232588868713084,0.0,0.05849436701650699,0.0,0.08416203468662957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06910926265973244,0.0,0.07746472129125616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093432664076447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16644519791776613
schizophrenia,catstache678,2018/01/22,"Update on The Bench I don't know how to preface this... but. Hi, I'm a friend of /u/ArktheRedKing. I know that he is very active on here, and last night I was alerted about what was happening. I tried my best, and it felt fruitless. Doing what I did was scary, I didn't want to lose my best friend. So, I wanted to give you an update. I contacted the appropriate people, and (for now) **things are okay**. Albeit, is has been 12+ hours since that moment. But I hope you can take comfort in the fact. A lot of us are scared, but in times like this we can't give up.

I'm not sure how close he was to you all, but I'm sure he was friends with some of you. I feel ashamed that I can't help as much as I can. I don't know many resources of how to get support, but I'll try my best. I'm sorry if I'm breaking the rules... I just wanted to let you all know. I hope that you all will be okay.

schizophrenia,Suicideations,2018/01/23,"What do I do when my partner can't handle me anymore? I apoligize if this post is hard to read. Im at my most clearheaded for a while this moment enough to twrite this post.  TLDR partner cant handle me, is scared, and my relationship is almost done for. A possible PHP program is at least some weeks away. How do i  handle not compeltely collapsing?  

  My Partner feels *""traumatized""* by me and Im breaking her heart and pushing her far beyond her breaking point and she feels she wont take much longer. She's scared and she doesn't know when Im in reality or not or when an episode will come. She cant stand to be around me and is constantly freaking out and on edge and leaves the apartment all day.  

  The delusions are getting worse she says. I dont even notice most of the time. She says I get unintelligable or barely able to get words out and speak at all. i get so upset oir stressed when my brain cant put the things into words. its like a drinking from a fire hose she sadi. I dont make sense and the things i do say are so not grounded in reality it terrifies her that Ill never come back. Last night she said Im the worst shes ever seen me and right up there next to my last suicide attempt/ER/psych ward episode.  Sjhe thought i was eihter goign to completely snap or was worried id be too overwhelemd and become actively suicidal. I had to self medicate hard to calm myself enough to internatlize enough symptoms until she fell asleep 

  Anyimte I hear things or see things I cant always tell if they are real anymore or not and im always shaking and twitching and very dissociated. Sometimes I go catatonic. im seeing things and feeling things and hearing things, im being communicated with. All my other disorders are kicking me hard and ruining my ability to function or even think too. The complete lack of mood or constant mood 180s and the personality changes and being manipulated from the thing in me is worse than ever. Im saying things I never thought and doing things and blacking out that I dont remember doing or am actively trying not to do but Im being moved without my permission.  

   I have therapy but one day a week for 45 minutes doesnt help. I called a PHP program and am trying to get in one. It may be 1-2 weeks before an interview assessment and then after that I dont know wehen the program would even start. Im not on any psych meds because i quit those over half a year ago (stupid). thought i was fine. new stuff has crept in rapidly recently. My partner thinks Im going to end up in Inpatient which neither of us want. She cant handle that I know cause last time it ruined her grad school semster and strung her out and scared her to all hell.  

  She says she doesnt know who I am and She doesnt know when Im going to snap, or snap and not come back.

schizophrenia,TheIngloriousTaco,2018/01/23,"Sudden specific panic attacks I'm with a new girlfriend and already I'm panicked about pregnancy. It's not as bad as it was with my ex, but idk why I'm so paranoid about this in particular. 

It hasn't happened with another girl I slept with, so it's not like sex alone is causing this. 

I think I just become worried thst loved ones are going to be hurt regardless of pregnancy, but pregnancy is something directly in my control so I latch onto it. 

This can't ruin this relationship, I like her too much to do that. I'm trying anxiety medication again but does anyone have any methods on dealing with persistent things like this?",4.805482695810569,6.30705980327869,6.042568306010928,75.88430783242259,69.81967213114754,9.35664845173042,33.22768670309654,9.725611199111238,3.4339479052823325,504,24,90,12,9,169,82,122,0.218,0.6829999999999999,0.099,-0.9226,0,1,2,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,8,9,1,1,1,0,9,4,1,2,0,16,18,9,0,1,6,1,0,3,1,0,1,0,0,1,12,6,0,1,1,0,0,1,4,5,0,1,2,0,8,4,16,15,1,8,0,2,0,2,7,4,0,0,6,60,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20035850071363295,0.21347970065284486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315543685257747,0.2028518672780052,0.1479906720966064,0.0,0.0,0.1352665217323073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22008020460522712,0.0,0.0,0.1615247996587997,0.0,0.21365314390649792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19872905894819826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2169734856747169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19944108572189967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16929163113052526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10994354291188037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17106945206014373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070949570446073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835334344203627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745984802690816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19488309300322185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14220988400202486,0.0,0.0,0.18683767934165665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13108845522384094,0.0,0.0,0.22697488704753185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20769564229645565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14892922508138212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285212789858998,0.12395658347994826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313415836450593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745608377577267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964604560629966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,ShamefulThrowawayyy,2018/01/23,"My friend is headed for a breakdown I (19M) am type one bipolar, and no stranger to psychosis. My friend (18F) is diagnosed schizophrenic and just opened up to me about her living situation. Her mother is physically and emotionally abusive, as well as starving her. She eats one meal a day, on a good day. Well, her mother decided to take her off her meds cold turkey two weeks ago. I don't know exactly what she was on but I know there was an antipsychotic involved. Obviously she needs to get the fuck out of that house, but she was nowhere to go and no money. I'd let her stay with me but I'm in a different city without a car. Her voices are comimg back in a bad way, and she's having delusions. It doesn't look good. She said she didn't sleep last night because she was so paranoid. The way I figure it she's probably going to end up in the hospital and then be promptly put back on her meds. It seems kind of inevitable, but at least she'll be medicated again. Is there anything at all I can do in this situation? My heart is breaking over it.

schizophrenia,rothjohn,2018/01/23,"Weed Has anyone noticed increased symptoms when smoking weed?

I have really bad auditory hallucinations. Especially if there is some kind of white noise. The air conditioner in my parents basement sounds like my mom screaming and crying, but I go up stairs and they are fast asleep. The window AC unity at my apartment sounds like neighbors yelling. The yard work happening on my block, whether it's a lawn mower or leaf blower all sounds like yelling. Hearing my neighbors muffled conversations through the walls I become convinced they are talking about me.

The last one happens when I'm not smoking weed too. 

I always thought weed gave me a stronger reaction than most other people and I wonder if it unlocked/caused my symptoms to surface.",5.489615384615386,8.604389961538466,4.830000000000002,78.245,72.46153846153845,6.461538461538463,34.615384615384606,7.61054688173877,2.8662307692307687,605,32,92,8,13,182,96,130,0.07400000000000001,0.804,0.122,0.7686,3,0,0,0,2,0,12.0,0,0,2,1,5,7,0,0,7,0,5,3,1,0,1,15,13,10,0,2,6,2,0,3,2,0,2,7,5,0,3,3,0,1,2,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,2,8,15,5,9,11,4,15,0,0,1,0,10,9,0,6,7,56,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16153733418255614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13574493472421484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1620960833857884,0.0,0.21440879607007646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.199431927347953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21325011211584494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11033239315088836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433489869602387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2188062350932098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021635583310327,0.0,0.1582473684221133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845362404135212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273706239988061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2210259851040628,0.0,0.0,0.13155209115729305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21556589462898051,0.0,0.0,0.1345899835290717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12436897798808433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4035648492866235,0.0,0.156039771880974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412290014124458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105330321515407,0.14133387159239502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,megaspark90,2018/01/23,"I work with a kiddo who has psychosis. Any advice on helping him? I'm an aid at a middle school and he's young enough that no one wants to officially diagnosis him with anything other than emotional disturbance. Most of his classmates have developmental disorders so I feel like we're underprepared for him. I'm currently working on a PhD to work with families and children but I don't have any experience with psychosis. Does anyone have advice on helping him feel supported and loved? He doesn't realize that he has delusions and I suspect he has auditory and tactile hallucinations.

schizophrenia,ezdabomb22,2018/01/23,"Good lord this blows I don't know if I have schizophrenia or not but I need to write this down somewhere or im gonna break something. 

A while ago, I had a really bad ""episode"" or whatever you wanna call it where I constantly thought about being the only real person alive and that I was being held in a simulation of sorts. I wouldn't talk to anyone because my thoughts talked to me so much that I got worn out and couldn't think. It got to the point where even if i did speak, it came out garbled and i would forget what I was saying half way through talking. I even (as gross as it is) couldn't bring myself to take showers or even brush my teeth. ( That may be unrelated though) 

Then I woke up one day and felt normal. I didnt feel so ""blah"" so I cleaned my room and moved my furniture around. I felt productive. Its been a few days since then and now I feel weird, its like a normal feeling with a glooming over thought that something isnt right and I cant stop thinking about ways to get back to how I was. Also every once in a while, I get an overwhelming urge to puncture my skin with needles, last week I sewed a big ""X"" in my skin with a needle and thread and it felt awesome. Its super concerning to say the least. 

Another thing that I think could be a bad sign is  when I sometimes cant get off of my bed because I'm afraid that hands will reach out and grab me ( this may just be an odd irrational fear). 

I have no idea what to do about this. Its driving me insane. Sometimes I will just randomly get shaking mad over nothing and I dont want that to happen when I'm out of my room. Urg

would any of you like to try to draw your experiences with it? how does it feel, visually? especially the differences between your positive and negative symptoms. i could try to represent this myself based on what i've seen, but i'd rather not be misrepresenting everyone. you don't have to be a good artist, i just need some ideas :)

schizophrenia,codece,2018/01/24,"Does anyone here have experience with schizophrenia without delusions or hallucinations? I have been reading more about schizophrenia, and realize now that it is entirely possible to meet the DSM or ICD criteria for schizophrenia without having any experience with delusions, or visual / auditory hallucinations. Under the DSM-IV for example, a patient must exhibit 2 out of 5 characteristic symptoms; one could do so with grossly disorganized behavior, combined with negative symptoms, such as lack of motivation. If in addition to that, you have social or occupational dysfunctions, combined with significant duration, it would seem you meet the diagnostic criteria.

It seems that this would be the case with ""Simple-type Schizophrenia,"" which is ICD recognized, but not exactly DSM recognized as a specific sub-type; it was removed in DSM-IV and replaced as a proposed category under simple deteriorative disorder.

I'm just wondering if anyone here has some personal experience with this, either as a patient or a family member / close friend of someone with schizophrenia who does not have delusions or hallucinations. How is it managed, and how effective has treatment been? It just seems to me that this is potentially an even more difficult form of schizophrenia to recognize and diagnose. I am also thinking that there might be a notable population of people who are suffering from this, who remain undiagnosed and are not getting treatment.

My 1st post here, thanks in advance for taking the time to read it.

schizophrenia,spaceepixiee,2018/01/24,"There’s got to be someone out there who’ll listen to me I just need someone to believe me, and not treat me like a five year old. Tried once again with r/bipolar, but they didn’t like it one bit, and significant booing ensued. 

So let me explain my powers.

This clearly isn’t a delusion. If it is, it’s not a huge one because there are facts behind it. Let me explain further.

So sometimes to me, time feels like it flies by. Music sounds faster, classes speed by, you can imagine. And other times, time drips by slowly. I can focus in on things and process better and travel through dimensions (but that’s a story for another time (that ones probably a delusion though)). So my theory is, if I focus in hard enough, I can switch how fast or slow time goes by for me. And that’s NOT that irrational. If my NT friends can believe me, surely you can too.

And besides, I barely consider this a power. Its more of “advanced” meditation if that makes sense 

I will gladly answer any questions as r/bipolar did not seem to get it—I’m just hoping that someone will",3.32384898190045,5.045992216346157,4.215418552036201,86.63252262443442,73.95192307692308,6.432579185520363,26.65837104072398,7.048011613610866,1.254539253393665,823,30,161,8,17,265,123,208,0.059,0.8009999999999999,0.14,0.9653,2,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,2,1,4,12,9,0,0,6,0,17,0,0,2,3,36,27,20,0,6,13,0,2,3,1,3,0,2,0,0,17,9,0,0,7,1,0,2,6,0,0,4,3,4,20,9,20,18,3,20,0,0,0,0,9,6,0,8,15,115,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09601053393570247,0.14804461687944415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606496920014423,0.0,0.0,0.3181339387090479,0.0,0.12486651940800947,0.15413728081607747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458816827838251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07138729820131333,0.1008624792730694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090790586382268,0.0,0.07376325271034782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291841555898725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264738868253799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14022840445829912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887421328445009,0.0,0.20692734671132573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424197829552552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10468677133222383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14814974174148368,0.150357248863104,0.28701150831904565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.152221138792939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15815933461210588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285293775462248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3588763751735369,0.0,0.13963541873951102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306504264950136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09379693548616766,0.0,0.1387133903454174,0.0,0.4116300834909225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958552400428438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09091840926542408

schizophrenia,periwinkle52,2018/01/24,"Really Struggling With Cognitive Issues Hello everyone! I'm pretty new to this subreddit, but I just wanted someone else's opinion on my symptoms as they stand. I was diagnosed as Schizoaffective after a very brief stay in a mental hospital in December of 2016. I was put on seroquel, which managed to bring me out of the psychotic episode in a matter of 4 or 5 days. Currently I'm living at home, going to school at the community college in my area. I've always thought of myself as somewhat intelligent, my fortes being linguistics and mathematics. I've been able to manage the cognitive deficits to some degree, but recently my thought processes have become more and more disorganized. I've had no delusions or hallucinations, but my anxiety has been really high along with my depressive symptoms. I just want to know if these symptoms improve with time, or if it's a sign that I might be on the road to another psychotic episode. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I am new to this subreddit and have been browsing around. I decided to post in case perhaps someone saw my piece here and had some insightful information. 

I have a brother who is 5 years my senior; in and out (mostly out) of my life for the past 12 years, suddenly get back in touch about a year ago. He has officially been diagnosed with 'S' (as he calls it) although I feel he was symptomatic since childhood. 

I have gotten in touch with NAMI, CMHA, and a few other associations but wanted some other opinions. He has quite a lot of savings from being employed over the years and is not poor enough to be on full-time disability and receive funding for supportive housing. On the other hand, he can not work and there has been no progress for him whatsoever over the past 1.5 years despite frequent doctor visits and him recieving the right medication.... being encouraged to be more active and go forward in his life. 

I am fine with supporting him with frequent check-ins, visits and outtings; however, I do not want him to live with me personally and he doesn't have any close friends that would likely allow him to live with them. 

Anyone else in a similar situation?

Thank you so much.

schizophrenia,J_Trix_2506,2018/01/24,"What do you get paranoid about? I actually have schizoaffective disorder, but there's crossover so I thought I'd ask here. 

This is for a writing project I'm working on. Purely for information, I won't be using anything you say for anything. I'd just like to get a better idea of the themes of paranoia that crop up for you personally. 

Please only post if you feel well enough and it won't trigger difficult thoughts. 

Personally, my paranoia presents as a fear of mind and thought reading, government involvement and testing, and fear that if I don't do something correct, the 'man' would carry out the threats he made to people. I also used to fear grids on the street when I was a kid because I thought the demons could enter your body that way, but that became more about experimentation as I got older.

I told them that I used speed on New Years Eve and that all my symptoms vanished instantly for two days. So she gave me Straterra. It's expensive, but if it works thats fine.

schizophrenia,bobjog,2018/01/24,"Tactile hallucinations. Anyone else's brain and body feel as if they're hooked up to an invisible machine? Feels all ghostlike, but definitely mechanical. Makes you feel like an android in a world full of people. It's been going on for about four years now. I don't talk about it. I keep it hush hush, just between me and the Lord normally, but I felt like reaching out today. Just trying to see if I'm the only one.

Also, in the past I've had visual hallucinations. Whenever I looked at light-sources, a big image of an eye would appear. Hasn't happened in a while. Also, once I looked at the sun and it started shaking in the sky. These went away a long time ago.

Also, my brain felt like it exploded when I was twenty-four, and I spent about a month or so completely insane. Like, everything people said to me, even little words, like ""cheese"", i would interpret as having some immensely profound meaning (relative to my entire life). Had a huge psychic slowdown for about two years before reaching a functional level again. 

All of this outside of institutions. Pretty insane. Hope y'all are keeping it real, and praying, and just staying strong and having patience and enjoying yourselves while the Lord leads you onward through this crazy maze of life.",4.835312852947818,6.920969716738195,5.297352608990284,78.92523379263609,70.71673819742489,7.6520442737745675,28.572170770273324,8.371475516178862,2.205528755364807,996,38,172,16,19,318,148,233,0.057,0.7509999999999999,0.191,0.9871,0,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,0,3,0,2,15,9,0,1,16,0,11,6,4,2,2,38,32,22,0,6,8,0,5,5,0,2,2,3,0,0,9,9,0,2,7,0,1,5,2,1,0,3,9,12,15,8,29,21,4,37,3,0,4,0,5,17,0,6,19,113,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11007898116075923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297922549362067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683025620898724,0.12723812954403246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11667215563909278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566890125709164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13793711809264705,0.0,0.2772541738522916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13020143633607453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10373730725822976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08202039222150732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116058931166034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18836896409192333,0.08871494516588778,0.2384665058693481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057493515250396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109812865457644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333977215191808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207555918656832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17542545312838204,0.303342867587687,0.12446200509500872,0.0,0.10989629453663884,0.20856156123510064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0828917948187365,0.0,0.0,0.13526953518320725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912010503405837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167103301397257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322487329710678,0.08414827266463124,0.09444526116480507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854483451812164,0.17218296618927875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263367407459862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14134518691195522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181245867418493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989561947958557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08789596478063838,0.13236044401024247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09981199960605204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07241095112615846,0.0,0.11770908641042666,0.0,0.0,0.0843107608057225,0.0,0.12130681187446535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511704922215345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1764292666954224,0.0,0.0,0.1599370102873416
schizophrenia,MudBugZombie101,2018/01/24,I think im in crisis For the past month I have been exponentially worse. It's hard for me to even comprehend that Im awake. I am so scared all the time and boarded up my bedroom windows so the monsters wouldn't get in. I keep hallucinating all day long and my intrusive thoughts are scaring me as well. I am just so scared and nervous that I'm going to die. Not by me but that some is trying to get me. I can feel a monster on my back sucking the life force out of me and just taunting me. Should I got to the hospital?,1.3475675675675696,3.0401573153153194,3.3029639639639647,91.1522837837838,79.45045045045045,6.241801801801803,24.613513513513517,7.1686216300943375,0.8360551351351355,406,15,94,5,10,137,73,111,0.155,0.83,0.014,-0.9016,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,8,6,1,4,6,0,9,1,0,0,2,18,19,9,1,2,4,0,2,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,4,5,0,1,3,0,0,1,2,5,1,0,3,2,16,1,14,14,3,12,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,6,66,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14900482610229934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497204166195085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011130021206788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12798983443898235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979809690190921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20248405978830247,0.0,0.11012961558774774,0.0,0.1549835342608127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17358877978286805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4186312141179924,0.0,0.0,0.17224053000175416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368725148353872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714891646118436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15467331341969684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18498489622672665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5820226283540345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12416637236403012,0.0,0.15383964093492908,0.1129946516370846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315638711871397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742314539558051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1974783319201984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Mr_Derp22,2018/01/24,"The doctor thinks this might be it So after years of going to see doctors, and trying almost every SSRI because it was thought that I had GAD. I finally opened up about my delusions. Told my shrink that I’m probably being controlled by an alien species or that this is all a giant computer simulation and I’m the only real person in the world. 

Was probably a good thing i opened up because she know things that I might have schizophrenic disorder. She wants me to try seroquel so maybe finally my delusions will be tamed. I hope.

schizophrenia,fubarchicken,2018/01/25,"Hi would like to talk about how I feel. I've never been officially been diagnosed with the disorder. But for years I've had what I consider symptoms, I would like to ask others what they think. For as long as I can remember I have seen things that aren't there. They produce real symptoms in my body i.e. accelerated heartbeat. When I experience these symptoms I know it's not real, as there's no chance a dark phantom is following me, but I still have a crazy heart rate. I went to my doctor and for a time was give quetiapine and fluoxetine. Neither of which really seemed to help. To this date, while my mood seems to be improved, my hallucinations have not stopped. Sorry if this is not the place to ask these questions, I'm not sure where I should.

But since my diagnosis I have always lived with my mother either on her property in my own house or like now when they moved I now live &amp; pay rent for a room in her new house... I receive social security disability &amp; was approved first try in 2009 thanks to the help of my dr.s &amp; mother previously I have worked all my life.. have always had a vehicle of my own except for a few months here &amp; there. I do not shop unless I am forced to. Same goes for driving. But I pay my own way thanks to ssdi (its a god send) I still feel I could never hold down a job like a normal person, without going into complete relapse.

It's disappointing that no one is making generic risperdal consta or abilify maintena, I have been waiting a long time.",5.619689440993788,7.512559478260869,5.6965838509316775,77.62978260869569,68.34782608695652,9.170186335403725,34.88198757763975,9.606745405546679,3.546942236024845,400,20,70,9,7,126,67,92,0.091,0.909,0.0,-0.765,0,0,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,2,0,3,1,0,0,4,0,15,4,0,1,0,9,24,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,2,4,1,0,2,7,2,12,0,8,15,0,7,0,1,2,0,4,0,0,2,5,50,14,0,0.2572375700616849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2575862685267677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404824034882241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15680963511679924,0.0,0.21889022568021427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.298313913748142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14619403910818388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22764715471033425,0.21601477191429205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17170807549864206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591397890722163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.174310834834437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20498503867869464,0.0,0.0,0.29060523440643954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19341063907579534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499972957527091,0.0,0.0,0.2458015218678251,0.0,0.17464742455431392,0.0,0.2512837278694331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18273418926537735,0.0,0.0,0.16565256125470246
schizophrenia,Defluxit,2018/01/25,"On the road to Psychosis? So, I've smoked weed a couple times now and about 90% of them have been terrible highs because I see every terrible decision I've made and everything I hear in my head I feel like I've spoken it and I just hear voices telling me all the shit I've done every time I get high. I also have this like, tiny, asmr-like voice in my head that fucks with me, like it's a tiny, tiny whispering like voice, it's just there and I can't make out anything it's saying, but I can feel it. But yeah I just feel the sensation of being quite literally torn apart into shreds. Like being gashed down and only the skeleton remaining, it's quite vivid in my mind when I get high. I have a friend who's schizophrenic and he says that it makes it worse for him and I fear I might be developing schizophrenia and I feel delusional.

schizophrenia,notgayinathreeway,2018/01/25,"My dad is showing signs, and it runs in the family but he is now fixated on the color purple? Should I be encouraging the color? Get him shirts and stuff with purple in it? He really likes it but he never expressed interest in it before.

His hallucinations appear to him as purple when they are friendly and red when they are angry.

He's also seen them turn yellow or white but didn't know what emotion they meant with that.

Would I be encouraging his delusions to let him enjoy purple or would it help him to be surrounded by something he considers friendly? New to this and kind of scared. I also talked him out of believing his delusions and explained how his illness places importance on things that don't have a meaning, and he called me and told me how relieved he was when he woke up and realized it was all a delusion but I can't tell if he still believes them",5.497449197860964,6.253764605882356,6.1243315508021405,78.68040106951874,67.64705882352939,9.005347593582886,29.572192513368982,9.095868883498916,2.4053529411764702,693,24,130,12,11,226,101,170,0.078,0.735,0.187,0.9747,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,5,0,9,10,0,1,5,0,17,2,1,2,2,32,27,23,0,4,7,1,0,1,2,3,1,0,0,0,12,11,0,0,5,1,0,2,4,1,0,0,7,10,21,9,17,13,1,18,0,0,10,0,35,9,0,4,8,98,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2869720356727211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526773641302713,0.4043008118981528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18321287120476076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018288486865672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16914581567869874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2772464462451084,0.0,0.09374209831261264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12026472008342133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18684340985109268,0.09860722589111766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18347410403924305,0.0,0.08765793700896983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1954463028687264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13838353455597105,0.17328967456816613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18746081896284367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494417747108945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1796356134712422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381300444266856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432889470569382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20539856934111825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14421492820623968,0.15682526028588994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11920192270117493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17144816924267536,0.0,0.0,0.19516275461932966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25491658448266463,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,RealbasicFriends,2018/01/25,"Just want to vent I was very stressed last week and got to the point of being suicidal. I have never had a support system for that growing up (my first attempt at suicide was in 5th grade and I’m 22 in a week.) Last week I finally got to feel what it felt like to have someone care about me to the point that my SO drove about 45 minutes to pick me up and take me back to his place to make sure I wasn’t alone till I felt better. Which wasn’t for another 2 days. It was also the first time I had a panic attack in front of him and instead of like being freaked out he just sat next to me and rubbed my back silently till I stopped. He knew exactly what to do without hesitation.

schizophrenia,ScaredofRoommate,2018/01/26,"I do not feel safe living with my roommate. I've [23 F]  lived with three women for seven months. Last night, I was lying in bed when one of my roommates came into my room. I sat up and then she jumped on my bed and wrapped her arms around me and tried to pull me down to lie on my bed with her. She kept saying 'Let's go.' We've spoken maybe five sentences to each other in the time that I've known her. It was bizarre and I pushed her off and asked if she was ok. She acted like nothing had happened and she starts going on these weird tangents about how her family is in the Italian Mafia and that they want to kill her. Then she said that her father is Pablo Escobar and that he is going to kill her aunt. Then she said that her aunt has already been killed. At this point I realize that I'm talking to someone who is mentally ill. She asks me if I work for the government. When I say no she tells me  she doesn't believe me and that she knows I work for the government. Then she accuses me of being someone called 'Dana'  (not my name).  I told her to call someone she trusts because she is not acting like herself. She denied taking any drugs. She went back into her room and I saw her take what I thought was a pistol out of her jacket. At this point I felt really unsafe being near this person. I locked myself in the bathroom and texted friends/landlord/other roommates. She comes back and starts banging on the bathroom door yelling ""Dana come out of there baby!' I woke up my other roommate and we left to call the cops. I told the dispatcher what happened and said that she had a gun but didn't threaten anyone with it. When we got back to our place there were ~15 officers. They get her to come out of her room and they find out that what I told them was a handgun was actually an airsoft gun. I guess she was still acting unstable because they cuffed her and took her to the hospital. The cops told me the hospital would either release her that night or admit her to the mental health unit. She hasn't come back yet, but my roommates and I are considering moving out. All of us can barely afford our rent and finding comparable, safe housing for the amount we are paying is going to be a challenge. Has anyone here been in a similar situation and how did you protect yourself?

schizophrenia,Dakoo,2018/01/26,"Voices are becoming helpful. Hi all,

I just started xanax in addition to my abilify injection and it works wonders for me. It doesn't make the voices or hallucinations disappear but they are becoming a lot nicer.

Usually the voices I heard were threatening and insulting me but with those meds they started giving me advice about my life.

They tell me to use the rowing machine I have at home 30 minutes per day and I must say that sport is helping me a lot with the negative symptoms. It was hard at first but it gets easier every day, maybe I'll even go to 40 minutes.

My doctor said that xanax can lead to dependence but I don't really care since it makes me feel so alive again. 

I also stopped taking other illegal drugs. I used to do cocaine to feel alive, it worked short term but was a disaster on the long term. Funny thing is I haven't taken any in 2 weeks and I don't even miss it.

Anyway I just wanted to share my experience with you all. For the first time since my first episode I actually had a good week and went to see a friend play in a theater. So maybe some of you should discuss it with your doctor if it can help.

PS: Even though I'm mostly a lurker I would like to thank you all for this subreddit it helped me a lot to see that I'm not alone in this. I can honestly say you guys saved my life a few months back. If this post can help even one person this would make me so happy.

Also I'm not a native english speaker so forgive me if there are mistakes in this post.

Have a good day.",2.559686333084393,4.239565915857607,3.9763915857605214,87.7216299477222,75.92556634304208,7.3428429176002,23.53510082150859,8.139509932561175,1.2193892457057511,1184,36,251,20,26,391,163,309,0.102,0.672,0.225,0.9926,0,1,2,0,0,0,22.0,0,5,3,6,18,15,1,0,17,0,24,8,0,7,4,50,51,21,0,9,13,0,3,1,1,4,8,8,1,2,21,10,0,1,4,2,0,4,7,3,0,4,8,13,36,12,27,39,11,34,0,1,2,0,27,9,0,11,20,172,57,5,0.0,0.0,0.09200319711477993,0.0,0.0,0.09212884135318776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976451341991514,0.0,0.15079057252796216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06411329653311704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249511998935344,0.0,0.0,0.20824861270686354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09612423897371948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18240744395844366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19299813711932826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10933429429589768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2490828961124052,0.0,0.07943454939145789,0.0,0.0,0.09222344692603374,0.0,0.0,0.09534110124507696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405822969379983,0.0,0.0,0.07284011186428081,0.0,0.04925715023554491,0.0904414922507763,0.05358121548985144,0.15815435183917936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09335153277271692,0.0,0.10036228642935427,0.084455918297067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159678251189627,0.0,0.0945700308188988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331848054293704,0.04606020400983299,0.0,0.0,0.08343439531867446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404591916188191,0.0,0.0,0.18879690548461064,0.0,0.18943287004506693,0.0,0.1047232765088695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07525300158944828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06388623271136527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232122743002253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18058740948112625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06039786521007299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968139925581095,0.14994969330996785,0.0,0.0,0.15025711850687662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597796195472913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13346303810050852,0.0,0.0,0.07882188792258651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09799250490372367,0.07088645469793266,0.0,0.08240444310164519,0.08679990155763805,0.0,0.0,0.06263511400477784,0.0,0.09262913519766056,0.0,0.054975137670787384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628544438206786,0.10383555529413087,0.0,0.055608494877830664,0.0,0.15125066447438976,0.0,0.0,0.08739804588696386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224210171908787,0.13727320533056225,0.0,0.0,0.13394691099745912,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,rankinmcsween6040,2018/01/26,"Im kind of worried that Im developing schizophrenia If it were to effect me would it have by now? Im 18 and Ive been smoking weed for 4 years, tripping regularly and using a lot of other drugs all in the past year. For those of you who dont know, psychedelics are known to bring out underlying mental illnesses. Mentally Im not doing the best but I dont think it resembles schizophrenia. Im pretty sure I have high functioning depression, diagnosed ADD and Im pretty sure I have anxiety as well, if not Im definitely an overthinker and feel really anxious for no reason whatsoever sometimes. When I get really baked alone Ill see something out of the corner of my eye (usually one of my cats for some reason) but Ive always just chalked it up to paranoia from weed. But when Im sober I dont see/hear anything other than my HPPD visuals which are pretty weak. 

I just read the symptoms of onset and its kind of scaring me, I cant tell if these symptoms are just from other illnesses I have or from drug abuse. I definitely noticed a withdrawal from society, Ive been depressed for over a year now,  I sleep a lot and have trouble concentrating (this is probably because Im baked all the time though), and I definitely have a weird way of talking and use words Ive made up but this is something Ive done since I was a kid as a joke. Sorry if this is kind of scrambled Im kind of freaking out right now.

schizophrenia,Raisondetre09,2018/01/26,"B3 So, before I begin I’d like too apologise for not posting for a while. 

I recently, well actually 7 days ago I started a nutrition medicine called B3 to help with my schizophrenia and too hopefully make the hallucinations and voices actually go away and completely stop. As that’s the main issue. As it has been seven days I have had a huge difference with my mental health. I have actually not hallucinated or heard voices nor had a problem with my schizophrenia since 3 weeks before starting on B3. How incredible is that? Well, VERY VERY INCREDIBLE. 

I start on eight tomorrow and am yet too flush. Which happens when your body has consumed enough B3. I’m only up too 4,500mg and am yet too flush. But that’s okay cause a lot of good has come too me taking the B3 and even starting on it. It goes too show how deficient my body actually is from it. 

But you know what’s crazy? By me taking B3 my schizophrenia symptoms can actually be stopped from one simple nutrition fix. Crazy right? But it works! I’d suggest it too anyone suffering or who knows someone that is.

schizophrenia,icymoons,2018/01/26,"First post. Not sure where to start. I was diagnosed schizoaffective years ago. I also have anosognosia but that part has never been brought up in session with a doctor.  I'd kinda like help sorting out my delusions and what is real or not. The main prevailing delusion is that I'm being reality tested. Pretty much if I can distinguish a staged or false scenario from a normal one. To measure my awareness, level of paranoia, state of psychosis, ect.. I've read about reality testing, is that a thing?",4.747065217391307,7.1270471847826125,5.1841304347826105,78.37771739130439,71.71739130434783,7.208695652173913,31.06521739130435,8.07648339933343,2.537039130434783,399,18,65,6,8,127,74,92,0.044,0.8440000000000001,0.112,0.8054,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,5,0,9,2,0,0,2,16,12,6,0,2,6,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,5,3,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,2,3,0,5,2,10,8,3,14,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,5,6,49,10,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278521288633441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20555630873014244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26089211040704197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2630932689819607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2186397026256334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1722897624701336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12557768508854042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18895536675799102,0.0,0.1982465537847491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518464796903346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17417823879391298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2783513212507839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2461750802703229,0.261504013110279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2571114518924456,0.29256994753106363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18193557464451948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422589419093589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707672119797313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16552655145304035
schizophrenia,hansolosmydad,2018/01/26,"Vivid imagination Hi all! So I want to start by saying I'm not diagnosed with anything but i would like to take a test but don't know how to go about that (like do I go to therapy and they decide to give a test like I'm just unsure of the process if anyone wants to help!) 

While I've never actually seen anything my mind is always going through these very vivid, intrusive images even when I day dream. If I watch something scary, which I usually avoid but come across, or if I am just particularly paranoid one night I find it hard to sleep with the lights off. I start thinking if I open my eyes randomly in the middle of the night I will see something I shouldn't see like a demon sitting in the chair, or if I get up to go to the bathroom I'm scared I will see something in the hallway or the bathroom mirror. Last night I was going through this and had to sleep with the light on, and I was even looking at my dog weird like she was freaking me out (even though she's the cutest thing ever). And then when I day dream, and say in that day dream I imagine being in a house and want to go to the upper level of the home I start to imagine like something being upstairs (again this is usually a demon). And when I drive I just assume I will see a ghost walking on the side of the road or something like I just anticipate these things happening and I'm scared I will eventually trick myself into seeing things. Again I don't know if this is schizo but if anyone knows what it COULD be .... I don't know.

schizophrenia,AdventurousMango,2018/01/27,"Is something wrong with me? Hi!
I don't know if this is the right sub to be venting to, but I think I might've had/be having a very minor psychotic episode of some kind... I don't know a lot about these things though and this has never happened to me before.

So long story short, my friend has just bought tickets for an upcoming festival for my friends and me on our behalf. And today just out of nowhere I just got the thought in my head that she must be trying to swindle me/us of our money, and I started looking for clues (and finding them...or so I thought) and then it all just escalated to me thinking she was out to get me/wanted to ruin my life, she was never really my friend, just pretending to get to me. I spent a few hours feeling so sure of all this and just getting more and more stuck in my own head. And then I decided to write in our festival group chat and call her out. It felt so important and justified like I was shining the light on JFKs shooter or something. It was like I had completely forgotten that this was my friend and I was going to uncover the thuth and everyone else would see the truth like me. 

Then they all freaked out (of course) because this basically came out of nowhere. Once they started asking me what was going on and if I was alright it was as if this weird paranoid fog lifted and I just realised that I berated one of my best friends of 8 years over some fucking delusion I had convinced myself of.

We all talked it out and there seems to be no hard feelings (they could tell from the start of my ranting that something was off with me). I feel so ashamed and what's more, now I can't stop thinking that maybe I've inherited my grandmothers schizophrenia or something of the like... I really don't want to sound like I'm selfdiagnosing. I just don't know what to think of myself right now and I'm kinda scared to trust my own thoughts and instincts...",4.064859414388209,5.104014937172773,4.6005526468877225,87.2782945510956,71.09424083769632,7.753500096955594,29.069614116734535,8.045849151850463,1.7510677525693228,1494,57,314,20,27,475,182,382,0.095,0.72,0.185,0.9916,0,0,4,1,0,0,40.0,4,0,3,1,18,26,1,2,11,1,28,4,2,0,9,78,64,35,0,7,14,0,5,5,5,2,1,1,0,0,21,29,0,1,17,3,4,3,8,7,0,1,21,10,52,19,49,37,14,35,0,1,3,1,24,17,1,10,20,224,73,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211358469692707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06006384415703341,0.0,0.08384298830209931,0.0,0.10340265509653684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061160477009533,0.112693704905084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330832793540946,0.0,0.0,0.0786693279235773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823103650693001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415100221382393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494613520624429,0.0,0.09460562296092027,0.0,0.09005594042037901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3806256854404001,0.09109071775059338,0.15443581365864634,0.0,0.11199536272296937,0.0,0.07880458423010485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713101664211112,0.0,0.0882648062134108,0.0,0.2022433435104949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703360923233514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260532015147304,0.16245088852537198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06959566172997522,0.2406873942675053,0.0,0.0,0.08719721344373399,0.08274158399905082,0.0,0.0,0.08376789682484395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898806325310378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10452627463555167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15198702355222302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493275542331378,0.06676744583060618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12624351202290898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16829060280606498,0.0,0.0,0.0986471486765969,0.0,0.07851679144938943,0.08969931174417961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30341722926663633,0.0,0.0,0.2092231562711612,0.0,0.0,0.08237668600548381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09286470510274997,0.0,0.0,0.07919582976469848,0.08612081128414349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545990276656079,0.2525398429239941,0.09680662803498603,0.2346688440125033,0.0,0.0,0.0933962730524546,0.0,0.0,0.06689637204400173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11852117639210412,0.0,0.0,0.08129874739481224,0.11623277854718735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999389966070796,0.10772864912510884,0.0,0.06345100934649102
schizophrenia,JaneD0,2018/01/27,"Do you get messages via radio (music) or other every day events? I had a dream yesterday, where I was with my now ex-boyfriend. I felt really happy during the dream, and we discussed several unresolved issues that led to our breakup..

During the day, I had to go to the store, and listening to the radio, all the songs they played spoke to me about our break up. The thing is, around the time of our break up, I had my first psychotic break where I thought that the music he was listening to (he was on a social media site where I could see the music he had listened to lately) was a direct message to me. I don't know.. I have this feeling that God (or another higher power) is sending messages to me through music.. It is just too much to be a coincidence. Everything fits too well together.

schizophrenia,pinkgreenpurple,2018/01/27,"psychosis in public online - instagram hi,

ive had psychotic episodes before but nothing like this past weekend. i believed that these two women from my old city where I used to live where slut-shaming me and prosecuting me and other women. it was originially from a real event that happened irl, but i believed they were still doing it or that it was happening again. i did an angry call out saying they publicly slandered me and that their shaming contributes to sexual assault.

i'm coming down now and seeing what i did.

i dunno wtf to do. i believed in some wild things and my brain is totally fried.",5.764623893805307,7.236981778761063,6.1045907079646025,76.4538772123894,67.49557522123894,8.481858407079647,31.82411504424779,8.841846274778883,2.8371424778761067,483,20,80,8,8,155,80,113,0.152,0.848,0.0,-0.9613,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,3,0,5,3,1,1,2,0,10,1,1,1,1,15,16,8,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,12,7,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,6,2,16,1,9,10,2,14,0,0,1,0,10,6,0,3,8,64,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16196855370775728,0.6433568408032826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2124866304753074,0.1943623007819344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16396432889168358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3366407861742665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929923656936748,0.0,0.16807706202817546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18264000901402505,0.0,0.19973379807551767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18170469426677227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21665291514655152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15136902903163532,0.0,0.0,0.1516793641348872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15200880398562094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12645596240854404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18593823386507047,0.0,0.0,0.16439592833088135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,CanaryButt,2018/01/28,"Has anyone here ever gone off medications for another disorder then realized it was treating schizophrenia as well? I really doubt I have it but I have Bipolar II and BPD and eventually I want to go med free. All the medication I'm one work in tandem with schizophrenia. Genetically. My grandmother on my Dad's side had developed schizophrenia at some point so I may have some predisposition. I'm pretty sure I'll be fine and I'm overthinking it. It just scares me that if on top of BP and BPD, I'd have to work on that too... kinda freaks me out. I've been on medication for severe bipolar since I was around 10-years old and literally don't know what it's like being off of it, especially what will happen.

schizophrenia,DreyaNova,2018/01/28,"Olanzapine (for psychosis) causing sleep walking. Hey, I’ve been taking a bed time dose of Olanzapine (15mg) since Dec 1, but its apparently recently been causing me to sleep walk / sleep eat. My partner tells me I’m waking about 5 times a night to snack or smoke a cigarette, and I can’t remember any of it. This has been going on for about two weeks now. My quality of sleep has greatly decreased and I’m concerned I’ll start leaving the house. I have an appointment with my doctor scheduled for feb 5, she said to keep on the medication until then but I’m scared to go to sleep because I don’t like the fact I’m doing things I’m unaware of. 

Has anyone else experienced this side effect? I’ve googled it but not much came up.

Thanks in advance - M ",2.8966307692307725,4.8015780066666665,4.328666666666667,84.57946153846156,75.6,7.282051282051282,27.538461538461537,8.139509932561175,1.8252307692307697,591,24,119,10,13,196,100,150,0.043,0.906,0.051,0.2617,1,0,2,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,2,3,4,0,1,7,0,10,11,6,3,1,15,23,8,0,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,3,1,1,1,6,4,2,1,2,0,0,6,3,1,0,1,5,2,9,3,20,18,1,21,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,11,63,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09162748403232253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942129949695018,0.1380565459787276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213595183638582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15410609907264766,0.0,0.2768291753377528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13791159309703252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13787215169705405,0.11255756729942344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531511318932989,0.0,0.0,0.14855078028787902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554712986673628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11976266323499765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426696812854767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582691634420168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573587629531114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09904903973660907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12644389823869914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330390064087645,0.0,0.15263359363110784,0.0,0.12816812459586466,0.0,0.1348977503223787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145791116058774,0.0,0.6741840628982174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536931536614172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10130733946253692,0.0,0.11776826653404555,0.12405003367548692,0.0,0.0,0.08951494024911062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15713537819734089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13162091828208144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807990380627792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,sgt-revolver,2018/01/28,"Alcohol problems Hi everyone, 
I’m new here. I was wondering if anyone else here has problems with alcohol? 
I find that it reduces some of the negative symptoms but can increase anxiety and delusional thoughts.

schizophrenia,Pradamaneblu,2018/01/28,"I think am developing schizophrenia. Im 18 years old.I have a history of drug usage, including lsd... although quite alot i have never been addicted or dependant on simply one drug. i just like being high generally. Nowadays i feel as if i simply cant function while im sober.
i feel depressed and anxious and i my intrusive thoughts are becoming so hard to manage it hurts. In public when im talking to my friends or such i always feel as if though im somehow ""locked"" away from the conversation, as if im just an onlooker looking through this persons eyes.  The day before yesterday i took  amphetamine. I didnt go to sleep and was awake for 30 hours atleast, then i started to notice some things were off, such as my tinnitus being extremely loud, and it also sounded like a n2o canister. I also couldnt shake the feeling of being watched, i tried to go to sleep but i thought i heard people whispering from my doorway. I was sure that they were going to break into my house and steal all our valuables. So i was walking around acting generally weird until my mother noticed something was off. She tried talking to me but i made her be quiet and told her to follow me into another room. There i told her that robbers were outside the doorway and she has to be quiet. She said there was noone outside and i became more and more delusional. Everytime she tried to say something i screamed at her to be quiet. I kept hearing the voices trying to break in and sounds of the door collapsing. I went to sleep with my clothes on and a knife in my bed. I was walking around my house with a knife being very aggresive, and incoherent. My parents said they wanted to call and ambulance to take me to a psychiatric hospital but would not do it if i promised to go to sleep. Kept hearing the voices but not as loud as my tinnitus became unbearably loud so i writhed in pain in my bed for around 40 minutes until i took melatonin and managed to pass out. Now the morning after i have close to no fine- motor skills. Took me 15 minutes to peel an orange... Do you believe this is reason enough to believe i have schizophrenia, or atleast that i am developing it?",4.99497891342099,6.1544840887290215,5.7229670057057795,79.64287769784173,69.02398081534773,8.533498718266767,32.60473000909617,8.841846274778883,2.7685971884561305,1703,76,315,29,29,555,209,417,0.07,0.882,0.048,-0.8273,2,0,4,0,0,0,40.0,1,1,2,2,18,14,0,1,16,0,32,9,5,3,3,61,62,43,0,7,15,2,5,2,1,1,4,18,4,1,10,23,0,2,8,0,0,14,7,7,0,1,25,26,58,7,59,28,6,50,0,2,3,0,29,20,0,11,16,228,68,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724719765242271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12800386312143794,0.06659342028998062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392101537133342,0.0,0.09041390259312364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21373757919316624,0.0,0.0,0.07519313327820433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838956729611055,0.06810173114624117,0.18033835828212308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08172209265200234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051614317564975185,0.0,0.06893184290944998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1856244963714276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08269492806527863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16186727152798505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06183288220552813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18193717175976298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169336666248421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18040480424374747,0.0,0.0,0.08455869100161609,0.0,0.0,0.07881585451462797,0.1846934333405018,0.0856764066640197,0.0,0.4322439671455689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07819963742530195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06720711203439303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572865137517246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617259691315878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18223497862615207,0.08398060676580006,0.0,0.05423206802808237,0.0,0.08516018309344056,0.0,0.08886657870056366,0.0,0.0,0.05548443265656482,0.06988125949311144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512437554444252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822867011134604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522583986840572,0.06364502666103816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32036104502228563,0.0,0.0,0.12322579974249626,0.0,0.0,0.056647389072087974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07542964901364446,0.0,0.060174451838728674,0.1286541239943839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053170012058787665,0.05128157057259015,0.0786314883226523,0.12707367145006335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15294889578153192,0.2667570327346955,0.21734715500284527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06603516346123664,0.04720522011023639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419089479696442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05685276530692505,0.0,0.0,0.0515382820552947
schizophrenia,wvwvwvww,2018/01/28,What does the word 'recovery' mean to you (good and/or bad)? I was just looking at a comment I made here and I used the term 'recovery' and it occurred to me how loaded that term is. I really regretted using it.

schizophrenia,wildroverette,2018/01/29,"A persisting odd belief despite otherwise being symptom-free My friend has a belief (delusion) from back when he had his first psychotic episode. He is now on medication and is nearly symptom-free, but he is still 100% sure that some totally unbelievable (impossible) things really happened. He got rid of all other delusions, he now recognizes that they were a part of his condition (paranoid schizophrenia), but this one won't go away.

His doctor says that since this delusion is a couple of years old, and he was not in treatment until recently, it is hard (maybe impossible) to sort of dislodge it, whereas the newer delusions can often be fought off with medication and therapy.

It is hard to wrap my head around the fact that my friend is now logical and rational in every way except for holding this truly impossible belief.

He told me that he knows it sounds crazy and that he has ""no evidence"" for it, but that he is still completely sure it all really happened. And the things he offers me as ""evidence"" don't make sense to me at all, i.e. there is no logic in the explanations.

I would be very thankful if someone could help me understand him better. We have a really good relationship and I don't want this thing to cast a shadow on it. I want to see him as a reasonable person, which he now truly is, but how do I accept this more easily while he holds this belief?

Does anyone have a similar experience, where you are rational in every way, except you are sure of something you know people think is crazy to believe? Is it possible to know something is a delusion while still believing it?

Please help me be a better friend. I already told him that I can't believe these things because they don't make sense to me, but that we can agree to disagree and that I don't judge him.",8.90613905325444,7.483551292899412,8.812655325443789,69.5061427514793,61.218934911242606,12.236982248520713,37.101331360946745,11.20814326018867,4.103845562130177,1419,54,254,32,16,463,168,338,0.068,0.748,0.184,0.9942,0,0,2,0,0,0,44.0,2,3,2,4,14,12,1,0,14,0,37,4,1,4,8,54,55,21,0,5,9,0,2,0,3,2,3,2,0,1,32,12,0,2,13,0,0,1,9,1,0,2,7,5,30,11,34,41,7,32,4,0,1,0,39,12,0,4,17,188,62,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10507865522503687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06658068264632291,0.0,0.0,0.08476680857151361,0.0,0.0,0.08946319068289015,0.07321901136719278,0.0,0.058045790231404513,0.0,0.0,0.32184411456975714,0.0,0.1684303348933464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09983732504396704,0.0,0.0,0.07602615800545325,0.10536013904187777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09746264850421936,0.08332847050866203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604554672285566,0.0,0.0,0.0931443331605028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099486759400998,0.0,0.0,0.22070234435207264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05411624432921263,0.07986679163221255,0.07615686990553823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16840709367299994,0.0,0.17059848560090102,0.0,0.09772413718988884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12764915366689547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569927854367081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12712140965073354,0.0,0.09566221469242794,0.0,0.0,0.1918501222950019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991833973663357,0.0,0.0645241610716354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311497929508157,0.0,0.06601419786991454,0.08314323623224941,0.0,0.10452397802970637,0.0,0.10734728232794397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18300288267761866,0.09790296681935662,0.09401917291931423,0.10223163477309766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572349904781173,0.0,0.0,0.07587874652509248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07876773064912564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068037819152962,0.14661143562972226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22813065388941306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692337762233083,0.19794199475769228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08766663162642205,0.10889342287172037,0.0,0.25304219787344306,0.0610137219535651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18197534311297228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912833792913456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856723297658964,0.11232753374765954,0.15116387139997636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676422109540865,0.0,0.0,0.061319151815660514

schizophrenia,istillhavenoaccount,2018/01/29,"Why do people ask me ""Is everything okay with you?"" I was at the car wash today, got a special offer and thought I'd try it out. I've never been there before, so I was a bit confused at first, took me a while to figure out everything.

Once I was there, I opened the window, paid for the service, and when I was asked to close the window the guy asked me ""Is everything okay with you?""

I'm like, why would something not be okay with me? I'm fine, everything's alright with me! My feet hurt terribly because yesterday I had an absolutely uncontrollable urge to exercise and I completely overdid myself (2.5 hours and god knows how many miles), but other than that nothing was wrong with me.

For weeks I observed no talking to voices, no paranoia about my husband (her step father), coherent conversations, able to socialize instead of being reclusive in her room, eating well, sleeping all night, wanted and found a job, helping me around the house, smiling, etc. The only thing that never changed was her inability to see herself as schizophrenic or to agree that she needs medicine/psychiatrist.

I want to give people a voice to speak about their experiences and help others understand what it can be like to have a mental disorder.

If you're interested, please PM me, and I'm happy to provide more details.",9.90012195121951,9.071832548780492,9.097682926829274,66.34945121951222,58.878048780487795,11.614634146341464,41.23170731707317,10.686352973137794,4.580404878048781,367,17,58,7,4,116,58,82,0.067,0.731,0.202,0.8689,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,2,0,3,4,0,0,5,0,3,1,0,0,0,8,10,3,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,3,0,0,6,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,15,9,2,6,0,0,1,0,8,2,0,1,5,38,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513894505767571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4291248371753241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21041661274673007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2334978319400803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14702296002399856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21432269346681912,0.0,0.19368648369765265,0.0,0.18419534598349527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4420982337769661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118456757637216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30413371324879623,0.0,0.0,0.240775973862116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552541853584671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17630195796258835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22834685927698764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12937591851859984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,analogue_camera,2018/01/31,"Mother has been sectioned for 18 months now with no improvement Hi guys,



As the title states, my mother was sectioned in summer 2016, this was her third time being sectioned. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia after the first section and suffers from delusions and intense paranoia.



The first time she was sectioned in hospital was for around a year until the psychosis cleared, the second time (2 years later) was around 2 months, and this third time (1 year after the 2nd section) she’s been sectioned for the last 18 months.



She’s been deep in psychosis this entire time. No combination of antipsychotic medication seems to be working. She no longer believes that my sibling and I are truly her children (she thinks we’re CIA) and thinks the doctors are trying to kill her, so often refuses medical examinations. The doctors wanted to try Clozapine on her as nothing else is working but she isn’t consenting to blood tests. She’s almost 70 years old so they don’t want to mess with too much restraint or sedatives etc. They are also worried about her heart.



I am no longer hopeful she will recover as she’s had psychosis for 18 months and is just not responding at all to medication. The doctors are telling us people usually respond to meds way before 18 months so I’m getting quite depressed now. My life is being truly ripped apart by this. I can’t see her anymore as she shouts violently at me that I’m not her child and it’s incredibly upsetting.



Does anyone have any similar experiences with yourselves or relatives? Have you seen psychosis last this long? Is she too far gone now to recover?",5.9662059369202245,7.844526554421773,5.7966481137909724,77.30560296846014,67.46938775510205,8.33865182436611,33.09152752009895,8.841846274778883,2.9636176870748296,1293,58,216,22,22,403,162,294,0.114,0.8340000000000001,0.053,-0.9629,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,1,1,2,5,14,7,2,1,11,0,29,10,2,0,2,31,41,19,1,3,6,2,0,0,0,1,8,1,0,3,8,13,0,1,4,0,0,1,9,6,0,5,12,3,30,1,35,25,10,50,0,2,2,0,33,18,0,6,29,155,38,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10303070082390836,0.0,0.0,0.08228207673117438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996956237231901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10204044908084668,0.07194393797254241,0.0,0.0,0.18319001174543093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08755285553194132,0.11592317819085032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08862006269475947,0.10443242914646868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159405908711199,0.09004080576144555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595241710287825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475091571629688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10064736288436248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17503844955244102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05375641921498131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187849086060152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12192659891216916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219420400980764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11383389761935825,0.0,0.0,0.1677401647613402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267511619623188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09105549773487666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428895757584455,0.3109562582529011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4106339771265174,0.0,0.07563689036058434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872690690570476,0.0,0.10796703413987584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07133182130451715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10943748461085412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819909862209412,0.0936683083641484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0899314671548438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318570868676325,0.0,0.0,0.2999835082724275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397127777954649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237654769262775,0.0,0.11332014972688607,0.0,0.12137582252615416,0.08167026647548119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498120767735535,0.10449103506206146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650343060126873
schizophrenia,Reeddddit,2018/01/31,"Fuck my life. First I'm diagnosed with high-functioning autism when I was 4, then I recover greatly and start making friends, then at 13 or 15, I started to drift more and more into psychosis. I am almost 18 now and it's been getting worse and worse this last year.

schizophrenia,SecretOfPineapples,2018/01/31,"Medication for negative symptoms Hi all, I'm currently in remission phase and everything's feels sooo dull and boring. Seems like anything I do feels painful. Even watching a Netflix show is painful. I’d rather just sit in a corner and think for hours. I’m currently taking 300mg of Wellbutrin and it helped me not sleep so much. But motivation and pleasure to do things is still very much missing. I also force myself to exercise; and rather than sit and think,  I take very long walks and think. Is there medication that might help me?

schizophrenia,supahfriends,2018/01/31,"Schizophrenic Mediums my schizophrenic friend and I(also schizophrenic) came up with the theory that our auditory hallucinations are spirits clinging to us and talking to us. That’s why they don’t make sense half the time(atleast for us two) and the same goes for visual hallucinations. the reason our moods change so easily is because our bodies are fragile vessels that can transport spirits, emotions, and memories from the spirit world to the real world and back again. we entertain the idea and the thought that we our illness gives us a purpose in the world helps to give us reason as to why we are like this. I wouldn’t call it a delusion between us two, but just an alternative to calling it a sickness, more like a gift that’s also a curse ",10.820681265206806,8.91208670072993,9.593832116788324,66.9482177615572,57.90510948905109,12.345012165450122,42.541362530413615,10.864195022040775,4.617915815085159,606,27,102,11,6,189,85,137,0.047,0.825,0.129,0.8237,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,13,0,1,0,5,5,0,0,15,0,7,6,1,3,0,21,12,10,0,1,2,0,1,2,1,1,5,0,0,0,8,11,0,0,4,1,0,2,2,0,0,3,2,1,16,4,14,9,2,9,3,0,0,0,21,5,0,0,4,77,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721448245030804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08276153806354714,0.0,0.06561081320223296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955369459628468,0.0,0.0,0.21980641762752112,0.12310110558798143,0.0,0.0,0.11385924784764645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107030448232114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08315538606590384,0.0,0.0,0.20649878238799727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07214274061282909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12150221402963925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051660671210522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184447855174804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12250755664894132,0.0,0.22132503467767128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650966094515307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08544693237101858,0.06276045821508809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2102795496937656,0.0,0.776800506918003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19424033872265373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,KikisBombDelivery,2018/01/31,"I just went through a three-day manic episode My meds ran out on Saturday and whaddaya know, I went through a ""positive"" manic session for the first time in my life. I only needed 4 hours of sleep each day. I was brimming with energy. I was confident in my actions. I lost my stutter and became an extrovert. I made 3 new friends. I even planned to get a girlfriend. I constantly analyzed and reflected upon my actions and went through a lot of self-improvement. I was positive and felt great about my future. I swiftly finished my coursework, dedicating my free time to learning programming. In three days I learned some Golang, Scala, .NET, cloud computing topics, and backend design. I started a programming project to apply these skills. I played basketball with newfound vigor. I planned ahead by years, carefully outlining my future goals. My thoughts were racing and I went from thinking of programming to thinking of soccer defensive schemes to thinking of sex in a matter of seconds.

All that ended one hour ago. Now I feel dead and empty, unmotivated, all my plans left in the dust. I heard the cons of mania outweigh the pros - i.e. I get 3 months of manic depression for every 1 month of positive mania or something. I messaged my psychiatrist and he immediately prescribed me my medication. I now know the consequences of missing my dose.

In all honesty, if I didn't care about my long term health, I would do it again. During those three days I lived life to the fullest. I had so much fun learning about software engineering. I had meaningful conversations with friends. I didn't go a moment without feeling confident and happy and secure. In those three days I experienced more happiness than I did in the past 8 years.",4.792877602732183,7.456968089456872,5.207169769747715,76.95348242811501,72.57827476038341,8.40669824831993,33.79629833645477,9.130062681391069,3.5094152032609887,1384,72,228,32,29,440,181,313,0.071,0.745,0.184,0.9873,0,0,1,0,0,0,45.0,0,0,0,8,9,17,1,0,15,0,11,7,1,1,3,44,36,14,1,3,4,0,3,0,3,1,5,1,0,0,5,16,0,2,14,2,1,8,3,5,0,6,19,5,45,13,43,16,9,50,0,3,0,1,7,12,0,4,30,152,50,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09932637661509536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2284867541252377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12108723380122507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3613178566554612,0.0,0.09650929009765506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09924385344831946,0.0,0.0,0.07400857349882002,0.0,0.094407729775719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331262016112882,0.0,0.10758645166543504,0.0,0.0,0.09531045224085156,0.0,0.0,0.17314052009856712,0.0,0.11708395816642952,0.0,0.0636811179993228,0.0,0.0,0.12353653089543785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385605681528469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11910488438644065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2206951634134832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231605065276196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1217436485152556,0.0,0.1582897519723306,0.0,0.0,0.09894301204110628,0.09916153496922817,0.0,0.0,0.1223168116471759,0.09526168213684323,0.0,0.10602528636687247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124463308039366,0.11287950990953664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17887594487021474,0.0,0.08237031629098393,0.0830843347118367,0.0,0.10821947328377376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07592860084697432,0.0852197711229413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10696527852056924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689354319252546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11213183822264068,0.0,0.0,0.08626226975018078,0.0,0.0,0.07931021534437163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21539310841673376,0.0,0.0889559114055473,0.1306755808742529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4154892883377853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10801308485453937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07959775610623827,0.0,0.0,0.1443142328442614
schizophrenia,XiRw,2018/01/31,"Why do people lose social skills when they come out of psychosis? That's all I read from time to time is people either slowly declining and losing what they once had or getting too embarrassed by what they did so they end up isolating themselves. 

What makes it so hard that this happens? 
 It's not like it's something you can control so it's hard to be faulted on whatever you did manage to do during psychosis and I'm sure the people around you would totally understand anyway. Is there something else going on that I don't understand with all this?

schizophrenia,Raindrops-Snowflakes,2018/02/01,"I don't think I'm going to pick up more meds. I've run out of meds and meant to be picking more up on Tuesday, but I think I won't. I'm not psychotic and never been diagnosed with psychosis; my 'psychosis' has just been me faking it for attention.

Also I think the drugs they are giving me are manipulating my mind, making me more complacent and accepting of their experiments. I know the government is fucking with my life for their own goals. They put me in a tiny room infested with bed bugs for six months, they'll do worse this time. They want to torture me and stress me out to see how much I can take before breaking.

I'm tempted to overdose or stab my neck or jump in front of a train. They can't torture and manipulate me if I'm dead. But I'm too much of a coward; I'm scared of it hurting and dying slowly. I wish I lived in a country where I could get my hands on a gun.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared and tired and want this to stop.",3.570352406214475,3.767348467980298,4.973891625615766,87.21494126563093,71.70935960591133,8.216597195907541,26.452823039029933,8.139509932561175,1.340178021978022,741,22,171,10,13,249,111,203,0.275,0.667,0.058,-0.9952,0,0,1,1,0,0,18.0,0,0,7,1,5,9,3,3,7,0,16,7,2,6,1,41,39,15,2,5,7,0,1,0,0,2,4,0,2,0,5,13,0,1,8,0,0,5,6,8,0,1,3,2,29,1,27,32,6,22,0,1,1,1,8,11,1,3,5,110,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12716456144477314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1353103971030265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126960861208962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16139728821394198,0.16503288446838066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18440738504966386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15554757816308004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14700717902398386,0.08307898567811113,0.1525420655372618,0.09037211882966152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17022927924070475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17478141528786764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123172827690716,0.0,0.0,0.14041351537890046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061440172091606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35326053365413473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16056022824366795,0.0,0.12692457869341214,0.0,0.233789237555935,0.0,0.1226424828589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15985440176735075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31840432052390016,0.0,0.12671468950977724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13294399831350298,0.1821516084786124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955979439451772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056719511289709,0.0,0.0,0.09272316107129756,0.1827648152422021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875828109196135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828598674058588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16205028214555026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,kybp1,2018/02/01,"Is the ""split mind"" etymology problematic/outdated, or apt/useful? (I have bipolar 1 w/ psychosis) Do you think the ""split mind"" meaning in the etymology of ""schizophrenia"" is a helpful and accurate way of thinking/talking about schizophrenia, or do you find it to be problematic? 

To single out psychosis itself, do you think it the ""split mind"" meaning in ""schizophrenia"" helps people gain an accurate understanding of how psychosis works mechanically? Or does it hinder that? And does this ""split mind"" thing help society humanize you, or does it help maintain society's tendency to dehumanize people living with psychosis?      

I ask because psychosis is a huge part of my life via bipolar disorder (my psychotic episodes last throughout my manic episodes, which can be up to 4 months) and only feel comfortable expressing opinions about the language of psychosis within the limitations of my case and experience; I don't know what the community of people w/ schizophrenia thinks about the ""split mind"" part of the word ""schizophrenia,"" so here I am asking y'all what you think.

schizophrenia,Clifftt,2018/02/01,"Fear of safety Hello, so I (F/29) have a sister who is a few years older than me (developing schizophrenia a couple years ago).

BEFORE
She was so aggressive and physical before (like hitting and choking other family members). I wasn’t around when she had episodes until it was mostly under control now (meaning she’s under medication, see a psychiatrist every few months).

However, there’s this sudden moment 4-5 years ago when we thought she’s fine after seeing psychiatrist when out of nowhere she attacked my other sister with a knife and fortunately, I was there before she could hurt my other sister. She just barged inside a room and attacked my other sister when we did nothing.

Thankfully, that never happened again recently. 

NOW
That said though, she recently became irritable easily and moody. She would cry or get mad when we won’t do as she said. Think that you went somewhere and right when we got there, she asked to go home because she forgot something and it couldn’t wait.

These happened a couple times that she would get frustrated if she had to wait or that we didn’t do like what she wanted. My parents (I think) tried to make her be more independent and “normal” in a sense (I don’t know a better word) so we tried not to follow all of her whims. Like make her wait 5 more minutes longer than it usually is or go home after we finish the dinner first. But I don’ t know if it is the cause of frustration for her. I believe, the change is very minor and what they did is necessary.

The way I see it though, they coddle her too much and bow to her every wish and command so it’s not like they’re pushing her too far. And how can you let this behavior stay forever? She’s 30+ and my parents are getting older. Very close to retirement maybe. What’s going to happen to her if she doesn’t start being a little bit more “normal” and tolerable to other people? She’s unemployed, spending her time in her room sleeping and frequent saloons visit.

Long story short, she doesn’t like to wait, doesn’t like it when we disagree with her or said something else. Like the time when my mother told my sister that my mom would make an appointment for her to go somewhere tomorrow and she went berserk, telling my mom to go make the appointment now.

I don’t know, it makes me anxious. I think I just cannot forget how she was trying to kill my other sister and another family member basically (for the latter, I only heard the stories but the person kept telling the story several times). I don’t know if I’m justified in this or not or how I can proceed with my life, having her as a sister. Also, thinking what can I do if I have to live my life walking on eggshells around her because I’m afraid I will say something wrong or do something wrong and she will try to hurt me or her episodes come back. How can you deal with schizophrenic family when the person doesn’t allow you to disagree and cannot be reasoned with a lot of times?

————

Tl;dr: schizophrenic sister tried to kill my other sister and I saw it as it happened. I cannot forget it. Recently, schizophrenic sister became more moody, I’m scared if she would do something similar. Am I wrong to assume this way or how do I deal with this anxiety and stop walking on eggshells around her?",4.649377110177085,6.036916198098261,5.318578171294703,81.36319489423276,70.06180665610142,7.9592227657961825,27.188072762351,8.389252357687651,1.8845383173706325,2575,85,478,39,46,832,252,631,0.108,0.841,0.051,-0.9915,5,0,5,0,0,0,69.0,8,4,2,3,37,28,8,3,24,0,53,8,1,15,2,113,109,63,2,16,22,15,0,7,0,7,6,5,4,2,35,41,1,8,12,0,1,13,18,18,0,1,22,9,90,10,51,73,11,79,0,2,4,0,84,18,0,18,52,339,125,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10760964986285684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0485399072633165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06364680259225168,0.04643355379873625,0.0685710937180261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621013931881013,0.0567441307821184,0.13810473154555028,0.0,0.04667276398428268,0.0,0.07400147631508218,0.0,0.1549477476866665,0.0683854922310306,0.0,0.05368215932913548,0.066266138485779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06235323023615751,0.06421008993502247,0.05228567085222092,0.0,0.0,0.06807760163018628,0.04846215297042663,0.1343216416346241,0.06667354377740341,0.0,0.12515327151836828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050705117335120814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228081494284934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17166109278436256,0.06830175721580632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0516294097470875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09513608700087252,0.0,0.17247943205805366,0.0,0.04854547403074535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2146990075258173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12176943024702945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12995622890475747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13430596439411605,0.0,0.1334314150583345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062067483156732585,0.08574512313395033,0.2075767198942756,0.06083501431550956,0.05359715739646611,0.05371553066539813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05160299111592949,0.0,0.0,0.20258084065842932,0.0,0.060978970969198576,0.06611756015854793,0.0,0.06114651994770369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14217676232352652,0.0484483035935243,0.0,0.04461977370580158,0.0,0.046813787401761835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11894166463954378,0.05824105438239824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0461633155484442,0.0,0.0,0.13479516582530846,0.0,0.0,0.04208012399051306,0.10599773389718242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0624073171488942,0.17979488874771146,0.0,0.0,0.051835481196659296,0.1732121602886398,0.04826922588995992,0.06076895958620347,0.0,0.14510456076339526,0.0,0.0,0.0685710937180261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0607415082520137,0.0,0.0,0.2336401709327406,0.0,0.0,0.042962125442410175,0.06469564346182316,0.0,0.05074597258886848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10610488332743397,0.055882262417850534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15557047227858906,0.11927031131981107,0.048187172460127034,0.17696650656547114,0.0,0.0,0.057999227806264826,0.0,0.2060486787374326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668499116372471,0.1001638741944983,0.035801060227713816,0.09635797535451007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11253470216943773,0.0,0.0,0.06979932856464523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17247154192795985,0.1990901312238276,0.0,0.11726193431059087

schizophrenia,ASILKYBUSH,2018/02/01,"schizophrenic roommate/friend Greetings and salutations,

A friend I am living with has been habitually doing meth + a variety of other ""fun"". Everything was reasonable for him until his dad passed away, which prompted him to become less tolerable to be around and promptly stopped showing up to work which cost him one of the few jobs out there that would hire this man.   
  
He is also bipolar, ADHD, and dyslexic.  

Family have imposed a tough love strategy, which looks more like they're shunning him, or rather, a stance kind of like - ""let him be over there, away from us... He'll realize he needs help all by himself in that house over there, all by himself."" Sometimes they come over to express concern, but he's typically having an episode and it pushes them away.  

-he's in the process of excommunication with his home church.  
-His last roommate assaulted him causing a concussion and a constant/long term headache.
-he's been smashing electronics, destroying windows, punching holes in the wall, stabbing stuff, and ripping up cords.  
-He claims to being observed by an ""audience"" of sorts, rather on a show where he is being watched, constantly hearing the clamor of voices.  

Drugs nullify the voices, but by not sleeping for 2-3 days, he gets super paranoid and I've heard him cry out for this show to stop for hours on end. Smashing the house ensues, etc etc... But I will say this.  
- He doesn't destroy my stuff - he does have no respect for things and doesn't take care of them or use them properly, he respects the space of the room I have (unless hes dying for smokes), His sensibility snaps to for a moment when I speak calmly/straight faced, and bring Jesus christ and different christian philosophies into perspective.  
  
He was screaming bloody murder the other night and ran away crying suicide. so I called the cops and tailed him for a bit. He was picked up, delivered to the hospital to see whats up, and then released. The officer said he seemed amiable at the time, buddy said he just had a bipolar episode and that we're all good. So they released him with no medication or proactive action. Basically saying that if something happens again, just to call. Which isnt much help at all..  

 Are there rehab facilities that abduct and imprison? The kind that provides 3 square meals a day, and a tinge of physical labor. honestly, planning to go to rehab just doesnt seem to work. It's gotta be a spur of the moment kind of scenario while he's in a sober place and desires change. 

How can I behave in a way that doesn't antagonize him?   
How can I even offer support and help him get to where he needs to be?  
What kind of tough love strategies work the best?  
What can the family do to help him?  
Which drugs also seem to help the best? Ive heard xyrem and general antipsycotics are the way to go.,
  
  Everyone else in his life are lost for what to do. At this point in my life, I have the time to be here and help, so I'm doing it until I can't. As a newfound tool in this strange situation, I've proposed to have a family meeting with his inlaws to decide what to do, possible intervention, and move onwards to rehab or something from there. 
I am in Canada BC.

schizophrenia,kaasbaas1251,2018/02/01,"i got really in a nightmare at 17 i start dating a girl i tought was 21 at 18 i moved to her country in south america there i developed schizophrenia, the first six months in her country i still had some insight and discovered she lied about her age and wanted to break up. but i start to lose my mind slowly and never broke up instead i stayed for 3 years with her with no clear reason. i spend 3 years in our room (i never went outside just waited whole day in the room for her to come home from work) before i realized something is really wrong  i went back to europe.

i realized i spend 3 years in a room doing nothing the whole day living in a sort of fantasy world.

after 6 months in the relationship instead of breaking up i stayed with her i used her for 3 years because of reasons i still don´t know (i lied to her that i worked on my computer and that i wanted to marry her and have children )

i remember her asking me if i was happy with her etc and i always told her that everything was ok (i didn´t knew i was mentally ill)

when i start putting everything together i went to doctor and he send me  to the mental hospital for 5 months i came out of the hospital with a sane mind but i am now mentally disabled because of everything i can´t have a conversation i can´t read i can´t do anything anymore.

first i didn´t feel any guilt that i used my girlfriend for 3 year since i was not sane and it was clear i even tought she was using me.

but after some email contact with her and thinking back at the relationship i don´t think she was really using me or had a clue that i was mentally ill i really suspect she is mentally retarded.

she kept me in her room and she never talked to me i remember she was always acting like a child.

we have email contact now but she really don´t understand the situation (that i was mentally ill those years).

i asked her why she didn´t break up with me if i lived together with her and never talked to her.. she responded with that she tought i was shy.

so bassicly i used a mentally disabled person for 3 years she is turning 30 (this is where the real guilt come froms) and i her country it is difficult to get married after 30 :/.

it is a year since i have been fired from the mental hospital and i spend atleast 10 hours a day feeling guilty about it and when i go to the psychiatric they tell me that my guilt obsession/rumination is because of psychosis...

i littery spend almost a year almost 10 hours a day feeling guilt and obsession/ruminating the first thing i do when i wake up is thinking about my ex and vomiting. in the day i go to a workplace for disabled people :/ but even if i work or do something else i still feel guilty and think about her.

honestly i don´t know how i can recover from this i have multiple problems that are suicide worthy

1.mentally disabled
2.my family need to help with with everything....
3.i used a mentally disabled woman for 3 years.

the guilt is horrible i can accept the mentally disabled part but a live spending 10 hours a day with imense guilt is not enjoyable.

i was such a evil person but normally i am a good person thats why that i think straight now i feel imense crippling guilt.

i too can´t accept that i am already 22 i still fill 18 (that is when i lost my mind).

tlrd : go to another country when i am 18 spend 3 years insane in a room and misled/used a woman for 3 years.

schizophrenia,ComfortableCurrent,2018/02/02,"Help me help my brother [24m] A few years back my brother was diagnosed with acute schizophenia that was triggered by what can easily be described as a very stressful even.

After diagnoses he went on a course of medication, and the symptoms subsided after a while and he stopped taking his medication.

He recently experienced another stressful event and I'm quite certain that he's now experiencing another episode.

I want to reach out to him and offer a place to stay with some stability and head space (currently he's couch surfing) but he's incredibly volatile.

He's also adamant that he wants to deal with his issues himself which guessing will not involve going back to see a psychiatrist/psychologist because ""he's not crazy"" (stated without a prompt).

FYI, I'm on medication myself for a different mental condition, so I'm at least familiar with getting some mental health help.

I was hoping people here could provide some advice on how to reach out to my brother and navigate his volatility. I'm not interested in telling him what he should or shouldn't do, I just want to offer a safe space.

Thanks.",7.901864686468649,8.551567222772281,8.032425742574263,67.45609735973599,62.41584158415842,11.28778877887789,39.11056105610561,11.038039088145766,4.668642244224422,897,45,146,23,12,292,124,202,0.058,0.7959999999999999,0.146,0.9296,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,9,7,0,2,10,0,10,8,1,2,1,35,25,13,0,7,7,3,0,0,0,3,7,0,1,0,6,12,0,2,0,0,0,2,5,2,0,0,4,3,14,5,26,16,5,25,0,0,1,0,27,10,0,6,11,92,20,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12609615146471848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10319304244826273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706188607229602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1984472071147816,0.0,0.07866143465407417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10302774130742633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13303431741508762,0.0,0.2619452624924753,0.0,0.13481907533792276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522953869313428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741794410515238,0.0,0.07333626435364096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14215183406437462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13243201274447045,0.1371632214005216,0.0,0.0,0.25947787565093355,0.0,0.0,0.1281655890480827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13468397471782598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3899819211209473,0.26008343755912244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08945991589198762,0.0,0.13481907533792276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13724965926389046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12741118688089545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282797490777128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13753920553983026,0.0,0.10788301005673756,0.2956291981381325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341217099797984,0.0970218337395615,0.0,0.11278643024366322,0.1188024659072288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10647130891149016,0.228332965763408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962114219622373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124389715404007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309736906607226
schizophrenia,av0cat0,2018/02/02,"Alternative to Medication: Communicating with the Voices. I have a loved one who has schizophrenia. Since learning of their diagnosis, I've been trying to learn as much about it as possible in hopes to be supportive. I found a wonderful TedTalk called The Voices In My Head by Eleanor Longden which was super helpful in destigmatizing and bringing awareness to the experiences of people with schizophrenia. Through this TedTalk, I found her organization based in the UK called the Hearing Voices Network (hearing-voices.org). I've been reading a lot of posts on reddit lately about people struggling to find medication that helps without awful side effects; consequently, I wanted to share this resource along with one of the articles on the website about an alternative method to medication: communicating with voices.

https://www.hearing-voices.org/personal-experiences/communicating-with-voices/

I feel that medication often alters or masks symptoms but doesn't truly get to the root of the problem the same way other methods like this one may. Of course, it may not work for everyone but I hope someone finds this useful. I thought it was really neat.",10.851721311475409,13.039905825136607,9.250396174863392,55.90379098360657,56.3224043715847,10.69016393442623,39.29371584699453,10.686352973137794,4.762286338797813,958,44,126,21,12,293,116,183,0.044,0.784,0.173,0.9695,0,0,2,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,1,3,4,10,0,1,14,1,10,7,1,3,0,32,24,6,0,4,5,0,1,1,0,2,5,5,0,0,12,6,0,0,10,1,0,1,3,2,0,3,7,6,10,8,34,14,3,11,0,0,0,1,10,7,0,8,2,92,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2562893999046439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11991610666056005,0.0,0.12275845286542413,0.0,0.0,0.06345417826725966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22940080302791724,0.0,0.0,0.2751981680148481,0.0,0.0,0.06556609796123683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287943504664675,0.0,0.14144228787811125,0.0,0.1682336657746735,0.0,0.0,0.24929023506499934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14156412861707365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06131064898764652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10669158919376732,0.11326437913156455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5056931193955571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225346173138194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2551165245429719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740052351590412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147705878337033,0.12018977675307375,0.0,0.0,0.12008202307499614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12552922891170898,0.0,0.08039548224118688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10381098261281403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633173342196718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311949021724212,0.0,0.0,0.14241054306488632,0.0,0.13043763484612095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09962922492177104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08520304932086192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838761850725273,0.0,0.0,0.07402036060148957,0.09961230250171486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12097296014884255,0.13609426499544014,0.09136204982542526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,CrispyCrunchyOnions,2018/02/02,"I Just Don’t Know What to do I‘m posting here out of desperation. I need advice. I just don’t know what to do anymore. 
A few years ago I started to randomly hear and see things. I saw shadow people, and heard random noises such as construction sounds and heartbeats. I never felt like I was really „there.“ I felt like I was watching a YouTube video of someone‘s life. I got extremely paranoid, and even persuaded my dad to board up the windows in my bedroom. I got depressed, and almost got kicked out of the one after-school-program I was apart of. 
I was 12 or 13 at the time, and all of this lasted for about 2 years. At the end of the first year, everything became unbearable, and I told my parents about everything. 
They told me that I was empathic, and that I was seeing the ghosts of dead family members, such as my Grandpa. They got mad whenever I tried to talk about it with them (because I didn’t, and still don’t believe that I’m empathic or psychic).  After a while, it got to the point to where they just started yelling at me, telling me that it was just a phase, and that everyone thinks they‘re crazy when they‘re my age. 
After the 2 years passed and I hit Highschool, everything stopped. The noises went away, the shadow people faded, and I stopped believing that people were out to get me. I still didn’t feel quite „there,“ but I got along pretty fine. Everything was wonderful. I stopped complaining to my parents, and my parents went about their lives believing that the „phase“ had passed. 
That was a year ago now, and everything is back. Worse this time. I see black bugs, people, cats, and flashes of light everywhere I go. My ears ring quite often, I hear heartbeats all the time, and the strange noises are back. 
Everything feels so overwhelming. I don’t feel here at all. I don’t feel in control of my thoughts or actions. I don’t feel much emotion anymore, and when I do it feels like it‘s merely washing over me. I’m not actually experiencing it. 
The paranoia‘s back, but it‘s in a different form. I constantly think people are talking, laughing, and looking at me. Even total strangers on the street. I feel like I’m constantly being watched, even if I’m alone. 
I‘m having trouble concentrating. School work feels like a huge task to me. 
I just don’t know what to do. Should I try telling my parents? I‘m scared that they‘ll get mad at me, or that I’ll disappoint them. What if they don’t take any of this seriously? Or am I just overreacting, and what I’m saying is perfectly normal for a 15 year old? 
Should I tell my guidance counselor? Or the mental health counselor at my school? They‘ll just tell my parents anyway.
I‘m sorry for the long post. I just don’t know what to do.

schizophrenia,veryhotpoops,2018/02/02,"Friend having paranoid delusions - I'm the only one he has told. How can I tell him in the right way that he needs help? Hey guys - posted something similar to r/mental health with almost no responses. I think this might be a better place to get some advice. 

My good friend went through an alcohol / drug binge last summer. Mid 20s. He was a mess. During this time he developed paranoia that a cartel was following him, or the government.

Now, 6 months later, he is totally sober, but he just (three days ago) told me that he is being watched still. He has moved to a bunch of different states since last summer. Changes his phone number over and over (because they are listening to it). And is extremely isolated running from his delusions. 

I'm the only one he has told. How do I let him know that he needs help? What might I be able to say to him to get him to see a psychiatrist? I don't want him to cut me off, because I'm sort of the last person he trusts I think.",2.6400275735294123,4.578281109375002,3.626164215686277,89.1808455882353,76.44791666666666,7.01764705882353,23.27328431372549,7.928766900206844,1.1195743872549024,751,23,156,12,17,241,119,192,0.07,0.828,0.102,0.7943,1,0,3,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,1,1,5,7,1,0,11,0,19,3,0,2,1,20,37,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,3,2,0,2,8,3,1,0,3,0,0,4,2,2,0,3,6,4,18,5,18,25,3,26,0,0,2,0,34,7,0,6,12,90,26,1,0.12946588967800865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265125690114513,0.1147636996747675,0.13835966297455407,0.12964138720350807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15784240937754213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11450205848626978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369577447149794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349478839649149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526429930354644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501393293268577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000500504224089,0.0,0.13528116769844034,0.0,0.0,0.10858984579438223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12819158537940806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13761618662978606,0.0,0.0,0.17355651365468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07115106714151434,0.3165959390090689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323876437781552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13047116609320314,0.2746856992469432,0.0,0.0,0.103338437964351,0.1376017517934067,0.0,0.1919946334798238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1754588748987578,0.1969292861130968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130446211346795,0.13526429930354644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12399253463415932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056316239541633,0.0,0.102956471852269,0.0,0.0,0.1031675520681304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10709552180523764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996691670052221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339162673476512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315889401865767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16591302900432792,0.0,0.0,0.07549260140835229,0.0,0.0,0.371130617178456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07636233607762682,0.10276399708527093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200161767947592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,ChocoChat,2018/02/02,"Lymphatic massage is helping with fear symptoms. Ok long story but I have to share it with you guys. So last semester I had a massive anxiety attack (uni admin shit) and I'm still feeling the residual effects. I'm stiff, my asthma flared up, and I have this looming sense of dread. 

I figured I could at least take care of the stiff part and went to a massage therapist who does walking massages (like walk on your back). Was freakin' amazing. She mentioned afterwards that it wasn't my muscles that were stiff, but that my lymph nodes were swollen and what she had done would encourage them to drain. Warned me that it is fatiguing and to stay warm to encourage the draining (Canadian winter, ya right). This was back in January, and it did seem to help my breathing. 

I looked into it. Apparently that can happen if you have a low immune system (check) or experience moments of extreme stress (double check). So I thought I'd try again, massaging the pressure points. Got my husband to help. Immediately, the sense of dread lifted. Was totally exhausted today (skipped class and slept) but holy cow to I feel relaxed. And my chest isn't tight. Even caught myself think 'Ya, I'm OK' several times instead of the 'I hate myself' mantra that has been going on. 

I'm going to try and do this more regularly, and see if it continues to help. I thought I'd share incase anyone else is interested in trying it.

schizophrenia,Notcarriemathisonbp,2018/02/03,"Is this a symptom of schizophrenia? I already have a diagnosis of Bipolar 2, but I don't think it explains *all* the symptoms I experience. 

For example, I often have really intense conversations with myself, to the point that occasionally family have noted that I laugh to myself etc. They're not external voices- they are my own, and I know they're a product of my imagination- but it's the intensity that worries me.

My inner voice is sometimes so disabling that I can't function. There's simply too much going on in my brain for me to do anything constructive. 

Another thing I've noticed that Bipolar fails to explain is my disassociation. I also get really bad headaches, almost as if I'm about to get a stroke. It goes far, far beyond mere anxiety.

Does anyone else here relate to these symptoms, or are they just a side effect of poor mental health in general?

schizophrenia,pennycenturie,2018/02/03,"Lamps There's this guy I've been seeing that I've been crazy about for a year, and last night the lighting in his house allowed me to see he's a piece of shit. Normally he's got xmas lights and a lamp on and maybe a light in the kitchen? Last night the kitchen light was definitely not on and the lamp got to me so I turned it off, and we left the xmas lights on his ceiling on. The room was vibrating with fear and it felt like the kind of place I could die, or at least not live correctly, like houses with no mother and you don't know which way is up and which way is down... there are no answers and there's no safety and there's no grownup and it's never night *or* day because it's just fear extending in every direction til you're lucky enough to be asleep. Everything he said was garbage in his mouth and I realized he's really committed to disrespecting and invalidating me. There are things I've enjoyed about hooking up with him and I feel accomplished about it but it's such a revelation that he's really seen so little in me this whole time... It's not like I thought it was more than sex but given how much there is to like about me, it's like... what's *his* fucking problem, that he thinks all of that is such a joke? The image of the lighting itself is haunting me and by this morning I knew the lighting was enough to at least keep me from going back to his house any time in the near future, but the tone of the lighting in my memory and realizing how disinterested in me he's always been is, I'm pretty sure, the end of it.

Yesterday right before I got to this guy's house was also the first time my friend in my head got loud in a really long time, and he (in my head) seemed to want to stay. He (in my head) is not here anymore but I wish he was. One day with him (in my head) is better than years with fuckface could be. I'll be careful and not agitate myself and I'm taking my meds and I'm not going overboard with stimulants because I don't want to put my family through all of that again, with the hospitals and the risk of catatonia and everything. But that's for them, because all things considered I prefer nonlucidity. This part is not really the point of my post but I guess it was kind of a perfect storm and it's just so unexpected that I'd want to end things with this guy so I'm pretty disoriented by that on top of the positive symptoms.

With this guy... I honestly never knew someone could have that little taste for who I am as a person. I know the sex has been good for him and being a woman with a very low sex drive that will never fully make sense to me but, like I said, I just had no idea he was so *invested* in treating me poorly. I've been with wonderful men in my life who have loved me and have shown me so every day, and it makes me sick that he's been treating me in a way so completely reversed from that, and, of course, it makes me sick that I didn't know and that I might have gone on not realizing what I am to him. So... fucking lamps, amirite?

schizophrenia,schizo20,2018/02/03,"Every time I hear something about schizophrenia, I'm back I thought I was good for much longer. Dang.

Well, looking at my post history, I guess it's been around 2 months or less that I've been pretty stable. Anyways, long story short, I'm in this group messing around and they put up some mental health links. For schizo, they put ""Delusional / Schizo"" and I got on it super quick because I thought they were EXPLICITLY identifying schizos by one symptom that plays a huge role in the stigma. I started looking in the DSM-5 to check if Delusional Disorder was on the schizo spectrum so we could just put schizo spectrum. Then when I was typing out the message, I forgot the word ""stigma"", but remembered what it meant, so I went on /r/schizophrenia to find the word. Then I was looking through all the posts and now I'm listening to Pink. Fucking. Floyd. Last time I was listening to that was in the crux of the crucible!!

I'm feeling the RAGE building back up. If you were to look back in my post history, you would've seen that I've made it so far without meds. Now we're back.

schizophrenia,brandoncc26,2018/02/03,Things are getting worse. I’m at a point in my life we’re I can’t even go into my own living room in my house because cars outsid are so loud. I haven’t been able to sleep because I’m being attacked by people in their cars at night. They are using the car sound vibrations to numb my body parts and mess with my head. They also attack my heart with their car sounds. It’s not normal but sickness makes anything possible. I just don’t know how anyone can go trough somethi like this. I don’t know why others think but others know what I think. I wouldn’t feel the way I feel if I was just a coincidence the way people are driving outside my house and are attacking me. I’m seeing a therapist and a physiatrist and am taking invega . I’ve taken multiple medications and been hospitalized about 4 times within the same year. I’m trying to fix my issues but it’s hard when people are the sickness and know what your thinking because there your mental illness. I feel harassed and attacked and that’s not a mental illness that’s really actually a crime the way people are attacking me. And I think people are going through what I’m going though but not on this level because I can never knowingly attack someone or feel what they feel in their mind and body.,4.448644444444447,5.705912860000005,5.355466666666668,81.40417777777779,70.4,7.795555555555558,26.288888888888888,8.167268648758528,1.6669822222222224,1005,31,189,14,18,329,131,250,0.17800000000000002,0.809,0.013,-0.9906,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,6,0,10,10,7,0,12,0,20,12,5,3,1,46,49,21,0,3,11,0,6,1,0,1,7,3,1,0,13,13,0,0,14,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,4,10,29,1,17,43,3,29,0,0,1,0,8,12,0,2,6,123,42,0,0.08490676142151868,0.0,0.08285675119982015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678999064328205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059368781766460786,0.0,0.06987103012498026,0.0,0.0,0.5795621919302336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20703349474596205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886245421602081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05608011514417461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21465704868725585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04436027844540051,0.0,0.19301787677173549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07605978084611867,0.0,0.08713883281974133,0.0,0.0,0.10061492109461688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959420057608581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886205994549074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333126778681222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0599721565832685,0.04148115482437514,0.0,0.07497422589918129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05667592256067134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08553462948783551,0.17113209045895353,0.0,0.08573162483882779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548532874408293,0.0,0.0,0.07967924385233671,0.08319059878069011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919457485160061,0.0,0.29431828805703625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08026433383397158,0.09571961602743234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05439344552850718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765969593749127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08496808006918156,0.0,0.07194122341959762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06383931781214576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858329419844804,0.05640827949697998,0.21761929733658414,0.08342046200146794,0.0,0.049509815386975714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0576461175790143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07333218060129437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20218510539590065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661514578099643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08652724367609015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05467717057793608
schizophrenia,ElectricRealms,2018/02/03,"Thought broadcasting I have been un-diagnosed as schizophrenic recently but I know I still am, I had another run in with thought broadcasting when watching the movie Shrek. Here's some things I ran into:

Theres a part in Shrek where donkey says: ""Look at my eye *Eye twitches* I'm gonna need therapy after this""

The problem that stirred up for me is my brothers name is Fletcher and he does the same thing with his eye sometimes out of nowhere and he thinks it's funny.

Also, later in the movie, donkey says ""Mother Fletcher, he already said it!"" Which made me think some more because he directly mentioned my brothers name.

Now that I'm sort of sober I realize this is just coincidence but it's hard to get out of old thought patterns they're like bad habits.",2.9863926940639267,5.56481590410959,3.319698630136987,88.5981324200913,78.31506849315069,6.633059360730593,28.22648401826484,7.793537801064563,1.878235251141552,606,27,116,10,15,187,100,146,0.07200000000000001,0.878,0.05,-0.4753,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,0,5,0,7,5,3,1,0,26,22,7,0,2,3,3,1,1,0,1,2,3,0,0,10,7,0,0,7,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,8,9,12,1,17,13,5,18,0,0,5,0,14,9,0,3,8,68,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204249320002072,0.14801488607984262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19408101016620474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15454083171790842,0.1128279873620083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187860524639619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16197184291859554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09670089261554983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658025818980264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017195788621608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042469612038254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15542738772014264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17513483472982785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13724048033263933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19421882496723072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20043237475720896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17710431426464182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827521687901428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17606116711133538,0.29437897079230857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18305686282408948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14781159512922798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21166437205172328,0.0,0.2459286176473923,0.2371939609071409,0.0,0.4408178287303206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I guess I just don't like having to add another person to the list of people around whom I've been involuntarily vulnerable. I guess I could just not go, but I'm trying to stay stable.

schizophrenia,H715,2018/02/04,"My brother has schizo and I’m scared I might too I have no hallucinations 
At school I have a fear of people trying to hurt me if they instantly make an instant action 
When I’m home alone I get shit scared that someone’s in the house 
Sometimes I get over excited and say shit to my self 
I have a wild fucking imagination 

I’m unsure if any of this has any sort of relation with schizophrenia but I just want to know ... thanks

schizophrenia,little_kid13,2018/02/04,"Should I be worried? Hi, I'm 13. I'm quite a hypochondriac btw. But I think I may have auditory hallucinations, for the past couple days different voices of different people and myself have been saying my thoughts, in my mind. I don't actually hear these voices with my ears, it's in my mind, like a voice thought. I saw this was a symptom of auditory hallucinations and schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. Also, there was a song stuck in my head and I also saw this was related to auditory hallucinations. And then when I was studying my mum was watching a drama show and I could hear it in the background but wasn't paying attention to it but it sounded like a song and I was singing along to it under my breath, but when she stopped watching I couldn't hear it. Also at night I was trying to sleep when I heard a noise in what I thought was inaudible voices but I wasn't paying attention because I was thinking, then I realized and noticed them and got really shocked when in reality it probably might've been my stomach rumbling. Also later that night I heard a deep beeping/pumping noise coming from outside my window. But when I went to check I couldn't hear it, then when I went to bed I could hear it again, but then later the sound went away, I was also absorbing every thing I heard, wondering if it's real or a noise. I googled it and started worrying out of this world. I've already set up to see a psychiatrist due to other psychological issues but I don't think I'll be able see the psychiatrist until three months. I have a couple questions:
Do you actually hear auditory hallucinations?
Do you actually hear other voices reading your thoughts or is it in your mind like mine?
How soon should I see a psychiatrist? (Because on websites they advise you to see a psychiatrist  soon but how soon is soon? In a few days, weeks, months, years?)
How often do schizophreniacs experience auditory hallucinations? (Every couple minutes, hours, days?)
How long do the auditory hallucinations each last when you get them?

schizophrenia,lightedpathway2,2018/02/04,"How it started for me - a rumor I couldn't live down. I just remembered something very important about the college housing situation I was in, from where I began a long walk of over a decade of living on the streets off and on as a schizophrenic. 

The only problem I had in that college housing situation was a rumor that I couldn't live down. I had done one thing which was inappropriate - allowing a homeless person in one time for one shower. The idea is that some people when they are kids learn a way of taking care of business when they learn that someone around them is going to cause problems for their environment. If their own personal world is going to end, they believe that it justifies a lot of creative action in this kind of way. 

The management of that kind of situation is going to believe that ""where there is smoke, there is fire"" - and they won't want to or be able to explain the situation to you because the rumor or false complaint is being orchestrated in such a subtle way.

So, what I did is that I started acting weird on purpose to be able to bring the rumor to a grounding point. ""Maybe we can agree that the reason the person is complaining (no matter what they're complaining about) is that is I am a vulnerable and weird person.""

I ended up acting catatonic, going into psychiatric therapy on the request of my parents, and then being kicked out of the college housing complex.  

The problem is that in the process of this happening, one loses the support of the most important people in your life - your birth family. There is something about the American mindset, where people will emotionally wall you out without realizing that they're doing so, when you get tangled up with a taboo - like mental illness. Then, because the psychiatrist was prescribing a drug that I knew I didn't need, and that had potentially very bad side effects, and taking this was a demand of my family, I didn't feel I could rely on the support of these people and so I had to basically go live on the streets for a few months. I had done this before in another city in the USA, so it wasn't an unthinkable thing to do.

...

So being I am who I am, I often to look out with inductive reasoning to ponder whether my situation is like the general situation. Does the above story sound similar to anything you folks have experienced?

Furthermore, is insanity really about mental patterns being askew, or is it a way to categorize types of behavior?

People can have all kinds of weird daydreams, and it doesn't ever affect their behavior until they choose to act out. This is what I firmly believe. Kids have all kinds of daydreams after school... and young adults do, as well. I think it often happens

- When you move out of the house for the first time at 18

- When you meet someone you might want to date

- When you move overseas to a strange country

All these transition periods are times when some people - not all, but some - are prone to daydreaming.

So... when we have lost confidence in our ability to think, we become hypersensitive to our daydreams, not realizing that no one can see inside our minds, and we lose hope in the possibility of actually going out and making a fresh start.

Now, when we're lost in the woods, scared... and the riptide of delusions is pulling our mind out to sea... it seems very big... but there's hope.",10.47673476923077,7.795448014400003,10.059560000000001,65.75564153846156,59.256,13.135384615384615,40.83846153846153,11.437924896087663,4.577414769230772,2639,105,468,55,26,862,272,625,0.065,0.871,0.064,0.7728,2,0,4,0,0,0,82.0,8,10,9,6,35,26,0,1,47,0,63,4,0,8,5,91,98,40,0,12,11,1,2,2,0,3,4,1,1,7,36,27,0,1,19,0,0,15,12,14,1,6,20,6,53,12,93,66,11,95,0,4,2,0,45,45,0,15,33,364,89,8,0.11635142394504212,0.0,0.05677110293783901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06100230643695801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04787365406147755,0.05178871762272522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048574289495942606,0.07092674810202476,0.06425050324008949,0.049503246044964096,0.19663231692776645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05931401556394183,0.05976248143317312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046448572209291134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05090995758635797,0.11906790304734045,0.0,0.0,0.06746535632196263,0.0,0.0,0.06543984573232499,0.10305282668303226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05262326210151172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10968576748383364,0.0,0.02941538795786957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049484230884750166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03039440839167853,0.0,0.19837558664275334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10288917993812227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11556321709281413,0.0,0.2685078431827403,0.0,0.06567329764497744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2423242067985071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0410912258263914,0.05684342860211373,0.0,0.20548087800075152,0.05148367441278729,0.048852946129456114,0.13016748185287616,0.12701132365503656,0.0494589099358901,0.0,0.0,0.03883273948346468,0.0,0.058445322023549226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172548691896324,0.061715236971314424,0.11748177012192225,0.0,0.04643529826779921,0.12366315018043428,0.0,0.04313655328585456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1971068401591998,0.04424525045308415,0.0,0.0,0.06459724351413904,0.0,0.0,0.2419902820589108,0.20318715101035514,0.0,0.0,0.05499485186591972,0.06558437418767127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16699889866855586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03726885076383882,0.1196286421177968,0.0,0.0,0.06590174098758429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05824403651950294,0.058876926369222975,0.04635851040727919,0.052960983252846185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3923516263433709,0.0,0.0,0.09858418393399226,0.08957301056915867,0.0,0.0,0.12353120508868998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13203421706607915,0.0,0.0,0.08748179069329992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06652899670414987,0.0,0.0772987160490163,0.07455329439939608,0.0,0.0,0.10176817646357966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440031650922921,0.06862708440423243,0.18470868922915107,0.0,0.0,0.0523069516854344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056079310336387314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,crow000,2018/02/04,"Mother In Law Hello, I've never posted to this sub before but seriously need advise.  My mother in law was diagnosed as schizophrenic 30+ years ago, shortly after the birth of my husband.  Recently me father in law and I thought it would be a good idea to get her a dog.  I helped pick the dog and I was to help train and walk.  Since having the dog my mother in law has become extremely possessive over the dog and wants to spend every waking moment with it.  This has become bad enough that my father in law doesn't know what to do. The last time my husband and I had the kids at their house she sucluded herself and the dog away from the kids.  The kids mentioned this and apparently she kept asking my father in law when the kids were going home.  They are well behaved kids and previous to the dog visit them almost weekly.  There are many training issues with the dog (puppy) causing arguments between my in laws but my father in law fears what it would do to get rid of the dog.

schizophrenia,imnomortalman,2018/02/04,"How do I get my father to eat and start taking his meds again? My father has schizophrenia and occasionally drops off his meds and stops eating. His delusions are of a religious nature and I think he spent most of his life with churches feeding into his delusions. When he drops his meds and stops eating, he says that god is telling him to do it and that the meds stop him from thinking clearly. He does not like talking about it and will start to isolate himself more and more.

This has happened a few times over the last few years and my siblings and I have not found any way of helping him get back on his meds. He had to be hospitalized once, nearly was hospitalized again but managed to pull himself out of it, and another time we caught the downward spiral early before he dropped his meds and managed to convince him to talk with his psychiatrist about it and we got it sorted.

It's happening again and we just aren't sure what to do. We've asked him to just trust us, we've asked him to stay in one of our houses to have a change of surroundings (has helped in the past), we've explained to him countless times that the meds put him in a mindset where he can actually address stessors that are setting him off. But nothing gets through to him. After reading stories on this subreddit, I think I'm starting to understand why. Do you all have any advice? Any way for us to be the best support we can be while he's spiraling out and putting walls up?

Thanks!",6.0973437179749945,6.273352630662025,5.836626357860219,83.28617134658744,66.24738675958189,8.425415044066408,32.56179544988727,7.928766900206844,2.158461119081779,1163,45,231,12,17,361,149,287,0.033,0.879,0.08900000000000001,0.9656,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,7,1,0,1,11,7,0,0,10,0,22,5,0,1,3,45,45,20,0,0,6,2,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,13,24,4,3,6,1,1,4,3,0,0,1,6,1,36,7,42,35,7,48,1,0,0,0,48,17,0,2,21,160,49,3,0.0,0.0,0.08184795434770921,0.0,0.0,0.08195973007085529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17110955919859147,0.08794815908058103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15681987586671287,0.0,0.0,0.06449316390513887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136974997276434,0.0,0.0880195445106176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08872651844526834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07339783214947437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2574690700262183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196242118323457,0.0,0.0,0.13146055061806566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06708090428438852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833724318636998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243661497292602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09677818711257953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836769370154716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05924198406383671,0.040976113801129616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6521480075201067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047841065416697,0.0,0.0,0.08932201332723276,0.05683451904267511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006627398856637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16863107241485525,0.0,0.0,0.08389570252780464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06669918023161625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17809723453298593,0.08939746399285194,0.0,0.2103647640496524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951780924759618,0.07904931490033508,0.0,0.06306206186236213,0.1348278892166017,0.07330870348578744,0.07721899458789483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16122730546087313,0.0,0.0,0.1467210716402852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731475645917047,0.20177779673367327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331489752824259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07568234167307893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05401146552961317

Last night I went to the ER because my pulse was 130, and I had chest pain, (for two days) While I was there they gave me Ativan, (they think the heart rate and pain is from anxiety). About 30 minutes after the injection I started hallucinating badly. The ceiling was dripping onto the floor. People in the paintings were dancing. That was about 20 hours ago, and I'm still hallucinating. I'd been episode free for about a year and a half. There's more hallucinations, but I just wanted to vent.

schizophrenia,son_off,2018/02/05,"Reduction Ive been on meds for nearly 3 years now, starting april 2015.i am getting Xeplion shots, which are Invega Sustaina here in Europe. I was lucky that i could start a job in academia only a few months later in october 2015. My first 1.5 years at work were terrible. I didnt understand anything, i couldnt follow conversations, when i would get nervous my jaws began to chew involuntarily. It was the most terrible time of my life. My work Environment didnt know about my illness, yet they i managed to somehow meet the minimum requirement and they prolonged my contract. In december 2016 i had my first reduction to 50mg every 4 weeks. I felt lighter after a few weeks, but i was still cognitively impaired. I took part in a class for cognitive texhniques offered by my university for normal phd students and there we would play ""Cognition"" games that required quick reaction and processing and such. I lost all the games. When the others had a ten point average, i had 1 or 2 points.
It was still very hopeless until i had my second reduction in july 2017 to 25mg. I was taking a 3month training and i did well on all the exams and got a certificate. But more importantly my thoughts came back. I was thinking again (also libido came back strongly). And a few months later in november and december, after two years i reached a break through in my research. I understood what was being asked of me. Im almost normal again.

That being said, it also important to note, that even without treatment i was very functional, and i believe in my case the medication did more damage than good.

In any case, from.my experience it is absolutely crucial to reduce medication to a minimum to stay functioning, following these researches:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23824214
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524699/#!po=8.18182
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22340278

Maybe relapse prevention should not be considered more important than functioning and less medication means higher cognitive and therefore also social abilities.

Now, after the reduction, i still feel slightly impared by the medication, but no longer hopeless. Im almost normal, even if not at the top of my game.",7.8021711366538975,9.857440220159154,7.2269083407014465,68.11882601434327,63.244031830238725,10.784124177227623,37.03988603988604,10.825029732296443,4.677803693879556,1781,87,264,49,27,555,217,377,0.08,0.8540000000000001,0.066,-0.7402,1,0,0,0,0,2,77.0,1,0,2,9,24,12,0,1,19,0,30,8,1,1,2,49,53,22,0,9,8,0,2,0,0,3,6,1,0,0,12,14,1,3,8,4,0,5,7,7,1,5,28,3,39,5,40,17,11,58,0,4,0,0,12,18,0,7,33,197,51,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19454236166406436,0.0,0.0,0.2330472771984469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06605819333295898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07993753443429655,0.0,0.09081232276243767,0.0,0.0,0.14938856402366135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944295572344087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222034271450256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07755798911100546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283194516353365,0.0,0.08184422116412259,0.0,0.0,0.09502107388480643,0.0,0.0,0.04911665160885399,0.0,0.09326915672358133,0.0,0.0,0.1652536238501746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015027624296154,0.0,0.0,0.08147600665678482,0.07769133469086156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20985466567919345,0.0,0.09639596820281963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053385330623236533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06861250397194432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10603924284933422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09758968755093232,0.1058133965684968,0.10790008968748772,0.3914313201209915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15507164961681502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28552826583833235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387896957072862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519261595168136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1836564578544859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240191240752324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09902149059839226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13751168088968072,0.10353778574805653,0.2327271985646379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07303681735824193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224307142493101,0.0,0.07711791507144372,0.056642825578108714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10792556244681388,0.0,0.0,0.09489117985027516,0.10112564879509532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16030052706972486,0.0,0.0,0.15583890044441606,0.0,0.08734007949629337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936390147973636,0.0,0.14143743072823073,0.0,0.0,0.13801023222152234,0.0,0.0,0.1876639659394848

schizophrenia,DaWeakPeeps312,2018/02/05,"Is this Schizophrenia or just Psychosis? Hello,Im 14,Male and a HS dropout aswell..It's gonna be very long and probably only a few will read it all but it's okay..

Let's just start from the beginning, Also i have ADHD...So it's gonna be boring but you can skip to the 4th one and continue there if you wanna go and just skip my story...So i got depressed when i was 12, Probably because of the feeling of disconnection....Just around maybe 2 or 3 months after my depression started, I dropped out, Everyone got mad which made it worse, But i couldn't tell it since i already know they wouldn't understand,Fast forward to age 13,I was right that they didn't understand,I tried approaching 2 of my family members but nothing,My mom avoided the subject, While my grandma said i was crazy..At this time,I was alone, I made my diary at march 2017 thankfully.

At march,This is where i started cutting myself, Cutting made it worse,Along with it,I also got Psychosis and Anxiety at this age,13...I red my diary and all it has is ""Master.""...That's what i call him back then and until now...Im sure he's not real since he doesn't know what i dont know but he's still scary..At this time,My psychosis kicks in every night, I usually see shadows at the edge of my eyes and hands grabbing me, I see a lot of things but i rarely see actual shadows, Only body parts..Tongues, Feet, Eyes, A head and more....He also touches me aswell Usually on the leg and stomach, sometimes on the cheek or neck...So My anxiety got worse right after the Psychosis part...

So i think around 1 - 3 months after my Psychosis, my anxiety got pumped..This is where i became a Night Owl, I treated daytime as a punishment, I got extremely sensitive to day or light,I never wake up when it's day because i hate talking to people and how happy they are, I hated people and that was a delusion of mine, Demons are real, That my thoughts arent mine and that people are worse than demons...That's what the voices inside me tells me, i believe it because no one came to me when im sad or alone, Except for my demons...This is really edgy :/ but oh well...I started going outside at Midnight...When there's some people walking,I look down...But i dont go outside when there's a party or a lot of people at night..I hate people..I hated talking too,It was like a level beyond embarassment, At this time, I rarely talks,I only talk when im talking to myself or my demons, or when im asking food...Fun fact, I only eat once a day,Most of the time once in 2 days..Im extremely thinner compared to my 12 yrs old self lol..

So fast forward to 14,This is where i got it worse,At my early 14's, Im still controlled but it got way worse,This time i was trying to fight him,I wasn't scared of going into daytime since im fighting him, And i got control atleast a little bit..But i hear voices and bugs that aren't even real, He always appears as things i hate...Roaches, Forceful people, Eerie sounds etc.. He does this all the time..Im forced to do it,At 13, He already force me to do things,But at 14,It was way stronger...He says ""Im gonna punch you"" and i go punching myself, Until i cant take the pain, I sometimes get scars or bruises because of this, And he started to make me even more scared to the point that it drives me crazy, When this happens, It feels like gravity betrayed me,I'll only move if he tells me to, I can move alone but it's extremely tiring...Im gonna skip some things since it's probably disgusting for some...

At this point, I just lost it all,He started controlling over my body just saying nothing...He only talks to me if im doing something,Saying negative things...I lost emotion on my face, i compare my face to the 10 years old me and its nowhere near...I also hated everything else,I thought of the World, Life and Me as a Punishment..I always get tormented Physically, Emotionally, Mentally and Psychologically..I lost touch of speaking or just talking...I talk like im drunk, And sometimes i get words all wobbled up like ""How'd this he do that?"" with like no tone, Just a simple flat tone...So i again went inside, This is where i officially planned my Suicide attempt,  I've been suicidal since i was 12, And also i have a lot,lot of failed suicide attempts...I forced my parents to let us go to our Auntie's condo, I said i'll stay there for a week..So before my grandma and the others left the condo, I hugged her, I planned that i'll jump at 12:00MD ( Btw her room is at the 27th floor,Sure death if i go head first ) After 7 attempts of doing it,I couldn't...so i just went home and just dissapointed...Anothet fun fact for everyone who red till here, I've never gotten to treatment once, Not once at all.

Im also showing signs of DID, It's because of my connection with my past life that she's starting to be like me, It's pretty unreal but it has a long story of it's own aswell...

schizophrenia,layoum,2018/02/06,"Distinction between insecurity and paranoia. I am sorry if you get asked this all the time. I did read the FAQ but I hope you can give me some insight. 
I have 3 cousins diagnosed with schizophrenia. Their cases are unfortunately severe even with medication. I have suffered anhedonia, sleep deprivation and depressive state. I had some auditive hallucination phone ringing people calling my name, door opening. I had a few visual hallucinations : someone coming out of a wall, and bugs which is pretty recurring. I have never took any drugs and I've always suspected my sleep problems. I have never really worried about this as it all can be explained away easily.

Recently people have been telling I was being paranoid more and more. I think that people are always hiding something from me and basically acting around me I just can't trust them. This has obviously isolated me and made me bitter towards people. I can't hear anyone laughing around me without feeling they are mocking me. I think people are running away from me sometimes. 

Anyway I still think I am just being my insecure self.

schizophrenia,concentriccarl,2018/02/06,"Friend with schizophrenia at a bachelor party Hey guys - I'm holding my bachelor party in two weeks, and I've invited a great lifelong friend of mine. He had developed schizophrenia in our late teens/early twenties (almost 10 years ago now), and had a quite a scary episode while treatment was getting figured out. Since then he has stabilized and we have remained friends - though we see each other much less nowadays since we live in different cities and have gone on different walks of life. This is the first time we'll be hanging out on an overnight trip, and this is the first time I'll be hanging out with him in a big group where I know drinking and maybe smoking weed will be involved and we'll be away from home. I'm not 100% sure what his triggers are, but I'm pretty sure he has a good sense of what he can/can't do in terms of triggering any symptoms. As far as I know, he has been completely stable and successfully managing since that first episode. I know he's gone on various trips with some of his friends where there was drinking involved - but I also know those groups of friends have their own illnesses that they all help manage together. Also one or two of my buddies on the trip know about the illness, but nobody else has met him before (obviously I don't say anything to them under any circumstances).

I could never imagine not inviting him - he's one of my lifelong friends. And I hate to have to wonder about this for my good friend for my bachelor party.  I don't want this shitty illness to prevent him from being a part of this. But a part of me is concerned about safety. Should I talk to him ahead of time? Should I make sure there is (and he knows that there is) an exit plan if he's feeling overwhelmed? Should I not say anything at all but just keep this in the back of my head if I sense he's not feeling well? 

EDIT: Was I in the right to invite him? I'd feel guilty if I didn't but I don't know what I'd do with myself if something happens on the trip.

Thanks everyone for your suggestions.

schizophrenia,MHThrowaway98,2018/02/06,"Looking for a little guidance on staying well Hi all! I'm not diagnosed with schizophrenia but had a suspected psychotic episode (no hallucinations, but general weird behaviour and thoughts) aged 16 that resulted in me staying in the hospital for a while. Anyway, since then I've been relatively well; I've struggled with depression, anxiety, social isolation and some negative symptoms (avolition mostly) but not had any really challenging behaviours or thoughts since, and have not been on any medication for probably about 4 years.

However, I'm now 21 and in my final year of uni, and am starting to find it really difficult. I lose track of my thoughts a lot, my anxiety and depression is kicking in a bit, I'm very isolated, really struggling to motivate myself to get anything done (my daily routine is usually just sit around and watch TV, I eat one meal a day and shower, but other than that not much else), and I have transient ""scary"" thoughts - I recognise they are irrational and am not scared by them, but I do think about them a lot. Basically, I'm quite worried about my mental health at the moment. I've not seen a doctor, because I'm not really sure how to explain it all, but I just wondered, what can ***I*** do at home to keep myself well? I'd really rather avoid going back on the meds unless it's absolutely necessary (obviously if I have to, I can't really argue about it), and I don't really know if this is just stress and a total lack of routine making me feel a bit out of it or if it's something more insidious. Another complicating factor is that I do tend to focus on schizophrenia a lot since I know I'm high-risk for developing the condition, so there may be an element of that causing me to jump to that conclusion.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything like that, and I'm not scared and ruminating about whether or not I'm schizophrenic, I just wanted to know how you guys cope when you're finding it a little difficult? I'm not taking any drugs and keeping alcohol consumption to a minimum, and I'm keeping to a good sleep pattern, but is there anything else I can do to stay well?

Thanks and I hope you're all doing well! :)",6.361231884057973,6.769878282608698,7.428303381642515,71.30051304347828,65.69082125603865,11.551536231884056,35.64212560386473,11.288533730351634,4.303928618357489,1715,79,310,51,25,581,207,414,0.157,0.7390000000000001,0.104,-0.9788,2,2,3,0,0,0,58.0,0,1,3,5,25,24,1,6,20,0,27,11,1,6,6,94,64,39,0,7,32,0,1,1,0,1,8,0,2,1,16,21,3,4,16,1,0,2,15,13,5,1,10,5,29,11,45,52,14,33,0,3,4,0,9,14,0,15,14,216,45,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827960003424649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15805465460800291,0.0812381024882294,0.11853458928834455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19126316899926846,0.06896816523350331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059572619983045076,0.0,0.047227348997236115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691627899768929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958700047901217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04996423365053535,0.0,0.1334562527443702,0.07863434212907543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792977836420842,0.0,0.07928266221224503,0.0,0.0,0.08984508703703734,0.07927510523244657,0.12943894590078614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0391731139563057,0.0,0.0,0.08486883217833223,0.14161941804417486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04047689682920472,0.0,0.04403018284645005,0.06498140221137569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671130674065448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235109561826542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08185539194758508,0.07771260339435937,0.07694902883514394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065869926742145,0.0,0.0,0.12773283020714624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03784981706661469,0.15529833162233098,0.0,0.0,0.13011706856094452,0.08667343785047557,0.0,0.1975965285089789,0.0,0.0,0.051714406459640906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08605599874527327,0.07804676828989437,0.07807543383884467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05695220500762116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052498295940767783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0835299299278527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08240299183853965,0.0,0.0,0.34742219210516306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15512970851321495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1922615450796596,0.0,0.07752981566535827,0.0789748488195973,0.0,0.059643166281889815,0.0,0.0,0.05483640037916964,0.2477304954860389,0.0,0.0,0.08874605056239916,0.16198501008524938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301820086551053,0.08052500991340555,0.058250704713440724,0.0,0.0,0.07132752591923823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04964212441305276,0.0,0.2460223794752165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532651683553535,0.06392405231697669,0.04569609283594013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482915442106752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08401710174248356,0.0,0.07867847054450322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09978125791613092

schizophrenia,EldritchFold,2018/02/06,"Attention This idea keeps getting forced into my head that I’m making up my symptoms or experiences for attention and that it’s all fake and I’m actually fine. It’s like a burning doubt that questions everything and just puts my progress two steps back. It’s obvious I don’t do it for attention because I tell nobody about my experiences and get no attention for it, yet the feeling is persistent and never goes away.

schizophrenia,theivoryserf6,2018/02/06,"Some advice would be appreciated! I've been living with what I assumed could very well be schiz prodrome for about four years and have been feeling very weird and depersonalised recently. My parents know about these negative symptoms as I'm living at home due to reduced capacity to function! 

Now, I've always been an atheist and am a very skeptical, evidence-focussed person. I've just woke up and instantly, without too much resistance, *assumed* that, for some reason unbeknownst to me, 'the government' could be partially controlling my mind. Not in terms of spin or anything reasonable; no, literally beaming things into my mind. Shaking at how scared I am. Feels like my reality testing/theory of mind is impaired.

So, question: should I check myself in somewhere? That in itself will scare the bejesus out of me but it's for the best if I'm imminently about to embark into paranoia. Thanks lads.

schizophrenia,hippoaos,2018/02/07,"Are these delusions? I don't, as far as I know, have schizophrenia. But lately I've realized that my experience of the world is definitely not the norm in a lot of ways and I'm confused. I've always had a lot of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (anhedonia, thought deprivation, very low motivation) and they've been getting worse lately. 

Would any of the following qualify as a delusion:

Every night I check the lock on my apartment door 10+ times. I often also look through the peephole to make sure nobody is there. 


When I was a girl I was scared someone would come through my window even though that's impossible. I still have periods where I worry about this and then I have to check all the fire escapes because it 'feels like' someone is looking at me.

I used to like writing but I stopped when I started to feel like just the fact of my writing something down meant people would know what I'd written(and not because they've read it). The same goes for my phone, I'm sometimes afraid that if I call or text someone they'll somehow have access to my whole phone and know what I do(which isn't anything bad at all). 

I have trouble doing activities I enjoy(not that there are many) in front of other people. I am afraid they will 'know about me.' I'm not really sure what it is I'm afraid they will know. When I was married I would wait until night time to do my hobbies so my husband didn't know what I liked to do. If someone discovers I'm interested in something without me telling them, I usually never want to do that thing again. 



That's all I can think of for now. These things all seem pretty normal to me but maybe I'm wrong and I'm just used to them. Or maybe they're another issue. They all seem to converge around the same theme of people discovering a secret I don't have/intruding upon my space. Delusions or not? 



Edit: I forgot one. It's off-theme, too. I often have trouble remembering if something happened in my head or in real life. I end up forgetting to do things often because imagining doing something often 'feels like' the same thing as actually doing it.

schizophrenia,blackbeanchickenfeet,2018/02/07,"Shout out to everyone who's ever managed to keep their head above water in tough times I spent all day out of the house yesterday trying to rush an essay that was due today and got home at about 1AM thinking that I would be able to finish the rest of my work at home since I didn't really want to end up spending the night at school or in some random 24hr cafe. Lo and behold my voices went crazy and started mimicking a whole bunch of people and scenarios (from a child-demon trying to lure me outside to kill me, to my neighbours screaming at my landlord to evict me (and also kill me lol), and old friends pretending to be outside my residence yelling about me ghosting on everyone). Had some surreal experiences last night to top it all off. My paranoia had been increasing the past couple weeks but it just kind of peaked yesterday and instead of getting any work done I just huddled up in my bed trying not to make any noise since my last tenancy ended pretty horribly when I accused my last neighbour of trying to kill me (initial onset). I finally fell asleep at 5:30-6ish and woke up at 8 to the sound of the same accusations and yelling, but this time with an alarm ringing and police car sirens (in my head, apparently to take me away). It was a rough night and in a rush I just packed up some clothes and my laptop and headed out. I went to my university's campus downtown, got breakfast for a homeless person and myself, and managed to finish the essay while hearing a bunch of different voices yelling at me since it was really noisy. Pretty subpar work but glad I got it done despite all the chaos and am now going to hole up in my dad's place in hopes that I can try and chill out a bit now.

schizophrenia,kattyo,2018/02/07,"Hello. What should I do with missing Abilify? What should I need to keep in mind to not be paranoia?

I take Abilify to keep my paranoia thoughts off from my head (+ those negative looping thoughts).  However, I have missed last night's Abilify and I can take one now, but I will have severe side effect of Ocular Migraine with taking of Abilify after a missed day.  

And, I have to go work today after this.

I was thinking which is better: taking medicine and get mind off from negative thinkings and having eye proble, OR taking no medicine and being paranoia but I can see OK.

I should have taken medications correctly, but I think taking no medicine today would be fine if I have good idea of not being paranoia as like home remedy (and emergency support to myself.)

May I ask for your advice for not being paranoia naturally?

Thank you very much!

schizophrenia,fourhundredthecat,2018/02/07,"is some component of schizophrenia a useful adaptation, which just went too far ? It can be argued that healthy dose of paranoia can be useful in social animals. Historically, I can imagine how some degree of paranoia has helped rulers to avert betrayal and stay in power.

Can something similar be said about schizophrenia?
Is there some component of schizophrenia that is a useful adaptation that just went too far ?

Anecdotally, many smart people suffered from schizophrenia. Is there some component of their genius/creativity that can be attributed to schizophrenia?",9.241098901098905,12.097871351648353,7.3745054945054935,65.34549450549451,60.75824175824175,10.474725274725275,38.27472527472528,10.608840637214634,4.972336263736265,467,23,60,12,7,138,53,91,0.152,0.715,0.133,-0.264,1,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,1,1,8,3,1,0,2,0,14,1,0,5,0,14,20,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,6,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,1,2,1,11,13,4,8,0,1,0,0,5,4,0,4,1,47,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687266152787864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25521062928901345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17451509621443534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394490474497104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566029315092941,0.0,0.19379095422378867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26830639676680323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6522312614890506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4667050026038386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,BackgroundMatter,2018/02/07,"recent diagnosis - 3 questions about myself? i have schizophrenia - no hallucinations. im 16, the onset was 14/15. im quite interested in understand everything i can, especially if it has to do with myself. ive started anti-psychotics for my delusions and ive only been on them for a short time... no results yet. 

im worried that schizophrenia is still developing and that hallucinations may start to present while im on medication and /i/ wont be able to understand myself as well as i would be able to without meds. would meds interfere with data?

i used to FEEL feelings in my head to align with thoughts that someone was in my head, id feel crowded or like it was buzzing because i was sharing a headspace, i would get images of the person that would pop into my head that weren't /mine/. im not sure if those are some sort of hallucination or a result of dissociation i also experience? (not DID... just a dissociative delusion)

and one more question: can schizophrenia cause you to want to perform major self mutilation for NO good reason? ive had the same obsessive desire to amputate a limb that developed with my schizophrenia and im questioning it may be related? but im not sure how specifically it can be pinpointed. it makes me feel the same giddy feeling as when i feel the person in my head (just the same giddy feeling. not the crowded feeling). btu there are no beliefs or anything telling me to do it beyond. i ""RLY WANNA HAHA WOULD BE FUN AND I HAVE TO"". and its something id like to understand better if anyone knows.

sorry if this is a wall of text or illegible im not so great at talking haha! any advice or insight will be greatly appreciated!",4.3103846153846135,6.279489380503148,5.7296855345911935,75.76793904209,71.8616352201258,8.162747943880017,31.41315916787615,8.841846274778883,2.813223609095308,1325,61,236,26,26,446,168,318,0.083,0.784,0.134,0.9671,0,0,1,0,0,0,44.0,0,1,1,3,12,15,0,1,13,2,38,6,4,7,2,73,57,25,0,12,18,0,8,2,0,9,2,0,0,3,15,12,0,1,19,0,0,0,12,1,1,1,9,8,28,14,38,33,6,20,1,0,0,0,13,11,0,16,11,172,43,0,0.14525597452694233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097122858912741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05808057517482883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04938952185896472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05078317737943455,0.0,0.059766645212269015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04427334692720609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06423355268375848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07460894921942864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06527335187275488,0.0710441077617908,0.0,0.0,0.2937831406980728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03794512573553482,0.0,0.0,0.06091690990508317,0.0,0.16014522471459144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2981490724286168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6276055141578901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03991444241404737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096473199118533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0484797454639307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134664208400376,0.0731650563161608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049214603796812105,0.055236857056318235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268319141728036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24407990229244525,0.07724880441036197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467366708104581,0.07171137551700894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07576683029126208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061537457921612186,0.05591257287784,0.0,0.08130108560056007,0.10281292639856768,0.0,0.058000804446003834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369020369577957,0.0,0.0,0.058375625063116623,0.0634800620763939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057658509262294474,0.042349963432132105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22682488831443914,0.0,0.06272726211134896,0.0,0.0,0.04283786861425978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530128282048601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700107879862168,0.0,0.0,0.0737572465124522,0.0,0.2579641917660795,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,WindWalke,2018/02/07,"I can't do this anymore. I got a part-time job working a night shift stocking grocery store shelves. The job itself is not all that bad, but I feel like a dirty piece of garbage for working that sort of job. I don't think that the other people working there are garbage, or anything like that. I really feel like I could be doing more mentally stimulating work. This is not really my main complaint, however.

When I've worked the night shift, I've felt lonely and downright suicidal. There have been many times where I told myself that as soon as my shift finished, I would kill myself. I can't afford a therapist right now, and the psychiatrist I have been seeing is burnt out and has been very hurtful in the past. I can't afford rent, and I am afraid that my family will kick me out onto the street.

I don't want to do this anymore. Life isn't supposed to be this terrible! I worked my ass off in high school to try to get a good foundation for a decent future, only to have everything robbed from me. I've sacrificed so much. I never got to be me.",4.063854660347552,5.141506791469197,4.827753554502372,85.50425276461297,71.13270142180096,8.091121642969984,26.38894154818325,8.447377352677275,1.6327286571879942,827,26,170,13,15,267,118,211,0.17600000000000002,0.736,0.08800000000000001,-0.974,7,2,0,0,0,1,24.0,0,0,0,6,7,10,1,1,12,0,27,2,1,1,2,21,37,10,2,3,4,0,3,3,0,2,1,0,1,0,12,6,0,0,4,0,2,0,9,6,0,0,7,4,24,4,19,24,5,20,0,2,1,1,1,10,1,2,13,115,36,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23823472688274944,0.0,0.0,0.09884072575646384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10028726908370372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589847855821174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10794759265383223,0.0,0.11322951084258903,0.0,0.12146297796404472,0.1716139622317064,0.11532493723370205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06275279051216713,0.0,0.0,0.10074300748310236,0.1921267139442432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12690336131380411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12858079828535554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35757348001501,0.0,0.13288449704812713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08483761397631495,0.17603980250714693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12177321749972166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104315616162932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882950539694193,0.0,0.09263663936094868,0.0,0.0,0.2254311772992038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09134946458115366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13006799094399235,0.11465908430488085,0.08326951282361864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538917523561801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257372975414177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155826094182776,0.09571253549519916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13138141664740033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13945757388445754,0.0,0.07696197282652323,0.0,0.0,0.07003741144454183,0.0,0.0,0.11477075126163055,0.0,0.08154716036618374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910375987226752,0.07084429799690832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5246513443743391,0.0,0.0,0.08532306888827937,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Captain_Aizen_Sosuke,2018/02/07,"I have a doctor's appointment! It's like 9 years overdue at this point, but I finally managed to set up an appointment at a local mental health clinic.

It wasn't easy to find a place that took my insurance but honestly the harder part of the task was accepting that the belief my parents indoctrinated me with - that mental illness aren't really 'real', and can be cured with happy thoughts or increased willpower - was a goddamn lie that has only been holding me back. The breaking point was when psychosis started impacting my ability to work; I'm a *long* way from my family and none of my friends have the means to support me, so it's become a situation of address the problem or die. 

I'm nervous as hell. I hope I don't freeze up and lose all my speech skills, that's been known to happen to me sometimes :/",9.023625678119352,6.8171278544303835,9.120452079566004,69.87563291139242,61.59493670886076,12.066546112115734,40.292947558770344,10.608840637214634,4.224892224231465,643,28,118,12,7,213,101,158,0.223,0.633,0.145,-0.9398,2,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,3,3,11,1,1,13,0,13,4,0,0,1,20,22,10,1,2,4,1,1,1,1,0,4,1,1,0,9,5,0,1,6,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,8,2,14,7,17,13,4,19,2,1,0,0,2,8,1,3,7,79,23,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12683821407910936,0.0,0.0,0.1821769666983778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17119454909173168,0.0,0.0,0.1688357715416272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555024428020382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18069729193617834,0.15076350569068728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274418154428152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14586686299692084,0.17559489760779495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1753366882076292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16383495295908349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058741081585391,0.0,0.0,0.1459776836916089,0.0,0.18453954296755554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17968152159581566,0.0,0.0,0.3324664449671407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12545373361875115,0.0,0.0,0.18316011995279616,0.1786273752455056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17234015019186724,0.0,0.3118666715970122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15783716996852218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877519444432744,0.10567273160678237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18541340939467246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16314214191471374,0.0,0.11675415807799674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871860293110133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309537806336646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18326818633947206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13093153761325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12008731213632327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106223937743976
schizophrenia,sqyd234,2018/02/07,"Medication &amp; Goals After the trial of 5 different antipsychotics and several miserable months of side effects and symptoms I believe I finally found the right medication.  I am on Latuda 40mg for almost a month now and I haven't noticed any side effects and I don't have any positive symptoms.  

Now that my medication is on order its time to get the rest of my life in order.   I have given up on finishing school, so instead I plan on getting a Commercial Driving Licence and getting a job in the field.  Hopefully, I can get through the medical portion of the CDL requirements.  

My goal is to be able to live independently, and maybe get one of those girlfriends people keep talking about.   Wish me luck.

schizophrenia,fashionstudy,2018/02/08,"psychosis triggered by bodytherapy Hi Guys,

I have had a psychotic episode 2x. In between my recovering fases I noticed that massage therapy was a trigger for me too sliding back and loosing it. After I noticed it the second time I called up some masseuse therapists and came to find out: They have a contra-indication for massages. Meaning they dont do massage therapy on people who have psychiatric problems. The reason being that massaging the body does something to the mind. It can release emotions that are ""stuck"" in your body and these emotions can trigger you.

That was really a bummer for me because whenever I was stressed and needed relaxation I would take a massage.

I have been looking into things like: Meditation, Reiki, Breath therapy and Bio energetica. But often their is a contra -indication.

I wanted to know if any of you also feel their is a body mind connection? And that things that happen to your body can be a trigger. Would love to hear experiences. I would do anything to stay stable &amp; healthy. But I need to find a way how to cope with stress and how to relax my body in a way it wont be triggered.",6.384190020505812,7.6216052488038315,6.774726589200274,73.08058612440192,65.88995215311003,9.416404647983596,36.45967190704033,9.606745405546679,3.748904032809296,903,45,149,18,14,293,122,209,0.053,0.86,0.087,0.7968,0,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,4,4,0,6,7,0,2,14,0,25,7,6,8,0,38,38,13,0,8,3,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,14,11,0,0,6,2,0,2,2,3,0,1,7,3,22,4,24,24,1,15,0,0,1,1,14,7,0,3,4,117,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08011083135500956,0.0,0.1085408172038492,0.0,0.06812321752045633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08243643629290012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702927622283977,0.0,0.061066451537903375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5563656004947101,0.0,0.0,0.10229105001638923,0.11457482893071275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876648243698429,0.0,0.11740570230241833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22536937192228704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09799149747639743,0.0,0.0,0.05065207164479007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831183734095852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991901386580383,0.08858543904237727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11290580218421467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05505419247719104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048941007037092026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412273640423877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904128869561742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10912119552954068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2022987099709613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14855869252337114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22810242259412586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06944952939680492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09585504693525228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06417540716147244,0.10299776701905604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712049481187877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10677444756246583,0.0,0.0,0.22950288385512516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0753199980934823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34368047557364234,0.11631223179618015,0.13310516621344026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058413518946566725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05908648903415645,0.15903033088753166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21348678934391746,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,dramamine94,2018/02/08,"How do you support yourself? Curious about those living on disability in the US. My break was when I was 21 but I always struggled in school with a foggy brain and bad memory, kept thinking it would get better when I got older. Since my break in 2016 its been getting harder and harder to just, survive. I'm just slowly declining. I can only take on college course at a time and I think by the time I graduate I wont be able to manage a job anyways.

I'm on SSI disability in the US right now and it's not enough to live off of, its like $750. My therapist has a program that helps disabled people find easy work and I've been thinking about just doing that for a few years to get work credits to get disability on top of SSI so I don't have to work. I don't know where I'll be in a few  years time. I honestly don't know if I could work long enough to get the credits.

For those of you in the US, how do you take care of yourselves? Do you live off disability? Can you manage a job? I've heard it can be taken away and I'm scared of throwing all my eggs in one basket but I don't know if I can honestly work, longest I ever did was 3 months and I ended up in a hospital after it. Tried again later only lasted one month.",1.3618735479588435,2.944351958015268,3.580089611682709,89.68427646863594,79.0381679389313,6.388582807832727,21.696647859276467,7.255503002510835,0.5940535678725527,951,27,213,12,23,327,132,262,0.045,0.8029999999999999,0.152,0.9801,2,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,3,5,0,8,15,11,0,2,13,0,26,2,1,2,2,30,48,16,0,4,8,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,10,8,1,1,7,0,2,1,6,3,0,2,10,1,27,8,36,32,5,41,0,0,0,0,10,20,0,2,19,144,37,15,0.10586789622231033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809057055730457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09946637345889643,0.0,0.08839527124064968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363155094530198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818358479951488,0.0,0.0,0.1079393759240618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845269005843956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09376753279657543,0.21877967414031965,0.0,0.0,0.09576357318452347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676133918853852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765580311993986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467222782535505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096101923833882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2101151026325433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17454668123732006,0.0862964654210648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0517217065002264,0.0,0.28044987586221626,0.0936897566883354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16900548945200494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14347765272585378,0.16103461133435795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0733954692292703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041060492149564,0.0,0.0,0.10599223292235332,0.10714396299420807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757501776374818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11067611151620854,0.0,0.0,0.1201376340417473,0.0,0.0,0.15919896507385708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292078728149075,0.0,0.20350761942289755,0.0,0.0,0.1851972649628945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187735218372701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382038131955562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3853654466520023,0.0,0.0,0.0752055159779963,0.0,0.0,0.13635090830369254
schizophrenia,LSDenis,2018/02/08,"The number 7 7 has always been an important part of my magical self
43 34 16 these are positive numbers that the great entity 7 shows so me everyday via licences on cars, random numbers on ads, house numbers etc.
25 I believe symbolises change, the death of something and the life of something new (beginning and end)
My birthday is 25.7. And I am 100% sure i will die on a 25 day
Ive had a near death experience because of bad LSD about a year ago on 25.1.
My good friend got the same shitty LSD and had the same experience half a year later on 25.8 so exactly 7 months after me
I believe this is some sort of entity/god that has thaken an interest in me because of my soul's age
It manifests itself in 7 because it cannot show its real self in this reality

Ive had DMT trips where Ive talked to Egyptian gods and I saw 7 there

Not looking for any advice or anything just wondering if theres someone else in here that has been chosen by 7

Much love to you all

schizophrenia,qyred,2018/02/08,"My mother's schizophrenia is hurting my family, socially and mentally (need advice) Hi everyone, I am an 18 year old male who is attending first year University. Currently my family is in low income, and I live with my parents and 21 year old brother. My father (54 years old) works full time as a chef that pays around $20,000 a year, while my brother works part time as a waiter for a restaurant (unsure about how much he makes)

My mother (53 years old) has been diagnosed with schizophrenia for 15+ years and has not been on medications for 3 years (unwilling to take them). She is very paranoid about me and brother being outside whether that's hanging out with friends, for school, or in my brother's case, going to work, and adamantly insists that we stay home all day. Whenever I'm at school, she always elects to drive her vehicle to my University, and walks on campus looking for me, yelling my name if she sees me. If she does not find me, she will often ask security campus to call me (because she does not have a phone) and I constantly have to pick up, in order to identify myself as not missing. This honestly makes me feel very uncomfortable being at school, knowing that at any second she could find me, embarrass me in front of others. There has been a time where she spotted me on campus from afar, yelled my name and continued to chase after me until I lost sight of her. I tend to avoid her as much as possible and bus back home after my classes are done. (around 3pm)

After a few hours, my mother realizes that I'm probably no longer at school, then comes back home, sees me, then drives off to my brother's workplace (the school and my brother's workplace are about 40 minutes away from my house, so my mother ends up driving a lot, wasting around $20 on gas money a day, which really hurts us as a low income family). She'll go inside my brother's workplace, and do the same thing she does at my University, making him feel uncomfortable too. There has been a time where she has accused my brother's manager of trying to ""rape"" my brother, and as a result, she attempted to physically hit him, which was when the police were called, and they gave her warnings.

So what happens when I hang out with friends? My mother will stalk me and try to find me when I'm out with friends. In the past, I was hanging out with a friend, standing on the sidewalk, waiting at a bus loop for our bus. The bus loop was right by two roads, where one led to a neighborhood. My mother ended up finding me, and parked her car close to the entrance of the neighborhood, behind a bush with small visible holes in it, and stood there just watching until I left her sight. I told my friend the situation, and it really freaked him out. Since we were at a bus loop, it was easy for to lose sight of her, since not all the buses that came were not in her field of view from where she parked. 

Many times as a result of me/my brother hanging out with friends, my mother will lose her sanity because she thinks that we are being raped and physically abused by people such as our friends and policemen. She believes that my father is the one to blame in this situation, saying how he is trying to ruin us by forcing us to hang out with these ""so called friends"" and being exposed in the outside world. Often when he comes home at 10pm from work, my mother accuses him for what I just mentioned, and other things such as using all our money on a ""mistress"". Sometimes she threatens to call the cops on him, and tells him to die. They usually argue a lot, and it really mentally stresses out my father, as he hears these accusations almost every day from my mother. 

Because of this, I find socializing outside of school to be very challenging due to the consequences (same applies to my brother), and I notice how I've gotten to a point where my mother no longer loves my father and it really devastates me just thinking about it. I really do believe that my father still loves my mother, as he thinks the non-schizophrenic her would love him back, since he has not yet thought of a divorce yet and continues to give her money to waste on gas. Money is eventually going to be a problem in the future for us at this rate too.

schizophrenia,Jwaggin,2018/02/08,"I don't even know I was prescribed dexedrine for ADD ~10 years ago, which gave me auditory hallucinations so I stopped taking them (without telling anyone). I still get them to this day even though I havent done any drugs for quite a long time, they seem to happen randomly almost daily, it gets louder when I try to sleep. I also have visual snow, bad after images, flashing vision etc. I went to the doctor and got tests (scans, blood etc.) and nada.

I told my therapist today whom I've been seeing for ~4months for anxiety, that i hear things and now she's sending me a psychiatrist and brought up the word schizophrenic. I don't have any delusions, i don't think people are watching me or anything. You can talk to me and I seem normal. Is hearing things such a big deal I mean like she seemed to think I was relatively fine then I tell her I hallucinate and I'm suddenly psychotic. Would like anti psychotics help at all? I'm not really willing to take them because this all started when I was prescribed pills previously. And the voices aren't that bad I've kinda gotten use to them IDK",2.4630352748154216,5.063362169811325,3.589688269073012,85.74349876948318,80.60377358490567,6.1397867104183765,23.368334700574238,7.423996415210882,1.1584591468416736,868,30,164,13,23,280,139,212,0.079,0.862,0.058,-0.6279,0,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,5,1,10,5,0,0,6,0,17,6,2,1,2,28,42,14,0,2,3,0,0,2,0,2,4,3,0,0,9,8,0,1,7,0,0,3,7,2,0,0,11,6,32,3,16,29,4,21,0,0,3,0,20,3,0,7,17,104,41,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100939870733413,0.0,0.12540038776921966,0.0,0.0,0.1001468906455463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17032224731786624,0.0,0.09580109021099116,0.0,0.0,0.08756416919672147,0.0,0.10305413925925208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20912469257959115,0.07633943052190699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08076339714872821,0.1291072820626772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128178857662334,0.0,0.1281544150169789,0.0,0.0,0.1452277742712171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793305143539798,0.1654273018561509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308556723527423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001583759260171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107410337217765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822880460316971,0.0,0.08393945244509772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06882347992569339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223627216676007,0.0,0.0,0.11082516796608242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13641287015709916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12269942974177996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08681915177068687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13319819138320918,0.0,0.0,0.08022594915601874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997925995209856,0.3420157903407768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12532107141368973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08863888542763819,0.0,0.10000934396264408,0.10469841526458802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18831569926078515,0.10065563782665453,0.2189141831257992,0.0,0.0,0.1454024151467389,0.16639533381026506,0.1604854639548744,0.12303845947015585,0.0,0.07302298821790411,0.0,0.11870399568586422,0.1196632348951725,0.0,0.08502337833171651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081590573139206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609004989291545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071785975533506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08896024746828082,0.0,0.0,0.08064442074149393
schizophrenia,Ex-elmo,2018/02/09,"What kind if hallucination is this? Earlier today I heard my friend mouth something to my other friend while I was turned around, then when he tried to get her to say it louder because he must not have heard her, she whispered, ""he's listening,"" because she didn't want me to hear. But I did. I called them out but they kept telling me they were talking about the sheet that got thrown off of their bed. 

I was really angry and I started shaking and talking really fast, my heart was beating a million miles an hour. I went to my room to calm down and I kept hearing a loud ringing in my ear that would go away if I covered my ears hard and then it would come back, slowly getting louder. I felt like my legs and fingers were growing, I looked at them and saw them growing. My walls were stretching and had lines in them, I was frozen and shaking, laying in bed. My whole body was numb. I threatened my friend, I told him that if I ever found absolute proof that he's been lying to me and has been shit talking me for months under his breath that I would kill him. 

It lasted for around an hour but I still feel weird. Help? 

Edit: to include as much info as possible, I was also having racing thoughts about everything going on, and every time I calmed myself down a little bit I would just immediately go back into it if I had one thought that led to it.

schizophrenia,CannibalYoshi,2018/02/09,"I feel like I’m losing my mind Hey you guys I’ve been really struggling for the past few months I really don’t know what’s wrong with me it’s a really scary experience I’m going through, three months ago I had a major panic attack I got prescribed Lexapro and Xanax but all they did was make me even more anxious and agitated I was constantly spacing out had horrible memory problems the world started to look different like nothing seemed real I was tired all the time I felt really sick i would tell my doctor but all he would say was cut my meds in half one day I had enough and I went to the e.r they did a bunch of testing and told me everything seemed fine they didn’t want to do a mri cause they said it could just be the meds, about 2 weeks ago I decided to go see a psychiatrist she but me on Zoloft and Klonopin and again I had the same side effects as with the Lexapro I felt like I was completely losing my mind I called her and she put me on Seroquel but I still feel weird like I’m having what I can only describe as delusional thinking I literally can’t recognize my self in the mirror I look at my hands and they don’t seem real nothing around me seems real I’m having a hard time recognizing people specially my parents like I look at them and they look strange but I know who they are I’m constnsly stuck in my head thinking the worse that I have a head tumor that I might have a heart problem I remember like 2 days ago I was playing a video game and for a few seconds I actually felt like I was in it I feel like I completely have lost contact with reality and it freaks me out I do have family history of mental illness and schizophrenia I’m just wondering if I can get some input from somebody who has experienced something close like this I’m sorry if my story might seem a little out of order or something ",3.156118479221924,4.693528400530504,4.522671087533158,85.01988638373122,74.0132625994695,7.891388152077807,26.09451812555261,8.548686976883017,1.7383747833775425,1465,51,303,27,30,486,190,377,0.18600000000000005,0.727,0.087,-0.9887,2,0,2,0,0,0,3.0,0,1,8,4,7,24,2,2,20,0,36,11,4,3,3,69,76,22,0,8,10,1,8,9,0,4,7,2,0,2,11,20,0,0,19,3,0,4,4,12,0,4,24,16,59,12,29,46,11,37,0,3,5,0,26,17,0,12,24,194,70,2,0.0,0.0,0.07224359780843692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19687210115344456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08363398211878029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06590330455702938,0.0,0.08422097433720202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07559395004023065,0.0,0.0,0.07605025178777479,0.0,0.0,0.15524023493183187,0.08000123415919391,0.0,0.05910774664952985,0.0,0.0,0.09548776877219953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734666069034181,0.0,0.07577388739236783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07649383487237431,0.0,0.0488967914486053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06653430850976734,0.07241654439377954,0.06978985840814313,0.0,0.11229692644870562,0.10577555299749944,0.21324417054994746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03867815317729648,0.0,0.08414707104377732,0.0,0.05920937069679194,0.0,0.0,0.07330235035223441,0.0,0.0,0.06631725402307083,0.0,0.1519543718663128,0.0,0.0,0.08772711683514445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137102659439346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32551035855619553,0.07419853211589593,0.0,0.0,0.2486696512342239,0.16564355314732504,0.08081360505976587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04941628166208071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644635514100655,0.0,0.07460585731522454,0.15707042941511434,0.14950045553641064,0.0,0.11818171000999715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420695233716514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0501653360560732,0.05630392775997465,0.0,0.08685945276863616,0.08220268831273053,0.0,0.07067098673568739,0.05132378888180777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14167537879348094,0.0,0.07442162403833599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2527905295075775,0.1897046719922624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08386271579038744,0.0,0.07042045430934107,0.0588724396254895,0.0,0.0,0.058993139247775175,0.33697530747705634,0.0772305009130406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398539424422692,0.0,0.08287166747728354,0.05239953800081752,0.0,0.059121269340480585,0.0,0.0,0.07739329745237156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470637577557753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948721785761554,0.0,0.0,0.08633616787027486,0.08508776872586038,0.0,0.07073981350215876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043665414514613116,0.0,0.0593832199054705,0.0,0.0,0.06862749854686108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802834847844271,0.0,0.0,0.07544393548007759,0.10517902713435592,0.08094130034476439,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,phe1ix,2018/02/09,"Possible early stages? I think I might be going schizophrenic. I am becoming more and more eccentric as time goes by; I talk to myself out loud a lot when no one is around and increasingly when I am out and about; I have an imaginary friend who I am aware is imaginary but is nonetheless very real to me; I often start laughing or grinning uncontrollably for no real reason and in inappropriate situations; I am not at all shy and have extremely high levels of empathy yet I also cannot relate to people and for this reason I have no close friends; my short-term memory and concentration levels seem to be deteriorating at an alarming rate, and I find following even relatively simple instructions incredibly difficult; I just feel blank a lot of the time, like what I imagine people try to experience through meditation except not at all pleasant or peaceful: more like being suffocated. The way I present my thoughts when I speak confuses people and I am often misunderstood when I try to make a point about something. I never know exactly what's going to come out of my mouth or in what order: I just know I'm going to say something related to a specific theme, or I am going to respond to something someone else has said, whatever that may mean.

I know I usually come across as very odd, and people seem to react to me in one of two ways: either they decide they want as little to do with me as possible, or they decide I'm some poor damaged wreck who needs affection and looking after and they're super nice to me in an almost condescending way. I go out walking by myself most of the time when I don't have anything urgent to get done. I've never been in a romantic relationship, and when I see the normal guys I have to compete against I am not at all optimistic about this changing anytime soon.

I am an undergraduate at the best university in the world yet I have no motivation for anything and am just barely scraping by at the moment, living each day as it comes, skipping lectures, letting the deadlines pile up until I need to work non-stop to complete them just in time -- and sometimes not even managing that. I don't know whether I'll make it to the end of my course at this point, and I just want any reasonably well-informed opinions about whether what I have described here sounds like the early stages of schizophrenia or maybe some other mental condition for which I can be treated.
Part of me hopes I am going schizo because then at least I won't have to pretend to be normal and people will realise that I'm no longer able to compete on equal footing with my peers.",14.775878787878787,7.902958062626264,13.609292929292927,56.26727272727274,56.25252525252525,16.674747474747473,50.17171717171718,12.801484090802019,6.113044444444442,2071,85,369,43,15,685,244,495,0.103,0.78,0.117,0.8751,0,0,3,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,4,6,25,18,0,3,19,0,39,4,2,8,6,98,74,40,0,7,20,0,1,3,2,4,2,5,0,1,16,29,0,0,18,1,1,12,15,5,0,3,4,8,53,13,77,60,18,75,0,1,2,0,15,31,0,21,29,282,69,5,0.08247177686492665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08258357150673795,0.0,0.0,0.06595265016264955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05608363634588322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573449061807052,0.07341736644184982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05027402970150156,0.09108359806887777,0.0,0.0,0.0865490417154507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724420455572697,0.2131263996568475,0.0864700889516586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05318747335800665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439726132215859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06889458702337929,0.0,0.0730455153820672,0.0,0.0,0.10894366161886372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08067322286714551,0.0,0.0,0.04170020838253853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537770995232955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12743498045150886,0.0,0.04308809951486251,0.0,0.28122366813108896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816600252905654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713596027254837,0.0,0.08191308306096377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18129732696667605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843329794782232,0.0,0.1208746330975352,0.08265838653183373,0.07282408992472543,0.0,0.06925552151877154,0.0,0.0,0.14022911094382154,0.0,0.0,0.1101011029223624,0.0,0.08285398482104826,0.08983594243576447,0.0,0.0,0.08311215351091185,0.08748952234685904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223035550985058,0.12721463708400566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16160966182280745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117700207800712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08930889752872974,0.0,0.2858777295650731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559249727428571,0.1859490736060548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18774187488405192,0.0,0.254384166816555,0.0,0.08854382415204153,0.0,0.0,0.07844954564541612,0.06558486713773172,0.0,0.0,0.06571932850440071,0.15015841646902214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09270173262817318,0.0,0.0,0.06987806890662075,0.19047240911126345,0.08156669611728648,0.0,0.05837394814490105,0.0,0.0,0.06895009830079295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06628769026864366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052844584550648964,0.0,0.06547337864388157,0.1923598252415992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198584580334492,0.0,0.08056294237916073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09083101069184348,0.1360957061135107,0.0972879815299848,0.19638677319043768,0.0,0.0,0.07415203186380022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06004043579178844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Businessman88,2018/02/09,"I salute anyone who suffers from schizophrenia I have a very long story that im not going to bore you all with but it was basically living hell for about a month or two. I literally witnessed hell and I am so very sorry for anyone who goes through this regularly. My thing is its been almost a year since I had “the shot” and im doing great, no voices, no hallucinations, even been under a ton of stress and still cope just fine. Im curious if its possible to just have a mental breakdown or just 1 episode? Almost every episode I had was extremely violent, I fought several occasions with law enforcement, tried committing suicide.. cut myself up 60 + times and my own throat, ended up in hospital from it then tried to run out the ER punching a security guard which which got me hit with a stun gun all before surgery im not joking when I said it was hell. I guess the thing that really baffles me is they tried diagnosing me with several things, schizophrenia, bipolar, ptsd and I cant remember everything else said id never be able to get off medications and now im literally better off than what I was prior to all these episodes. I no longer have any sort of panic attacks or anxiety attacks, im way more social and just all around happier than what I use to be plus I handle stress really well now. Im in school working on opening up my 3rd business, have decent health, good relationship, good support ect. The things that lead me to have the episodes were, my best friend shot himself, I lost one of my businesses, some of my animals passed away and my dad died in my arms from the chemotherapy he was receiving. I use absolutely no drugs or attempt to self-medicate I did however start drinking a couple beers after all this happened to kinda live life a little and I enjoy it. 

Oh yeah and the medications they gave me caused me to do some very unusual stuff I feel for anyone who is having to take that. It killed my motivation, made me tired but yet I could never sleep, made sex less enjoyable and gave me severe suicidal thoughts. Prior to the meds I was hardly ever depressed and never had energy problems I use to work 17 hours a day. Any thoughts/comments are appreciated id love to get to know some people who suffer from this disease and let them know medication is not the only solution sometimes it just takes some very big lifestyle changes but you have to be willing to make a commitment to becoming happy and getting out of your comfort zones.

schizophrenia,blukimchi,2018/02/10,"My boyfriend might be schizophrenic Hi there. Not sure of this belongs here but I just wanted some advice. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. Lately he's been really paranoid about things (that I'm cheating on him, that I don't love him, that his parents are out to get him) and visibly sad. He hasn't been eating much, maybe  one meal a day.. it kills me to see the life drained out of him...

Mental illness runs in his family. His uncle was schizophrenic and had an episode that resulted in double murder and suicide. He constantly questions his mental health and has told me (when he was quite drunk) he's afraid he might be schizophrenic. Problem is, he's a really closed person and won't open up to anyone about it unless he's blackout drunk. The most he's told me is that he hears his parents yelling at him when no one is there and that he's had vivid dreams of hurting people (including me).  I don't know how frequent these are. 

He went through a 6 month period where he was a heavy marijuana user (2-3 times daily) until he started getting drug tested. I know marijuana can bring out latent schizophrenia so I thought that might be important to mention. 

I don't know what I should do. Ive been in contact with his sister so that his family can keep an eye on him. He refuses to seek help or talk to anyone about it. I'm the only one he trusts, and even then I don't know the full extent of this. I've been trying to encourage that he sees someone, subtle hints. I don't want to push him too hard. I love him so much, id give my life for him to be happy again. Please let me know what you think would be best ..",3.4476576576576576,4.720415483483482,4.3105057057057055,87.88276756756756,72.84384384384384,7.490162162162162,24.731411411411408,7.976525956113202,1.2169388348348344,1288,38,271,18,25,415,177,333,0.171,0.743,0.086,-0.9851,2,0,1,0,1,1,42.0,0,1,0,2,19,14,3,1,11,0,39,15,1,2,1,43,64,19,3,5,5,3,1,0,0,6,8,2,0,1,18,14,4,2,8,3,0,4,9,7,0,3,14,7,37,7,32,38,8,33,0,2,4,2,52,14,0,8,15,174,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10376279244953614,0.0,0.0,0.10632897947120143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14849409821707674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11143464870689772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147483056463156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684805665294718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12314093523818305,0.10865380535949176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07013421766848961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2002036115516693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109546018700607,0.10186236634917714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303594991070245,0.09512093924852473,0.0,0.0,0.11286973241109832,0.11967825772081607,0.0,0.07117359423388828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11367328182098972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438214273367172,0.11747801447825225,0.0,0.2917826058729273,0.0,0.11978135056226527,0.0,0.0,0.1085813979715521,0.1500032684685602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916722892375292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10667714522888716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2140190912849552,0.3379366424521392,0.0,0.0,0.08475588610949521,0.0,0.1561164448674669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2158611942094979,0.08075850803543085,0.0,0.0,0.23581184221953666,0.0,0.0,0.07361533700614592,0.09271668144903822,0.0,0.1165592874890716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160474297185328,0.0,0.0,0.11895154673309398,0.11294086094255895,0.0,0.0,0.13604971168935726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16923145860397734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997024006951625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751583180614288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11614919956755122,0.0,0.1000781438419871,0.0,0.0,0.08534751318175796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07054462249899897,0.06803908626537998,0.0,0.08429906102047763,0.06191735092108819,0.0,0.0,0.20292871294851705,0.0,0.07209267220004813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526137586641395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843459618794262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07543080603718529,0.0,0.0,0.06837968454507433
schizophrenia,Ajay3462,2018/02/10,"New and incredibly innovative treatment of schizophrenia and hallucinations **A new, innovative, and incredible treatment by me:**
Playing chess just once or twice daily can treat and beat the pressure and flow of painful hallucinations because it makes the mind to divert completely so heavily and strongly for about 30–60 minutes that it beats that flow and pressure of painful hallucinations and breaks the power of those hallucinations daily and when like this some months pass by then hallucinations can be reduced to zero but still playing chess once or twice will be required. And chess is so popular game that it is accessible to everyone so easily on internet and computer and mobile phone. For computer chess titans is good and for mobile shredder chess is great.",8.372812500000002,11.103199406250004,7.839500000000001,61.65550000000002,62.75,10.745,37.8,10.793553405168565,4.955081874999999,636,32,89,18,10,200,74,128,0.047,0.745,0.209,0.9766,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,5,7,12,0,2,4,0,9,2,0,1,0,21,10,21,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,8,13,0,1,0,8,0,3,0,4,0,3,0,0,1,8,14,7,1,11,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,3,7,63,9,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13604234290965414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339894685672768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21324847099319028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18718438341536991,0.0,0.2460456808448131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10902957506137853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14896768856036005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2253380520642177,0.0,0.1781321416561511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4310778972304215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4753374711892031,0.0,0.0,0.4749371675128923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17822382709065698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,TheCircleOfFifths,2018/02/10,"Please help. I have nowhere else to turn. There are these beings that speak to me, primarily through thought. They’ve told me that they want to get out of my mind, to actually talk to me, and that they’re working on it. They seem to be making progress because I can hear and see them more and more often. They started off as things that I could see and hear as I was trying to go to sleep and in my dreams, because apparently it’s easier for them to talk to me in this altered state of consciousness. They’ve told me that I have a mission to save humanity, that my soul isn’t entirely human, that someone wants to kill me, and that humanity isn’t worth saving so I should just leave, and they talk to me about things involving a battle between good and evil and these subjects. Though I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and Asperger’s Syndrome, I’m afraid because up until we moved over Winter Break, my thoughts have always sounded like my thoughts, and have been located in the center of my mind, but the beings sound different. They sound loud, outside of the center of my mind and they have their own voices. I told my psychiatrist and my therapist after some convincing from some friends on an OCD chatroom and I got put on 5mg of Abilify. It helps a little bit, making it more difficult for the beings to talk to me, presumably because they need more energy to do so. Thing is, part of my wants it to be schizophrenia; I really just want a normal life. I don’t want any missions or to be part of any battles. But I’ve been told that I wouldn’t suspect schizophrenia if it were, in fact, schizophrenia or really psychosis of any kind. This suggests to me that the beings are real, even though I don’t want then to be. But also, I feel like, if they were real, then maybe the abilify would have no effect. Please, can anyone help?",6.9492068611640505,6.267348292479112,6.8987245271954265,79.25572789913505,64.6824512534819,10.231989444362998,32.54376191174315,9.549672527348893,2.7247849582172705,1443,49,288,24,19,460,169,359,0.057,0.807,0.136,0.9725,2,0,0,0,0,1,41.0,1,0,11,3,11,14,4,1,11,0,34,3,1,3,1,60,62,31,1,14,9,0,1,2,1,3,2,8,0,3,23,17,0,0,9,1,1,3,6,6,0,0,14,11,44,8,51,36,10,25,1,0,2,0,32,14,0,8,8,206,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.0859781772218807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07045786980654427,0.07331076457141897,0.0,0.0,0.17974411361138853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061605355824945786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148329767263705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618829580133896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07034500593526376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942514322314471,0.0,0.09205140804294566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360077011155368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05819279670839648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04454874589386222,0.06294252720826812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06807002629393062,0.0,0.046031443745514586,0.0,0.050072338631916534,0.07389864329321334,0.07046595022113214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19860241558213174,0.0,0.17716561065110786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747558954108766,0.09174823334014824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329091473918867,0.0,0.0,0.06223146131640545,0.0860877123279277,0.08830477353550194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11762209943238912,0.0,0.08851373312638833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2668840641411194,0.0,0.0,0.09364211448975372,0.0,0.06532905001358212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08632460169613883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1908191606895832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19342657968720897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08857027854115218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20056650559446815,0.11288517185715714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404172199333061,0.08020786224541146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08816904525707374,0.0,0.07465143355442719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06236146733064313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2832631858890564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10229717937250436,0.17559997155850052,0.0,0.17312624890629175,0.20983757787936594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3367540048633128,0.0,0.05981779446564425,0.0958333931305934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3118011445852311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414179259989368,0.0,0.0,0.06258756006976274,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,claradinus,2018/02/10,"I eat way too often I already, months ago talked with my psychologist about this. She said i should have three main meals and if i get hungry between them i should have one or two snacks per day to not be hungry.

The point is, i eat every one and a half to every two hours. I wake up at seven in the morning, if i can sleep at all, and at around eight i get my first meal. So i have about seven meals per day. And a fact is that i just eat bread without any vegetables or fruits to it.

I eat white and yellow cheese with high fat meat cold cuts. I already try to cook myself at some point vegetables and low fat meat like chicken.

I just got 7 € for nutrition per day. If i buy healthy i can eat twice or three times per day, and if, i instead, buy bread and cheese with cold cuts, i can eat like i have said, seven times per day, at least.

I also drink Coffee with high fat milk and a lot of sugar or Tee with always four pieces of sugar. If i am not drinking these two things i drink soft drinks or juice.

That is not it. In some weeks i will have lesser as 7€ for my nutrition. I relapsed at my Stop Gaming Project, and bought a gaming Laptop that i could not even pay. I just bought it via paypal and now i have debts because of me beeing weak in december last year and listening to the bad thoughts.

I will have to pay it of monthly.

Today i was in the super market and bought couple of things because monday will be in germany a holiday.

I bought two packs bread, four packs of cold cut meat, two cream cheese, margarine, two packs of mackerel, coffee, coffee milk and olives with cream cheese.

I have seen in my kitchen room before i was going to the super market three bags of rice, noodles, spaetzle, two packs breads and a pack of tortellini, a pack of yellow cheese and four cottage cheese and at least one cream cheese.  

Now, i do not eat because i am hungry, i eat because it comes up in my mind that there is place that can be filled again.

I do not know how hunger feels anymore. I have eaten just three healthy meals a day at least five times in the last months.

If i just eat healthy and lesser meals my mind tend to get me in over eating at the next day.

I already lost 5 Kg of bodyweight, but i am still at 132 Kg of bodyweight. 

I got pain in my back because of the sleeping and laying the whole day at the bed. I got a barbell and a training mat. 

I got problems getting myself into exercise. Even if my back does not hurt anymore i rather avoid it.

Are some of you too over eating and just laying around all day ?
Any advices?",3.586264367816092,4.337672128352491,4.012509578544062,92.12094827586208,71.96934865900383,6.566283524904216,23.69540229885057,6.139981653823899,0.3689402298850569,1969,48,438,10,36,617,210,522,0.051,0.902,0.047,-0.5831,1,1,4,0,0,0,55.0,0,1,1,4,27,15,3,1,20,0,34,45,6,1,3,79,58,38,0,12,28,0,2,2,0,5,6,3,3,0,15,31,39,2,3,9,9,3,8,11,0,25,16,18,60,4,63,33,12,71,0,3,7,0,9,35,0,17,34,293,75,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053238634638713325,0.04829451116607185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803648782477077,0.04356878953357644,0.04533292421311684,0.0,0.0,0.07409849770116532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10806190185111483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700006834375584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0837857320142956,0.045489728430621414,0.16605690701341613,0.0,0.046359694447157054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0469309382200624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043498998291416166,0.060282679388287325,0.0,0.31622420693612063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04767707709263195,0.0,0.0,0.21348428767754316,0.0,0.6132292819026078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719689573107938,0.0,0.0918059294055439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02754745409084426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04634188678629012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11385721935571265,0.0,0.030963059049300263,0.0,0.1742951447665153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11512526955499745,0.0,0.0,0.05365324598053789,0.0,0.05832351053962233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02994157574461058,0.08881929364387788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05323376125535631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947292982189665,0.04631817376651767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100214511391121,0.0,0.13045970181242894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05794163171168457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107541053965455,0.0,0.057972095581505075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05692151117120425,0.0,0.10300514541430016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05213138217410277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10364865505178728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090415758162766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04350895000745855,0.04554892508152655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043790119409288265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239009849849029,0.0,0.0,0.04325217936129158,0.09530570098394313,0.0,0.051642036727197985,0.0,0.0,0.0369893229044844,0.0,0.3725431670216302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043244832806622786,0.043701726552409496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608265844180361,0.0,0.052518165973212766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035084262443844424
schizophrenia,pizza_potatoes_pasta,2018/02/10,"Boyfriend has schizophrenia. What do I do I am so lost. I’ve been with my boyfriend (or was with him.. I don’t know) for over 5 years and he’s socially isolating himself right now. For a few months he was hearing voices, seeing things, and feeling extremely paranoid (sleeps holding a bat because he thinks someone is breaking in). He completely cut me out, said he can’t handle a relationship (which I understand...), said he doesn’t know if he’s capable of love and doesn’t feel emotions.

schizophrenia,MrFrustration,2018/02/10,"Can people with mild drug-induced schizophrenia live alone? My 29 year old stepson has mild Meth-induced schizophrenia, he is on anti psychotropics and I see no signs of schizophrenia.

He wants to move out and gets tons of disability money to move out. He's never been violent or talked about violencee, if anything he's so mellow he walks in slow motion due to the anti-anxiety drugs he's also on.

schizophrenia,danel-i-am,2018/02/10,"How do you deal with intense hallucinations? Hi you amazing people,

My girlfriend was first diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years back, though she’s been suffering the symptoms since she was about 10 years old. She’s had a lot of cruel doctors misdiagnosing her and filling her up with meds but right now she’s found a good one, who’s successfully been able to get her schizophrenia-free for sometimes months at a time. One thing she constantly asks the doctor is how can she deal with her hallucinations when they get out of hand. 

Basically she’s given a choice many times a day where her auditory and visual hallucinations tell her she can either hurt herself, or watch her loved ones die a horrible painful death in front of her. I wanted to ask those of you out there who suffer from these type of situations if you have any ways of dealing with taking the latter choice. Are there any ways of desensitising yourself when they happen? Maybe some way you can convince yourself that it isn’t real even though you believe it to be?

Any answers are truly appreciated.",9.148781725888329,8.57461740609137,8.265588832487309,70.8902614213198,60.21827411167513,10.72263959390863,35.43604060913705,9.888512548439397,3.278687715736041,867,31,154,14,10,270,127,197,0.146,0.715,0.139,-0.5408,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,6,2,2,13,10,1,0,10,0,15,7,1,2,0,21,25,11,2,2,4,0,1,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,8,9,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,5,0,4,7,2,27,5,23,17,4,25,0,3,1,1,36,7,0,4,13,108,35,4,0.12212997958797694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24915772240582726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22835008915876145,0.0,0.0,0.09391041566941506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13759866468024734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319791204644793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07876373327312082,0.37773193873738936,0.0,0.12395935846592265,0.12675163697523653,0.0,0.0,0.25001041839727456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066569968258877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038836982474042,0.0,0.13390921884350654,0.0,0.0,0.12761574721140356,0.0,0.0,0.10243683246076044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799913760919648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074266910124796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10383054123629808,0.11022707485090703,0.0,0.0,0.1238206302439304,0.12269597988109475,0.0,0.1356588750891829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974829845191524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12815486910370244,0.0,0.24827530475258416,0.0,0.1299549090854111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846695502477716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390106544263685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10429833526126102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10102718117156023,0.13727921410243954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207896726680011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12693981152589795,0.09182654538666396,0.0,0.10674698525664417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113773165081628,0.0,0.2399841697148236,0.0,0.14242994648205715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203542623964956,0.2908232793429356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157295405331978
schizophrenia,justherightime,2018/02/10,"How do I know when I'm dealing with PTSD from a psychotic episode? I know this is a super loaded question (and one best for my doctor) but I keep having these moments where I will suddenly stop - think and agress toward myself when I have a moment of remembering my psychosis episodes. 

I repeat moments in my head that have to do with ""Did ""I"" do this? or did my illness?"" and can't differentiate between symptoms and who I am. 

I'm always scared of this, I hate the idea of being a bad person because of this illness, but even worse I hate that I may be a bad person despite this illness.

I have screaming fits mixed with laughing all the time. Is this happening to anyone else?

schizophrenia,Crash-Over-Ride,2018/02/10,"Ssi questions Hey everyone i applied for Ssi back in October, then in November they sent me to a independent doctors office( medical review, physical and mental health ) a week ago i got a phone call asking a bunch of follow up questions, then a day or two later i received a letter in the mail saying i had to call to answer questions. It took me a couple of days to finally get someone on the phone from ssi. The person told me that the paper was sent befor the person called me and not to worried about the paper. Today my dad received a letter asking for his updated medical records since hes my payee. Does this mean my case has been approved already? Also i heard from alot of different friends that my case has moved very fast? How long did it take everyone else to get approved?

schizophrenia,Lovely_Skulls,2018/02/11,"What's the best way to let people know I'm schizophrenic without scaring them? A few years ago, my mother and sister told me that I should start telling people whom I want to have a part of my life, that I'm schizophrenic when we begin the friendship.

Now, the reason why this is becoming a situation is because I'm now 18. I'm going to start college soon and are gonna making new friends. I know what they're saying but heres my issue:

On one hand, I know this will help them so they know what to do if I ever have a bad psychotic episode.

But on the other, I feel like it's going to scare them off. I know I shouldn't just start off with ""Hi I'm schizo."" but my episodes are pretty random.

What do you guys think I should do? When's the right time to open up?

schizophrenia,schizotypalism,2018/02/11,"Extreme self-isolation I have Schizoid and Schizotypal PDs, this was originally posted in r/schizoid but I didn't get any helpful or serious responses and was hoping maybe you guys might be more helpful. Also if you haven't got a serious answer then please refrain  from commenting, I just want advice or anything that anyone thinks might genuinely help.

My therapist told me to go to this farm trip with other people (I can't drive and we were suppose to go in a minibus), and I was like I just can't because I won't be able to leave when I want to and return home (because I cannot drive and rely on the minibus driver to get me there and back), and also will be stuck around other people out in the middle of nowhere with no way to escape and be alone. I'll get there and feel dissociated and uncomfortable, and only be able to think about leaving. She was like 'Its my opinion that you should go, especially as you've told me you want to go home and daydream.' but I just couldn't make myself do it.

Does anyone realise they're similar? Like if you know you'll not be able to just leave when you want and go home, and especially if it's to a place where other people will be around you/ requires you to be social that you just can't make yourself do it?

My self-isolation is really bad, I haven't had any social commitments, jobs or activities that I've been able to hold down since leaving school. I leave the flat like once a week/ only go out for food and necessities ..I just really like being alone, listening to music, daydreaming, reading and drawing (literally all things that I tie into my inner world. I draw my imaginary friends, I read for inspiration for my own fantasy/ a way of escape, I listen to music to help along and set the mood for my daydreams).

I have agreed to do one or two days of volunteer work in a charity shop each week, I'm dreading it tbh but going to give it a shot. This is really one of my biggest problems, I'm a complete hermit. (I'm 23 years old and still young, and I am honestly quite distressed by it. I have a good insight into my behaviours yet feel completely out of control and am also very aware of how they impact my quality of life which I thought would motivate me to change but it isn't???).",7.902321161648516,6.167274681614352,8.170435618193466,74.31196562032885,63.39461883408072,11.544565449498188,35.36365577621183,10.398101306919678,3.4097314969036936,1772,63,351,34,21,585,218,446,0.08800000000000001,0.76,0.152,0.9836,1,4,0,0,0,0,51.0,1,10,1,5,21,17,0,2,13,0,43,2,0,6,2,83,76,40,0,12,18,0,2,5,1,8,1,2,3,1,21,33,1,4,10,4,1,10,12,6,0,3,13,4,49,10,50,45,4,47,0,0,0,0,27,19,0,11,19,235,70,7,0.2930724437908865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07159675004486385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15176733287142186,0.0,0.1757774455615608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09964965583006297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10246153348615893,0.0,0.060293412462334474,0.13044830497009985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0563386547482132,0.06117581223030874,0.08932712076742387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.077507946377874,0.0,0.15364044068908192,0.0,0.08217641654179841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04725187024169356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06411741763543792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409311671116163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08859609058760927,0.0,0.056606760768802264,0.0,0.1148386918212748,0.07028544828366355,0.2914796914110871,0.06145381528096998,0.05859920149420623,0.0,0.0,0.07254694903423821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19644028137105293,0.0,0.2204816675915404,0.07277176612321762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07270729466063032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04026623765023084,0.0,0.0,0.38790175206784416,0.0,0.0,0.05175143355783946,0.17897549046910607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781406598761948,0.0,0.0736076653504367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554517745039381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07688255741676367,0.0780281469468625,0.09929673634358276,0.11144739992653732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15238464844691085,0.0,0.0765495816178792,0.08042638381981779,0.0,0.0,0.07017059711140229,0.0,0.0,0.0701076871024488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779296547429441,0.14657587667818436,0.0,0.14081228403094476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07415123987685211,0.0,0.0,0.15286923779944686,0.0,0.0,0.060608138507722675,0.0,0.0,0.14937522448084195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05851200804712772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506992394946275,0.04867607728007601,0.0938944941172912,0.0,0.05816669596507995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14002163969292686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0715722981230144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06045386478919105,0.1728617205930539,0.1163136322409086,0.11754251827587707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05334005738893115,0.0,0.0,0.05204756385246169,0.0,0.0,0.04718226126095562

schizophrenia,Rain_Daniels,2018/02/11,"Thoughts or Voices? At work quite often just out of the blue I'll these thoughts/voices start up, and multiply as time goes on. While my main mind is trying to think about working on this car, the others start arguing over something I did on that car. Then another few arguing about something random some time ago. The loudest one argues with ME about what I just did two seconds ago. And the number of thoughts or voices keep multiplying and drowning out my only thought I can control. At this point I feel like my mind is fragmenting or breaking apart. It then takes an extreme amount of effort to tell my boss I need a break or to leave. My talking is shaky and heavily shuddered. At this point usually the only solution is to go to the car, lay down. But when I lay down I can't move or talk or think for at very least an hour. There has been times this happened when I got home. collapsed on the floor and wasn't able to move for hours or think.
It had became such a problem my boss moved me to a different position which pays significantly less and I am afraid they may fire me soon.

My questions are
1: Are these voices or thoughts?
2: What should I do? My doc just put me on a new med but the last two it kept coming back.
3: Should I inpacint myself somewhere?

schizophrenia,pizzaboy298,2018/02/11,"Advice on what to do? Im 22 years old,and right now I live with my mom.We've always had,I guess a complex relationship. When I was a teenager,I took her car and wrecked it without her permission.
Well a few months ago(December),I was using her car to get back and forth between work(I worked overnights)
I had just got off work,I was tired and was headed home.I ended up hitting a pole, I drove the car back home and awaited punishment.

I over heard her on the phone speaking with the insurance about it costing $500 in damages.I immadietly withdrew the $500 that same day and gave it to her. Around this time I didn't know how much the extent of my actions would cost.

I've tried to give as much as possible after the event happened.The next month,I gave another.

Fast Forward to today apparently its going to cost around 2k. Anyways a few weeks ago,She asked me how much I had in my bank I replied 1k.

I intended on going back to college this year,and I intended to use it to pay off a loan.She told me to give her all the money I have in my bank account. 

For a few weeks,I asked her if she still needed it and if she wanted to take me to the bank she said not right now.

So...I ended up using the money to pay off my loan when,She found out of course she was enraged.I withdraw everything I have left and shes furious its not 1k because she still doesn't have a car and has been renting.I intended on giving her the money from my returns but she didnt want to hear it.A few weeks before this she was screaming at me because I haven't been giving her money.

So my options as of right now are to leave the house and not come back.

I was thinking about joining the Army or Air Force.I feel like thats my only option,but I'm just worried because the last job I worked overnights when I was put under stress,I would space out alot.Its not even that,I would see things its just that it was like I was in another dimension.I can't quite explain it,but a few people could tell I wasn't there mentally. However,I was hearing things constantly yelling in my ear but I was able to hold it together but you could tell something was wrong with me.



I honestly don't think its possible to even mend things with her at this point unless I give her 10k or another car and even then the fact that I totaled her car still looms over me.
I understand,I fucked up.I already told her I was sorry after it happened but sorry obviously isn't enough.

Tldr:wrecked moms car on accident, Mom has had enough plans on throwing me out, I plan on joining the military but not sure how I will cope mentally.",2.854655095683136,4.241870813084116,3.9569225634178937,89.38134735202493,74.51401869158879,7.18869603916333,25.822207387627948,7.793537801064563,1.2690712060525144,2035,70,441,28,42,661,236,535,0.085,0.884,0.031,-0.9609,4,0,1,0,1,0,59.0,0,1,0,5,29,10,3,0,24,0,41,4,2,9,5,72,82,30,0,10,19,2,1,2,0,4,1,8,1,0,24,20,0,1,7,0,14,16,14,5,1,0,32,10,64,5,63,43,14,80,0,0,1,1,45,35,1,6,33,278,88,6,0.06918441351802984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06760620817950698,0.122655616470178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07634672069657128,0.0,0.05756697429481372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21763766962138226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12317759195698355,0.1293561748600668,0.0,0.0,0.2127941739855163,0.0,0.12652252900224298,0.0,0.05887084023101049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059596246239154126,0.0,0.07476377279980563,0.0,0.11047624921436464,0.0,0.0,0.044618223235401606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255371071020857,0.14297198664720367,0.0,0.13708695790474446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062178489833269124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034981718233749924,0.04942535884097998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585713844872816,0.0,0.06395987547463146,0.036146000581806684,0.3318399679928073,0.07863819311546308,0.0,0.055333095606821904,0.0,0.07621443140985791,0.0,0.06117954838895937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0710031679732818,0.0,0.15595172440967492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13879521542172613,0.0,0.0,0.07982952432263975,0.0,0.0,0.07473103870443809,0.0,0.06865485508651174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038021944340786366,0.05639453093786075,0.0,0.07325630447488572,0.07516906771820132,0.0,0.0,0.06760001961039717,0.0,0.0610911046536341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13944323295690436,0.0,0.0,0.24308384684019016,0.11044467762457046,0.0,0.15257551318919335,0.051299365991098536,0.0,0.0,0.07357840865648356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259740391615015,0.0,0.0,0.052617864049534176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04796376120334754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540163315322642,0.15599006218486072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954944444885511,0.0,0.07358613985421439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07427816857439072,0.0,0.17724933338155294,0.06581022032692753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0551310202376558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05326154157080771,0.0,0.15489257344414695,0.0,0.0,0.16575228601394654,0.0,0.0792505119351698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06520549097684071,0.0,0.052018068859060976,0.0,0.1209404536824428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13788915049481335,0.08866115727634845,0.0,0.0,0.040341987888678765,0.079517305900606,0.0655787344939519,0.13221734389876846,0.07686642904323818,0.0469716753945667,0.0,0.0,0.07202341439165783,0.0,0.1792593601013142,0.0,0.0,0.08161351919855843,0.0,0.11099112676934303,0.0,0.062205096466752874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06669130577982701,0.0,0.20146830809405555,0.07026013021890913,0.0,0.1474398670962355,0.07564229543078052,0.0,0.0891049880110272

Can the therapist do that or would they refer me to a psychologist?",2.00205882352941,4.183784696078433,4.121333333333337,83.68200000000002,79.49019607843138,8.393725490196081,23.925490196078428,9.120678840339163,2.100636078431372,397,14,81,11,10,136,65,102,0.052000000000000005,0.888,0.06,-0.3049,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,0,6,1,0,0,9,0,10,3,1,0,0,13,17,5,0,3,6,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,7,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,3,1,0,0,5,0,12,0,13,10,0,13,0,1,0,0,8,8,0,4,2,60,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495456988675587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09008974941287262,0.0,0.0,0.1417843857508779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12554611460873968,0.0,0.13168913540222935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079390152703706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12352912742569575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14336423878837326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936325675195013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15769520484332705,0.0,0.14580209960011994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15177570918957853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407249403022872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15648695068616422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08949023828908367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10754168556067054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8109655863332179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108998022060298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13348164176139493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478785931276266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949583441767498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923315121781943,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,lurkinese,2018/02/12,"My brother has schizophrenia, and I've given up on him.. My brother is 26 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia a couple of years ago. It started of small with random spouts of paranoia and now it's to the point that I can't even speak to him. He's constantly in denial saying he doesn't need the medication. Constantly getting in arguments and physically fighting my family and friends.I know this is silly but In his mind my family is in a mafia and everyone else is apart of the rival gang or mafia. He thinks everyone is plotting against him and trying to take over. He had been involuntarily hospitalized twice now but refuses to take the medication because he doesn't like how it makes him feel. He also claims to have  telepathy. I love my brother, I used to look up to him. He used to be the most popular guy in School and everyone wanted to be his friend, but now he's all alone, he's turned on everyone who has every helped him and no one wants to be near him. I can't take it anymore, it's tearing up my family and it's stressing me out. We can't have a family dinner or have anyone over without the constant fear that he will have an episode and attack someone. At this point I don't know what to do anymore",4.899877049180327,5.609766241803277,5.929631147540983,79.71198770491806,68.95901639344262,9.214754098360656,30.41393442622951,9.354420925462401,2.5752098360655737,969,37,192,19,16,322,124,244,0.08199999999999999,0.8420000000000001,0.075,0.3108,0,1,0,0,2,1,19.0,1,0,0,0,6,9,2,2,10,0,25,5,0,4,1,37,44,18,0,3,6,3,1,1,1,1,3,2,0,1,12,15,1,1,4,0,0,0,8,4,0,2,4,4,22,5,34,36,2,28,0,0,1,1,32,19,0,4,10,130,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09560437349627407,0.0,0.0,0.1117022424132246,0.0,0.08624928023445606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21392059213034595,0.07541269148610577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122697326430395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06574563517230432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3496493938611154,0.0,0.0,0.11933629011743314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109467604669805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09009658487054566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712352906028822,0.0,0.09087004042631552,0.4122291890924229,0.0,0.0,0.406693420779034,0.12136358989428687,0.05453325908437296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08332625992684646,0.0,0.0563482674413005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10679052908214172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07229098487228965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854538006239285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05269108508177624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056859532596473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09734072524266263,0.0,0.0719921099201818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172992752426168,0.0,0.0,0.1088998692950358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07997096076766272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308336981377841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20391017853691565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576831364549592,0.0,0.10915207660640107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138272885936206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633826691611018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12354420875073535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.243274055940148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06910726666088571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732244919132546,0.11731210725833817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18629916084324866,0.0,0.0,0.12722791823726085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10396556945729486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945321216708003
schizophrenia,scrubling,2018/02/12,"I have a in-law with schizoaffective disorder, and he used to claim to hear voices, but now claims to have never heard voices, can he be telling the truth? Obviously I'm hearing all this about the ""patient"" through immediate family members, and not directly, but I try to help when I can. 

Is it possible to have schizo-affective disorder without hearing voices? Im trying to stay as informed as possible about the situation, and I think his immediate family members like to believe he is fine and never heard voices, but I'm trying to lead them toward the obvious truths so to be better informed to handle his sometimes violent behavior. 

He thinks he is fine now and went off all meds. Everyone is worried to death about him, as his behavior has become erradic again.

schizophrenia,vanilladi,2018/02/12,"Intense paranoia I can handle my auditory hallucinations and bi monthly visual hallucinations, but my paranoia is absolutely killing me.

I watched this documentary on polybius https://youtu.be/_7X6Yeydgyg

I had anxiety for the rest of the day. Everyone in the comments agrees its a myth. Absolute bullshit. How can people accept this? The war and intelligence industry is at a MINIMUM, MINIMUM of fifty years ahead of civilian technology. Do you think something like half a dozen forum posts is enough evidence to debunk that? That is gourmet baked AAA+ grade bullshit served on a solid gold 24 carat platter and people dine on it. The FBI and CIA are ahead of our time.

Do not even get me STARTED on 9/11 and the Iraq War. I will break the text limit of a self post if I start, I really want to but can't, I'm too tired right now. 

I'm on probation. Every single tiny keystroke goes right to an NSA data center in Utah. Every single kilobyte of data. I religiously use a military grade VPN but that doesn't do shit when Google created a digital profile of everything I've viewed with my YouTube accounts. Do you know how much legible information they have from that alone? My GMAIL is tied to so many things in life I feel like I need to run off to Russia, marry this girl I've been talking to for the past few months, and never look back. Then I'm faced with the issue of the FSB and KGB operatives, DO YOU FUCKING EVEN COMPREHEND HOW ELITE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE IS COMPARED TO THE CIA? THEY MAKE THE CIA LOOK LIKE A LEMONADE STAND RAN BY ETHIOPIAN TODDLERS. It's like Steve Jobs coming out with his little iPod while IB fucking M creates custom scratch OSs for airports and the military. I'm not fucking role-playing or anything, if someone can prove me wrong PLEASE DO, my thoughts are killing me.

I am having trouble in my day to day life. I live in a big city and camera's are on every road, street corner, bus stop, train. There is no privacy,i want to cry but can't. The thing that sealed my paranoia was when I was arrested for felony drug possession. I'm on probation for two years and one fuck up or missed meeting and I'm going straight to prison. Fuck this American gestapo I can't handle them. They can arrest me at any moment, knock my door down, NO WARRANT! FELONS DON'T HAVE RIGHTS! THERE IS NO NEED FOR ANY WARRANT AND THEY HAVE A FULL PROFILE OF ME.

Someone please try to legitimately refute my points about how I'm being tracked at every second.


I mean FUCK this post itself is enough to send me to prison as is! I'm an individual who resists this legalized terrorism, I'm a threat to their system for simply not liking it.",3.4032738095238058,5.903698652777778,4.178174603174604,83.42714285714288,76.3611111111111,7.050793650793652,26.952380952380967,8.093282712189389,1.8966166666666668,2107,84,390,37,49,673,276,504,0.211,0.691,0.098,-0.9976,1,1,2,0,0,0,57.0,1,3,6,4,15,22,12,1,27,0,39,15,2,6,2,49,74,30,4,6,11,0,2,5,0,1,4,0,2,2,19,17,2,2,8,1,1,5,12,16,1,5,6,6,41,6,59,66,8,64,0,1,4,7,19,31,7,4,27,241,60,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897895408627485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11684625384209925,0.0,0.06572246832941543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07069828108181908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06606104857058741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07400560727188736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437033159929163,0.16621845741816965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963068034059283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1775401868808148,0.0,0.11348817203558455,0.0,0.289538364861109,0.08209262700740202,0.07721219354813626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043439704086628776,0.06137557189389831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4765457280520404,0.04488549014936356,0.0,0.0488257868869796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966983939832268,0.08525443402008538,0.0,0.1900978660733937,0.0,0.04721500527577078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213644159996698,0.2098613930642229,0.08610642465577183,0.07586189708425478,0.0,0.14428893657041464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057346947606161186,0.08710131469739643,0.0,0.0935833874007001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13714832650289044,0.0,0.06315522772510769,0.12740536434456945,0.06626065437998019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05821621541915033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08201275444641644,0.11912116949961468,0.0,0.0,0.18861122160699775,0.0812146382283023,0.0,0.246839931378579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05503744676591172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22010521439219466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896249847316262,0.0,0.08818746491843564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14558596962406228,0.06613927851037826,0.0,0.0,0.12161795502415422,0.0,0.0,0.0718263045463486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06905283598203184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11415227146603997,0.05504896029302005,0.0,0.06820455590416108,0.050095995983977466,0.09874324111260173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05832862942748687,0.0,0.08392357048182751,0.0,0.0,0.07420041048800115,0.0,0.0,0.10134628321468056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09393131886747297,0.0,0.1106490620608575
schizophrenia,OverlordSheepie,2018/02/12,"I’m confused Never been diagnosed. Dom’t even know if I should be here. I feel like everyone is watching me, the only way I can get over it is not caring. But I really want privacy.  Everyone can read my mind. 
Things have been feeling worse because I’ve become friends with someone who suffers from hallucinations and talks about their mental illness a lot. I feel really bad and uncomfortable when they do it. It seems to make me feel worse and I can’t stop thinking about it.  Like, mentally ill people need acceptance, why am I disturbed?
Someone talking openly about their issues makes me jealous I think. I want to also but I feel like I have to keep it all in.  If I talk about it something bad will happen, like it will get worse or there will be bad stuff.  Everyone thinks I’m lying or overreacting.

Sometimes I just want to give up, it’s all my fault anyways. I think I did something wrong in a past life and this is all payback. The universe is out to get me and people all want to control me because they hate me.

I’m sorry. I really shouldn’t be here. I just don’t know where else to talk. People here are scared too so I feel like I can understand a little bit.

I just want an answer why I do this. I’m too scared to ask my therapist though and I don’t want to talk to anybody about it. They’ll figure me out and I think that would be bad.

schizophrenia,chrisbluemonkey,2018/02/12,Just wanted to share Last night my daughter had her first sleep over since her diagnosis. It was at the house of a new friend. I was terrified. Almost didn't let her go. I was a wreck all night worried about her being unable to keep a grip if hallucinations presented themselves and she was alone in a strange place. When I picked her up everything was fine. The mom said that they were adorable and sweet and had a great time building blanket forts and watching movies and playing pranks on the older sister. It was all so normal. She was happy. And I know that we'll have bad days and times but for right now I feel so hopeful for her future. It's possible for her to carve out a bit of normalcy. There's light in our world today. :),2.5885714285714267,4.861897103448278,3.097561576354682,91.30181034482763,77.9655172413793,6.0738916256157625,22.081280788177338,7.1686216300943375,0.6052660098522162,580,17,120,7,14,180,101,145,0.07400000000000001,0.759,0.16699999999999998,0.9344,0,1,0,0,0,0,14.0,2,0,1,1,7,10,0,0,9,0,15,1,1,1,2,21,22,12,0,4,3,3,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,5,8,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,12,6,18,9,16,7,3,25,0,0,1,0,18,10,0,3,14,80,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18083393328251174,0.187035881674491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15078438503419828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19715656392717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11646505271211732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623018706456646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131129306873777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15360902650919042,0.0,0.0,0.13952271821367127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263296745433068,0.0,0.0,0.1991001595629527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19224049291485545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793657591571056,0.0,0.2083756161505476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16051592131366146,0.0,0.0,0.09924706612596283,0.14720424844577445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18466462646552148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2115038130372724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744141125094015,0.0,0.33894134068228665,0.17693901020913366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886772102906141,0.0,0.0,0.20358711640170868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15422213510204716,0.17178162247595555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14938519914618806,0.0,0.1807195549396752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21060595448537164,0.0,0.17117738483974634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10651615109518547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18339703323311465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Missmerrymac,2018/02/13,"My Cat [Poem] Hello! This is a poem about past experiences I endured regarding old self harm practices. I was unaware at the time that they were a result of my actions, for I truly thought that a common hallucination that I used to experience (and had began to think was real at the time..) was responsible. It wasn't until I received proper treatment and got properly medicated that I was able to get a better grasp on my life as well as my sanity.

""[Her] cat got [her],
[She] explained,
As [she] yanked [her] sweater sleeve, 
Over the scarred wasteland,
That had become [her] arm.
[She] claimed,
[She] had picked [him] up,
Just the other day,
And accidentally grazed [his] belly,
So [he] attacked [her].
No biggie,
At least,
Not in [her] mind.
Regardless, 
Doctors were called,
And dosages were upped,
As [she] was once again,
Dragged back to the psych ward,
[She] had come to know all too well.
Still,
Despite all of [their] allegations,
[She] swore,
That [her] cat had got [her],
On Thursday in fact.
That [his] claws,
Were the reason,
[Her] arm looked like minced meat.
But alas,
[Her] pleas,
[Her] promises,
[Her] cries,
Fell on deaf ears.
For [she] was the only one,

schizophrenia,chadrod,2018/02/13,"Could this be some type of schizophrenia? First let me start by saying that I have never been to a psychiatrist, although I have been to a counselor for marriage issues previously.
Also let me state that mental issues run in my family as my grandmother was a diagnosed schizophrenic and my mother was possibly undiagnosed bi-polar schizophrenic.

I have been diagnosed as a sexual compulsive last year while undergoing counseling and have been undergoing CBT for that.
However in the last couple of months I have been under enormous stress, the highest in my life, as I deal with some potentially very serious legal issues.

Since all of this started I have been having issues with night time hallucinations (people moving outside my windows, shadow figures who are there and then they aren't, etc...)
Also I have been hearing music, mostly at night but not always, that absolutely is not there.
At night I often hear people outside my windows having discussions about me. I cant tell what they are saying but I keep hearing my name.
I am also undergoing panic attacks on a regular basis, sometimes multiple times a day, to the point that I have to go hide in the bathroom to keep from passing out until I calm down.

Could this be some type of schizophrenia coming on later in life? I am 40 years old.

I am just tired of being scared and exhausted all the time.",7.1270121951219485,8.327818398373989,7.53064024390244,68.45620426829271,64.20325203252034,10.215040650406506,32.44817073170732,10.270032843473604,3.61679756097561,1090,42,170,25,16,357,137,246,0.103,0.879,0.018000000000000002,-0.9662,1,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,2,1,8,7,1,3,11,0,34,8,0,0,3,27,43,16,0,2,5,1,0,0,0,0,8,5,2,0,10,8,0,2,1,0,0,5,5,6,0,1,9,5,27,1,33,27,7,41,0,0,0,0,14,14,0,5,21,142,37,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24516473123254104,0.0850305482408753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1162562631459578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08802792838931635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1631813405753253,0.1130716662732258,0.0,0.06590431457818964,0.10535375221679523,0.0,0.20744208573558495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139692406410996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633595678353876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869230500426149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058077124559611074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3455278166372005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4266406556053245,0.0,0.1816629371080488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665975306909717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20899309021274146,0.14436011694871234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298382616119077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156735353685265,0.108612157846773,0.0,0.0,0.07881548917450541,0.0,0.0,0.2876961314106892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10723157038341423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989834453059747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416918280237804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660290107288927,0.11520425270033605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1625317181856008,0.10231035646203927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453290432273654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010688581469912,0.0,0.14466169565219106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11705868791552275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08931886039774685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17876402517181528,0.1174527617300022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08431773180945296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316144555865055
schizophrenia,cliffhouseview,2018/02/13,"Question for those who have tried dating If you dated and then broke up with someone did you find it unusually hard to let go? I'm wondering if my daughter's misery has to do with the illness or not. She dated a guy for only a month when he broke it off. It threw her into deep depression and unhealthy obsession with him, even though he wasn't all that great. She can't seem to move on. If this is a symptom of the illness I'm wondering if she should ask for a medication increase (Abilify) or if she should just tough it out a bit longer. It makes me worry what will happen if she dates someone more seriously and then faces a break up. Any suggestions to help her get through this?",4.701231884057972,5.320311007246378,5.439275362318841,83.37601449275364,69.3623188405797,8.742028985507247,29.10144927536232,8.841846274778883,2.0825014492753624,541,19,112,9,9,176,94,138,0.235,0.732,0.033,-0.9817,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,2,0,0,4,7,0,1,8,0,11,5,1,1,1,27,22,15,0,8,10,1,1,0,0,3,4,0,0,1,11,8,0,0,5,0,0,4,3,6,0,0,3,1,12,1,18,15,4,20,0,3,0,0,19,7,0,12,8,80,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12987595667907484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17854465437122188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20850552523023844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16449460355628653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12614341008141444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745563025186264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09978147835249504,0.0,0.108540848748552,0.0,0.0,0.21056100043634807,0.0,0.18910460515865124,0.1688868943985185,0.0,0.17108452971803667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280128328635695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19529451196391634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12748358527676626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923967134501625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15244194422841928,0.20298621680211146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14525225967200758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2139462624406337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17386504569760064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3236409634411968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19850594198000904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876412257781412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966588657452838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4142289194812126,0.0,0.19395395201786805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,adnawahs,2018/02/13,"RANT: Schizophrenic brother currently going crazy? I’m currently laying in my bed, in my room on the third floor of my house. My schizophrenic brother is going nuts, constantly shouting “get off of me” and other vulgar things while making loud noise and jumping and running. I’m guessing he’s fighting this person/voice/hallucination. Honestly this is rant, I’m 20 and diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features so I definitely experienced the delusions and hallucinations and know how intense they are but also I just tried to commit suicide in December and I’m trying to heal and recover but my living space is horrible. He does this all the time and smokes weed 24/7. A part of me is very apathetic and I don’t care because of how my family treats me like a slave and don’t give two shits about my life. But I’m also trying not to have a heavy heart and I feel bad he’s dealing with this but I need to get away ASAP! My parents only seem to care about him but also don’t know what to do.

schizophrenia,StreetEntertainment,2018/02/13,"Skip my graduation? I'm graduating in May with a 4 year degree. It took me a very long time to get it for many reasons, including being homeless a lot, especially when I was a kid. I'm proud of my accomplishment but I don't have anyone to go with me to the ceremony. 

I have to fly from West coast to East coast for it and I don't have anyone to stay with or see. I'll be staying in a hotel by myself before the ceremony, without being able to really go out because of symptoms.

Before the ceremony, everyone else is going to be catching up with relatives that love them and are proud of them. I'll be eating pizza alone in my hotel room. After the ceremony, everyone is going to be celebrating and taking pictures and I'm just going to be there by myself waiting for an Uber.


How do I even go through that kind of pain?

schizophrenia,dude998,2018/02/13,"how do I help my schizophrenic brother when I can barely help myself..... my brother was in a car accident 11 years ago, he had a closed head injury. He's always been a little weird but last winter he went from a little weird to undeniably schizophrenic and extremely manic in the matter of a couple weeks. He was largely symptom free for most of the summer w/ medication; but with the return of winter back comes the schizophrenia. I'm not sure if there is a weather component here or if it's just coincidence of him going off his meds. 

last autumn the only relationship I've had that even remotely qualifies as supportive fell apart, in response I cut out of my life people who are chronic sources of stress, including my mother. My mother has correspondingly taken more interest in my brother, and because she is herself some flavor of screwed up (I'm not sure what kind of fucked up she is, but I think sociopath is at least in the cards) she has to antagonize every situation (why I've stopped talking to her.... )....... I know my brother is schizophrenic, and I know my mother is antagonizing it; how much it is of each is what I don't know.

I did manage last winter to get him to sign papers giving me power of attorney etc in-order to keep those powers from defaulting to my mother if he gets institutionalized. Which has happened once so far.

he seems to be aware enough to hide his schizophrenia, but he trusts me enough show it.

last winter when I ""talked"" to him, it'd be 3-4 hours of listening to him talk. Most people talk louder and faster than me, he normally talks louder and faster than most people and when he was manic and schizophrenic last winter he was talking louder and faster than his normal so I really wan't getting a word in. But after those sessions I'd spend 3-4 days basically being a zombie barely capable of dealing with anyone or anything and really not wanting to. My economic calculation is that if talk to my brother once a week then I'm going to lose my job because for half the week I can't function. Which is obviously not sustainable. It's better this winter, he's not as manic so it's not as taxing.

he has substantial assets from a lawsuit stemming from his car accident. I could probably pretty easily get him to put his assets into a trust right now, but ethically I feel like he needs to be brought out of his schizophrenic state before that can be talked about.

when he was symptom free during the summer, his speech patterns seemed to revert to what they where 6mo-3yrs after his car accident. I'm not sure if that's the drugs or trauma of the schizophrenic episode.

this is more venting I guess. But what the fuck do I do?",5.4197260273972585,6.578078917808219,6.268383561643834,76.12558904109592,68.04109589041096,9.049393346379649,29.08140900195695,9.312151188531436,2.56520023483366,2121,74,380,41,35,700,238,511,0.128,0.777,0.095,-0.9577,3,0,1,0,0,0,62.0,0,0,1,4,17,21,4,1,22,0,39,16,1,2,4,68,70,37,0,10,23,9,1,1,0,0,12,2,0,0,22,17,0,2,7,1,4,10,9,9,0,1,12,4,50,14,62,51,12,66,0,1,0,3,57,20,3,15,36,255,72,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083133367511492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06648771058819168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055871727606677225,0.0,0.06575535233478917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06144233576679808,0.0,0.09741920483906208,0.0,0.06799362716750827,0.0,0.0,0.07066985060705286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883144408109815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06379797596288955,0.08841382748235517,0.0,0.05153238553484255,0.08237897945720961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266491898959574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16512731799549307,0.08911566542221554,0.05277677635043725,0.0,0.0673237627016967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0404025812767577,0.05708444806404656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14774254655232738,0.16698913604846402,0.07665255999215599,0.09082418329410576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08802482882409783,0.0,0.0706600990764224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820060137063279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10711783747824864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786907430480491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07929379981114397,0.07102360879072042,0.0,0.08320919882584144,0.13174178749003418,0.3256679109580289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05643956127963385,0.03903775206765635,0.16017244563489946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939372604373101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887569083105477,0.08049630424423145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058739677787105975,0.05924885650419121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15658069228352905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17019332908804452,0.0,0.06077167263955755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661890717381307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08129253872850539,0.08615155758912288,0.0,0.0,0.0803270171957186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10237891638444374,0.0,0.0,0.08578851738678102,0.0,0.06823879214419827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454857867885211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08981704006482531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06680450910659537,0.09153138871824128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09067572377365456,0.22592973832323024,0.1661046533837979,0.0,0.5137995991116203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051200166741567625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04713028703548207,0.0,0.19228592447915585,0.0,0.0,0.07407312494327177,0.07210221312036337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05145647072313821

schizophrenia,Cantthinkofagoodd,2018/02/13,"confused caregiver (update) About 8 months ago, I posted here about myself being overwhelmed with caregiving. Since that post, my situation has significantly improved. 

My mother is 80% independent now. I just mostly oversee things (I'd consider myself a secondary caregiver now). I make sure she's taking her medication and I control the finances. Although, she's still a bit codependent on me, I've been setting boundaries and encouraging her to find hobbies.       

She rarely has really bad days and seems a lot happier than before.

I am a 30yo M with schizophrenia which hit in my mid-twenties. I'm looking for advice about anti-psych medications, and other medications as well.

Are there any medications which do not lower testosterone in men, or which at the least, do not increase serum prolactin in men?

schizophrenia,xXB00MS14N6Xx,2018/02/13,"I have returned. Stay yourselves. Greetings...  

I come to you, humble, not that humble, tormented, yet still, unbroken soul.  I have traveled these lands with many names. Many names, because I practiced no accountability or suffered mortifying humiliation, or I wanted to forget the past.

I've tried to move on, and the advice I was given was straight denial of the psychological situation I am afflicted with.  So after some time, years even, I grew used to the theater in my mind.  Constantly in forum, argument or conversation with various persons.  They exist in my mind and things go one way or the other down hill one time or another.  

It's been bad the last year, constant torment from the, uhh, people that can talk to me in my brain and from exposure to the public as well.  I was going on about sexual depravity and it was just to much for one of them, and, I'm not supposed to talk about it because it's humiliating. It's been hysterical for going on 18 months.  I laugh lots these days, I'm grateful.

So in recent months it grew quite bad.  You know, I am talking about denial.  I had thought it was outrageously unacceptable to attempt to go into careers of extreme responsibility, not that I am completely unreliable.  But, it just seemed like something utterly absurd to do, law enforcement, military.  

Perhaps in the bronze age it would be fine to do.  Alas, I mean, I had been trying to go into law enforcement or back in the military for about a decade now.  

I just kept being rejected (my psyche record is acceptable).  Between the stress of trying to maintain and then being insulted not once or twice but several times by various agencies.  On top of that I go tormented by these barbiturates in my mind.  It just got to the point now where I just have to move on at 32 years old.  

Ignoring it isn't acceptable.  You can't be more than willing, it's not a privilege, it's not something you should be told to fight for.  There are more opportunities out there to satisfy your needs.  Hunting, martial arts, Beaches, margaritas, girls, coke parties, whatever.

It's quite stressful.  So that's loosely what I experienced the last 18 months, besides details on around a dozen psychotic breaks.

I've normalized again, stopped drinking, stopped making a fool of myself for our amusement.  Cool and good, got to stay frosty these days.  

They did not want me in the military or law enforcement either.  So when I do not do what they want they just torment and torture the hell out of me.


I liked one other cadet's rebuttle to it, ""Fuck'em, I want to be a policeman.""  Hope things worked out for him.



Cheers

I thought I was chosen by god to carry on a legacy and basically I felt important. I also never felt alone and didn't feel the urge to be with someone I was good on my own.
Later I took my first pill of risperidone and that delsusion shatered, I started to feel lonely and depressed because I am no longer important and I also feel the need to be with people. Every day that goes by I try to mimic my behaviour from my delusion, and I try to have that mindset of being in control of everything.

schizophrenia,Liliandoodle,2018/02/14,"Life after diagnosis ... My brother was diagnosed with a severe case of schizophrenia recently. I'm not really sure why they said 'severe.' When I think of 'severe' I think of debilitating, and that is a premature diagnosis IMO. But even 'severe' diagnosises have been managed, so our family is going to support him and hope to get him into a normal lifestyle in the future. 

This diagnosis isn't a surprise to our family as we have been seeking medical advice for a few years now. We still view him the same, and just want to support him through this journey. Right now we are leaning on the medical professionals to handle his initial recovery, but what happens after that? I have a lot of questions about life after diagnosis. 

1. Financial - I am expecting this to be substansial, what are some real numbers that others who have gone through treatment seen?This is a burden we want to handle but need some time to prep for, have people seen numbers like $20,000, $50,000, $100,000?

2. Relationships - because it took so long to diagnose, a lot of people were impacted. There are a few assault charges and a lot of inappropriate words spoken. Has anyone had to mend relationships after the fact? How did it go? Did you remember these events? What role should your family play? 

3. Location - After you learned to navigate your life with schizophrenia did you personally find it beneficial to go back home or perhaps start fresh in a new location? I don't want him to hide his schizophrenia, but purely for recovery purposes I want him to be in the best environment he can be in. 

4. Responsibility - After being released from a clinic when should you press for him to get a job, pay bills, etc. This could be a jarring change of environment, but sometimes jumping into a routine is a good thing. On the flip side, is that too much stress? Should there be a break, when should we push him, when should you let him be ... 

He is a straight A student, great in sports, a teddy bear until the last few years. This guy has amazing potential and even with this constant battle he is going to have to deal with everyday, I am sure he will do great things. I want our family to make sure we support him the way he needs support so any tips and personal experiences are greatly appreciated.

schizophrenia,DerDochenThe3rd,2018/02/14,"Should I see someone? First things first, I would like to offer you guys my sincerest apologies. I know this sub isn’t for guys like me who aren’t diagnosed and may not even be schizophrenic but I’m very concerned and dont know how to approach my family due to my fear of them over reacting and the possibility that there may be nothing wrong with me.
Ok, now to begin. I’m only 16 years old. About the time I turned 14 I realised that I was hearing some kind of whisper in my head. I didn’t think much of it back then, it was only a whisper and it could be drowned easily by the sound of the TV or music or something. Over the years however, I’ve noticed that the “whispers” have gotten significantly louder, to the point where the “sound” coming from them is louder than my surroundings, more recently, they have taken the shape of people I know and love, usually its more than one whisper at a time so I cant really identify what they’re saying.
I’ve also kind of been seeing things. Now its mostly existing creature that interact with my surroundings. Like if there’s a hole or something, then snakes will start to come out of it. They start slithering at around, climbing my teachers and other students until they eventually make their way onto me. At first I used to freak out cuz I used to think they were real. Now I only freak out as soon as I see them, then calm down quickly. Keep in mind all of these hallucinations started during my winter break, so I’ve been able to avoid interactions with other people and haven’t freaked out around anyone yet.
Now onto the physical side of things. I constantly feel like I’m being watched. I started covering my webcam, closing the curtains, turning of the lights. 
I also feel like I’m taking less care of myself than before, sometimes I just forget to shower for two days, or maybe I would forget to brush my teeth or shave for a quite a long time.
I’ve also been having serious trust issues at school. I’m still pretty social, but sometimes I just feel the compulsive need to just sit by myself in an empty class and do nothing. At other times I get a surge of energy and become like my old self, except jumpier and louder.
I’ve been studying less, going on youtube less, walking my dog less. And sitting down and staring a whole lot more.
It really sucks because all of this happened in a short period of time and I don’t know whats wrong. Ive looked up these symptoms online and it says that I have schizophrenia, but I don’t know.
I just feel like maybe someone with actual schizophrenia can maybe confirm or deny this so that I can address this topic with my parents to hopefully get something done.

schizophrenia,lecheconcarne2,2018/02/14,"Hi Schizoaffective dude here. Need some advice and help with some paranoid thoughts So anyways, ill try to make this concise. I always have paranoid thoughts that my stepdad is out to murder me due to my past drug abuse and the toll it took on the family. Deep down, i know its false, but there ya go.

So, some money (1000 bucks) was recently withdrawn from my parents debit cards over 3 states away. The thing is, in my paranoid mind, i think thats money he's given away to someone to put a hit on me. My mind says how the hell would someone just randomly get acsess to his debit card.


He called and reported it as fraud or whatever and the bank is investigating. My minds still messing with me though, help me please guys.

schizophrenia,joywyr,2018/02/14,"Just wanted to subscribe, introduce myself, and share the album I've been working on in if it's okay. Hi!  I've been a lurker on this sub for some time now.  It's been a major inspiration to me and I wanted to join in the community.  I was diagnosed about a year ago.  It's been a rough couple of years as I was in and out of the hospital, diagnosed general anxiety, depression, bi-polar, going on and off different medications etc.  Recently I took to an old hobby of working on music to express myself and my delusions and hallucinations and visions and emotions.  I wanted to share as a means of introducing myself and my world and perhaps even help others.  Thank you for this opportunity.  I hope to discuss more in the future.",4.2446363636363635,5.981870242857141,6.4836363636363625,71.2468181818182,71.57142857142857,9.376623376623376,29.870129870129876,9.800150414767053,3.2139285714285712,574,24,100,15,11,203,82,140,0.038,0.7829999999999999,0.179,0.952,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,0,3,4,8,0,0,10,1,6,3,0,0,0,21,14,13,0,5,2,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,11,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,7,1,13,7,26,7,4,21,0,1,0,0,7,11,0,3,8,78,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1710302318477172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475990579252402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21348514320243372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16617948649052006,0.391661366981724,0.0,0.20158189859829848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21703224564601434,0.0,0.0,0.2151798099458896,0.12743546996859165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965260937637758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12932404084724602,0.0,0.0,0.19163358531071695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21016891435913893,0.0,0.19436739171003545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024587406699048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905056008560906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776338146194246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11250523604805486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21436414505759727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3414041569102876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809261608633423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2484948866898297
schizophrenia,Hi_I_Am_God_AMA,2018/02/14,You ever thought people were demons? Maybe not all of them but you just know who is. And they're like just a part of your story or they're trying to get you to kill yourself. And you can't ever tell them they're demons/antagonists because maybe they'd make you freak the fuck out and get hospitalized then act like everything's normal when really they were demons. And they just know everything about you and what you're thinking.

schizophrenia,cbangs,2018/02/14,"Breakthrough psychosis Hey everyone,
I am unsure if I am posting in the right place but was wondering is someone could answer some questions for me.
My partner has schizophrenia, and has managed his psychosis and other symptoms amazingly over the past few years. In the past two months he has been experiencing what his psychiatrist described as ‘breakthrough psychosis’ however did not explain much further around this. I have tried to read up on it as much as possible but am struggling to find enough information, is anyone able to tell me what exactly it means? And any advice on how I can support him further? I know everyone has individual needs however recently seeing him experience this he has been so down and scared and I feel stuck in how I can further my support more than usual. Thanks so much for your time guys :-) ",7.3553061224489795,8.945777761904765,6.919870748299321,71.6328673469388,63.89795918367346,9.689523809523813,37.829251700680274,9.888512548439397,4.067601904761904,669,34,106,14,10,209,96,147,0.075,0.833,0.092,0.5733,2,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,1,0,0,5,6,0,2,3,0,18,1,0,2,1,25,29,15,0,3,4,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,7,6,0,0,9,1,0,0,1,2,0,1,5,3,16,4,18,23,7,22,0,0,1,0,14,14,0,4,7,83,23,2,0.14687158075123466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14352120888230951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09987771135194627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269602419561004,0.0,0.0,0.13074684545196044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11726500618056508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517576041643172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2806841789022471,0.0,0.1436685884214682,0.0,0.0,0.07426268422505591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13423796400359708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454259560607541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071677975721286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15998620831739227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11723149451902087,0.0,0.3239025333384921,0.1089034161239982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2804110853856389,0.0,0.0,0.15344954186256646,0.0,0.0,0.16557563943649878,0.14066237530490275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16452978358169176,0.0,0.14691132628684486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14501796727231936,0.0,0.0,0.12542752746887104,0.0,0.0,0.14704407428640756,0.0,0.11703763433107148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12444381375422688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15354206544023022,0.0,0.0,0.3333362586590503,0.0,0.15265580852441096,0.0,0.0,0.12837223520354615,0.1352196187365448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564199984601015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997161624263248,0.0,0.14347219311858936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16175829633684966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15927596420253706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09458048262986887
schizophrenia,Cthula-Hoops,2018/02/14,"Schizoid Neuroscientist? I'm a 3rd year psychology major and thinking about switching to neuroscience but this (in my head of course) sounds like a really bad idea.
I've been living rather well with schizo-affective disorder for years and I know how to drag myself out of the depths to make myself a functional person again whenever I have an episode BUT.

I can't shake this overwhelming feeling that I shouldn't pursue this degree because I feel like i might get discredited for my mental illness and I don't want to waste my time. I just need somebody to tell me I'm being irrational and I can go from there because I'm worried I really might be right.

Edit: I'm really bad at hiding it and I have a tendency to tell people what's going on if I get the feeling they are thinking I'm a wierdo. I'm worried that this open attitude will hurt me somewhere down the road.

Edit 2: I'm brand new to the sub and fairly new to reddit in general.

rationally i know i don´t need to feel guilty but for some reason i spend 10 hours a day feeling guilty for the past year.

my biggest fear is that the guilt isn´t going away and i want to kill my self because of this (shrink already knows this).

this is really a nightmare i dream about what i feel guilty about when i wake up i think about it.. littery 24/7 

i try to do activities but i can´t just stop feeling guilty/ruminating

schizophrenia,magus_cat,2018/02/14,"Anyone else take Clozaril? Been on this drug since November 2017. It sucks having to go into the clinic for weekly blood draws but I guess I've been doing better. The only other antipsychotic I've taken that I think really had an effect on me was Risperdal. But that also made me kind of depressed and I gained about 20 lbs on it.

As someone who is used to taking drugs with immediate effects (like narcotics) it's hard to say what Clozaril has done for me thus far. My doctor stressed the long-term benefits of this pill. Like with Risperdal, I feel generally less anxious or on-edge. I have fewer outbursts of rage. I also don't feel so tormented by invasive thoughts, like that people can read my mind or I am being plotted against. All too often I experienced this sensation when listening to myself talk; it's like during a conversation I will take my own voice out of context and dwell on the sound of the things I have said. It's uncomfortable and makes me feel distant. Those sensations have ceased not entirely but it's better.

Trying to relate to people on a personal level still feels weird and I don't know how to do it. I don't think I'm ready to start forming new relationships yet. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I don't know how it will go. I'm not good at talking about myself... or my boring life. Therapy is new for me as well. My psychiatrist said I will get better at talking about myself.

I think I'm making this post because of the thoughts I've been having lately about quitting my meds. I've done it before and I ended up back in the hospital again. My goal is to stay out of the damn hospital! Anyone else have success with this medicine?",3.6572188449848007,5.665202693009121,4.630189969604864,82.79446428571428,73.74164133738604,7.61793313069909,26.035714285714285,8.418075326091056,1.829448024316109,1342,47,254,24,28,436,179,329,0.105,0.784,0.111,0.6343,0,0,2,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,0,9,17,20,3,2,12,0,30,7,1,9,1,46,61,20,0,0,8,0,5,4,0,3,6,6,0,1,22,13,0,0,13,1,0,2,6,8,1,0,13,12,33,12,43,44,4,30,0,1,0,0,11,14,2,5,16,171,55,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16046739930789813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334410897139803,0.0,0.14030584886840455,0.2055994598373156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07714741825155122,0.0,0.061160110920733674,0.0,0.0853732646727658,0.0,0.0,0.26620064754291484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08641390417011155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10269179503600846,0.0,0.205344425124338,0.0,0.0,0.2327014158338532,0.0,0.16762533694656934,0.0,0.08886241762505774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20291903276793355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05241817617046707,0.0,0.1140394675511711,0.08415187071510477,0.0,0.0,0.1105245788765001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08987578824118828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044780408179493,0.11027726136883803,0.0,0.11317637718284684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086590028901299,0.19606427710004284,0.0,0.0,0.08878871009745676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949344765301322,0.1339418325367636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11144378290137456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10130449067656866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19379827961062154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630532902858457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391120922971899,0.08760410582750536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608820850459043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10671308527904752,0.1003569442172234,0.0,0.06427383483945692,0.0,0.0,0.10771665089586116,0.0,0.0,0.19087321791559134,0.07978627877417692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0829938420042151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500910849260908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101394426945395,0.1069382106207228,0.08012350273047758,0.0,0.11492743953278045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2263065556586779,0.24192386289188175,0.0,0.0,0.11473586275287802,0.11649062322995925,0.06665465672820227,0.19286184170241166,0.0,0.15930129826435588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811734399997968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665272844160234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804785085861257,0.0,0.0902085335254585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But the worst part is I can feel pain if I’m hurt in my dream I can feel every second of the pain sometimes I’ll wake up in a panic to see if I actually got hurt and I’ll go the rest of the day with this phantom injury....i think about my nightmares way too much as if they’re trying to tell me something...it’s hard to tell what’s real anymore ",2.6193661971830977,3.2747668521126765,3.659267605633804,94.11918309859156,74.14084507042253,5.961690140845071,21.242253521126766,4.935628992294339,-0.237520563380282,511,10,121,1,10,165,79,142,0.188,0.7040000000000001,0.108,-0.9313,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,2,8,0,10,5,2,0,2,24,19,16,0,5,8,0,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,6,1,0,4,7,0,1,1,8,0,1,4,8,12,0,17,15,6,11,0,2,3,0,2,5,0,7,4,78,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.13906287762110284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11396001221409398,0.11857434306376788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413251984581862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11898448552430768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18380596074812028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941222299491829,0.0,0.12006536041492845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2161621820299015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08098803352626267,0.0,0.11397308164335232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12601539073441295,0.0,0.12765516198171506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051059276430902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047564827208908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3032675817377767,0.16719717479505405,0.0,0.15431742360771933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4866006059374388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11355685420667085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2818792470921333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24910871243274024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28401901673363644,0.09131050057865857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09675053484645403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175803268915855,0.0,0.11311265994758166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,LeckLayer,2018/02/15,"I must talk about it I’ve been living with schizophrenia for 5 years now. In and out of hospitals, juggling through pills and doing my best to stay sane. I speak to a psychiatrist once a week and since I’ve awaken from what seemed to be a 5 year long dream, I’ve finally found a medium, I found myself. I’ve realized that I was crazy and that I needed the proper help to live a fulfilled life. 2 years later every one I know is proud of me and the mountains I have climbed are now behind me.

Now I’m asked to talk to others with the disorder and I’m asking, what helped you to cope, what made you believe the voices are fake, what would you say to your self at the beginning when you started hearing voices? 

I’m no public speaker, but I hope my story will help others realize that schizophrenia is a nasty disease and it can (to some degree) be fixed  ",2.989611890999172,4.576526924855493,3.9622336911643257,88.66475433526014,74.5491329479769,6.561354252683734,23.33980181668043,7.1686216300943375,0.7900738232865403,670,19,138,7,14,216,105,173,0.073,0.823,0.104,0.6369,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,5,0,3,5,4,0,0,11,0,14,2,0,1,1,23,29,9,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,3,2,6,0,1,11,10,0,0,6,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,5,6,18,3,21,19,2,18,0,0,0,0,17,3,0,3,13,91,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2946165811274097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17752937301288518,0.16536180208528298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18059084614979848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13276097280039514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17261212070982634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3455385227345974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17759478399931525,0.0,0.3168510137549512,0.0,0.0,0.15650427504276268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865972982087402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11129756803867512,0.0,0.0,0.27827743684939044,0.13944601653032254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14909817440739606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11683743616144035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16780874261278586,0.10677467762189337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12530735874667792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14344737881226716,0.1643816724032277,0.0,0.0,0.13034495772414936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153007669119556,0.1679504913358074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533003647789009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126394531763313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193443120068193,0.0,0.0,0.3044130706277377

schizophrenia,hthiennguyen,2018/02/15,"Help! I have poor executive functioning. Hi guys
So I've had schizophrenia for the past 11 or so years and I've just found out that this condition and poor executive functioning are related. I know, I'm a bit slow. It's so crippling that when I try to learn something I just can't process it or understand it. I also have poor working memory which affects me to a great extent as well. I just can't remember what I learn. Are there many of you out there with the same issues? I don't know any others with schizophrenia so I feel very alone in this. If so how do you deal with these on a day to day basis? I read that a speech pathologist can help with ways to deal with processing information but not sure if that would be helpful for a schizo!

schizophrenia,gazelleguy,2018/02/15,"Musical thought process? Ok I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder for about 4 years now, and I was wondering if anyone had the same thought process as I do.

When most people think (from what they've said, anyway), they have a single train of thought, that can shift from one topic to another over the course of a conversation. However, when I think, it's more akin to several trains running at once, on separate tracks, in short bursts. I think a more appropriate analogy is my mind being a symphonic orchestra, with each topic an instrument. Yes, more than one instrument can play at once, but they aren't necessarily the same volume or melody. Keep in mind this isn't literal - these aren't auditory hallucinations, but I do have ""background music"" most of the time.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Just curious.",6.396799754299753,8.340284736486488,6.71943488943489,70.85160933660936,66.5,11.5980343980344,33.724815724815734,11.389717465364855,4.514059459459459,663,30,113,23,11,214,101,148,0.014,0.924,0.062,0.6818,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,2,0,6,2,0,0,10,2,16,1,0,0,0,23,25,8,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,5,4,0,1,7,3,0,1,3,0,0,2,8,1,8,2,19,16,9,13,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,5,5,79,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866618027830795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489411918318269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18067911008385976,0.0,0.0,0.2040179389201809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17413054648694645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15822583780679747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3594840963557325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3791553617534884,0.2412519806149628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234115695603052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16933081101005865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20110364465932284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3421899879406321,0.0,0.42396652067741797,0.10380061779177553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19304714408037374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463432131053933

schizophrenia,kyecantreddit,2018/02/16,"Regression I was diagnosed with a myriad of stuff, along with schizophrenia about three and a half years ago. I was put on medications and a treatment plan, not unusual, and for about three years I was doing really well. There were ups and downs of course, but nothing came up that I truly felt that I couldn’t get over. 
Alas,here I am. Three weeks have gone by and I can shower. I can’t eat. I can’t communicate. Little tasks like getting dressed have gone back to being an all morning affair. My head is loud. 

Please tell me that this is a normal “down” time and it will pass.. please tell me that after years of work, I’m not reverting back to square one. 
Please, anyone.... what did I do wrong? What can I do to get better? 
I don’t understand why this is happening, and desperation doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel in terms of fixing this, whatever it is.

schizophrenia,Fctert,2018/02/16,"FOR CARETAKERS: How to deal with the risk of inheritance? LONG POST Hi there, this question is mainly for the caretakers of people with schizophrenia, but i would really welcome any help

I really don't want to be THAT person, but i do have a relative with schizophrenia and i maybe wanted some help and advice with dealing with the haunting risk. This is not much of anxiety advice, but i am looking for your opinion on what to do with the new things that i do experience and at what point should i reconsider seeing a doctor again. I hope you'll understand, thank you. If this post doesn't follow the rules i am sorry, do whatever you want with it

I have a biological father who had been diagnosed with an F20 schizophrenia at the age of 36 or something like that. I didn't even know that until he told me couple months ago and i lived with him every summer for a few years.
He does seem more or less operational, he sorta works with sales stuff, (i was concerned why isn't he working with his degree field, but it makes sense now. the degree became useless in the 90s) and he has friends, he was in the relationship since my parents divorced and he generally seems normal, which makes him and my therapist with whom i shared this doubt the diagnosis. He also says that he doesn't take any medicine as he doesn't experience much symptoms and pills only make him feel worse. He does claim to have had telepathic experiences though and he had heard voices. He also has troubles with an alcohol and he had for at least like 5 years before the diagnosis (thats what i can clearly recall to, and my mom said he had been drinking since 98 and was diagnosed in 2007)

Now onto me, i have always been sort of an OCD type, when i was a kid i was checking door knobs for if the doors are locked and etc. Around the age of 16-17 (summer 2014) i have had HOCD (fear of being gay). I've had hypochondriac fears before, but they usually never lasted that long, 2 days the very max, i would find my answer and calm down

And when my mom was diagnosed with cancer in the late 2016 i have had my first major hypochondriac fear obsession. I was never convinced that i do, but i was scared that i am going bald (mpb) which made me look up a lot of info and visit at least one doctor. After my mother's death feb 2017 i have had my fears jump up to a gigantic degree. Since then i have been scared of: ALS, Cancer, Multiple sclerosis, HIV, whatever else etc. I again am never sure that i do have something, but the risk and not knowing kills me, so i would end up going to a doctor and check it. Check up would usually do the trick, but i would end up worrying about something else new

Ever since this late august i've been afraid of schiz, it started with me thinking that my fears are maybe delusions and at that time it was the only concern of mine. Long weeks of freaking out and i was able to talk to a doctor online and figure out that what i've had were definitely not delusions as i've had a critique, insight and was able to abandon them without any anti-psychs. As soon as i figured the delusions out, the next day the fear of voices had stared. I have been hearing things in an environment that i thought were maybe voices, but i couldn't really tell and there was always another half-assed explanation for whats happening Sometime slightly before i learned that i wasn't delusional and first fear of voices started, i learned that my father was diagnosed and it started the second wave of my anxiety. I was convinced by the people online that what i've had was just fine whatever, but when i learned about the risk it all started again. Ever since then i've been super hung up on the fear of schizophrenia and since i do have a genetic risk, i feel like it's gonna be haunting me forever.

Every unusual though i get i take as a symptom of schizophrenia, every sound in my environment i suspect for a hallucination.

I am seeing an anxiety therapist who says that i am fine, but since she doesn't specialize in schiz i wanted to get a second opinion. Or i thought that even if i am not schizophrenic at the moment, i am maybe in the transition stage. So i went to an early psychosis clinic in UCSF where they listened to me and said that i am fine and i am not in the UHR (ultra high risk) group and there is not even a need to watch me, but as i said since there is no definite answer it just keeps haunting me and there is always a feel that something new had came up, that they didn't listen to me or didn't understand or that i have failed to explain something That visit to UCSF was on the last friday the 9th and ever since then i've had so many new things or things i want to elaborate on

Things i experience now:
I DO NOT HAVE ANY SOCIAL SKILLS IMPARED. I don't get to see my friends that often, but at least few times a month i do and actually this past few weeks i have been doing it more frequently. I have things planned with a friend for this weekend and i am going on the date too, so don't think i've been isolating myself 

Like i do get suspicious and unusual thoughts or ideas and while i never believe them, what scares me is their presence. Like i may think that my teacher dislikes me and singles me out, and it is based on evidence. He sternly criticized me over my essay topic, multiple times gave me notices over the phone use in class and once even grabbed it out of my hands. And again, i am not 100% sure if it, i just get a thought and what scares me is not the fact that i get singled out, but that i get this thought in the first place 

I sometimes see parallels between things and any coincidental events happening also scares me, but again more like in the context that it is a symptom. i.e. a person that i never talk to on FB messages me ""hello"", i get weirded out, notice it and i think of schiz again. Most of the time i get anxious before i even formulate a thought in my mind of what it might be ""I accidentally like my own old picture, few minutes later my friend likes it too... While i understand that it either was a coincidence or he was shown that i liked it, i think that i noticed such thing and paid attention to it, therefore i get unusual beliefs and therefore it's a symptom""

I sometimes forget,misuse words, blank out forgetting what i wanted to say/do, spit out the wrong words and misread things sometimes. I have trouble concentrating on reading and following through and generally feeling dumb, but that has been going for at least few years. I always notice those things myself when  and i have mentioned some of those things to my doctor 
 
I do not believe in paranormal, but do have an occasional thought of paranormal stuff (this happened in major way today for the first time so i never brought it up with anyone yet) i've thought that maybe its possible the nightmare that i've had about my mom this night was sent by her as she disproves of my recent actions. I got a tattoo ""mom"" the day before the thing occured and my mom was against tats (i know that the dream was probably a subconscious thing of me combining this new large gesture and the fact that my mom hated tats) And also this is actually something that she herself talked about. She believed that if she dreamt of my grandma, that meant she was trying to get in contact with her. And mom used to always say that she would never haunt me in my dreams. And while i don't believe in anything paranormal, this may have had an effect on me. And again, what scared me in this incident is the fact that i thought of it, the fact that i thought that it maybe possible for me to experience such things 

I always see things with the corner of my eye, like movement in my peripheral vision. All of the movement things turn out to be nothing usually when i look at an object. i.e. i thought i saw my dog walk by with the corner of my eye, i look up, there is nothing

I hear sounds, when im alone they may be just noises like cracks or whatever and they may be environmental, but i also get indistinguishable murmur from time to time. Which does sound like someone talking, but quiet, non definitive (i can't make out words) and not addressing me. So possibly it could be environmental.

For the past 3 days i've had quiet talk sorta around me, but it never happened when i was alone yet. I have always been outside and with someone and it makes more sense that i picked up on someone talking, very often i can't find the source of the sound and it scares me and leaves me wondering 

So can you please tell me how do i deal with those things? Some of them i mentioned to early psychosis clinic,some i did not as they are new or expanded (there is always something new or something that has changed) and for all of the ones i mentioned they have said ""it's whatever"", but how can it be ""Whatever"" if i feel like i am going crazy. I feel like i will become psychotic like very soon any day now. 

And i do understand that i was specifically told that i am not in the transition phase by the people who deal with it, but i just can't help it. Is there a threshold that if i cross i should reconsider going to the doctor? The thing is that having a genetic risk always is going to be there and if not now i may develop it later in life meaning if i am good now i can get sick later and i feel like i always have to watch for it 

Thank you for your help",6.9763798701298665,6.108418477813853,7.08892857142857,78.52482142857146,64.70887445887446,10.124242424242423,32.778138528138534,9.2995712137729,2.6662515151515147,7369,250,1472,112,96,2376,543,1848,0.105,0.812,0.083,-0.992,1,2,10,0,1,0,168.0,0,7,11,11,76,73,4,25,93,0,181,30,5,15,21,299,299,145,2,28,63,11,9,16,4,17,23,22,3,3,141,101,2,2,53,5,6,21,41,37,0,8,88,46,220,36,196,182,33,214,1,3,15,2,121,77,1,44,128,1074,361,16,0.050891054352374315,0.0,0.049662327925070714,0.0,0.0,0.04973014932221108,0.022555924546433744,0.02719353007238581,0.0,0.05270778437010181,0.0,0.10174389444790556,0.21172717009269865,0.0,0.0,0.10382298626468464,0.026681853880617758,0.058397275926937664,0.028746202927737545,0.0,0.017792104239565776,0.0,0.02093950076657601,0.04530382790369246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028102585612559888,0.10826134737651298,0.11467358214061245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029102904323771724,0.0,0.0,0.02691799379590773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02031618292879469,0.028154991838789167,0.0,0.08205129986349619,0.10493288483720027,0.0,0.1033066978387631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15626745170480752,0.06680265691878921,0.0,0.0,0.02492692941929349,0.0,0.0,0.042512945713944594,0.0,0.0450743688910004,0.0,0.05675697804557728,0.08403265358694659,0.0690508083443543,0.0643168623075775,0.0,0.0,0.12445304096082545,0.0,0.22906633880689975,0.09006216164978305,0.07271315879569938,0.0,0.0,0.04651350170888454,0.08657580966884486,0.0,0.0,0.07863660470385166,0.0,0.17282509041399755,0.0,0.10122895640641737,0.02134250094052593,0.020351112575942003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000558258703324,0.0,0.0,0.025122190082722182,0.0,0.0,0.05735791690429636,0.0,0.06822240199002177,0.026884596518026847,0.0,0.02527314992287312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0287249029417024,0.027485535824668283,0.0,0.0,0.022617153705546383,0.028151705751951733,0.0,0.041952588834022086,0.041483001635728184,0.057407325967779435,0.026943139235500856,0.0,0.0,0.01797292835818087,0.1989023884009798,0.0,0.022468866680241936,0.0675554724806463,0.0854713368328727,0.0,0.0,0.02163287726453152,0.0,0.024077173061216376,0.08492543488930818,0.025797770723239525,0.15338071295873665,0.027717638706772917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02699368321061837,0.025692728743534447,0.20861045725164476,0.040620754055085716,0.0,0.037410780548758106,0.018867535982038653,0.15700127380214074,0.17202814095514274,0.02706160682508699,0.023878903527568003,0.024931214035692168,0.04883133919042911,0.1158796053676306,0.026700800373014998,0.02709865599047024,0.034485095500007515,0.03870494007371823,0.0,0.0,0.028254246654036683,0.0,0.04858126982217036,0.0529221739599139,0.04443610570101962,0.0265851600947284,0.027931547691052782,0.024054247902726703,0.08605802589131417,0.048739562482823656,0.0,0.027434582009299484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028504813919795282,0.0,0.025452413097216457,0.0,0.048903168837080666,0.0,0.025124388315213277,0.027318973464514708,0.0,0.0,0.09681809324658333,0.08094121807672593,0.17832788198028773,0.0,0.10138395357955933,0.04632930454807089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894392272426804,0.0,0.0,0.025938510525325045,0.06467973780757992,0.15671367980967787,0.10066510807077704,0.02848418441774805,0.07204190041085959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058258081655389864,0.0,0.0,0.04796421645622343,0.10579058261761287,0.03826373940312629,0.12271290530868445,0.04448102461799458,0.04685364541888059,0.0,0.059088436530778124,0.30428779672774914,0.08152233184572688,0.05000020251321166,0.2222099691341819,0.10386244066760644,0.0,0.024119384495627,0.048628583321915865,0.0,0.017275842664359768,0.02767742670062413,0.0,0.10595876470049796,0.0,0.04395353121798354,0.08407395980270561,0.06298567437461985,0.09005058719634843,0.020197475080658632,0.040821734100397376,0.0,0.0,0.023588258620153485,0.02296063047793745,0.0,0.0,0.024528580172089625,0.027594588789056795,0.037049293678060535,0.025841168002700327,0.02593116606473835,0.10845463462873682,0.02782068946138426,0.0,0.0491582557112567
schizophrenia,bearyweek,2018/02/16,"Overcoming Paranoia Hello guys. FTP, but just thought I’d share &amp; ask for advice from people who might know best. 

I am finally in a relationship with someone I absolutely adore. I got out of another relationship two years ago that was very abusive and controlled, which has left me scarred and very paranoid with people (which is heightened by my schizophrenia). 

One thing about this new relationship is I’m constantly catching myself thinking the worst. I’m constantly telling myself he’s gonna lose interest or he’s bored of me or something. I can not physically comprehend why I’m deluded by these thoughts - he is in every way so in love with me. Sometimes, when we have cheesy couple fights about who loves who more, I believe him when he says he does. He’s so amazing.

How do I get this paranoia and these deluded thoughts out of my head? I know he’s amazing. I truly do. I know he cares, but I’m super scared me telling him about it all the time is gonna drive him away. 

I just want to love him without fear.

I would like to ask my doctor to start on this medication, but it would not be for schizophrenia, so if your symptoms improved that is AMAZING and I’m so happy for you, but I’m more interested in side effects!

schizophrenia,rainingren,2018/02/16,"Wanting to get better but can't find help The last few years have been difficult for me. I've been struggling with a lot and have seen a number of counselors, therapists and psychiatrists. A few of them told me they weren't qualified to help me because of my case was too difficult and the others just kept upping my medication and never really listened to me. I'm so tired of the mental health system, even with pretty good insurance, the quality of care I've found just doesn't come close to what it should be. I don't know if its the area I live in (east coast, USA) or just my luck I guess. I'm stable for the most part but I just don't want to fall down that dark hole again. I've been pretty lonely and I'm trying to reach out to something. I suppose I'm just curious if anyone as any advice or dealt with a similar situation? Maybe I'm not looking in the right places? Are there any good online resources? I don't know where to look at this point. Please give me a helping hand reddit. &lt;3",2.80970588235294,4.503600558823533,3.9556862745098056,88.07558823529413,75.27450980392156,7.152941176470589,22.294117647058826,7.928766900206844,0.9439000000000002,790,21,166,12,17,257,126,204,0.113,0.688,0.199,0.9629,0,2,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,2,1,11,9,0,1,12,0,15,4,1,0,1,36,36,13,0,5,12,0,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,0,6,11,0,1,4,0,0,2,8,4,0,0,9,5,16,5,25,25,5,20,0,1,3,0,8,13,0,8,4,103,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14198241776187406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976137053012219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10159494839387392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08857162210797576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12850327228056338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14813984040771422,0.0,0.0,0.12516038627843076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09596721095620647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13279870503523475,0.0,0.0,0.15931051617109326,0.0,0.0,0.07591161659888326,0.1393819953355215,0.0,0.24373623855318144,0.0,0.0,0.1600608809650454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15444377624722588,0.0,0.0,0.2921682835890721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15970271757227913,0.11843633989713087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12829979636538616,0.0,0.24402555026012596,0.0,0.0,0.12352620126930673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14597023308618254,0.0,0.0,0.14637130845785612,0.14642506870955466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11206190183389347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15734234891774196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15180430214997015,0.15949232918291345,0.13735250431461113,0.0,0.0,0.2956382997522518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930808941502576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408273134410082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16331976728040018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185662751368627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15189583371773627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687008624496909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16699737568037218,0.0,0.13883738389051312,0.0,0.09864703580385224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17139971446259802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09356641921742448
schizophrenia,bittercynic,2018/02/17,"Having trouble taking my medications? Hey. Sorry if this is the wrong place.

I’ve been taking an anti-psychotic and antidepressant for a while now, (Seroquel for 3 years, Zoloft for 7) and recently, in the past month, it’s been getting harder and harder to take my meds. Physically harder.  I feel anxious and nauseous when it’s time to take them and because the Seroquel puts me out, I spend about an hour having a panic attack while slowly passing out. My skin burns and I can’t stop crying. If I don’t take my meds, I get weird and I can’t sleep and I spend hours laying in bed, panicking and crying. Because I don’t want to get worse again but I retch every time I think of taking my meds.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if this is some symptom. I’ve been having worse and worse panic attacks during the day. When night falls, I can feel my skin crawling, even if I’m at work. This has been happening for about a month. 

I tried to contact my doctor but she doesn’t have an appointment for three months. I told them it was an emergency and they told me to contact a psychiatrist instead. I don’t have a psychiatrist because no one in my county (or the next few counties over) will take my case anymore. If I go back to my therapist, she’ll put me back in the psyche ward again and then I’ll lose my job. I can’t lose my job. She thinks I belong in psyche, says it’s the only place they’ll be able to help. I can’t go back. They just lock you in a room 24/7 until a bored doctor comes, gives you an once-over and shows you the door. Plus, if I go back again, I won’t leave for months. I’ve already used my three strikes.

And she’s the only therapist who will take my case. All the others told me they didn’t have the experience or expertise to deal with someone like me. Or they’ll take my case, have two or three meetings with me and then suddenly, ‘sorry but we have too many patients to deal with right now so we have to drop you’. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Should I just force myself to eat the meds until I can get to my doctor?

schizophrenia,UnassumingMoose,2018/02/17,"Med change woes Vent incoming: I've been tapering off Abilify (30 mg) all week. Switching over to Latuda since Abilify hasn't really been doing enough about my positive symptoms even on the maximum dose. One more week of the taper to go and I'm already feeling like crap. I haven't been able to sleep properly since I started reducing the Abilify and I've been having these weird twitches of my head. 

I'm also a bit worried about my symptoms getting worse during this interim period. I already had some visual hallucinations after a sleepless night and today I had a conversation with someone over the phone - except that in reality that didn't happen? Ugh, at least I'm halfway through already. 

Thanks for reading my rambling. Also if anyone has some Latuda experiences I'd gladly hear about those.

schizophrenia,estrelle84,2018/02/17,"I wrote a poem “Our Greatest Fear”

Beautiful baby boy
Giggling, so sweet
Holding parents’ hopes and dreams 
While he plays with his tiny feet

Ten years pass
He grows tall
He loves video games
And his parents, most of all

Another ten years
He’s twenty now
He tells his parents 
“It’s so funny how”...

...”it seems as if the songs on the radio 
were chosen just for me.
And I hear the neighbors talking.
Why won’t they let me be?”

He’s confused and frustrated 
He doesn’t understand
It’s his dopamine receptors 
That have gotten out of hand

His brain makes him see patterns 
From street signs to a church steeple
And fills in the blanks
With ideas of powerful, malevolent, people 

“They’re torturing me”, he screams at his parents
His pain is real 
Even if it’s hard for them to understand
And they don’t know how to feel 

He goes through many
Trials and tribulations
And finds many 
Meaningless revelations 

Like a dreaming man
In deepest slumber 
It all seems so completely real
And his sanity is torn asunder 

Others laugh nervously and exchange glances 
When they meet him out and about 
But still he tells friends “don’t stick your dick in crazy”
When a girlfriend’s odd behavior stands out 

The news blames “madmen” 
For every evil act
Never stopping to think 
Whether it’s in line with the facts

A moment’s research would show 
Someone like him is eleven times more likely to be victim than perpetrator
And if he encounters the police 
He’s in even more danger 

This could happen to a loved one
Or even to you
This illness can strike
Out of the blue 

A person can lose their mind 
In youth or old age
So let’s exercise some compassion 
For those trapped in their mind’s cage",2.9632473557246257,5.6581064353312325,3.010214325477828,90.08707506030805,79.2839116719243,6.253071070699574,24.46548524772685,7.5105763829236425,1.2484997958804973,1328,48,254,20,34,402,194,317,0.165,0.685,0.151,-0.3053,5,1,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,2,6,2,15,22,5,3,15,0,17,9,4,3,4,58,33,29,0,6,8,4,3,3,3,2,3,3,1,3,11,19,0,2,9,9,1,4,5,11,0,4,3,10,25,11,36,23,7,34,1,1,3,3,51,15,1,11,17,150,36,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145632916981449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12196460429254928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455168692617053,0.0,0.0,0.08723114973488079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164854986791712,0.0,0.09205196773583188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294214032305352,0.0552425615991112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985700184139014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844100668861628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09661374972777026,0.0,0.09787093306049133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12313821586209665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851477036415078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333548671075177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06004363731731738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22344108072194335,0.0,0.16012928049195665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12222828991339095,0.0,0.0,0.19721363074963846,0.0,0.07292849599842245,0.2215346464119025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22063261351603647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426411639185605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464464183763945,0.0,0.07403394967760528,0.0,0.1162549196245055,0.0,0.48525856046143606,0.0,0.0,0.0757435931275853,0.09539716696847536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24871199666133426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706201225308054,0.19892312036715004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09257132459840094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08725110650782522,0.09134199085300716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781495236991979,0.1909872013070815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700061301957684,0.0,0.0,0.06370741242838135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274764137955244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09858555626556643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07761154827409637,0.0,0.0,0.14071315068332396

schizophrenia,finmeister,2018/02/18,"If you live in CA and take Clozaril, who does your labs? Hi all, hope this is ok. 

I do not have schizophrenia but a good friend does. He lives in my old home state (MN) and takes Clozaril. His blood draws are done by a mobile lab who visits his house.

I live in CA and actually am in the lab profession. Nowhere I've worked has ever done Clozaril draws nor do they seem to know where people taking Clozaril would get them done. Google hasn't been helpful. 

My friend maybe coming out here and staying with me a while because of reasons but nobody can seem to help him figure out where to get his labs so he can continue his meds. Hos doctor has told him places like LabCorp and Quest do it but I actually worked for LabCorp and we didn't, an old co-worker who worked at Quest for 8 years said they didn't either.

I would much appreciate anyone with firsthand knowledge letting us know how you get them done. If you aren't comfortable replying here feel free to DM me.

schizophrenia,grey_unknown,2018/02/18,"Question from a 31yo dude with bipolar disorder that keeps worsening. Hey all, I have bipolar, your “cousin” disorder. Haha, sorry for the lame joke. 

Anyways, I’m lost, and strongly rethinking all my treatment options, and could really use some outside advice. 

Basically, bipolar runs in my family, on my father’s side. My aunt has it the worst, and it’s bipolar with schizoaffective symptoms. 

Now I’m starting to present with schizoaffective problems, too. Needless to say, her life was, and still is, a wreck ... and it’s unnerving since I’m slowly following in her steps.

I’ve had bipolar type2 my whole adult life. Then, around 28yo, it began changing ... and became bipolar type1 by 30yo.

Now, at 31yo ... I’ve been experiencing my first true visual and auditory hallucinations for months.

Doctors always blame the worsening disorder on brain damage from dysphoric mania “burning up” my brain cells. No one mentioned meds can change my brain as well. And no one talks about Kindling theory - that my disorder can simply be worsening, no matter what I do. 

Luckily, the changes have made me less prone to severe depression. But, I’m now more prone to anxiety, anger and dysphoric mania.

Now, I’m starting to deal with schizoaffective problems, for the first time. Thankfully, it’s only once or twice a week. Very random and uncommon. And, it’s mostly neutral feelings with the hallucinations - no strong dread or fear with it. Just mostly an annoyance at not being able to control and stop my brain from acting stupid. 

Ex: I randomly see cameras floating around my bed. No movement. No action. Just a camera by itself, without someone standing behind it.

But, a month ago, it escalated. I clearly heard someone open the bathroom door while I was showering, walk by the shower curtains, making them rustle, and then somehow reached into the wall, and shook the pipe to the shower head, making sounds of metal bending, and then causing the water to shoot out in weird sprays.

Only lasted ~6 seconds, but it happened during the day, with the lights on ... and was weirdly and very unnervingly ... a very visual experience. I hope you understand what I’m saying, because I’m horrible at describing my disorder.

When I bring it up to my doctor, she just wants to increase my lithium AND put me on more antipsychotics.

And that’s a big problem for me, because the constant sleepiness and anhedonia is making my life garbage, not to mention akathisia and other shitty side effects.

My life has been an uncaring gray fog of anhedonia for years. I’ve lost all personal drive and motivation.

With bipolar disorder, the doctors and their meds only care about one thing - quantity of life. They don’t really care about quality.

In fact, my doctor doesn’t really give a shit that my life is bland garbage, as long as I don’t commit suicide.

Is this the same way doctors work with schizophrenic patients? Do you also suffer from constant anhedonia and muscle twitches?

If so, what do you do? Do you just keep taking strong meds? Are the meds pretty good at stopping your disorder?

I know my hallucinations are nothing compared to what you experience with schizophrenia. And I know my bipolar mood changes are a diving force for a lot of the hallucinations I’m now starting to see.

But, I’m lost. I want to live for a purpose, and not just live for the sake of living.

Anyways, thanks for reading. I really appreciate any advice, experiences or info you wouldn’t mind sharing.

schizophrenia,somedude91,2018/02/18,"What's the trippiest thing you've ever dreamed on antipsychotics? I don't know about other people's opinions on this, but I think antipsychotics, when you first start them and they make you start falling asleep and dreaming, are easily far trippier and scarier than any drug I've ever tried. They make me have nightmares that make less sense than anything ever.

When I first took them I dreamed about a lady telling her child in her car something about the album ""OK Computer"" by Radiohead, [which I heard only once way years before]. She called it a ""jogidat feat"" (??) and when she said that, for some reason it was super scary and aggressive.

Then a few weeks ago I had a worse one about the Youtuber 'AmazingAtheist' [again, a marginal influence in my life]. He was being murdered in the most horrible way by a demonic computer program, draining all the nutrients and health and minerals from his body, turning his skin grey and tearing his organs out. And it randomly described this method of killing as making him ""everco-creased"". Whatever that means?!

Anyways post trippy shit they made you dream. Easily freakier than anything illegal I've tried.",7.1199789915966365,8.71449428921569,6.2889355742296935,75.92735294117648,64.44117647058823,9.946218487394958,34.669467787114854,10.125756701596842,3.755558543417367,921,41,150,21,14,280,137,204,0.187,0.73,0.083,-0.9824,0,0,3,0,0,0,35.0,0,3,5,3,12,6,4,0,11,1,7,7,4,7,4,29,21,15,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,12,10,0,0,4,4,0,3,1,4,0,3,7,4,24,2,19,13,5,28,1,0,1,0,22,7,1,4,15,100,36,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246133001351386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955973889232062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23136629033615536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962093370095893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15614969647613813,0.0,0.0,0.14354514727440013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16302504503181034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3814806654045761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2391499699446401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14942710296504316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15552796122199838,0.0,0.07725761115899549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09929390884398236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13301764629095664,0.3753457743727647,0.0,0.0,0.15312989827103005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14971024332200314,0.09525882095599554,0.1069153761396444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09745860389354563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346342003322521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14453688405110618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337212102236335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14430058482408656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082232784185132,0.0,0.0,0.19900268197216506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287076195058973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09339331585720596,0.09007626164997176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15618655987123545,0.19088552655773716,0.15290774152542916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2231674449005047,0.11276263566624498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143260285031866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052717628512154

schizophrenia,Yavaritos,2018/02/18,"I have some questions. 1) Have you ever taken any psychedelics and if yes, then how was it?

2) If you hear voices, then are the voices inside your head or do you literally hear something outside of you?

3) I personally feel like there is some stigma to the word schizophrenia, but from reading your guys' posts you that much out of the ordinary. My question is, how did you first realize you had schizophrenia, and how does it affect you on a daily basis?

schizophrenia,WoWDisciplinePriest,2018/02/19,"How Do You Stay Safe During Delusions &amp; Dissasociations Sometimes I get confused  and am not sure what is going on or where I am. I have trouble interacting with others.

Other times I disassociate and come to in a completely different location. 

Most often my issues are with hallucinations and delusions. I constantly get the idea that if I jump off a high place it will fix whatever is wrong with me. Normally this makes zero sense, but sometimes it just seems as obvious as 2+2=4. Or I'll think that all the cars will stop for me or I should put a real coyote in my car. I'll start acting on these before I realize that no this is not the simple obvious answer it is not what other people think and it is not okay. 

When I'm starting to feel ""fuzzy brained"" I try to remember to repeat my name, my location, and why I am there until it seems like solid facts and not just a random thing to say. 

I've considered getting a psychiatric service dog to help with grounding me, keeping me from going near the edge of tall places such as balconies, and stopping and sitting until I give a conscious command when crossing a road. Problem with this is a dog is a long term commitment and what if I become unable to care for one.

I've tried an aromatherapy necklace that I just got a few days ago, but I'm not sure I've found the right scent yet. 

I'm currently on anti-psychotics. I was on risperdol, but my weight ballooned. Now I'm on Geodon (and slowly losing weight again thanks to my previous/current diet and exercise regimen). 

Medication has lessened the symptoms. I'm only having delusions that might be dangerous to myself maybe once a week (although I typically have a harmless or more harmless one once or twice a day). I've been told to accept that these symptoms are now a part of my life, but what happens when I jump off a bridge before I realize why that's a bad idea? 

Anyone have any ideas to help me keep myself safe?",5.9054930227194085,6.287854599469501,6.671574212893553,76.42541229385309,66.6657824933687,9.421243224541575,32.04117172183139,9.318704503766252,2.8092069888132865,1532,59,285,27,23,507,206,377,0.093,0.805,0.102,0.7606,3,0,0,0,0,1,39.0,0,1,0,1,15,18,1,1,23,1,25,9,1,2,7,77,53,32,0,5,20,0,3,1,0,4,5,1,0,0,25,17,3,6,15,1,0,10,7,7,0,4,5,5,32,11,36,43,6,53,0,1,0,0,8,18,0,14,24,195,57,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08601187290412783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051327373972173,0.0,0.06598421241642967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06784613086465048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08101659268821093,0.0,0.10716279960100517,0.16513198085601016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10831836610431517,0.0,0.0,0.09892927903860486,0.0,0.0,0.08358336788159296,0.10173485688170128,0.10485573036035373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12515356594581867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137644353688018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04906164412651854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10638916894130493,0.0,0.0,0.15208362882220527,0.09308070179875316,0.1102895809634938,0.0,0.07760432540621696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580393938409718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13007528370429475,0.10251827603107004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3286075943265753,0.0,0.10127485538734936,0.0,0.1724907126701798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06853566239222339,0.04740430534185706,0.0,0.0,0.08586912795382545,0.0,0.1085525487655917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476875463020527,0.0,0.09748039339430233,0.0,0.0,0.0977482355713332,0.0,0.10293425324891356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09506949753130843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20666908599794245,0.1315010451080057,0.07379622988916429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050748070055451,0.0,0.0672688793444581,0.0,0.20275288707376035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09284528841086004,0.0,0.09754266699955126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1104421945414509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10991688324089782,0.08286369905103236,0.0,0.07716271779936164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17666623446633853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919317131833756,0.0,0.1373576766750267,0.10342183010503056,0.0,0.16224404224984562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829005980794982,0.20170412717572267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08933284438347254,0.0,0.0,0.06446289444941783,0.12434672639781325,0.0,0.0,0.056579389266280485,0.0,0.0,0.09271700478475227,0.0,0.13175497022963376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07783218546287918,0.2363145373161771,0.0,0.0,0.17511025330852542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10608785293334952,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,psych_throwawayyy,2018/02/19,"I'm scared I have schizophrenia. Are these symptoms or are they just normal things? I'm sorry for the long life story, and if this is against the rules of the subreddit please delete this post. I know you guys are going to tell me that only a doctor can diagnose, but I want to see if any of this sounds familiar or if it's all nothing to worry about.

I'm a 25 year old female and I've been treated for depression for about 6 years now, and I've had ups and downs through that. Lately I've just been feeling really weird. I am scared I have schizophrenia and here's why:

-Genetics: I have three uncles with schizophrenia, but no one in my immediate family.

-Social isolation: I've always been an introvert and like having time to myself, but it's gotten way worse lately. If I'm around someone who's not my SO or a close coworker, it's physically uncomfortable and I can't wait to leave. It's really tiring. My mom was visiting recently and it ended up being ok but I was dreading it leading up to it, even though I love my mom and have no reason to not want to be around her.

-Intrusive thoughts: I don't think I hear voices but it seems like sometimes my own thoughts will be repetitive almost like a mantra, and it's stuff I don't even agree with. It's usually along the lines of ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I wish I was fucking dead"" over and over again. I don't even want to kill myself but these thoughts start repeating in my head very often, and especially when i'm uncomfortable socially. Sometimes I'll even mutter these ""mantras"" under my breath, which I'm not sure if other people ever notice. I've had this before but it's gotten way worse and more frequent lately.

-Visual perception: I also don't really think I have hallucinations but it's like sometimes my eyes play tricks on me, like I'll see something out of the corner of my eye and when I turn my head nothing is there. I am scared of driving at night because a lot of the stuff along the side of the road like signs and mailboxes look like people when the light of the headlights catches them just right and I am afraid they'll jump out in the road. I see as I pass them that they're not people but it still makes me scared.

-Paranoia: I think mostly I perceive things as they actually happen but it feels like things are targeted at me sometimes. Like I work in a science research building and there was this one woman who my coworkers and I don't know and she was frequently weirdly hanging around our area (my coworkers thought it was weird too) so we found out her name and looked her up and she does research on psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia) and sometimes I get paranoid that she's secretly observing and researching me.

_________________________________________________________________

I've been thinking and reading about it so much and worrying and it's all really exhausting. I know it's a low chance that I would have it and it's probably my anxiety making me worry but I can't forget about it.

I'm currently seeing a doctor for meds but not for therapy. I of course know that I need to bring these things up to him, but I'm afraid. Either I really do have it and this will start a whole new scary phase of my life, or I don't have it and I'm just a big hypochondriac baby wasting everyone's time. I'm especially afraid to tell him about the suicidal thoughts because he might lock me up. In college one time I was honest with my doctor that I wanted to cut myself again and she made me stay at the hospital overnight.

Does all of this sound like nothing to worry about? Any tips for talking to my doctor? My next appointment is in a month. Should I try to see him sooner?",2.5619746376811605,4.801487736111113,3.7212318840579712,86.96869565217392,77.8888888888889,7.118357487922705,23.907004830917874,8.135877884289325,1.4435845410628017,2870,97,572,53,69,930,296,720,0.154,0.746,0.1,-0.9939,1,1,1,0,0,3,66.0,2,1,5,2,35,35,5,8,25,1,51,17,5,5,5,125,108,63,4,15,33,2,2,10,0,6,10,4,1,2,51,43,0,1,21,2,0,9,15,19,0,4,22,16,85,16,77,77,10,81,0,2,9,2,35,36,1,16,42,388,136,11,0.0,0.0,0.05424665824879808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055664161859123165,0.0,0.0,0.04445435002035869,0.046254341743032217,0.0,0.0,0.0756045919121029,0.0,0.04252528629814984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14845747505202966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777284332844391,0.0,0.047301981667463286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04787855924844912,0.056421470424488265,0.0,0.0,0.0637095904529714,0.2275900037235768,0.09729228173255178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049235184639340936,0.0,0.0,0.14686353479839978,0.05028325974718671,0.0,0.05311748866398746,0.0,0.0,0.05240418131357817,0.0,0.056214743601284006,0.03971265585185789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060950259214371916,0.0,0.051390957650381784,0.029042858062897213,0.0,0.03159240087718911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0550416600088948,0.0491569997126329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141003096481996,0.0,0.06265262717577072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12300156072836163,0.0,0.1222006213678473,0.0,0.18811979157219794,0.05886052174047041,0.0,0.0,0.07852803870550584,0.27157883901296914,0.0,0.0,0.04919434618560839,0.0933611973694878,0.0,0.0,0.04725961705531805,0.05017106994296041,0.0525994746206659,0.07421192256668534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06174663456948951,0.0,0.0,0.05897094112108715,0.0,0.13020988117684246,0.04437045654322448,0.0,0.04086417032868831,0.04121839708999482,0.0,0.05368801758058952,0.059119328410006076,0.05216633102541602,0.0544652296429741,0.1600168827903717,0.06328822684135678,0.05833110340657726,0.0,0.113005245732049,0.04227779374110387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561484145158715,0.0,0.0,0.06101981865379452,0.0,0.0,0.05323871231310006,0.0,0.05993413746945187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05560385155424498,0.0,0.17805807057554215,0.057154553372315675,0.05488724204398155,0.0,0.0,0.04747253866987654,0.0,0.0,0.2226163791507453,0.0,0.22148541606991265,0.050605963427964085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333157946789148,0.047100216992961366,0.04279498055534948,0.27489376471300364,0.062227119918205814,0.07869208944611272,0.05925027346349555,0.04439329422175665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12727177230027145,0.06080513399723611,0.0,0.05239179408177984,0.0577780565367115,0.0,0.04468017855197932,0.09717413749308412,0.0,0.06357064705607439,0.0,0.1477229370432761,0.14247625546518985,0.05461572204583734,0.22065652282907908,0.09724284369228994,0.0638911578499136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03774115198093366,0.060464660847159776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06122321896148561,0.0458665886883811,0.16393859735136948,0.08824761737646991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05016025332492855,0.06206291942488833,0.06392438630684673,0.0,0.0,0.0404693145988936,0.2258125332356159,0.11329948975642493,0.039488694590125585,0.0,0.0,0.07159474016062975
schizophrenia,Neeraj1993,2018/02/19,"Have you guys observed different levels of isolation on different medications? My clinical diagnosis is of bipolar disorder. My mother is schizophrenic though. I sometimes relate to schizophrenia, so I sometimes come to this sub.


So my question is, do you guys observe different levels of isolation on different medications? 

I have tried three antipsychotics by now. Amisulpride, aripiprazole and quetiapine. I think I isolated least on Amisulpride. I am isolating a lot on quetiapine. It is getting very bad. 

I don't remember how it was on aripiprazole.",6.251704119850189,10.137680752808992,6.924971910112357,58.62393726591762,78.5505617977528,11.955430711610491,41.12453183520599,10.504223727775694,7.06450486891386,453,30,55,20,12,148,55,89,0.163,0.8370000000000001,0.0,-0.9267,4,2,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,0,0,5,1,0,0,1,0,10,5,0,1,0,7,13,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,3,2,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,12,0,11,12,2,9,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,2,1,46,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13515816454015553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394402580275949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6764961883195689,0.18552181481273328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845725690099145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3205617421977745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13761962462981872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32614237820896635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18133610909986414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833718710929708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201953724559368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372242739943646,0.15904054317742009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990193091563707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335631372331444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,AmberNomad,2018/02/19,"How do you deal with upsetting voices? Disclaimer: I don't hear voices but phrases. But they are usually related to stuff that really upsets me - sex, racism, etc. I used to be able to treat it as background noise but now the material is so upsetting that I can't. I feel like my own brain is bullying me. What are some techniques you guys use to cope with this kind of thing? For example, should I be talking back to the phrases or labelling them or something?

schizophrenia,Dreamwave11,2018/02/19,"Things you/your family noticed early on? Hello all! Just wondering, what kind of early signs did you show early on (assuming you had insight and knew at that stage)? How did the delusions start and did you ever doubt them in the beginning? For those in college, how did it all progress? Did your family notice much early on?

Ive read prodromal symptoms but its always better to hear peoples personal accounts :)

schizophrenia,thefishyswa,2018/02/19,So lonely I dunno why I feel alone. I've been back and forth all day. My voices I haven't heard in years thanks to meds. I feel like I have a lot of friends. I consider myself blessed to have life even if it is the worst thing that's happened to me. I'm so conflicted. I reach out then I turn back from wanting to reach out.

schizophrenia,inconvenient_penguin,2018/02/20,"Need Advice on how to help brother on the other side of the country. My brother has been experiencing paranoid delusions that have recently become severe. Over the last few years he has had episodes where he is convinced that 'they' are after him. Typically these haven't  involved any visual symptoms except for 2 events, one a few years back and one over this past weekend. I want to preface this and mention he is also dealing with cocaine addiction and it was assumed these events were a result of that. He is not otherwise diagnosed with any type of psychosis. Over this past weekend he had a severe break in which he believed 'they' swapped his car with another car. That 'they' were getting into his walls and is accumulated into  him chasing what I am assuming was an imaginary person down the street. This is the most severe it has ever been. We currently live several thousand miles apart and we are the only family each other has. He does have some friends in the area but none equipped to deal with him when he gets in this state. He often turns on them and thinks they are there to hurt him if they do. Usually he is ok with me but over the weekend I had to keep proving my identity by answering questions from our past or showing myself on video chat. I was able to keep him calm, we usually talk about what he is experiencing and while I don't validate or reinforce his psychosis I try not to invalidate it either. Sometimes we do logic exercises that never pan out, but it seems to keep him calm.  What I have been unsuccessful with is trying to talk him into treatment. I considered calling an ambulance but didn't know if this would cause more issues and I certainly didn't want to surprise him with it.  I'm worried that one of these episodes is going to cause harm to himself or someone else and irreparably damage his life. He is otherwise successful, makes a great living and has a ton of disposable income, which of course lends to the cocaine use.  I'm hopeful that the psychosis is only drug related but it may even be self medication for other underlying issues or maybe even paranoia itself. Any advice on how to get him help would be appreciated. Any advice from someone dealing with a similar situation would also be great. Thanks for taking the time to read this. 


Edit....

I managed to get in touch with him this morning and he is still suffering symptoms. It's now been 3 days since this started.

schizophrenia,zweiundsiebzig,2018/02/20,"What do the voices want from me? I think the voices serve a purpose in my life, I think somewhere in my life I strayed from the right path
and the voices want me to find it again. When I have done that I won't need them any longer and I don't any longer have
to take medication. Also I'm pretty scared my medication will further psychotify me and chronificate my condition.

Below are some of the things they say to me and what I think they want me to do.
I need your insight to see if I'm beeing correct with my assumptions.

When I started hearing them they told me to follow them. I would hear cows and birds telling me to follow them too.
When I followed them I sometimes found interesting places, like a tombstone in a forest no one living near the forest seemed
to know about. For a few weeks I lit grave candles for the deceased.
In hindsight I think the voices want me to lead a more adventurous life, they want me to follow them on a journey.

Then they began to call me by the name Erebos, who is the god of the dead in Magic the Gathering lore or the god
of darkness in greek mythology. This was around the time I was visiting my dying grandfather in hospital.
I think they wanted to say that I feel responsible for my grandfathers death and that I should abandon those feelings.

Sometimes they said stuff like ""This is not a normal human being"" or ""We have to behead him"", although I'm not
sure if the people walking past me were saying this.
Not quite sure what this means. Do you have any ideas?


I appreciate any insight. I realise I probably should also discuss this with my therapist.",4.419051003344479,5.820171554487184,4.97992196209588,83.52015050167228,70.63461538461539,7.733779264214048,27.34726867335563,8.18289091462,1.7291940914158306,1263,43,245,18,23,404,157,312,0.08,0.825,0.096,-0.2001,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,1,2,13,2,9,9,0,1,22,0,21,5,0,1,3,51,55,17,4,14,7,0,2,2,0,5,5,10,0,1,16,10,0,1,15,0,0,8,6,3,0,1,8,14,57,6,36,41,3,32,0,2,2,0,32,14,0,6,12,179,73,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16682758718322654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837277261481113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09285481379925603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10650850063613676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082535794915832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10674166569899013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10548090383540676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953341635835111,0.0,0.0,0.1143665881771883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23512179612652775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11774923389359275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05732407178867946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2210240935499712,0.10191768054601286,0.0,0.09210446571134566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362025242298265,0.0,0.21015545687364087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15468375380440394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219812957063233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07068071881938644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09957226513085396,0.07231292713051478,0.0,0.1089779916905529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10611711169417744,0.11245994530746027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11094269997996503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08907709909301269,0.09921927612741284,0.24884591703298856,0.1044289068003944,0.0,0.08311869939003648,0.09495663272439556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063234013219476,0.0,0.07382860961126086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11940587748816205,0.0,0.0,0.19661510270335644,0.0,0.07842543471367386,0.0,0.0911683945843211,0.0,0.0,0.12110777445601625,0.06929654001032277,0.33417665986671136,0.0,0.0,0.06082190298058888,0.0,0.0,0.09966923897196953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3691357173793738,0.0,0.0836683056211724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0740962767026059,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,DefiningWillow,2018/02/20,"Im 15 and I think I have schizophrenia Hi, I recently (withen the last couple of weeks) have been doing and seeing/hearing strange things, but all the research I have done could be fake (you know how the internet can be) and I wanted to ask your thoughts on if I have schizophrenia. 

The first thing is that I am constantly followed around by a mask who taunts me, and if I take the mask off of the creature its me. I sometimes see goblins to, but that is all I see. I sometimes hear people screaming and my name being called. There was one time I was in the shower and I heard my grandparents screaming and burst downstairs in my sweat pants and everyone was OK and I looked like a fool. I also feel bugs under my skin and yellow jackets crawl in and out of me. I have a huge fear of bees, yellow jackets, and wasps so this the worst part for me. 

I also feel like I am disconnected from everything. It feels like everything is here, and I am some where else. I haven't been talking much at all at home. It doesn't help that I'm home schooled as well. I don't feel sad or mad or anything, just feel empty. I want to scream and cry and yell, but I cant.

I also studder a lot now for some reason and shake to. My body will move on its own as well. I feel cold all the time, no matter how hot it really is.

All the research I have done says I am to young to be a schizophrenic, but I wanted to hear some who has it or is an expert. I am afraid to tell my family what is happening because my family are one of those who think they know everything without putting a dime of effort into figuring it out kind. Plus if they had a member of the family who was skizo, then they would abandon me (they are not my biologic family, the only person I talk to regularly thats my blood is my mom, and she is against psychiatric help).",3.2780649633590784,4.262011647058826,4.420243612596553,88.04328480887307,72.90374331550801,7.679778173895823,24.81441869677164,8.045849151850463,1.2046927312339069,1412,41,308,20,27,463,191,374,0.135,0.7809999999999999,0.084,-0.9716,3,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,2,4,2,14,19,1,3,20,1,44,5,4,3,5,67,69,37,0,8,13,1,8,3,0,2,1,8,3,1,20,22,0,1,13,0,1,4,7,12,2,3,11,22,52,7,38,51,13,29,0,2,5,0,26,15,0,10,13,233,72,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22045183341693186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561717191771268,0.0818010749471214,0.08590421347331224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0560149440223195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10206844243540716,0.0,0.0,0.09382938252267496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09929983018765656,0.0,0.07336623324327575,0.10167390722198426,0.10093622474663394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18806958171712204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07676182829323007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08780428879750718,0.2477528855439704,0.0,0.34650070897451435,0.10340115623584367,0.27877234255568595,0.13129165519817265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07816110274813756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125752003244245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106981999053127,0.0,0.12318309680413488,0.0,0.18434518224677449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925635338078044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09568870166968683,0.10100005591088712,0.07490215027854605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346776028672835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07716397878077128,0.0,0.0,0.0781211079204895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761979056901358,0.0,0.09766392257285753,0.06754930444298836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453331261771088,0.06988605268686393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950729880754812,0.0,0.06370456123725877,0.08023430648144088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09237425780946032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05886672222190925,0.09447763884586136,0.09072972711896754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307416340491958,0.0,0.09299700953536603,0.14644795848734132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18176199299014556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06908941604948014,0.1477144872536854,0.08031541255710901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209450928878016,0.11775807362420047,0.0,0.07294994376747994,0.10716293190567057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16259630086755664,0.0,0.07370815856259914,0.0,0.16523926721823784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885781320408046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06527561507964677,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,InnerNeedleworker,2018/02/20,"I cannot accept that this is real I believe I may be the only conscious person alive. I believe that when I die, I will be revealed as God, or perhaps I will simply wake up from this simulation/dream. I just can't accept that the current universe I'm living in is real. 

When I walk down the street and see people going about their business, I cannot accept the idea that they are conscious, living lives as complex as my own. I just don't believe it. The idea that anyone who replies to this post actually sat there, saw the post as clearly as I'm seeing it right now, and thought up a reply in their head, is absurd to me. The concept that everyone but me is a puppet is implicitly tied to my worldview.

I feel like I'm recognizing signs all over the place meant for me. Watched Stranger Things and noticed messages that I am God. Read a news article today and noticed messages thay I am God. Everywhere I go I feel like the world is screaming at me, telling me this is all a dream I need to wake up from.

But then there's my psychiatrist who thinks I'm in a state of psychosis. And there's all these posts on here where people discuss similar worldviews. And I feel like...What the fuck man...What if I'm wrong about all this, and you people, are actually seeing this post, just as clearly as I'm seeing it right now? What if that man at the zoo today really saw me with his own eyes? What if I am just yet another lunatic? 

But I don't know what to think anymore. When I cut my own throat I will finally know the truth.

schizophrenia,BlueInkSz,2018/02/21,"Can I handle this? I ask this question of myself sometimes. I'm sure many people here can relate. Because of schizophrenia and other assorted life events things can be hard to deal with.

I've come to a realization: The bullshit will never stop. Even when one problem is successfully dealt with, there will be new ones. Sometimes you'll find people to help, sometimes you won't. But the thing is, I'm not as worried about things as I used to be. Which is funny, because a lot of my problems and challenges keep getting bigger. Some due to my own choices, others not. And there are so many freaking big unknowns that sometimes I wonder why it's worth wondering about all the time.

But that's life. I didn't choose everything that happens to me, but I've gotta deal with it one way or the other. The question is: How? I've crashed and burned several times, sometimes very dramatically, and maybe it'll happen again. But I'm not the same person I used to be. Some people say people never change. But even the people who say that aren't the same person they were ten years ago.

Everyone grows, it's just a matter of what direction they take. I kind of like who I've been trying to become lately. Will I succeed at what I want to do? I hope so. Will life events derail me? Possibly. But I'll be damned if I'm not gonna try.

I get frustrated sometimes. Hope wavers. But then it dawns on me that I will never escape all my problems and that whether I want to take responsibility for it or not, I do have some choice in who I am throughout it.

So to life, I say: Bring it on. I don't know how much time I have left, or if I will break again like I've broken in the past. But it's a new day, with new challenges. I've gotta face life anyway, so let's do this. :)

schizophrenia,barc0des,2018/02/21,"Anyone have this happen to them? Heya guys.  
I have sort of an odd question i guess? Or at least i never see anyone talk about this sort of thing so im not sure if anyone else experiences it.  
Basically, does anyone else get these like, visions while awake? Not hallucinations, but more like you’re seeing something happening or you’re somewhere else and something is happening for like a few seconds or a minute (or more?) and then you’re suddenly snapped back and really confused. Like hallucinating but inside your head? Seeing yourself do something or be somewhere else and then suddenly it never happened.

schizophrenia,Johnny-B-Badd,2018/02/21,"Triggers for an episode. Hi

I'm currently doing a level 2 course in mental health awareness as part of my mandatory training at work. And I've found learning about schizophrenia fascinating, one of the most interesting things to learn about were how very small things can trigger episodes. I read that one person started having delusions of Grandeur (I think its spelt) from her friend calling her child a nimrod in a joking manner. 

Has anyone any stories of a small insignificant thing triggering an episode for you or someone you know?

I hope this isn't a rude question to ask!",8.522243589743589,9.064641096153846,7.054615384615384,75.3570512820513,61.115384615384606,9.241025641025642,38.487179487179496,8.841846274778883,3.462075641025641,470,22,77,6,6,140,82,104,0.022,0.775,0.203,0.9556,1,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,2,0,1,3,5,1,0,8,0,6,1,0,4,0,14,13,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,6,1,0,0,6,2,0,0,1,1,0,2,2,0,8,4,15,11,2,8,0,0,0,0,11,6,0,4,2,50,14,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486047879661887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15279806369193324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20429178104839102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22313889965575567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396018579814869,0.1688322074257045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322823165218448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21704506221492276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009586301859555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22022223868886112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29615697770671034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366417487429051,0.0,0.0,0.19080797913792968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447984968050008,0.0,0.21858456904121595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18515589020142675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15467342619018806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4355357627466643,0.14002227376768447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803063680230816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15908911781700513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,catdogbun,2018/02/21,"Want to hear from other people if this is ""normal."" About 5 or 6 years ago, my brother was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic after escalating violent behavior and hard drug use landed him in the mental ward.

I've been living with him on and off since then, and he seems to be getting worse and worse. He'll spend all day and half the night yelling at people he has limited to no actual contact with, and he will become furious if you don't answer one of his questions of ""Isn't he?"" or something similar. 

We are just coming off of a phase where he would literally only speak in weird gibberish languages, which he called German and Russian, but he just isn't coherant at all. Unless the police are called. Then, and only then, he will be quiet, and actually talk coherently. It's a complete, instantaneous 180. Is that normal? I guess my question pertaining to that is, can you ""shut it off"" for a short period, or is he possibly intentionally playing it up just to annoy everyone?

He also still won't admit that anything is even wrong with him. Is it normal to be in denial about it for so long? It's like he has no self awareness. I think it's also possible he's got some other things going on in addition to the schizophrenia. The way he compulsively utters certain words and phrases over and over leads me to believe he might also have tourettes (since it does actually run in the family), but I guess I just know so little about the actual day to day lives of other people with schizophrenia that I don't know if this behavior could be classified as ""normal"" or at least ""within the realm of possibility"" for the disorder. Any insight anyone might have would be much appreciated.",6.307924528301887,7.0411310188679295,7.160685534591195,72.04366981132077,65.85534591194968,10.259371069182393,30.99433962264151,10.241411754978122,3.221310188679245,1336,48,234,31,20,446,175,318,0.102,0.855,0.043,-0.9337,1,0,2,0,1,0,41.0,1,2,0,2,15,8,3,0,12,0,32,3,0,3,3,62,47,30,0,11,14,1,1,1,0,8,3,4,0,1,19,18,0,1,9,1,1,4,7,5,0,2,3,5,15,3,45,30,5,40,0,0,0,0,33,22,0,15,14,167,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.3559755784501801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083952790140914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2187876194678948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062016235672906525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06376618720009702,0.0,0.07504632997758605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10071853845101918,0.0,0.10274637849500448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862421093995024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855706162205321,0.0956170063940029,0.0,0.0,0.07281238387464363,0.0,0.0,0.1764411384957584,0.0,0.0,0.09256176426228037,0.0,0.0,0.1045182276957266,0.0,0.07980601337145588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10575811460081318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060233931269693536,0.0,0.0,0.08714144503732067,0.0,0.0,0.0859712347198937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04764601420869728,0.0,0.05182864502596595,0.0,0.07293757032751275,0.0,0.2009247951868633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169347727077486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102784235565389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002375959245257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044553635852127384,0.09140209718011062,0.16105503200910842,0.08070536695358725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09190386421500008,0.19348855353496014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703936767830218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0855810314491008,0.35740988022998044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06179659880748229,0.1387169511305363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18967094652354224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3084285093638965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043202171074912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08302118363529479,0.0951370539068935,0.0,0.0,0.150876129780155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020694200223973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07282904191729174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07329968756946688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06058640253372759,0.0584345528046425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07876384552420003,0.0,0.0,0.053789614795080896,0.07238693971332112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18587251595837812,0.12956568526757048,0.09970823396399406,0.0,0.058727071550152124

I adore the artwork that the folks here post (I've personally always noticed a specific technique similar between people dealing with psychosis-related symptoms but that could just be me). I deeply admire the passion added into these creative pieces and feel so connected to them.

I appreciate the great level of empathetic support found here. It's so welcoming, especially during times when I inaccurately convince myself that it's me against the world.

I still have minor delusional beliefs that have stuck with me for decades and have never really been able to shake, although I'm grateful that they no longer provoke me to harm myself. 

Anyway, thank you all for the understanding and love I consistently see shared here in posts and comments. It's good to just read through. 🧡",8.32865769230769,9.823124735,7.696999999999999,67.2806153846154,61.65,11.153846153846157,39.884615384615394,11.051253699011982,5.004707692307694,937,49,140,25,13,293,127,200,0.066,0.674,0.26,0.9943,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,2,0,13,13,0,1,9,0,13,6,0,2,3,30,23,11,0,3,8,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,11,10,0,0,4,1,0,1,5,2,0,1,4,2,22,11,22,16,3,15,1,0,1,2,11,5,0,0,7,107,33,1,0.1678224604262617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964173105165198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17239989568208916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26798515762495845,0.18569236042744594,0.0,0.0,0.17301758763996722,0.0,0.3406725293952321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08485607849224873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18400866565188834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076151752284374,0.0,0.18502485508528466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.151466322761017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12943502740724394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19106698351507725,0.0,0.0,0.11372084246424845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163469632411604,0.1465360992301513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3214550533510557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16786787556745475,0.0,0.10751136548876088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373277291253244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340232336815223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19044293930558906,0.0,0.3488635889106351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1545083739018532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19571725253405944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17470909988068722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898603528942697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080721622390142

schizophrenia,throwaawyforma,2018/02/22,"How to talk to my best friend who may be developing schizophrenia We have known each other for a long time. While he's had delusional beliefs for some years, slowly he is slipping away further in them, which is probably related to some social seclusion and stress. Ever since I've known him, but even more so lately, I struggle extremely on how to talk to him when a delusional idea or thought comes up.

I'm torn between two sides: I don't want to affirm his beliefs as reality, but I don't want to rationalize away his delusions either. Why not the latter? Because he can become very defensive. Even when I choose my words very carefully, and I express things neutrally and always affirm I'm on his side, a disagreement with what he says can make him visibly disappointed in me. And, well... I'm emotionally dependent on him (I'm also socially secluded) and get pretty down when someone looks down on me.

 Sometimes when talking about things he recognizes himself are deemed as delusions by society, he brings up schizophrenia and says he is of course not developing that: what he is experiencing is real. I've explicitly expressed mental health worries only a few times in the nicest way I can, but it never resonates and always distances us.

My resort is to be quiet... To not confirm or deny... To give the most neutral answer and to switch the topic. It works in the sense that my silence communicates a subtle disagreement, as he also recognizes sometimes. But it has also painted me as a shallow and uninterested person, which I'm not! Anyway, it hurts because I want to help him. But he would never ever want treatment. 

What should I do? Maybe I should just keep doing what I'm doing and suffer from my hidden discomfort -- I can take that and have taken it for years now. But I keep thinking: what if there's some actions I can take or things I can say that will prevent him from developing full-blown schizophrenia. But then I think, no, I could not help him because he doesn't want to be helped. I don't know...

I feel like I have a big burden and it feels good to write about it. How should I talk to him and should I take some kind of action? I've already heard the advice of expressing my worries to people who love him. No, that would be the worst kind of betrayal in his eyes. And yeah, I don't want to lose him as a friend.

I currently am taking 10mg Abilify/Aripirazole daily. I think it's making me more emotionally numb...has anyone else experienced this? I feel like I'm not really enjoying anything and the drive to do it is just gone. Also my girlfriend has told me that I seem really distant and unenthusiastic and she's sooo understanding but I'm worried its gonna put stress on our relationship because I can't really be there for her emotionally right now.

For the last yr I have been hallucinating giant ants from millions of years ago that are suppose to be long gone. They are in almost every rock I have collected. They bite and sting me through the rocks. I can see them crawling under the surface of the rocks. I see their shapes and images in the tile floors that are morphing and moving along side of eyes that look in various directions. There are scorpions and other creatures there as well, but mostly ants. I just needed to get this out. So far I have tried only two meds but they are not really helpful enough to deal with the side effects.

schizophrenia,LovelyFloweringDay,2018/02/22,"Is it a bad idea to entertain delusions? 

This feels really silly admitting, but
like I’ve had this recurring one where I need to follow the secret instructions encoded in things like people’s word choice, the direction that my pencil points if I drop it, or a “magical sense” making me turn around and look at something to decipher the significance of it (these kinds of ones I am the most embarrassed about because clearly my brain just randomly picked an object to fixate on, but like I can’t just ignore it because what if it is telling me something important). 

The exact details change from time to time but usually it is pretty harmless stuff like “don’t step on the green tiles; the floor will fall out from under you” or “don’t drink from that water fountain because it is poisoned!” The worst it has been is being told to not take any cold medicine during a time when I was sick because it would interrupt “their” communication with me.

Is it a bad thing to just keep doing what I am told to?

The delusions aren’t scary (I’m not in constant fear for my life despite the information I am receiving), it’s just that I am worried that they might become scary or get worse.
I am not currently diagnosed or getting help, but I plan on it after this semester ends.",7.4767418944691695,7.076779954545457,7.419586776859504,75.0238556897648,63.50413223140496,10.917228226319137,34.73108709472346,10.389873798559362,3.4935253655435474,1007,39,186,21,13,323,146,242,0.179,0.6940000000000001,0.127,-0.961,2,0,3,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,2,1,8,15,1,2,15,0,24,7,1,2,2,38,38,12,0,4,17,0,1,4,0,3,4,0,0,0,25,4,2,2,5,2,0,4,7,7,0,2,5,4,19,8,26,29,2,27,0,0,2,0,11,12,0,9,14,133,44,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09255196837273352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12115694023528215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22727391445772305,0.331858681787832,0.15031062243816756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15193146400845062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14397466688763744,0.0,0.0,0.14707463929045764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813759228649242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13332517968779806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12054329337201318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153149181895513,0.06881572984238925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14221219176824926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09122427246306462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15363917399520516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12097102018047058,0.0,0.14172613644600968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613072924319704,0.2659643334706852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428885954740718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908471210089568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14437950234277985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091566364865956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18444837215011026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094353891113616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12865752014380175,0.0,0.0,0.1384615835563199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08718848683464392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095512765401968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15580076218612354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232948963822848,0.0,0.1189565008215838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18083621975040312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23808121613424774,0.0,0.0,0.2600968013468725,0.0,0.0,0.1480366003403704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14989379035569608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382151130349792,0.1386964802981081,0.09668080523560836,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,diamondsandjules1,2018/02/23,"Voices Inside My Head Won't Leave I’ve tried my hardest to not talk about these issues with others, since to me, they shouldn’t be a big issue compared to others and that I feel pathetic for even talking about them. However, for the past couple of years, I feel that it’s almost completely consumed me.

For the past couple of years, thanks to self-discovery and my initial reactions to it, alongside issues inside my family, my mental health and anxiety have been off the walls. It’s gone to the point where I barely leave my residence outside of school and meals and seldom talk to anyone. Because of past experiences and anxiety, I’ve had these voices inside my head that makes themselves out to be people that I know, specifically my family members, telling me disparaging things in a very loud, angry, screaming tone. It’s now gotten to where I can barely enjoy anything.

An example of this was just today. I’m watching a YouTube video about gaming, and I have this screaming voice at the back of my head that makes itself out to be my brother (the most frequent in my head). Statements along the lines of “why are you watching this, you’re not accomplishing a damn thing”, “this is for pussies, watch something more important like [insert sex-related statement here]”, and several others.

It isn’t just mundane things where these voices persist, it infects everything that I enjoy. I’m planning on going to a con tomorrow, and these voices are telling me “you’re fuckin’ retarded for being interested in this”, “you’re not gettin’ bitches this way”, “what are you accomplishing doing this”.

It’s also affected my college life and classes. I’ve had statements along the lines of these frequently plague my mind: 



- “You’ve been at college for how long and you haven’t fucked any bitches yet? Pathetic.”

- “This song/show/movie/game is for fags/retards/losers, do something more cool or important. Start being a man.”

- “Your friends are fuckin’ losers.”

- “College turned you into a fuckin’ faggot”

- “Your so-called Asperger’s is 100% bullshit. It’s all an excuse.”

- “I know what’s going on in your head. You obviously don’t give a shit about anything. That’s why you’re failing.”

- “You’re fake. Your “friends” know you’re fake. Your dreams are bullshit.”

- “You’re not praising/obeying God by doing what you do!”



I could go on, but it’s best to not type anymore at this point.

I know that most of my family would never mean to say these things to me. However, most of these statements are along the lines of things that have actually been said to me in the past, some were by people close to me, and they trace back as far back as my childhood, and some as early as last year.

This has been escalating beginning around late 2015, when I found out I was trans (still in the closet as of this writing). No matter how much I tell these voices to stop or ignore them, they keep coming back. It’s been at an all-time high the past several months to the point where my sleep schedule was corrupted at different times. 

I know that this is schizophrenia. I know that most of these statements are fueled by anxiety and low self-esteem. I know that these voices persist because I know bad things will happen if I come out, or if I don’t live up to some exaggeratedly high expectations. And I personally know that these voices are not real. What I don’t know is how to deal with this. Every time I try to counteract it, whether it be studying, spending time with friends, talking to close family, just doing things that I love, etc., these voices come back and get stronger with each passing day. It’s one of the things that’s left me in a state of depression for years.

I’ve been silent about this for a couple of years, but now I desperately need to know how to end this. I can’t let this keep going on.",4.810897257089724,6.441542253835426,4.9431450488145074,83.27186308693629,69.976290097629,7.821571362157138,27.503719200371922,8.344100000000001,1.8506092980009288,2984,102,560,45,54,933,291,717,0.097,0.8320000000000001,0.071,-0.9579,3,0,2,0,0,0,106.0,0,11,5,8,30,29,8,0,27,1,53,16,7,7,3,103,94,35,0,7,17,1,2,1,3,4,3,14,1,2,72,35,1,4,20,3,1,9,16,18,0,1,16,20,65,11,93,66,14,91,0,4,3,5,37,40,8,13,41,381,137,9,0.0,0.0,0.055215640293116784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05665846409072165,0.0,0.0,0.04524841675833219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03847754024202085,0.0,0.12985468528759414,0.0,0.05611390657168732,0.03956328544371607,0.0,0.09312394247721388,0.050369766580530016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21753942220859174,0.04724341007146513,0.0689834371308583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593790711960325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14622054049523706,0.05932490373571851,0.0,0.0,0.04517593498307158,0.1878199391907392,0.0,0.0364905573148403,0.0583333148702941,0.048733790993911064,0.0,0.0,0.05911590125779855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05011464913364082,0.0,0.06310362431292449,0.03737172192438119,0.0,0.04767257707982367,0.0,0.05085204166558738,0.0553478230295237,0.21336100830357896,0.0,0.0572188806105316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062038984468274626,0.13114479306379714,0.052308929684256635,0.02956163671004582,0.054278384450721896,0.12862688314036164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050035067627077684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2903460719171499,0.060143769953849985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11956348184117765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17716998571167136,0.0,0.10058494441450848,0.0,0.0,0.3420544392940144,0.046121690067630484,0.06382669506772015,0.11982383803186634,0.06147625286203193,0.05785868789945256,0.03996537370284217,0.027642992158866533,0.0,0.049962734823146907,0.05007308120219181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05106725170766964,0.0,0.07553753455391002,0.0,0.0,0.06163412923038342,0.0,0.0,0.057021110606924275,0.0,0.05713145266134241,0.0,0.045163024732243935,0.0,0.041594107408367456,0.041954661552454836,0.043639345063020425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0383412680830242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2700684836533454,0.07845334261707579,0.04940501444306634,0.0,0.0,0.16046416934651078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06440243551088687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05382221528795938,0.04499609028552056,0.0,0.05726376659489794,0.0,0.0,0.1180542411350856,0.12784257741970412,0.0580803683244544,0.04680502042880761,0.0,0.056622627336453624,0.0,0.0,0.08711881354451761,0.0,0.0,0.040048864253003115,0.0,0.04518627034927677,0.04730488882172487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18191311662690174,0.14836486877228666,0.05209288690158529,0.0,0.0,0.30072328206521337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897984597995448,0.0,0.0536328969681508,0.0,0.0,0.07683060816278972,0.06154471209027972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04668588156849464,0.0,0.044911971124891606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211248375515317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04019406220624533,0.0,0.0,0.1821840066837704
schizophrenia,Schluribumbi,2018/02/23,"shortfilm about schizophrenia. what do you think about it? Hey guys and girls

Me and a friend of mine made a short film about a young man starting to suffer from schizophrenia. We have a friend who has schizophrenia, and we talked with psychiatrists and read a loooot of books in order to understand it better and make a fitting movie. 
I really love this part of the internet, so I thought I’d post the link to the movie here. It takes about 15min to watch and is filmed in swissgerman with english subtitles. 

Here is the link to the movie:
https://succeedshortfilm.com

But be advised, although there aren’t any disturbing images, it could trigger some of you because it shows the effects of a schizophrenic escalation.  

Do you like the movie? Do you think it's authentic?

Kind Regards and take care

schizophrenia,burke_no_sleeps,2018/02/23,"Relapsing, prodromal Venting here, thank you for reading, sorry to take up your time and attention when so many better things deserve it more. 

I've been functioning pretty well, psychologically, for a few months. Still have difficulty organising tasks, sticking to a human schedule, and remembering stuff, but I know from recent memory and spotty journal entries that I was happy, productive, and reasonable. I even had a semi active social life.

Two days ago my anxiety started ramping up and now I'm certain I'm in the prodromal phase, headed for psychosis in the next few weeks. Everything is awful, everything I do is wrong, and something terrible is about to happen -- and I cant escape it if I'm awake. 

The worst part is being aware enough to see it happening but being unable to stop it. I don't know how bad it'll be this time, and I don't know how long my insight will last. I think my family and friends believe I'm lying so I can get out of social obligations / responsibilities. I want to reassure them but I can't fake normalcy right now. 

The good news is, I finally have an intake meeting next week, to get set up with a therapist and a psychiatrist. I guess this is a good time to be suffering, then. 

I'm angry this is happening, or rather I want to be angry but I'm just numb, sad, hurting, and scared. I was doing so well. Nothing bad happened, it just came out of nowhere.

schizophrenia,Dibuixar,2018/02/23,"Is it possible to ""tame"" your voices or hallucinations? Often they say negative things. You know the usual rep.

People try to make them disappear, but can we tame them?

Get them to say good or at least neutral things?

When I was a child, I saw a giant butterfly only in my peripheral vision.

Its wings seemed to be made of light. It fluttered its wings when someone seemed to be lying. It was never accurate. Like it fluttered when I was watching TV commercials. So not exactly lying, but anything pretentious seemed to activate this hallucination.

I was never diagnosed. I have never seen any hallucination other than that.

(I heard some singing though. I may be low-key. Maybe this condition is a spectrum.)

I even miss it sometimes. It felt like a friend.

I have two diagnosed friends.

A voice tells him to castrate himself.

A voice tells her that her mother is poisoning her.

I don't understand why the voices are negative. 

Is it because my friends are in a bad place?

Or are the voices pushing them to a bad place?

Is it possible to tame them, instead of suppressing them?",2.867121212121212,5.7952511919191965,4.0759848484848495,80.53397727272728,82.53535353535355,7.542424242424243,26.936868686868692,8.472884824447931,2.536117171717172,848,37,148,21,24,276,112,198,0.171,0.7290000000000001,0.099,-0.9522,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,1,2,7,0,9,10,1,0,11,0,20,3,0,2,4,23,33,10,0,0,6,1,1,2,3,1,3,8,0,1,17,1,0,1,6,2,0,2,7,4,0,1,9,13,27,6,15,20,2,15,0,1,3,0,25,6,0,9,9,112,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08960684620678454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10843394275255906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22004176742746467,0.0803246283795656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674837543711907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703160643578772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12651806779275826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3054111886823424,0.0,0.06884340884672906,0.0,0.0,0.11052085486562672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07241631763592196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287505038780936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12468218963131965,0.08795624926954006,0.0,0.13237879636925334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048831128781245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10021559976477573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135142945830976,0.0,0.27533929866951423,0.0,0.0,0.2970975337289251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20957460985086465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3598702671901991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11164670805448376,0.0,0.13032204883258652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303423052330719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17508177963900046,0.0,0.1294615176687544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08946191006901075,0.0,0.1287183153248836,0.13717526928824214,0.0,0.0,0.1451239779759442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890024115481553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Davidsdoom,2018/02/24,"Help with my brother. I am reaching out for help! I just moved to rural Colorado with my wife and kids to help my mother take care of my schizophrenic brother. He is suffering deeply and I don't have the slightest clue what I'm doing. 

My mom is burned out and hasn't done much so I feel like I am starting from scratch. I'm not even sure what questions to ask or were to go. 

What I do know is that he is on INVEGA TRINZA which is a 3 month injection. It seems to help a little with the paranoia. His other symptoms don't seem to be affected. Constantly pacing, smoking, and drinking. obsessive thoughts and behaviors seem to be the most noticable. Out here there seems to be very little in the way of help, little to no mental health care. 

So again I'm not even sure what I'm asking. I guess just general advice? 

Thanks for listening.",2.011525184924267,4.319425622754493,3.291475871785841,88.9611236350828,80.19760479041916,6.56414230362804,23.595984501585068,7.724431198458867,1.2240809439943643,657,23,133,11,17,213,98,167,0.081,0.7609999999999999,0.158,0.9381,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,0,9,8,0,1,6,0,18,4,0,1,2,30,39,8,0,0,5,5,2,1,0,0,3,1,0,1,8,11,1,0,8,1,0,2,6,2,0,0,3,3,13,6,22,33,2,15,0,1,0,0,18,8,0,8,5,87,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11958938643459968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22881960103379054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495513585434273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13225048346040474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12523834662799474,0.0,0.11988687890870547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16166311374328915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06187955710952445,0.08742907637133833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695519946928073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348165698861009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13008537769109582,0.0,0.0,0.4101473304564053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06725744746239813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05978921970234701,0.3679740136828339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333135610486735,0.0,0.0,0.14333125550932474,0.09768341982011347,0.1300717327762911,0.08996418375657754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393316840495497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13709483094506786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44564459832586456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866219666051686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306854612340447,0.1272008131709813,0.0920153504519949,0.0,0.0,0.11267206682940027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971569167180491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097721744645363,0.0,0.09714041422937317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,foooooomnt,2018/02/24,"Whisper voices The volume is turned up today in my head today. I recently did something that was weird, and I know people are gossiping. I’ve been hearing them for the past couple days. 

At first it was really negative, and then there was  some voices fighting back for me “why the fuck so you care anyways, why do you need to ruin her life so bad”. Now i feel like an emotionless shell, just randomly catching phrases of so many people running around with ‘hot gossip’.


“Go back to where you came from, we don’t want you any more.”

I’m going to do yoga, try and eat something. 

I dont know if I’m strong enough for this, guys. I want to go all thirteen reasons just to not live this experience anymore. Either that, or run away.

schizophrenia,kyladavid,2018/02/24,"MDD with psychotic features looking for friends Hi r/schizophrenia, if my post is not appropriate here feel free to delete.

I have psychotic depression and I struggle with finding a support system that understands psychosis. Although there are general psychosis and psychotic features subreddits, they have very few members and very little activity compared to this subreddit. I also have a hard time finding support for psychosis in real life: I’m the only psychotic person I know and I can’t seem to find any support groups in my area for it. I realize that MDD with psychotic features is not the same as schizophrenia, but I was wondering if I was welcome in this subreddit just to talk about struggling with psychosis in general. Sometimes I feel really alone and I just want a friend who gets it.

If anyone else is looking for psychotic friends or wants to chat, hmu! I’m a first year grad student in STEM, I love cats, and I spend a lot of time looking at memes. Thx.

schizophrenia,Baynsma,2018/02/24,"psychosis after first time weed since quitting? So I've been abusing my neruochemistry for years now, but I really did a number on myself this time. I've been smoking weed almost daily for about a year and a half, and semi regularly for about 7 years. I then recently quit weed and cigarettes cold turkey and got on a plane to deep dark Europe, and started travelling around there by myself, having experienced symptoms of anxiety and paranoia, conspiratorial delusions and so on about people at work plotting against me, everyone thinking I'm an idiot, general negativity and social anxiety at points in the months before then. Anyway, so I stopped all drugs, and I became pretty emotionally unstable. Then, after 6 weeks, and after a night without sleep, I smoked half a joint, which kicked me into overdrive. 

The first time I ever got really high, I thought I was dying. I felt my soul leaving my body for one thing, and for another, when I looked at trees, I saw statues, figures. This to me is the classic psychosis - pattern recognition gone haywire. Anyway, this was coupled with an overall dangerous and negative situation I'd found myself in (think smoking in the ghetto and then suddenly coming to about where I was and what I was doing) and I went into a 7 day no sleeping paranoid psychotic bender, complete with open eye hallucinations indistinguishable from reality, auditory hallucinations and possibly voices. Aliens, biblical revelations, fractalised realisations and the belief, while still overseas, that I was literally dead and had entered into a perpetual dream state of nightmarish hell that could only lead to pure insanity. 

So basically, I managed to get back to my home country with the help of my parents, and I've been put on risperidone. My psych isn't sure if I already had schizophrenia, or if it was simply drug induced psychosis. I'm inclined to believe that I was going through psychosis from stress, anxiety, depression and drug use, and that quitting followed by starting again suddenly shocked my brain into being flooded with dopamine, leading to a whole chain of negative effects like sleep deprivation leading to psychosis. 

What do people here think? Has anyone experienced this from quitting weed and then starting again a while later? What sort of fx from tolerance break leading to extreme sensitivity to an already somewhat destabilised mind have people had?",12.287542579075428,10.743281172749395,11.230328467153287,55.21537104622874,54.790754257907544,13.512895377128954,47.89416058394161,12.161744961471696,6.155604379562044,1946,103,271,45,18,624,235,411,0.184,0.775,0.041,-0.9967,2,0,5,0,0,0,52.0,0,0,0,12,21,9,3,1,19,0,23,10,6,7,4,64,45,38,2,3,5,1,1,1,0,0,4,1,1,0,14,33,0,1,10,2,0,12,6,7,0,5,22,8,31,2,56,21,3,71,4,2,3,0,3,20,1,6,38,204,45,7,0.0,0.10574727447766746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08937150579241296,0.0,0.19698034124987127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09358695444437937,0.2048292156273375,0.0,0.0,0.06240604031444232,0.0,0.0,0.07945188698561123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06862814248145885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07594562079790737,0.10055477550196763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991372100967814,0.0,0.0996330997177379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07688142211147485,0.09357747448574684,0.0,0.0,0.07125927961182453,0.09875400526470572,0.0,0.05755920332061529,0.0,0.07687134400827862,0.0,0.09262795122445294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31050681183025397,0.0,0.0,0.1003948247059708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08073220703709509,0.0,0.08528269872860643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08569449768240132,0.0,0.0,0.1518328972138845,0.0,0.09785859092268956,0.0,0.0,0.046629714180651684,0.0,0.05072312855689184,0.0,0.1427635916198956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05982274372400617,0.094298076919453,0.08952555082974523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945034162732252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04360329693882989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07494796034664686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09011758497859232,0.0,0.07123891533659857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375556910757266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06047846367814965,0.067879043931104,0.0,0.0,0.09910214283844836,0.0,0.0,0.1856252232563876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437059181639485,0.10061655366601244,0.0,0.0907998672399774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08972142599105573,0.0,0.3797156657809109,0.0,0.0,0.11435233984912542,0.0,0.08812412342932456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382895427008579,0.10032132642591676,0.267944933640208,0.09097966782030988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18951593699234925,0.0,0.07127558233473623,0.07461743295001465,0.10223617165732324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411756095609434,0.09276546600151066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05929408115875371,0.1715643925819065,0.0,0.07085494526284918,0.15612809172104364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07708379526722363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07159138541661941,0.0,0.0,0.08273612826094348,0.0,0.0996450207390734,0.0,0.08603431850806277,0.0,0.06497544314497246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17242323034969026
schizophrenia,eowyn_rohan,2018/02/24,"Stopping Invega Sustenna--DAE have any experience with this? Hello,

My last shot of Invega Sustenna was last December 15, 2017 (with doctor's supervision, of course). Finally, after gaining almost 70 pounds with this drug and suffering from adnehonia, I am free of it!

I've been reading a lot of forums/threads about coming off Invega Sustenna and most of them were not very inspiring or positive at all. They talked about how several months after taking it, they are still suffering from several side effects.

I've read about some though who did recover and feel better, and even lost the weight they gained.

I've been really depressed about how this medicine has made me f*cking obese (I used to be normal weight range without any doing any diet or exercise before this drug) and I cannot wait to lose it all. This drug has also made me lose interest in pretty much everything and cannot be motivated to be productive at all.

My doctor says it takes 7.5 months to get out of my system, so I can't wait for that day to arrive. I'm scared though that like the others I've read about I won't be able to recover from the weight loss and adnehonia.

If you've experienced stopping taking Invega Sustenna, what was it like? I was hoping to hear from other people who took this drug and stopped and be more informed about withdrawing from it. I'd really appreciate it if you had positive results, like losing the weight you gained.

Thanks in advance, reddit.",7.833739237392372,7.816677047970482,7.827955719557196,71.11873554735547,62.6531365313653,11.507109471094713,33.19581795817958,11.072351349416056,3.741244821648216,1164,41,202,29,15,376,150,271,0.1,0.736,0.16399999999999998,0.966,0,0,4,0,0,0,34.0,0,2,4,12,14,18,0,1,5,0,23,13,0,8,3,45,40,19,0,4,6,0,5,3,0,1,8,3,0,0,20,14,6,5,5,4,1,3,6,9,0,0,12,9,17,10,37,22,8,23,0,8,0,0,13,7,0,9,15,132,37,7,0.08726751871645752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738581422757094,0.0,0.0,0.06978780318866498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17803471577375893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07425823087124132,0.0,0.0,0.07718102858502024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517324018003899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05628033011041952,0.0,0.07516338599613705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17864400649536652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4048104644302619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0576393730726494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07843041878026166,0.08536437862865527,0.0,0.0,0.044125079558592295,0.0,0.0,0.0955973011512637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04559367669534197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983568360035199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08667633681341752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422693503889589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12790350477667586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2928900938307955,0.09526280545997777,0.0741917236967308,0.0,0.1651492724996811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13931220171756667,0.0,0.06415166738599347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550363969349628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050030947265341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887824397739348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618734036391664,0.0,0.11181161420458073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06939863354505252,0.08737001017690328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19717491287593128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969195317501245,0.2188786596833336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968429404942082,0.07014232590943152,0.0,0.08034420647320828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17147978811505174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695742428242042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537111692874217,0.0,0.07200484233498552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4250733111608904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412277389399747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,bbb1225,2018/02/24,"Quick question Hey everyone, I am majoring in neuropsychology and I love learning about the brain. I was wondering if anyone with schizophrenia has had hallucinations that are synesthetic. Synesthesia is when two or more of your senses are connected, so does music for example bring about a certain visual hallucination, or anything similar to that?

Edit: I’m fairly new to this subreddit, this is my first time asking a question and it has been so amazing hearing everyone’s stories. If anyone ever wants to talk about anything random I’d be happy to. I love talking about the brain so this is sooooo cool for me. I don’t have schizophrenia so I really like learning about what it is like.",4.231555299539167,7.365444298387098,5.183640552995391,73.67403225806453,77.79032258064517,8.058986175115209,29.82488479262673,8.841846274778883,3.242204608294932,559,26,86,14,14,182,83,124,0.0,0.7909999999999999,0.209,0.9809,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,1,0,1,12,8,0,0,4,1,15,4,2,0,2,16,23,11,0,3,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,3,0,0,5,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,3,2,9,8,14,19,2,8,0,0,0,2,10,1,0,8,8,66,17,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368389799297593,0.0,0.2787354398905718,0.0,0.15832745475454946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3781204765675237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820687600345955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15319457432166836,0.0,0.32365885210418865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14405636183102918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802854079298584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19087948153288506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16548014128973582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.305705546610052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635676175487573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794408441492291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084954732986813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722480988026861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09875437750169837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16543877006265192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09989210628906996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18366220690883506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,paranoid927,2018/02/25,"Should I see a psychologist or a psychiatrist first? Who should I see first? A part of me wants to see a psychiatrist first because it's less intimate, but another part of me feels like I won't be able to explain myself very well if I only have 1-2 sessions to go over my history, so a psychologist would be better. Because I don't have very severe symptoms I was considering seeing a psychiatrist first and bringing up my family history of ADD and how I'm having a lot of issues with inattention, navigation, and reading and see where it goes from there. 

I have never been to a psychiatrist and the last time I saw a psychologist was when I was a teen many years ago, and briefly at that, so I'm very intimated by this whole process and have no idea how it works. I'm very nervous to bring up any of the things I've experienced because a) a lot of it was in the past and I feel like I'm doing better now (even though I'm having trouble moving on from these experiences and they've left me with some residual ""quirks"" that have really damaged my self esteem), and b) a big part of me keeps convincing myself that I'm being totally ridiculous and exaggerating things, and to say anything would be very embarrassing.

schizophrenia,psychicfurniture,2018/02/25,"Brain pain? Sensations in brain? Don't know. I'm not formally diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, I will probably be diagnosed with something soon - schizophrenia, autism, I have no idea - given the things that have happened in the last couple of days, in combination with my entire life, and the last number of weeks, months.

I started having these ""episodes"". So far I've only had two, although I'd say technically three (the second was mitigated by meditation, the third felt like it happened but had no outward symptoms - two were yesterday). I get really hyper and feel like ""playing"", and spam my online friends with these surrealist stream of consciousness tirades that are mostly in word salad verse (in other words, most of it rhymes, but it's all nonsense).

Ever since the first ""episode"" - this isn't my only symptom, but I'll refrain from a life story - I've had these weird feelings in my brain. During the episode, I could feel the left side of my brain. Ever since, suddenly during the day, multiple times a day, it feels like the ""furniture is being moved around"" in my brain. I feel parts of my brain - left side, front side, right side, right-middle, etc - and while it doesn't hurt, it's definitely odd. It would probably make a baby cry, and a grown man go ""ugh, what the hell?"", but I suppose beyond that, it isn't too particularly distressing.

I've been trying to google fu to try to find out what it might be, but I honestly can't find much. I'm not trying to self-diagnose, just trying to understand.

In my ""episodes"", the usual paranoia I feel is suddenly hyperified. I was going to say something else, but it's completely slipped out of mind.

I can't remember.

(I remembered, but I'm keeping the above as is. I've started seeing movement that isn't there and I'm incredibly sensitive to light, but mostly in general, not episode specific.)

Sorry to post such a lengthy post, but does this happen to anyone else - sensations in your brain, like some sort of cranial renovation? Is it an indicator for anything? It's so frequent now.",4.956031746031744,6.925919312169312,5.463153439153441,78.33647619047622,70.16402116402116,8.84952380952381,30.32486772486773,9.3871,2.890714708994709,1612,67,287,36,30,517,200,378,0.084,0.84,0.076,-0.591,1,0,2,0,0,0,86.0,0,1,0,1,12,13,1,1,19,0,29,15,7,1,3,59,54,20,0,2,13,0,7,4,1,3,7,2,0,1,25,13,1,2,15,1,0,6,12,6,0,6,9,11,21,7,39,38,8,52,1,1,1,0,5,23,1,6,25,179,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0507109797769674,0.07431015979771742,0.059681675962322524,0.06456238873461738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5667311137850635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07604080297862102,0.0,0.0,0.057905098114039676,0.08024723790581641,0.0796650139831226,0.14031735938682394,0.0,0.0,0.22083323286504014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06346688280829389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12117021693055074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088424862840436,0.0,0.1312055466996395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200241055533156,0.1036233678591049,0.0696351173231534,0.0,0.13257258460018712,0.06168950105868025,0.0,0.0,0.056032429008573,0.0,0.03789117977853115,0.0,0.08243495448557671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19240014630627256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07763922694326733,0.08187159610568763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644633152285599,0.0,0.0,0.039857696712127695,0.11823467470245988,0.0,0.0,0.1575966697753307,0.0,0.10245272782044328,0.14172768521334222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048410822612480066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07693728099655854,0.0732293061115902,0.0,0.05788855015900274,0.07708231387634461,0.05331402374626987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103166554623874,0.07717142955878051,0.0,0.0,0.07853721863309973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13891729354352242,0.0,0.15638785775201744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04646120122602848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16431276985555104,0.12387145186523855,0.0,0.1153491576303886,0.0,0.0,0.05779282259654195,0.0,0.07565911384310263,0.0,0.0,0.11998641759934027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11166616579743956,0.0,0.08118550119325761,0.1026667589633726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15076193415575145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04818221017364499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04228975519030576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1969581329304981,0.0,0.1416922522713388,0.07550080504208162,0.0,0.0,0.07987574746486957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05817496639387139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05151948966914782,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,hoarderline,2018/02/25,"Constantly paranoid about work, even after I clock out I was diagnosed with schizophrenia by 3 different doctors as a child.... I'm not sure how I feel about the diagnosis, I think my symptoms resonate more with paranoid personality disorder (not a self-diagnosis, just trying to give some context)


I am constantly afraid that they are planning on firing me. I'm not a bad worker nor did anything terrible happen, I just feel like I do a crappy job. My boss asked me if I work tomorrow (I do) and I feel like he is planning on giving me bad news/feedback related to my performance. 

This is retail btw.

Maybe this has nothing to do with my mental illness and is just me being new to the workforce, idk. But these thoughts are pretty intense and scary, it's not like other anxieties and fears I have had recently....

schizophrenia,mercury_panda,2018/02/25,"My best friends wife was recently diagnosed as a paranoid/delusional schizophrenic... How best to support them? A few questions if I may ask...? (Apologies for longish post) To start, I would like to say that I’m not taking it upon myself to “help” this woman to make myself feel good, or do anything uncalled for. I guess something just feels “nosy” about making this post about someone else, but I’m hoping y’all understand I’m coming from a place of concern. 

Im usually a rather hands-off type of friend; I tend to give people space when they encounter problems. However, this is obviously a very unique problem, and one that is proving hard to distance myself from. Therefore, I feel like I should acquaint myself with the proper way to go about it, if that makes sense?

So that’s why I’m posting here- Maybe you guys can give me some anecdotal advice that I can apply to my situation. I don’t want to make things worse or anything. 

Anyway- some backstory. Will try to keep it short and sweet. 

- Him: 24yo, Her: 24yo. Married ~1yr, no children. Living on their own. 

- She has been hospitalized a number of times over the years but never diagnosed until this last time. She was released, and on medication, and seemed to be “over it” for the time being. But she doesn’t “like” taking her meds, will gag and vomit, so she stopped. Now she is full swing back to where she was ~2 weeks after release. 

She basically walks around in a daze and never knows what is going on, is always very confused and says things that are completely random/out of context. Try as I might, she’s almost impossible to communicate with. Her husband can’t even “get through” to her, she is endlessly confused and he spends most of the time just comforting her, because she’s flustered about being confused. 

I’ve learned to be careful what I say, and no longer engage in the types of conversations that the three of us have normally had over the years, which include mostly religion, philosophy, occult subjects, the universe, consciousness and so on. These things seem to set her off into deeper confusion/delusion. 

So...what CAN I say? What can he or I do? I know there’s not some magic words, but she doesn’t want to be readmitted and doesn’t want to take her meds. I told my friend about a local “schizophrenics anonymous” support group but I don’t know if they will go. 

Basically I’m just really worried about my friends and feel like everyone is helpless in this situation. Any advice welcome, thanks for reading.

schizophrenia,pinkpunkmonkey,2018/02/26,"Really nervous about starting work for the first time So recently it was decided by my therapist and my family that getting a job would be good for me. It'll get me out the house and keep my mind occupied etc etc but it's something I've never done and way out my comfort zone. 

I'm 18, only recently left school and only did a couple of weeks of voluntary work in the past so never been employed. I guess my parents are sick of me being in the house so want me to go out and do something.

 They're convincing me that it's going to be a good thing, that it'll give me some of my own money to buy things I want/need and enjoy some entertainment if I want to. Said that I should start becoming more independent. 

I already had an interview after my parents put in an application for me, it's just a retail place so it's not like the job will be difficult and the people at the interview were nice so gave me no reason to worry. It went well and they asked me to come in for a training day in the next couple of days and start working the day after fully. 

I keep having thoughts racing and my stomach ties into knots. I'm worried I'll do something that causes problems or that everyone will know I'm sick. I feel like it'll all go wrong and that I'll be looked down on and ridiculed. The idea of going out into the world longer than I need to scares me.

schizophrenia,FuriousGeorge93,2018/02/26,"Paramedic here..... Question about anti-pyschotics. So I went down the rabbit hole on Reddit on a schizophrenia thread... And found this sub. At work at times we have patients that are schizophrenic, and we see them on good days and bad. When they have been taking their meds, they have their issues but can function just fine, but invariably they stop and things always go downhill. These are the days we have to sedate and transport them, and that almost ends in an inpatient facility until they stabilize. My question is, why do people stop taking their meds when they seem to be working for them?

 I've had patients that have insurance and medications and just quit taking them. And they never seem to have an answer why. I feel for the ones that run out and don't have the means to get refills. 

Is it a side effect issue or something else. Working in EMS, it's amazing how many of our calls are mental health related and just how poor the health Care system is prepared to handle it.

I have DPDR, and I've been having bizarre thoughts that I consider delusional, including some paranoid thoughts, which I recognize as being paranoid thinking.  I'm not on any medication and I've had a psychologist and therapist tell me that I am not schizophrenic or psychotic since I recognize that the thoughts I'm having are irrational and bizarre. 

My question to all of you is that when you were having delusions prior to being medicated, did you recognize that your thinking was abnormal, or did you think there was nothing wrong with the things that you were thinking?",9.034053156146179,9.121384542635663,8.794042081949062,64.83697674418607,60.16279069767442,13.262901439645624,44.009966777408636,12.540900571622839,6.0167222591362135,582,33,93,19,7,188,72,129,0.135,0.8390000000000001,0.026,-0.9158,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,8,0,0,3,1,0,0,4,0,23,5,0,0,2,23,33,10,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,10,6,0,0,9,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,11,0,17,0,7,19,2,3,0,0,0,0,10,1,0,4,2,75,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.18524067731291485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129086714886025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19266719340549185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3824550798962598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18214108608399251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2218939010965816,0.0,0.2126461347179775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15702423515965225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1659143957214733,0.0,0.0,0.22040009926310627,0.12611051904361245,0.486525786387301,0.0,0.4520967565032662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1927753153496667,0.0,0.0,0.2075425609091302,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,sadgalmipo,2018/02/27,"Don’t feel safe around my roommate My housemates and I are all friends and have known each other for a few years, and we’ve had a subleaser for several months now (who we didn’t know before she moved in) who we think may have schizophrenia. She told us she has depression and anxiety and used to be medicated, but that she decided on her own that she didn’t need her meds and instead she just smokes weed (multiple times a day, every day). She’s a massive stoner and insists that weed helps her with her issues - but only sativa; apparently indica makes things worse.
She talks to herself every day, gets extremely angry and aggressive, and tends to have inappropriate and very intense emotional responses to things. We don’t feel entirely safe because she is so unpredictable and aggressive, and recently she got very upset with all of us, so her hostility and anger toward us have been building up a lot lately. We initially suspected that she was bipolar, because she fluctuates between what seem to be bouts of mania and depression, but we’re not really sure.

Some specific reasons I’m concerned about her:

-She’s a very angry person. Small things set her off and she becomes irrationally angry, especially because she kind of works herself up over things. Once she left her phone in an Uber, and then the next day she called the driver - who had left our area and was at least 2 hours away - to bring it back. He brought it back that day and she stuck her head in the car window and screamed at him. When he drove off she chased his car down the street.
-She talks to herself frequently, often angrily. A lot of the time she is just quietly muttering to herself. We’ll only be able to pick out certain words and many times she is angrily talking about us. And sometimes she’ll be doing something and will randomly yell out in anger, seemingly for no reason (all she’ll say is “FUCK!” or other such things).
-She records voice notes on her phone of things that upset her and then listens to them over and over?
-She often talks about how much she hates it here - sometimes about the university we attend/the place we live, and sometimes about our house specifically, because recently she got upset with all of us and hasn’t spoken a word to us in like 3 weeks.
-Before she started hating us, she used to talk NONSTOP - even if no one responded to her - and her understanding of social cues is terrible, as she can never detect when people are annoyed/uncomfortable/need her to stop talking.
-She has apparently always had a lot of trouble forming and maintaining friendships, but ALWAYS thinks it is the other person’s fault rather than her own. She always victimizes herself and it seems like she thinks the whole world is out to get her. She feels that all the people in our town, except her, are shallow, selfish, and don’t know how to communicate.
-She spends a lot of time just getting really high and then walking/biking/driving around alone. But she has also told us that she absolutely hates silence and being alone.
-A lot of the time she randomly talks about things or people we don’t know without providing context, or she’ll be so high that she just babbles incoherently about randomly things, so it’s often hard to know what she’s talking about. She seems generally disconnected from what is happening around her - I once told her to take a right at a stop sign while she was driving, and a second after she did it she asked if she was going the right way and I said yes and she laughed and said something along the lines of “How did I know to turn this way?”
-She is extremely confused and forgetful at all times. She can never remember where she puts things, and her forgetfulness of course gets her angry. She tends to blame others for moving her things around, but no one moves her stuff.
-As a result of her constant confusion, she often suddenly and very frantically searches for things. I also think she might go through our stuff, because the other day she thought she was home alone and my friend caught her going into my room while I wasn’t there.
-She is generally very slow moving and spaced out. Sometimes she’ll just be standing in one spot, motionless, for a long time.
-She’s very scared of the dark, apparently because her thoughts immediately go to things shown in scary movies and stuff (I guess like monsters? It was kind of unclear.) She even sleeps with lights on.
-There have been multiple instances where she perceived the events of a situation incorrectly? Like, she thinks things happened that didn’t happen. For example: she once slept on the living room couch, and while I was in the kitchen she woke up on her own and went to her bedroom, so I opened the blinds in the living room. She came back out and then went back into her room and started recording voice notes about how I had opened the blinds while she was sleeping and woken her up on purpose, and then she listened to them repeatedly and kept getting angrier and angrier until confronting me (yelling at me, asking why I had a problem with her).

We’re worried that the excessive weed usage may be a contributing factor to a lot of her issues because it causes her to be forgetful and causes confusion and affects her perception of things, but I’m not sure. She has exhibited a capacity to physically lash out if she gets angry enough, so living with her is very stressful, especially because she often works herself up over things so she progressively becomes angrier. I’m not sure if I was able to fully explain, but we are definitely all afraid of her and don’t quite feel safe because of how angry she is all the time - especially now that she hates all of us?

Basically, I am wondering if it sounds like we should be concerned and if so, what we can/should do about it. Also curious if weed could be making things worse. Thanks if you read through this whole thing!",7.26603102189781,7.605688714416061,6.861560218978102,76.37009580291972,63.771897810218974,10.061678832116787,33.183394160583944,9.827888789773867,3.0886832116788323,4685,176,850,88,64,1465,410,1096,0.184,0.765,0.052000000000000005,-0.9995,4,3,3,0,1,0,129.0,24,1,2,4,58,48,12,10,44,1,80,10,4,16,15,218,160,103,0,13,30,0,5,5,2,10,4,12,9,2,57,87,1,6,31,1,1,19,19,30,0,4,42,20,163,18,130,96,27,145,0,2,2,1,178,68,1,39,59,634,220,3,0.07143163494305561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11097244672059194,0.0,0.08568577898463405,0.08915526381238521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02732250260722743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127178598970748,0.06677893610983876,0.0,0.03355618620731706,0.10985303611904723,0.0,0.1959482774556969,0.07889062869607019,0.060783060148028624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03646984290621512,0.0408493803850882,0.0,0.07337996583594826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038596110410110684,0.0,0.028516174028496894,0.0,0.0,0.1382024854396596,0.0,0.061523962506653776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040175487437861306,0.0,0.0369039868879028,0.0,0.04717992119209431,0.0,0.060184233260677227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07223596181538361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05518790396317299,0.03301869773541208,0.1119602430772163,0.0,0.08119248856162349,0.0,0.05713040386799902,0.0,0.039344999581753734,0.0,0.09475013831032042,0.0,0.03199435715299706,0.1410479019384152,0.036654732739377534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023939559594044174,0.07547144418623904,0.03582587701369964,0.0,0.03517288580589425,0.04121125806469774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455606835916072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438505559705297,0.09814239616515774,0.0,0.04028899777939165,0.0,0.07761068037177297,0.0,0.0,0.08724472170481874,0.0,0.12615088468587385,0.031607374551070634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821858648274417,0.0,0.0,0.0476811710002253,0.03621023309691203,0.0,0.0,0.03967222165617252,0.035979928607994836,0.0,0.03788883821345747,0.0,0.0,0.02850802475699891,0.15184104672014115,0.02625523535620144,0.026482826101657937,0.055092480488695215,0.0,0.03798417706808485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11410853990697918,0.07260588675398567,0.054326977206941976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07428255238184278,0.0623713483856751,0.03731542753349794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034175213793742686,0.0,0.03590426133386422,0.0,0.03798816822784106,0.0357254826789689,0.0,0.045760934456070185,0.07344361764346102,0.07053012192961791,0.0,0.04045905881272645,0.06100222594554708,0.06794784251065533,0.02840265158130484,0.03575776396373374,0.0,0.0,0.13005735533514434,0.0,0.040348707639564635,0.0,0.0,0.04014607527208819,0.07148322201553046,0.036407778113270325,0.0,0.054991562413097966,0.1412954269217161,0.0,0.050559678869302106,0.0,0.0,0.05972004530927745,0.04091234824248409,0.0,0.1226581982113045,0.0,0.0,0.10098520586273152,0.0,0.02685384985026166,0.22965616953994825,0.0,0.03288232615637194,0.0,0.0,0.4033760359168512,0.1144262684712665,0.0,0.05670873915373549,0.16660944309314912,0.0,0.0,0.10238398248533226,0.0,0.0,0.038848553353855286,0.0,0.037181425573814895,0.3866555776106799,0.061693997822914376,0.0,0.20628502913905386,0.0,0.05669910694887221,0.028649074430760205,0.0,0.0,0.06621784123513949,0.03222797002801544,0.0797508694431733,0.0,0.03442877352063415,0.03873228051310117,0.052003080985210635,0.03627114632937331,0.07279493858227452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022999815462590827
schizophrenia,-HIEROPHANY-,2018/02/27,"Paranoia's a real bitch I know it takes time for medication to start working, but I just wish it'd start now. I'm trying to get a refund on a thing I was kicked out of for ""mental health concerns"", but they won't give me the refund because it's supposedly past the deadline. and there's still that little thought in the back of my head telling me they're not giving me the refund because they hate me and want me to kill myself. I know it's not true, I know it's just my brain being broken as usual. Do any of you have advice or have gone through similar things? God, I just wish this would all stop. I don't understand why people think mental illness is so trendy and fun to self diagnose, it's such a bitch to deal with. Just like these bitches who won't give me my money back.

schizophrenia,addledd,2018/02/27,"Parents think I’m crazy I was diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia (Schizoaffective disorder) a little over a year ago, after my first real episode (I thought my brother and mom were demons and attacked them) got me sent to jail for 4 months, where I had multiple episodes of completely taking myself out of the world, paranoia, hearing voices, running around naked etc. . I got out a year ago in April, and have been taking my medication (Haldol) regularly. Haven’t felt any kind of psychosis or paranoia since I started taking the meds in jail, but now any time I get really happy/ sad/ ESPECIALLY when I get angry, my parents think I’m having an episode and want to call the cops. How do I get them to realize these are all normal emotions? Anyone else deal with this? I’m 19 and about to go to school, and haven’t found another job yet since moving back, so I can’t move out. Any advice deeply appreciated!

schizophrenia,DarkTimes18,2018/02/27,"First Psychosis with delusions schizophrenic symptoms About 4 weeks ago my wife started to ask me very paranoid questions and delusional statements about me and other things. She also seemed to be questioning her sexual identity too. Very out there things like I had sexual relations with all of my siblings and parents. That I had forced her to lose weight down to our street address number.  That I had killed our pet who had died at vet office from almost 2 years ago.  That I was cheating on her but that I was also gay.  That I was colluding with estranged family members and the police to harass her.  Lots of talk about numbers and dates and referring to the date when it happened as her expiration date.  She left home on foot and wandered to hospital then has been held in mental facility for over a month now, was on involuntary now voluntary.  Wont see or talk to me and has repeated delusions to staff and other family that have called her.  For 3 weeks she wouldn't talk to any family. Dr is calling it psychotic break psychosis with delusions disorganized thoughts bizarre behavior and thoughts. 

History: 21 years old, grandmother with schizophrenia, mother alcoholic and emotional batterer.  Dad suicide when she was young.  MJ user since 18.  Found out secret LSD user for last 8 months not sure how much.  Self admitted to be very sensitive, defensive, fear of abandonment.  In last year expressed feelings of possible attraction to women too.  Was close friends with older women who was previously bi.  This woman emotionally teased and played with wife curiosity and then unfriended her. Wife has written long messages of betrayal, abandonment and anger and projection to this woman. Started to unfriend more of other close friends recently.  Stopped talking to childhood friend right around time of the LSD use.

I dont' think the current facility has her on right meds, she started on Risperdone which she had EPS from so that was quit.  Then Geodone increased a few times until it caused tremors.  Then back down to 20mg.  Seems to only help with stabilizing mood.  Wondering if Clozapine or Olanzapine havent been tried.  With 2 antipsychotic med reactions, thought Clozapine is the next in line. Dont think that any true therapy being performed currently.  Looking to transfer to a 24/7 residential for better treatment plan. 

Don't know how to feel or help.  Feel helpless but have done some things behind scenes to help as much as possible.  Brought wife letters which she wouldn't read.  She called it stalking to staff.  When discussing the delusions by family they bring up things without directly challenging thoughts that have made her question the delusions but then says well I don't know he did something.  Says she doesn't want to go home.  I know she needs more 24/7 treatment and fully supporting that.  I know it's not a quick fix just want  to make sure she gets best treatment.  I just started therapy for myself to cope as I've been my own prisoner at home.

schizophrenia,kimmykaboom,2018/02/27,"New here.. Hello, like the title says - I’m new here. I’m not schizophrenic but the man I am dating is. After a conversation about my biological father being in a mental institution he opened up and told me he was recovering from schizophrenia and was embarrassed about it. He’s on medication. I’m not judging him for something he has no control over. He said he was isolated, talking to himself but has never heard voices. 

My question is this, what can I do or not do to be a better partner to him?

schizophrenia,xHeadBand,2018/02/27,"Weight neutral APs, Geodon not working So I’ve been trying to lose the weight I’ve gained on risperidone. My doctor prescribed me Geodon, I’ve lost maybe 10 pounds but the hallucinations are back. I’m curious about your experiences with Geodon and latuda. Are there any other antipsychotics that are less likely to cause weight gain? I’m afraid since Geodon wasn’t effective latuda might be the same since they are similar. I have an appointment in a week. I’ve been on 80mg of Geodon for almost a month. How effective was latuda for you guys?

schizophrenia,treble333,2018/02/27,"Im being let down... I'm being let down by 'the service'. I am  trapped in the mental health system.

My medication has been affecting me differently the past few weeks even though I've taken it for ages.

When I meet the Dr before I leave he always says that if I have any issue to ring them up and I can speak to a Dr.

So I rang today and the receptionist was like a guard dog. Apparently the Dr shouldn't tell me I can ring up to speak to anyone. 

I may have lost my temper over the phone but they put me through to a duty social worker eventually. 

What a suprise she was not able to offer me anything other than she will talk to a doctor about it and get back to me. They have literally created a middle man. 

I have rarely asked for help but each time I have I feel like I'm being blocked and not supported.

schizophrenia,erawk210wers,2018/02/27,"Who else uses cannabis to avoid psychotic episodes from metabolizing? TLDR; I use Indica’s to give my brain something to focus on (the mellow relaxing high) so I don’t overthink into a psychotic episode/ keeping cannabinoids active in my system seems to surpress psychotic episodes. 

The long version;

So my history with weed use is rocky, but these last few years I discovered that my strategic use of cannabis has actually been the god sent medication that has been the only long term effective treatment for my psychosis. 

I began smoking in high school, and being in a state that was on the brink of medical legality at the time, I was still sourcing my bud from the street, aka who knows what the fuck I was smoking I just was a teen looking to get high. A year prior to my first use of cannabis, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I was convinced that I was an elaborate liar and I had my whole family and set of doctors fooled, and I was simply looking for attention. I began experimenting with weed and realized that hey, getting high feels pretty good. 

I smoked about an ounce every three weeks for about 6-7 months before my mother found my cannabis and demanded me to stop because she feared I would have a psychotic break. I guess a part of my elaborate lies was that I also WASNT suffering from this most likely sativa dominant high. But I was. Overtime my mood shifted from sweet and kind to bitchy, short tempered and literally became a whole new person. My paranoia was at an all time high and my delusions continued to tell me that I was self medicating and my mom just was a product of the war on drugs era. After severely fucking up my scholastic future, I was forced to become sober by my parents obsessive monitoring and disposal of bud (RIP to many ounces to the toilet). After several months of sobriety I felt anew and like medication was totally unnecessary at this point. Side note, this whole three years from diagnosis to weed dependent to sobriety was sprinkled with many many trials of different medications. Was the medications helping my psychosis induced by THC? Who knows. 

I lasted about 6 months sober and without pharma medication before I decided to give in to one little toke with friends one night. That was the same night I had my first complete psychotic break that resulted in me rushing home at 5AM to my parents screaming and hysterical about the government inevitably coming to kill me and my entire family within the hour. Luckily I snapped back rather quickly and with a good nights rest was able to bounce back- now fully aware that cannabis was NEVER to be a part of my future and that’s that. 

A year later I moved out very abruptly and maintained sobriety for an entire year before my new roommates expressed to me that there is a HUGE difference between sativa and indica strains. I began researching and realized that maybe I had missed out on the very beneficial components of strains that contained higher amounts of CBD- and I also just missed weed. So I finally gathered the courage to try my friends vaporized SFV OG. I smoked it on 420 of 2016 and had one of the best days of my life- and oddly enough I was totally fine. 

I decided that even if I didn’t plan on consistently smoking I would invest in a medicinal recommendation for cannabis so I could know exactly the source my bud came from and have the opportunity to access pure CBD or CBD dominant strains. I began slowly dabbling in hybrids and eventually falling in love with indicas. 

What I experienced was drastically different from what I recall in high school, and definitely didn’t cause me to lose my marbles temporarily. I was elated with this discovery that maybe.... I wasn’t schizo? Maybe I was just temporarily experiencing psychosis and I had outgrown it? 

I went from living life afraid of the dark, feelings of always being watched and followed/stalked melted from my existence and I was feeling better than I ever had. 

I went to visit my family and decided to use it as an opportunity for a tolerance break. Within a few days I began hearing things, having that awful feeling that someone was watching me at all time, unable to shower without my mom staying in the bathroom with me so I wasn’t alone. I was fully back to the awful place I thought I had ridden from my life entirely. I confronted my dad in a breakdown of tears and desperation about my seeming grip on reality being lost once again. He immediately blamed cannabis and said he wouldn’t consider treatment until I cut cannabis for good. So I listened and I returned home intending to never smoke again. 

My bedroom where I happily toked comfortably and with warmth before bed became a cold and empty place. The voices would repeat the same sentence on loop for hours as I tried to sleep, the shadow man who tormented my teenage years became looming over me again as I laid in bed terrified, unable to reach my phone to call my mom for reassurance. In a temporary fix, I reached for my wax pen and took a long drag on my Girl Scout cookies cartridge and almost immediately felt the warmth and comfort of my room again. I fell asleep thinking I band-aided the problem and I would deal with it after I got off work the following day. 

I got busy with work and being a waitress 60 hours a week, working 10 hour shifts at a time, I couldn’t fathom the idea of dealing with psychosis on top of it all. Quite frankly, I couldn’t afford to. My rent was due and psychosis was gone. 

I finally was able to get my own place and was ecstatic to have my dreams come true. The slight fear of being too scared to live alone never became a reality. The haunting shadow man was long gone and my home was comfortable and warm, a feeling I’d compare to “safe”. 

So I live my life until around a month ago and I have another psychotic break while I’m sober. I smoke my pure CBD strain and the psychosis fuzzy feeling melts away. I grabbed reality and held on for dear life. 

I finally googled “CBD and psychosis” and found a shocking amount of material on the correlation of psychosis being treated with CBD. I learned that my symptoms subsiding when smoking indicas wasn’t completely ludicrous. 

But here’s the thing, I believe stress is the #1 trigger to my psychosis, when I smoke indicas the High from the minimal THC in the strains almost “distracts” my brain from the delusions and auditory/visual hallucinations. The CBD I believe is what helps my anxiety (aka stress- forgot to mention earlier I suffer from crippling social anxiety. Like I have panic attacks at grocery store checkouts because I’m afraid the cashiers think I’m evil or whatever my brain is irrationally puzzling together thanks to anxiety) subside, and the high is what gives me the rational ability to disregard the psychosis. 

So far I believe that maybe weed is actually my medicine. Weed is what keeps me level and stable and capable of being a productive member of society. Whenever I start to detox, my schizophrenia comes knocking on my reality door and opens to the world of psychosis. Side note- I’m not taking pharma medications. I’m working on finding a new psychiatrist who can treat my psychosis with pills alongside my weed medicinal use. 

So my biggest question is, am I slowly digging my sanity grave and this is all one big band aid? I am highly aware of the correlation to THC and psychosis but honestly, solely smoking CBD doesn’t quite do it. The fuzzy cloudy feeling from smoking a solid indica is truly what makes life bearable. Should I give up weed all together? Should I try taking another chance at cutting out THC completely and only consuming CBD (risking another break), or is there someone else out there who can resonate with my experiences? 

I just want to give myself the chance to live my best life. I don’t want temporary medicinal cannabis use success to ruin my future. But sometimes when I have these breaks from my weed detoxes I just... I am afraid I won’t always make it out Alive. 

Thanks for any and all responses!

schizophrenia,not_frannie,2018/02/27,"My brain is a dick (I hope) I'm having a hard day. Either I've gone down the rabbit hole again, or the police are framing me for crimes I didn't commit because I told them weird crazy shit and lies while psychotic 4 years ago. It sounds crazy even to me - mind reading machine, hidden cameras everywhere, people following me around stores and sitting near me in restaurants. I'm thinking I'll be arrested after my therapy appointment on the 28th.

I'm not hallucinating a lot, which is weird if I'm as psychotic as I hope I am. I am medicated this time, which I guess could explain it. I have been hearing some radio in the distance kind of stuff, but haven't heard actual voices since I stayed up too late drinking like a monthish ago or longer.

Currently in-between doctors but hoping when I get a new one they can give me a real diagnosis whether it's schizophrenia or something else.

Question is this: I've been drooling a lot recently especially in my sleep. I recently found out it's a side effect of abilify so I was wondering if there's any way to stop the drooling.

schizophrenia,EverlmmortaI,2018/02/28,"Invasive thoughts I've never been to a doctor for this, but I'm starting to think I should see one. My main worry is that I'm schizophrenic, but I've read that my symptoms are common in other mental disorders like anxiety OCD and depression.

What symptoms you ask? Invasive repeating thoughts. The same thought/phrase over and over again and it's not me thinking it. It's not auditory but it's definitely there. 

It usually goes something like ""who? what? where? How? .. etc"" repeating. 


Another thing to add is that I only have had this happen when I smoked cannabis (I have stopped) and have a subtle anxiety attack.

I'm not sure if it's the anxiety and stress causing the intrusive repetitive thoughts or a telling sign of early schizophrenia.


I'm really calling on those of you who clearly recall early signs of schizophrenia.

schizophrenia,bro0t,2018/02/28,"introduction Hi everybody, im new here.
im bro0t and ive been hearing things since i was 15-16, just normal noises which werent really there but i still noticed and was told that ""thats normal"" and nobody did anything about it. over the years things started getting worse, the sounds turned into voices telling me to hurt people, but thought this was normal. when i was 18 i started becoming apathic and not caring about anything. im 19 now and last summer i had my first psychosis, my parents didnt understand that my thinking was different and kept yelling at me which continued when he wasnt there telling me i was a lazy piece of shit. so shit hit the fan and i broke his nose and then he kicked me out of the house. i went to a new therapist for anger control and there they found out i am sensitive to psychoses and probably have schizophrenia but my parents dont seem to understand, and think im just a lazy piece of shit. still hear them telling me that even when they arent here. 
im gonna go to a new psychiatrist specialised in psychotic disorders soon and hope they can help me out on this.
still have moments when the voices tell me to kill something and i attacked 2 cats (failed) and slashed a tire because of them.

schizophrenia,dingleberry8000,2018/02/28,"Schizotypal here. Would it make sense to ask for an alpha blocker? Diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder 6 months ago. I've been on seroquel, risperidone, abilify and truxal but now I'm off and I find that paranoid thoughts can pop up but I'm getting better and better at ignoring them. 

But I still have this ""physical"" anxiety - or is it free floating? I can  feel my adrenaline rushing all the time. It's just there for no reason. Ok, coffee makes it go up and long walks make it go down. Cigarettes probably also work. And I have nightmares. They can be very brutal like the Saw movies.

I read that alpha blockers helps with ptsd symptoms and a lot of AP's also work as alpha blockers. So maybe asking for a drug like this could help keep me grounded without all the side effects of APs? I also have massive hypertension which is being treated with 3 differents drugs. Maybe some of this is also caused by adrenaline...",3.52237636480411,6.271558427745668,4.323651252408478,81.18261239563266,77.43930635838151,7.312652536929995,28.10822093770071,8.344100000000001,2.40827835581246,740,32,127,15,18,237,118,173,0.098,0.748,0.155,0.9175,1,0,3,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,2,5,10,9,1,0,6,1,14,4,0,6,2,35,28,16,0,2,6,0,1,2,0,1,4,0,0,1,11,9,0,5,5,1,1,4,2,2,0,0,3,2,10,8,19,21,4,18,0,0,1,0,7,8,0,3,8,85,21,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11700647820325903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42222857213505866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009765686883251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467968592029597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23347944774296345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355962385125833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053880549271158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13397314820811715,0.0,0.1379077123950481,0.15127883658150512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3061468776994705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667411370114468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.120641940716155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896245522093072,0.0,0.15003272240607496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17694825532393313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732409800449435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1289731436473916,0.0,0.0,0.116812294733556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11221826783980723,0.0,0.0,0.2643250386608306,0.0,0.26521542061173203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535793742708274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152538044370723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14231399893533295,0.0,0.15429624510865084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13203170688698998,0.0,0.0,0.13571385843206585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10541216564318028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13719437074809324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10479006950246857,0.07696792144402945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891051292917388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272394210822214,0.0,0.19218930105321394,0.0,0.0,0.09376616194270257,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,waycaster2,2018/02/28,"Early symptoms I want to know everyone's early symptoms and when they first suspected that something separated them from the general population.

I was diagnosed bipolar 6 years ago when I was 16. I've always had auditory hallucinations but it was never anyone talking to me. Last night I got really bad paranoia and I heard something say in a deep voice, ""welcome to the dark lands"" it sounded almost external but I still had the attachment that it was my thought if that makes sense.

I haven't been to a psychiatrist since I was 16 and I need to go back. This isn't me claiming I have schizophrenia but I feel I connect with you guys and I want to hear your upbringing.

Edit: I forgot to add I'm going back to a psychiatrist in spring.

I have so many questions, I would prefer to speak with someone who has dated/is dating while diagnosed with schizophrenia and want to know how you made it work. Of course, that chapter of my life is behind me, but this has been picking at my brain and I really just need to pick at someone’s to understand the nuances of their life.

Love you all and if you need to talk pm me or whatever.♡",-0.0351136363636364,2.216144806818185,2.2800000000000007,92.965,89.56818181818181,4.563636363636364,21.63636363636364,6.11248444174946,0.3269181818181819,325,12,69,3,11,110,63,88,0.018000000000000002,0.7909999999999999,0.191,0.9502,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,1,2,0,1,1,5,0,0,4,0,8,4,2,0,1,11,16,5,0,2,4,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,0,1,5,3,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,4,6,14,4,5,12,1,10,0,1,1,1,8,3,0,3,7,44,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16171548303128452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14915566379453593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694148770335785,0.1652255888208532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19672559089845307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2462005353638651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11299111737726372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087381061599292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335256124406476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714902663486186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20194368807399085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17804968489670492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18589310262728928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6576756512229359,0.0,0.2569592067118221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079473762536558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14893593548166867

schizophrenia,late8,2018/03/01,"Anyone else get tortured in their dreams Like just last night I was paralysed with something squeezing my spine, it was really painful.

I've had others; the worst being my soul being torn apart.

But the thing is if I prey to the sun before I sleep ""to protect me from the fallen angels in going to sleep and in sleep"" then I'm fine, every single time works without fail

Also if I do drugs like Codiene I have to meditate for 10 mins a pentance for doing the drug, or I get tortured, this builds day so if I use twice in a row I'll have to meditate 20 mins the 2nd day etc etc.

It's a system I have worked out with the angels, are my 'multiple personalitys' just extremely intelligent or is this something most schizophernics can't relate to?

Like there always directing me in a good direction, like yesterday there's this kid who keeps wanting to fight me and I thought about how easy it would be to kill him and make it look like an overdose, (not that I ever actually would) I justified it by him being a useless annoying junkie then I had the worst torture session I've had in a while until I apologised for the bad thoughts, reflected on why they where wrong, prayed then I was allowed to sleep

Is this weird to you? Does anyone else have contact with intelligent entities? Like nearly all mine are good ones so I'm pretty sweet, it's like there my sprit guides

I can't ever talk to them because the bad ones are always mimicking the good ones so it's a useless battle trying to identify a good voice vs bad but I'm just saying I'm dealing with intelligent beings or intelligent concious multiple personalitys, either way you look at it it comes down to the same thing

The good ones really seem to like me and protect me a lot which I am forever grateful for because I couldn't deal w/ the bad ones all the time

But can anyone relate to the intelligence of these things?",5.340020325203252,6.096980620596206,6.043648373983737,79.1171798780488,67.99728997289972,9.185230352303524,29.46714092140921,9.2995712137729,2.448410027100272,1495,52,287,28,24,489,188,369,0.114,0.711,0.17600000000000002,0.97,1,0,4,0,1,0,24.0,0,2,3,3,15,34,7,0,26,0,30,8,5,4,4,46,47,23,1,7,16,0,1,8,0,2,3,2,0,3,21,10,0,3,4,1,0,3,5,19,0,6,8,6,34,15,40,31,11,34,4,3,2,0,17,13,0,9,24,200,55,4,0.0,0.0,0.0800370033754061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06558916396863518,0.1364898419819725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720451013765895,0.1680727268129756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27392390643539605,0.0999939068202366,0.0,0.06979063759132187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07065059725254395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10578868028964636,0.16911236361246634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07177384683969673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19022793894197465,0.0,0.13702977374476735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829418246468659,0.0,0.14837859363258288,0.06910306921004422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08570125437590613,0.0,0.0466122923931594,0.3439608836689566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07290069890417113,0.09073993356461016,0.0,0.0,0.06685500419855774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3205558780056501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377476642841721,0.0,0.0,0.06972813168377426,0.0,0.0,0.05474715022742231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769676316873636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778850509283062,0.0,0.08727213501698135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14322859562074572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08344102742603443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10508469908181838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06522340791384854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07466542265374257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283059213798198,0.0,0.0,0.12628176974329422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06592235756121899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16346584645635145,0.0,0.0,0.13022506773764395,0.09564983429501664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05568432795685863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083656915484307,0.0,0.0,0.048375898140644004,0.06510147424600632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07400780977632818,0.0,0.0,0.07906170073176898,0.0,0.11941906741227824,0.0,0.0,0.11652540024510323,0.08967298591747466,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,runnergirl_2,2018/03/01,"Am I starting to get Schizophrenia? When I was a young kid, I heard voices. They said little things like hey, my name, stop, no, and yes. It never turned into more than that. I always thought it was normal and but didn’t talk about it until recently. I’ve had some visual hallucinations as well, but definitely not as much as the voices. Recently, I started hearing voices again and I’ve started getting delusions, like the world around me isn’t real and that something/someone is watching me all the time. It started as a “what if” with these ideas but gradually got much worse. It is disturbing, but isn’t threatening id say right now. 

Other info: one of my aunts, one uncle, and my grandma had schizophrenia. A few others had depression and anxiety as well. Also, I’m 15 right now.

schizophrenia,lookingforhelp101101,2018/03/01,"Question on diagnosis Going to try and summarize this the best I can. Any help is GREATLY APPRECIATED. Last year around this time I was out in the city and became completely belligerent. I vaguely remember getting into a serious verbal altercation at around 4 am. I woke up the following morning under a tree with my ID missing and this sent me into an irrational sense of thinking that I was being followed due to what had happened the night before. This came with other delusions, that the wind was God's language, that I was destined to give a speech at the reflection pool, thought certain TV channels could use the screen as a camera and react to how I was acting, and briefly thought that certain people were capable of reading my thoughts. I also started to believe there was a strong significance in numbers. I came to the realization on my own that all of these things were false. Since then I have been pretty up and down. I'm extremely socially awkward and sometimes I really struggle with auditory processing. I also really struggle with explaining myself verbally ( I could never put this all together verbally). I'm 24 and for about 3-4 months I have been fine besides feelings of deja vu and what they call ""mind pops"". I now am experiencing little specs of ""light dots"" in my vision whenever I am concentrating on something and while I am driving I will misinterpret an object. I haven't been diagnosed, and I was just wondering what you guys thought about this. Thanks again.

schizophrenia,SweetEstablishment,2018/03/01,"[QUESTION] [25/M] Recently involuntarily hospitalized and was diagnosed with Schizophrenia with Psychotic Disorder -- Backstory and Questions In mid-January my apartment was broken into by my family and I was forcibly brought to a prominent mental hospital in my area.  This was because
I had told them I would go get mental evaluation the next day, something they had been asking me to do ever since around early November, when I had left
a full time job I had had.  My family really freaked out about this and started doing weird stuff such as breaking into my apartment to yell at me.

So anyway they got drunk and decided to break in.  They dragged me to the car and drove me down the the hospital.  Upon arriving
at the medical campus, my family also called the police and told them I was crazy, to force me into the ER.  To my surprise the police officers believed them 
without any real proof, and I was basically forced through the metal detector into the ER and they would not let me go.  
The doctor at the ER made me go to the mental health unit even though I said I felt fine.  Next thing I know I have an involuntary stay at the 
hospital.

So, I'm at the mental hospital as an involuntary patient.  I keep telling them that everything is fine and nothing is wrong with me.  Apparently, the doctord
did not think so because after 4 days she still would not let me go and I was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  I really don't know why.

Thus, I was presented with a moral dilemma.  I could either fight against my involuntary stay in court, or I could accept the diagnosis
and become a voluntary patient.  I ended up accepting the diagnosis even though I did not agree with it or my involuntary stay.  This was because
if I accepted the diagnosis I could potentially get access to SSDI, and I would avoid any probate on my record from losing in court.

All that happened was that the system played me, and I got lucky enough to be able to play the system a little bit with that diagnosis.  What is a 25 yo
guy gonna do when he gets that diagnosis?  I was pretty hysterical about it I thought it was funny and in great spirits because I knew I could get db with it.

All in all, I left the hospital feeling 10 times more confused, sad, and hopeless than when I get there.  I felt a significant
breach of trust with my family, the police, and the medical system in this country.  I didn't receive any actual help, such as medication or counseling, all
I got was a diagnosis and a good luck.  My first experience with the American hospital system. Just not at all what I expected.  But hey, I got this diagnosis now let's play the cards.  It's like getting pocket aces.  

So that about covers the backstory and what happened at the hospital.  Now, I have a few questions about how I should proceed: 

* Is it reasonably easy to get my medical record amended, and have  ""cannabis use disorder"" removed?  They put it on there despite me saying I use cannabis 4 times a year
and asking them if it will go on my record and she said no.
* Will I qualify for disability?  I do genuinely feel disabled and entitled to SSDI, what is the likelihood I would receive it if I applied, appealed etc?
* Do you think I actually have schizophrenia?  Or was it a mis-diagnosis?  Should I get a second opinion, or ride the potential benefits of having schizophrenia?
* I've been abandoned by my support group (family) that had originally forced me to go into the hospital, once they learned of my diagnosis.  Is this normal?
* Is it normal to have bad experiences at the hospital?  I felt that everything in my life was fine beforehand, now I'm considering disability and am severely depressed
about the whole situation, not to mention my family/friends abandoned me.
* People have called me ""crazy"" since I was about 12 or so.  Is this normal?  I guess I really am ""crazy"" now. 
* I don't have hallucinations, delusions, or hear voices.  **Should I maybe just ignore all this unlucky bullshit and go on with my life as regular?**  I really feel like this is all blown out of proportion and the only reason I went along
with the diagnosis was the potential to get disability and because I would get a probate on my record if I lost in court.

So yea, with this diagnosis, I can basically say ""fuck everything"" and peace out, probably get disability and ride a mis-diagnosis for free cash and benefits from the government. I have 
a very cheap living situation and savings, so I would be able to work part time and still have a comfortable life.  No more 50 hour work weeks with 24/7 on-call and working on the weekends.
And since my family disowned me, I won't even have to deal with them anymore either.  I can just live the high life with almost no worries.  

Or, I can fight against the mis-diagnosis, try to get my family back on my side, and get another full time job.  I don't really want to do any of those things,
sounds like a lot of effort for zero payoff.  Also I would not receive any medications for my schizophrenia if I do end up having it.

schizophrenia,teabaggin4trump,2018/03/01,"I faked being crazy for disability I was on SSDI and even told the adjudicators. That I was faking being crazy so I could play video games and get drunk. This was back in the late 90s. 

There was debate between two different reviews. Originally declared bi polar.  But I was never manic or depressed. I was told that I have delusions about reality.

 I am perfectly fine now that I decided to participate in society. I make 80k plus a year married with kids. 

But my question is, is it possible to fake being schizophrenic? Wouldn't pretending to be crazy be the same as being crazy? I have auditory and shadow vision hallucinations semi frequently , but I think they are side effects of the heavy LSD usage I had. That originally gave the appearance of the Bi Polar diagnosis. Plus I find them entertaining.  

I know many things still like how to project myself through mirrors and I can basically hear peoples thoughts. Its most likely just simple deduction of the scenarios I am in since people are easily able to be studied in their repetitive, predicable sheep like social media interactions.


Also as far as paranoia , I used to joke that I intentionally did stuff to have people want to kill me. So its not some delusional thought. In all seriousness I know there are people that want me dead. But they are to chicken shit to confront me. I have had some affiliations with questionable groups.

 Also I had to go through a thing with the FBI indirectly implying that I could be a possible suspect for profile they were investigating. Which ironically is something I used to joke about and my so called friends would always make jokes about me being serial killer. 

Anyway lol... Maybe there is more to life then we want to admit. I remember as a teen being commited at a Catholic run Hospital. While I was being processed, looking up at a picture of St Michael and thinking , these motherfuckers believe in people flying around with bird wings and huge ass swords . ..and I'm fucking crazy?

schizophrenia,Namgoong,2018/03/01,"Stressing Out I’m a 20 year old male and I’m pretty sure this is my anxiety/ocd being over active, but i wanted to see what you guys thought. 

My mom has pretty severe Psychosis/schizophrenia, and I have really bad anxiety about the disease. 

I feel like I’ve been having auditory hallucinations, but I don’t know for sure. I’ve been hearing things like a ringtone after a class/the gym that sounds just like sonic getting hit and loosing coins from sonic the hedgehog. Also whistling when I hear background music. I also hear pretty distant base occasionally, like the base you hear from cars sometimes. 

I have been super sensitive to whispering recently, but I have yet to hear voices. My psychiatrist believes that I don’t have schizophrenia or psychosis, but that hasn’t really calmed my worrying. 

I guess my question is, how did the disease start with you? Should I seek a secondary diagnosis?

schizophrenia,WayyCold,2018/03/01,"Here are the supplements and medications that have changed my life First for context I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 with auditory hallucinations/schizoaffective disorder 4 years ago and made a full recovery within 2 years!  

EPA XTRA fish oil: 1060mg EPA/260mg DHA  
Helps even out the emotional lows and lots of other beneficial effects that add up  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4999787/  

Uridine mono phosphate: 600mg  
This is not specifically for schizophrenia but rather anhedonia which is characterized by low motivation, inability to experience pleasure and depression sound familiar? Very similar to negative symptoms.  

N-A-C: 600mg  
This reduces stress and the effect is surprisingly noticeable. Aids in treatment when combined with an anti psychotic.  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5024434/ 
   
  
ZMK multi: basically a good multi  
  

L-Tyrosine:500mg  
Helps with things like motivation, however I mainly take it to replenish dopamine from my adderall use  

Adderall: 10mg 3X a day 5 times a week  
Helps with negative symptoms and inattention, however I strongly caution using this as it can lead you straight to psychosis and it is considered to mimic the effects of schizophrenia when abused. That being said it has greatly improved the quality of my life.
  
zyprexa: 2.5MG  
Extremely low maintenance dose that has no side effects for me also KILLS psychosis if it ever happens to me either from adderall+stress or using psychedelics like LSD and shrooms (Extremely high risk) though I've never had problems with psychedelics I always take a minimal dose and my use is roughly once every few months
  
Zoloft: 50mg  
This is completely anecdotal butI feel like this is the best antidperessent for schizo as it also lowers social anxiety which I developed to a severe extent when I started hearing voices  

Phenibut: 1-2X a week 1g  
This is mostly for when I go out with friends makes socialization fun and unstressful. This thing is like a second anti psychotic, if I stay up late I get auditory hallucinations because the adderall. With phenibut that doesn't happen ever.  consistent long term use not only ruins the effect but causes severe dependence (use twice a week MAX).  

Kratom:1g 3-4 times a week  
I use this to ease physical anxiety useful for adderall crash specifically. Causes dependence with consistent use. Withdrawals are generally mild but very greatly some people experience a withdrawal similar to benzos which is fucking horrible. One thing I will say is that while it helps with physical pain and anxiety it also crosses into emotional territory like most painkillers. Extreme dependence will numb you physically and emotionally.
  
Wish you guys the best, i've been able to regain my cognition back, something that I felt was hopeless.",8.324584541062801,11.052843613043482,7.632028985507251,63.10338164251209,62.8695652173913,11.285024154589374,39.95169082125604,11.151842621240363,5.590161835748793,2282,125,307,71,36,711,261,460,0.159,0.657,0.184,0.909,3,0,1,0,1,1,68.0,0,3,0,12,14,28,2,2,21,0,26,14,0,24,3,72,50,29,1,5,10,0,3,5,1,2,13,5,0,1,30,26,0,0,9,0,0,3,7,13,0,4,7,9,22,15,41,40,12,43,0,6,0,1,14,14,1,10,30,193,52,3,0.07024110279479806,0.08322422090170782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622644995219614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16851535358276565,0.05844622442269792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16120275413900284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0540110723246774,0.0,0.042818324309363616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14742740770295262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14431392274502874,0.07430577311903849,0.0,0.07364645988744073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04529970040119434,0.0,0.0604985589118634,0.07129324077312181,0.0,0.0,0.0805023892065973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370353593505376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0463935859363463,0.12707419771384382,0.059181158578539714,0.0,0.0,0.1374185534884161,0.0,0.0,0.035516012082044204,0.0501802578714397,0.06744247395886517,0.0,0.0,0.059747046154571236,0.0,0.0,0.05426810177867188,0.06493676768373953,0.03669807711567653,0.0,0.03991963742513285,0.05891490445772676,0.0,0.1548821276082824,0.0,0.06954973505730001,0.12422795045327115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916682781759263,0.0,0.1883245223378078,0.07421358160685426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07771137315725482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923502343961844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09922673636032653,0.1715812740519524,0.0,0.0,0.062161165614795226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05971647375053118,0.0,0.06646382982325218,0.046886481546629735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07076052132695461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05606577811159786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05417426870198012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07996996108677228,0.0,0.07480448205485786,0.047597189107783634,0.05342152386075887,0.07474148573963749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048696336498270584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06721124910648152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06681537380854365,0.05585854421385377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587049056462029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14320391725728154,0.0,0.05407503260123105,0.0,0.0,0.04971701408713007,0.07486766970314405,0.0,0.0,0.1609218918630548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1460148012834133,0.1056251353771752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13999520270081456,0.0,0.06901152686233086,0.0,0.08191630380726475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5459918426507184,0.0,0.1159125320981798,0.0,0.0,0.22537270313592145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08077380170989064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09046593450966704
schizophrenia,comrade_toastboy,2018/03/02,"I need advice on what to do next Hi, I’m 19F and have been diagnosed with Bipolar I, but perhaps this question might be better fit for this subreddit. Recently I think I may have experienced a psychotic episode, but I don’t know for sure as I have not been to a doctor. For the weeks prior I was feeling empty or would get intensely, energetically depressed and couldn’t focus. Then I lost interest in a lot of my relationships and school and I started to get more delusional, but still functional. 
By Monday was very disconnected from everything and paranoid and delusional, i felt like multiple different people. I couldn’t do school work or anything, because thinking and organizing was too hard, and I was too afraid to do anything, so I’d just lay around in bed. I kept having freak outs over mundane or irrational things and couldn’t care for myself. Now I’m better, but it still gets worse when I’m alone. Sometimes the noise will push suicide or just irrational things but I can’t stop it. I don’t know what to do or where to go now. Sleeping has been hard too. I struggle to go sleep and constantly wake up, then wake up earlier. When I do sleep i usually have nightmares. 
If this question would be better fit elsewhere, let me know. Any advice is appreciated!

schizophrenia,dictormagic,2018/03/02,"Just got diagnosed Hello all,

I am 20 years old and yesterday I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. While the diagnosis wasn't the best news I have heard, it was kind of expected. I was prescribed Abilify and Wellbutrin. 

Has anyone else been prescribed these medicines and can tell me what to expect? I know everyone reacts differently, but this is my first experience with mental health and that type of thing so I am scared of going at it blind. Also, any words of encouragement? A year ago I had a 3.9 GPA and was Princeton bound for graduate school. Now my GPA is 3.0, and my future is uncertain (I was accepted to graduate school, but not Princeton and I'm not even sure if I can graduate this semester anymore). Which really depresses me.

Thanks and good luck!",3.9155015197568375,6.615703007092204,4.7406940222897695,79.01250000000002,75.66666666666667,9.134954407294833,27.80192502532928,9.606745405546679,3.0741201621073966,608,25,108,18,14,196,95,141,0.131,0.7509999999999999,0.117,-0.2938,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,2,5,11,0,2,4,0,17,4,0,1,2,28,23,14,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,9,10,0,1,2,0,0,1,3,3,0,1,10,2,14,8,10,13,2,11,0,1,1,0,4,1,0,3,9,76,23,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15768568407100916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14225580124671186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209689467449342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17641564749265135,0.12438240437908415,0.18226578121908235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866809483167539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1532134156793896,0.3611021859088008,0.0,0.18585357239711744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14860137772177756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11749238155041493,0.0,0.0,0.16997821150569375,0.0,0.17400716923153434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15131019949470145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10109701970749001,0.1492027894340994,0.14227211575997714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1890850729756716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18524145681112827,0.09776178988989813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17926779230063775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866619993073177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11395867215049628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17809545844348146,0.36006134945536405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16765595813330014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15548067605539231,0.1637740256199077,0.0,0.0,0.11817991243818017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2291061981996413
schizophrenia,Legolasthe44,2018/03/02,"I lost my best friend, and I’m confused My best friend killed himself last weekend. I never knew he was struggling with Schizophrenia. How easy is it to hide? We spent so much time together and everything mostly seemed normal. A month before he ended his life he messaged me and said “hey if I needed somewhere safe to stay, could I stay with you? I feel like my name is about to get taken, I guess I’m just livin in batshit country.”

I have been obsessively researching the illness now and I wish so badly I had known more before. I told him he could stay with me but I didn’t think twice about it. Fast forward a month later and I get a call from his sister that he had ended his life. I didn’t know but I guess things had gotten pretty bad; he wasn’t sleeping or eating and his delusions were severe. His girlfriend took him to his parents where he ended up having a psychotic break. It all happened so fast, but I am assuming he has been struggling with this for longer and hid it. He was insanely smart and independent, the greatest musician I’ve ever heard and he loved people with such fierce passion. 

I have been having symptoms of schizophrenia the last week but I’m positive I am just obsessing over it because I’ve never had symptoms before this. It’s like I want to feel it, I need to know why I lost my best friend, and why it seemed to happen so fast. He was about to turn 21. Everything I look at reminds of him, every song, every noise. I miss him deeply and I feel sick about what he had to deal with. I just want to talk to him one more time, and have him play and sing me his favorite song: The Grand Optimist by Dallas Green.

schizophrenia,jackp2017,2018/03/02,"Thought I would share this project I'm working on So I'm schizophrenic, obviously, and I've recently been working on a feature-length screenplay (""Florida Girls""). I'm lucky enough to have some family members with pretty hefty connections in the film industry, so for better or worse, this will be read by Hollywood gatekeepers.

https://www.scribd.com/document/372778121/Florida-Girls-First-6-Pages

So yeah, if you're interested, check out these first six pages and let me know what you think.

schizophrenia,ShakyMD,2018/03/02,"Speaking in front of school soon. Help, please. I’m two weeks, I am set to speak in front of my entire school about my struggles with depression as a bigger part of an outreach day the school leadership is planning. I intend to discuss the struggle that is depression, tell my personas story, and finally send two big messages about mental illness to my school. I’d like to first address those who may suffer from mental illness and help them to know that there can be hope. That I understand how much it forces you to feel worthless and isolate yourself, but that if we all can learn to help one another, we can begin to not be alone. The other is to address those who may hold a stigma against mental illness or simply don’t know how to help at all. I would love it if y’all here at r/schizophrenia could give me some feedback and overall relay to me what some of the most important things need to be addressed in regard to mental health. Especially considering the high stigma and misunderstanding of schizophrenia.

Here’s a few questions to guide your feedback if you’d like to answer them. If not, feel free to share some thoughts and ideas with me it’d be much appreciated. Love y’all. It’s hard. I know.

1. As a person who suffers from mental illness, what does it help to hear? What helps to give you hope?
2. How can others help?
3. What’s one thing you think people need to better understand about mental illness and schizophrenia?
4. What do you wish for in the future for the mental health community?
5. What do you think I really need to relay to other people who may be suffering from mental illness?

Thank you. Hope to see some good responses.",3.421377497371189,5.827414823343853,3.904501577287068,85.88964405888541,75.84542586750787,6.24559411146162,24.762250262881174,7.3011,1.1925984016824391,1317,45,244,16,30,413,153,317,0.128,0.667,0.205,0.9866,0,1,0,0,0,0,36.0,2,10,2,3,10,20,0,2,12,0,23,10,0,4,2,57,49,18,0,13,8,0,3,2,0,4,8,3,3,1,26,11,0,1,14,0,1,3,3,8,0,5,1,7,27,13,46,36,11,20,0,6,1,2,39,9,0,17,9,170,53,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07714980493588823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810989768658172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588088956575515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947468931695126,0.0,0.0,0.048040279855099316,0.0,0.12831730343538886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06518723324679812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07532937942845677,0.0,0.0,0.08160082024552083,0.0,0.06336167330822925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14291635814698234,0.0,0.062479188001671876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672895352891693,0.0,0.0,0.15836006642456027,0.08395632928948332,0.0,0.3495063915209338,0.07870341741484302,0.0,0.22195794529786486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08409082966544668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12281427055910504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278469703197385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344613644730235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6005521017550843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10951833609887836,0.16570152640992022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10095352793961188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066606965801093,0.0,0.10328481701098967,0.06504232587110646,0.0,0.08176831872843979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08344652919592073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04772059107418069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3015538895764901,0.05935937042900246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15574751473733625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06510807490085538,0.06858094393078598,0.0,0.0,0.09897650030876247,0.09546114791171867,0.0,0.05913722225418446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14553300066706426,0.15509470044292256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05975187271914292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085660523242691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052915990847747535,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,AllesKomtGoed,2018/03/03,Need help with a friend. I need some advice for a friend of mine. She has schizophrenia and some other mental instabilities. She can change between personas and she is constantly fighting with whats going on in her head. She is strong enough and knows how to deal with it. The problem is she isnt her usual self lately and there are a lot of things that seem off about her. At the moment she doesnt have any medical help or medication. I'm really scared something has taken over and I really wanna help her. But the distance (physical and emotional distancing) makes it very hard. Can someone help me or some advice how to help her. ,3.2301790633608825,5.75620049586777,3.9458057851239663,84.73264807162536,77.09917355371901,7.008539944903582,22.480027548209367,8.07648339933343,1.3177101928374657,504,15,94,9,12,160,78,121,0.075,0.7390000000000001,0.185,0.9289,0,0,1,0,2,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,4,6,1,1,6,0,11,3,1,3,0,25,19,11,0,4,3,0,1,0,2,0,2,0,0,1,6,9,0,0,2,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,1,1,15,3,16,18,5,10,0,0,0,0,21,5,0,7,4,71,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916579901757422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014837207096998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15786898042896294,0.0,0.0,0.16126811649345602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538529177575357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16786730889372578,0.0,0.15419782960700196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305944622604037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848126894434383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13368367075484205,0.0,0.15315635815732134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5001394757647649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820146859853704,0.0,0.16834159500148685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12687276412165907,0.0,0.0,0.09961434659740208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006735785821742,0.15039200601161098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213091132478114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14279605640868656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19120526991698408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494085073126512,0.0,0.0,0.1358563369997282,0.1556828160089185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12644484007630158,0.11488703912337067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914393363001896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1643593304824542,0.12313305207096052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What if schizophrenia is actually the most fun and wonderful thing you can get in this world
But because this gene is so strong and beautiful, the devil sends at a certain age (12-30) demons to enter the body of the person, so that he will not get pleasure from it
And the women give schizophrenics, prescription drugs that destroy his body and turn him into a kind of demon?

My life was heaven, at the age of 14 I got a Demon in my body and They called it schizophrenia even though I had it at the age of 0, and then the women gave me a shot that turns me into a demon ..

Antipsychotic takes all the pleasures and emotions and you want to burn them all after you take it",8.155685714285719,6.377059273333337,7.949809523809524,76.23300000000002,62.93333333333333,10.971428571428573,32.09523809523809,9.606745405546679,2.6799238095238085,601,16,118,9,7,193,90,150,0.099,0.753,0.14800000000000002,0.8158,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,3,2,1,4,11,1,0,16,0,6,6,3,0,3,19,17,14,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,3,11,10,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,4,0,0,4,0,13,7,19,12,3,15,6,2,0,0,15,8,0,3,5,84,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.1740403156398267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10871828261377042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5943077850556311,0.0,0.0,0.182111568700508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2068251504975024,0.0,0.0,0.20061564453214648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11779608540614805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18635721895224064,0.17108607474395482,0.0,0.0,0.14263987228639566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18572028398215654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259713048147586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15572515798450956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26818852685793393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11848539347962353,0.0,0.17522438820395314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879792414356849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519330093191492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934090141744732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,ManicMadeline,2018/03/03,"Help?! Do I have to hear external voices to be schizophrenic? Hi everyone, I've never been on here before but I was really hoping yall could help me. I'm not asking anyone to diagnose me, but if you can help me clear this up it might help me sleep tonight at least. When I was 20 I attempted suicide and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and then possibly bipolar disorder. I did not stick with therapy for long enough to find out for sure. I'm now worried I actually have schizophrenia.

For the past 6 months I've been having worse are worse episodes of what I would describe as hallucinations and/or maybe delusional or intrusive thoughts. Hallucinations like seeing dark shadow figures or monsters mostly, sometimes seeing and hearing cats that can't be there, or hearing a woman screaming. I think they are all in pain and trying to contact me for some reason. I also see the future or maybe an alternate dimension where I see terrible stuff happen to my friends or just people near by to me. Like a man falling onto the train tracks and being crushed but when I look back he's still safe and alive. Its scary because I don't know why I'm seeing this stuff and my girlfriend tells me its not really happening.

I think I might have schizophrenia or am developing it now and it was misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder a few years ago. But, I don't have voices outside my head talking to me. Their are plenty of voices in there but I'm pretty sure they are in my brain and not coming from outside. 

They all sound like people having phone conversations where you can't hear the other end of the line. Like they are waiting for me to talk back but I never do. They tell me to do things really horrible and scary things that I don't want to do but I don't know how much longer I can put up with them. 

I guess I just need to know, if someone could be considered schizophrenic without having external voices talking to them? Because that seems like its a big part of it, but I don't really understand this at all. I can't see a therapist right now or for awhile so it would really put my mind at ease to know that these symptoms might not be schizophrenia or if they are a can at least deal with that and try to understand until I can get a diagnosis from a professional.",4.7996853837471765,6.165373101580138,5.498001551918738,80.30187817437927,69.67720090293454,8.968651241534987,28.516436230248303,9.354420925462401,2.455927821670429,1816,65,345,38,32,589,207,443,0.134,0.743,0.122,-0.8323,0,0,0,0,0,1,31.0,0,3,9,1,18,14,0,0,14,0,49,11,3,2,8,83,84,40,1,10,27,0,0,5,2,5,8,10,0,2,23,18,0,2,13,0,0,4,16,4,0,0,8,17,51,10,49,64,11,41,0,1,7,0,36,17,0,19,25,254,74,1,0.0,0.0,0.07123877666208077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06471128270887842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05837914472507561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055845824809900864,0.0,0.0,0.051044233858035866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06824639786099106,0.0,0.0,0.11226704775420568,0.0,0.08900187782048641,0.0,0.06211876300706355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149363773711922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288418989288602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11657125863886475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07526117541956236,0.06287594663544167,0.14818964560292974,0.0,0.0,0.16733171893081267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06465751874247541,0.07542989806444501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06975590817833009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06672190165974425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05640065371496623,0.0,0.03814018680527825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041920556746572,0.0,0.1291096866407919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07492043508765309,0.0,0.3291112602141708,0.0,0.19572503592866716,0.0,0.0,0.07250680176004975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16047850788641815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17832383489743134,0.0,0.0,0.06460388813040463,0.06130273921948684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14667931490208602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23232865431877125,0.07371054242812031,0.0,0.058268972617264665,0.0,0.053664384083809545,0.05412956815138307,0.11260626663462008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07767857207417779,0.0,0.0,0.07905333661662832,0.06968803870901008,0.1012198739962504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08229804149469455,0.0,0.07426860660158571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14677301835809745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2338326365549553,0.07505753523539095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06234274495535879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3490356958088671,0.06645767763019833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305406007117693,0.0,0.06185379795577474,0.0,0.07220019128320093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0582989639260928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671381363383269,0.07985161668153032,0.0,0.13760579685478913,0.07587634332625577,0.0,0.17602713404877088,0.12761277655943962,0.0,0.08348339370733474,0.08476018159435979,0.0969976922046229,0.09355262121569594,0.0,0.05795490913654716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912623500633616,0.0,0.0,0.15199393764379193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0430580813639991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06587235415569867,0.0,0.0,0.07037068610049246,0.0,0.0,0.07413640370661524,0.14878920300799356,0.10371611396524703,0.0,0.0,0.047010469115817057

schizophrenia,xxxxx4839472984,2018/03/04,"Psychosis that goes away Hi... Sorry if this is weird but I am just wondering if this happened to anyone else here.
I have a weird experience... I don't know what it is. I was very scared as a kid and I would do weird things like take a bath in the middle of the night convinced I would die if I didn't and I prayed for weird things like not to turn into a beast despite not believing in any religions. I saw lizards and rats on the walls (I do not live anywhere where lizards are common). I was put in a psychiatric hospital at age 8 for trying to stab myself (I wasn't suicidal at all I just heard someone tell me to stab myself and I attempted it) and was put on risperdal for psychotic symptoms. I was on it for a few years after that along with zoloft (anxiety) but I got off of it and didn't have any psychotic symptoms after that for a long time (and anything I did was few and far between). I was in a hospital for mental health a few other times too but I don't remember why at all (my memory sucks sorry). 

I am older now and I am a bit concerned about this stuff coming back. (I have not had any hallucinations except for a few...) I do not know what that was or why that happened to me, it was just written off as ""psychotic symptoms"". I already mentioned it to a psychiatrist and he said it was weird but didn't really give me any answers and he wasn't concerned. Was that psychosis? What could cause something like that? I am diagnosed with asd but no psychotic disorders to my knowledge. Was I misdiagnosed? I'm very confused...",2.3379723502304124,4.28751006451613,3.839470046082952,87.25491935483872,77.38709677419354,7.267281105990782,25.587557603686644,8.192908349453996,1.5950138248847932,1200,45,250,22,28,397,142,310,0.123,0.818,0.06,-0.9527,0,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,1,9,12,1,2,15,0,36,6,0,1,2,47,52,22,2,6,18,0,0,3,0,2,6,2,1,1,24,16,0,0,6,1,0,3,13,8,0,0,23,3,33,4,40,26,7,33,1,0,1,0,9,18,1,6,15,188,57,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544845325316725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3092245679525813,0.0,0.08696471305534656,0.0,0.0,0.07948753851706207,0.11647835863374308,0.09354876473857048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680588622138787,0.08741272625795712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280781724094973,0.0,0.0,0.12410886626684328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11678043853944645,0.0,0.09792505614104953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09076404630550088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153825738226675,0.11798165375678098,0.0,0.1302868654139398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949648609408499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112006287029324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10905199419822033,0.0,0.0,0.09092009708148696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20105329072678646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12083627982739482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124950857449045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16661458061267356,0.0,0.10038131980526499,0.10060301934199907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11456247060425695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668076346314696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285591352483011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07282617173333115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12877701910100356,0.0,0.10813549387503646,0.0,0.1138132815763494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963205003940362,0.08751624099864139,0.0,0.2545103913001922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13013613924358292,0.124347217636289,0.0,0.0,0.3544704253640251,0.0854730395758702,0.0,0.0993611298021352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15104757604207425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325751763957568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07718110183641297,0.12365094602057675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875954318636161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20515662171453464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12328086153828495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16150969425030764,0.0,0.0,0.07320604487749388
schizophrenia,a_mess,2018/03/04,"psychiatric assessment tomorrow :( This is my first time posting in this subreddit. For most of my life I've had counsellors and struggled with my mental health but was always dismissed by doctors when I was referred. Now, at age 21, I am being taken seriously and it's so scary. I recently had a psychological assessment and I've been referred for a psychiatric one tomorrow. I am quite in touch with my behaviour and I believe that my behaviour is symptomatic of schizophrenia. Does anyone have any advice for tomorrow or has had one of these assessments and knows what happens? I'm so scared of being dismissed again and I just want help and support.

schizophrenia,goldbikesparkle,2018/03/04,"Please try KETO I've been eating keto for the past month and within the first week I instantly saw relief of most, of not all my psychotic symptoms. The longer I've stayed in ketosis, the better I feel. I slipped up once and accidentally ate carbs and immediately saw my psychotic symptoms come back and then fade away as soon as I got back into ketosis. 

I'm not here to say it'll cure you - over even help you at all - but it's worth a try if it happens to help one other person relieve their symptoms.

A bit of my background: I'm not on medication, I'm losing weight like crazy, anxiety is at an all time low, voices are fading away, and my memory/focus is improving.

schizophrenia,Kitten_Stars,2018/03/04,"Can't tell if this is from ptsd or maybe schizophrenia Hi everyone, 

I lived with a new age cult for five years, during that time I did and experienced very strange as well as emotionally hurtful things. 

It's been five years since leaving and I go through these episodes where I see shadowy people, feel like someone's watching me, feel like there is a reality on top of this one and feel super connected to everyone and nature to the point where I feel trees feelings or people in a room which then triggers me because of the cult.. I basically start fixating on my experience in the cult and feel like they're still watching or controlling me 

I'm on a really low dose of abilify go help the intrusive thoughts I constantly get about reality and seeing ""spirits"" in my mind or having trouble grasping the two different realities I lived in (cult vs now) 

I've spoken with my therapist about the possibility of me having schizophrenia and we read the dsm together and I don't have some of the identifying symptoms. But idk to me it feels like something else is wrong and no one can tell me what that is 

I'm not asking for a diagnosis but idk can any of you relate to this because it's becoming very frustrating

schizophrenia,hellboundandgaged,2018/03/04,"I'm at the end of my rope. I'm not sure where to start, I made this account today to try and talk to some one, or at least be heard. I am currently making appointments for a new doctor but I have some very bad trust issues, beyond paranoia, after a horrible experience when I committed myself and when I was prescribed what was discovered to be a harmful medication, so if I'm going to be told to talk to a doctor know I am making steps in that direction with the help of my s.o.

I have been dealing with this terrible condition since high school and have been in therapy since I was in 6th grade. I have battled through substance problems, being homeless and being revived after I successfully stoped my heart 4 years ago. I finally found a decent balance of meds and recognizing when I was slipping(most of the time) and was able to be high functioning. But I'm getting worse, and I can't talk about it with my loved ones, and a few I've shared with in the past  have stoped believing me because of a person who actually went around telling people I was lying because she was mad at me and had a personality disorder(never date a girl you meet through mental health facilities, I thought she would understand but I was wrong). I'm getting worse and worse and what I hear is becoming overwhelmimg. I can't sleep at night with out being sedated due to anxiety mostly. I want to talk about the things I hear and see but I'm scared to. in some cases it makes it worse as if I have breathed a life into them beyond the confines of my mind. I am having trouble finding new things to enjoy and find my self listening to and watching the same thing over and over because I know what is actually being said or sung and staying in my house but that isn't helping anymore. I've become a waste of freedom. Worst of all, I had a child. I didn't plan on it but it happened and I have done everything in my power to be a good stable father. when I leave the house it's for doing things for him, trips to museums, parks, errands, ect. it's hard but if I'm going to be remembered as anything I want it to be a good father, but I'm scarred and guilty. Guilty that I had him and that I very likely passed it on to him. funny enough I practice safe sex but shit happens. I don't know what to do and I did d my self breaking down more and more each day. So far I've kept it togther but as it worsens I know I have to put my fear aside and seek help. For my child. honestly a main reason I feel I'm still alive is my child, so that if i pass it on I can be some one who knows more then most to help. it's hard though...i do d solice in making music to vent it but it's nothing most people wanna hear. I don't know I'm scarred and a mess and I needed to say something.

TLDR does it ever get better? 

Edit: just wanted to state that even though I have been through substance problems I am sober though I enjoy an occasional drink and a rare toke(I live in a legal state)

schizophrenia,GeneralBigfoot,2018/03/04,"Two voices that talks to each other. Like the titles says, I have two voices that chat with each other from time to time, I don't mind it actually, it's funny.

An example 

Mark ""I really like the new galaxy phone""
Edd "" It looks exactly like the last one""
M ""No it doesn't""
E ""yes it does"" 
Etc

Another one 

Mark ""damn I'm hungry""
Edd ""me too""
(They discussing about food places and where to get the best food for like an hour""

Meanwhile I'm sitting there like the third wheel.

schizophrenia,goatslayer,2018/03/04,"I'm having problems with PTSD Does anyone else have PTSD from their hallucinations?

My disease is centered around rape for instance. I would masturbate thinking about attractive women at my school. The voices got a hold of me doing that, and then started gang raping me telepathically. It was one of the worst parts of my life.. Ever since then, I've always had a little bit of traumatic intrusive thoughts about rape, on top of that, I'm schizophrenic, so everyone in the world can hear my thoughts.. It's really rough.

It seems to have came back, but now it's centered around children. Here's the story: I was having sex with a female two years my senior, and then I got momentarily bored and started to let my mind wander. My telepathic boredness got picked up by a 4 year old kid, so it's safe to say I showed him me having sex on accident (Though this is all telepathic, I would like to say that no one in the outside world knows about this.) I thought I had opened a can of worms, but it didn't hit me until two days later. I am given the idea that his grandmother told him it was ""just playing"".. The kkid loved playing with me, whenever I was at the place he stayed at I made sure to play with him a little while while hanging out with my friends (FYI, he's my best friends nephew). He then started randomly rubbing his testicle on my leg.. I tried to get himn to stop, but he kept repeatedly saying ""I wanna play."" It was so scary, I tried to get him off of me, but it was no use, I was at the mercy of a rapist 4 year old kid... This is by far the most bizarre hallucination I've ever had, and also the most damaging thoughts seem to plague my head space, such as; me showing kids whenb I'm doing something inappropriate (watching porn, bathing, defecating and urinating..), they all seem to be a trigger, and I'm constantly judged by the voices as a pedophile, even though I want nothing to do with those kids while doing shit like tghat.. I'm NOT a pedophile. I have a few questions to ask about this, hopefully y'all might help...

1) This is all based on the fact that I hear the voices of everyone around me, they're not like demons or anything, just regular people reading my thoughts. Is there anyway I can prove the reality of this? I strongly hope it's not real, then I can't live with this and I'm seriously considering suicide, so if it's real, I'm just gonna off myself, simple as that.
2)The above question: have you ever gotten PTSD from a hallucination? I heard it's very common...

Thank you for reading, I hope to hear from you guys ASAP, My life has been a living hell..",4.7622352941176445,5.561648752941178,5.461176470588236,82.62529411764707,69.31372549019608,8.431372549019608,28.52941176470589,8.583994105835817,1.935117647058824,2024,69,410,31,34,657,247,510,0.118,0.7559999999999999,0.126,0.5429,1,0,1,0,1,1,86.0,0,4,2,3,27,30,6,0,28,0,39,15,4,4,9,77,84,32,1,9,12,1,2,3,2,4,3,10,1,7,26,20,0,4,14,9,0,2,7,11,0,4,27,13,56,19,64,50,10,60,2,1,1,8,39,28,2,14,32,272,82,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05999423336411128,0.062423447229887935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052456398468885036,0.07686783749356886,0.061735856600278215,0.20035367514853453,0.07013446906106552,0.0,0.0,0.05768648627677302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872986746266562,0.0,0.08190345636401425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580399064966725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107100439524846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048382311867958924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0656513462925048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06267038430163732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049550635513388064,0.20358225583318976,0.0,0.14337148149341386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11592201279408965,0.0,0.07839070882324227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18000334129024947,0.0,0.0,0.07428254363879824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699314691156754,0.0,0.25366221757396784,0.0,0.05028496707172474,0.0,0.0,0.2235382175824851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846895305019168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041229556793792484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.076714012835418,0.1059790431660003,0.1099543525236792,0.15038141814959705,0.13248976150915245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06770934401035314,0.07098664481151301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958538144634922,0.07574978195815198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07198463295438028,0.0,0.1574437520088643,0.0,0.10167228599994403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08124038725686385,0.0,0.05201008656614163,0.0,0.07838093417792437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07178492543008361,0.2630864573502194,0.0,0.16808128562253682,0.0,0.15008252036352046,0.1707805497767294,0.04806034700127319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17897903182866912,0.0,0.07592521512412218,0.0,0.20488878893443735,0.0,0.0,0.07700793576361341,0.06205811207086709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05775479900334679,0.0,0.0,0.1593006615542968,0.07996235984618902,0.0,0.0627208804761395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206075214451658,0.0,0.07070636549780336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906921915247931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04807040095799811,0.14741542153993073,0.29779130541462145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07168574074670693,0.0,0.1018686125581667,0.0,0.14656915085823286,0.0,0.0,0.06479402089377012,0.0,0.06190014754745569,0.044249305016849184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10658547284570094,0.0,0.0,0.14493311273944953
schizophrenia,johnny0906,2018/03/04,"Meds yay or nay? Help Hi, this is my first time here and its been so good seeing all these people struggling like I do .

So, to keep the story short.

 I am 23, functioning off meds for 3 years now. 

I feel like I have learned to cope with my condition and while I still have very bad days and/or episodes and my demons (the voices) are here almost all the time I do my job responsibly, can focus when needed, socialise regularly.

 I used to take meds in my teens and I remember everything being easier; focusing, talking, thinking, sleeping, being me. But I remember everything feeling so fake, gray, slow, BORING. 

My question to you, more experienced guys is ""Is it bad for me not taking my meds, should I use them and why, putting aside all the benefits I said above.""
What are your experiences?

schizophrenia,doggobandito,2018/03/04,"My schizophrenic girlfriend falsely accused me and I am so sad. It's exactly a year ago today that she did it. One day she was cuddling with me in my room as usual ... the next day she wakes up and a psychotic episode twisted everything in her head to make her think that I had been stalking her and trying to kill her for the entire time she had known me. She obviously couldn't remember any of our happy memories aside from the ones that she had twisted into horrible false allegations.

I spent 8 months disproving all the allegations, eventually I proved myself innocent, but she still couldn't remember or see that I didn't do horrifying things to her.

Even with our beautiful and romantic message exchanges right in front of her, she still couldn't remember anything and still thought I had done disgusting things to her.

She was invited to a mediation session so that she could see I had never done anything to hurt her, she refused to attend because I can only assume she still believes her delusions.

A couple of months later she asked the university whether or not I was returning or not, I can only presume she asked that because she is still scared of me. I dropped out of the university permanently because I was too scared to be on the campus, if I ran into her I know I would get falsely accused again and my life would be ruined for a second time. 

There's nothing I can do to help her;

* I've tried reporting everything to the local mental health institutions and they won't do anything because I was the one that she had the delusions about
* None of her family members are going to listen to me either
* I can't contact her at all, because despite it being based on delusions, she's let it be known that my contact is the last thing she wants

I loved her so much and never thought that she would have delusions about **me**, I thought her feelings for me made me immune to that kind of thing.

She was never medicated or diagnosed, she feels that the delusions were a core part of her that mustn't be changed. She didn't feel anything was wrong with her, so she never went to the doctors.

Maybe it will take her 5 years or 10 years to snap out of this episode and remember, maybe she will never remember.

I feel sad, lonely and a failure. She is out there somewhere, still believing those things about me, it hurts so much.

schizophrenia,camerongillette,2018/03/05,"At my wit's end helping a friend For the last 6 years I've been heavily helping a schizophrenic guy. His family is not supportive and had institutionalized when he was 17, so he doesn't really have anyone to fall back on. When I met him he was disability, had extremely poor social skills, no job, and just walked around the city, floating around churches until he made people and generally women extremely uncomfortable. Long story short, I spent a huge amount of time with him for years and eventually let him live with me so I could teach him how to work and how to make people uncomfortable. He eventually got jobs in fast food and learned to work extremely hard, however, his social skills inevitability would cause him to lose whatever fast food job he had. Eventually he found a fast food place that he could work a lot of overtime. I co-signed his apartment and co-signed and paid a down payment on a car so he could work a lot. Over time, he was able to be mostly financially dependent. I mean, he basically calls me or texts me every day for the last 7 years, but that's usually ok. However, over the last year he's become hugely financially dependent on me. Previously, it would just be a couple of hundred dollars once in a while. But he started trying to go the University of Phoenix and thus was working way less and eventually got fired again, and I'm literally paying upwards of 50% of his bills. Which, I'm fine with letting him fail, but I'm cosigned on his apartment and car, so I don't really have a choice. He can't find a fast food job that will have him, and he's just full time ubering right now, but I'm literally paying thousands in keeping his car running. I don't know what to do. His lease is up in 4 months.

schizophrenia,knobodyknows,2018/03/05,"is it all a game? I took a dna test a while back, and concluded I have a lot of markers for schizo, and it runs in my family. Now I get these 'spells' when I think everyone's in on a joke, or some sort of elaborate lie, or even occasionally that my life is just a tv show like The Truman Show. Some days I'm fine, some days I'm just unraveling. I've never seen a doctor about it, kinda afraid to actually, I've been told my whole life that further mental illness diagnosises will only hurt my school (past), career, insurance coverage, etc. 

Back when I was with a lying ex, as in she was keeping another relationship (and I couldnt let go of her), this all started to get 1000x worse, I thought anywhere we went, people were talking about me, how it wasnt right and I was a bad person. I was 100% emotionally reliant on her, and couldn't function on my own emotionally at all. I've come a ways since then, and rarely get episodes that bad, but I still get them, but more mildly. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I'm alone despite being around people, I never truly connect, either because I'm not socially experienced, or just always isolating, stuck between introvertism and craving others, and anxiety.

schizophrenia,Sjforbz,2018/03/05,"Am I (going) schizophrenic? 


About 4 months ago, I started hearing the distinct sound of the iPhone camera click when I was in public. I do not know if this is real or imagined. I don’t think someone is necessarily taking my photo! It could simply be someone taking a photo which is SO common these days..however...I wonder why I never heard it so much before which makes me think it is in my head. This is very disturbing to me. I recently took one of those 23andme as well which marked me at a pretty high risk for schizophrenia’s. I am on the scale a highly gifted IQ, but I am barely functioning as an adult (i.e. I am forgetful to pay the phone bill on time or remember if I did). I am only confident in my ability to parent my son...it does take all of my mental, emotional, and physical strength, though.  He is a profoundly gifted 2.5yo and I can hardly keep up. I have help from my husband and my parents, however I can not help but feel I am perpetually drowning in my own thoughts. I have withdrawn from friends and pretty much don’t like people (a select few) so very much anymore. I barely can sleep but this has been going on all my life. I think what worries the most is being schizophrenic and not realizing it. I do not think the many therapist/doctors  I have seen have ever been capable of properly diagnosing me. This is because I only tell them bits and pieces. My memories are fragmented. I am starting to lose even more bits of memory here and there ...thanks for reading this far.❤️ ❤️🤷🏼‍♀️ I know there probably aren’t any doctors here and even if so, a diagnosis would be impossible online. That aside,I am looking for personal experience/advice. 
I was diagnosed OCD, panic disorder, adhd, and ptsd around 10+ years ago. I am a 31 year old female. The last 4 years of my life have been even more traumatic than what caused most of my issues. I am talking 8-9+/10 traumatic life crisis stuff, I was first prescribed an anti psychotic (abilify) at the time of my ocd diagnosis at 20 ish(?} I felt no benefit and quit shortly after. My most recent medication was Luvox, which I took for about 1 year before I quit several months ago..it helped my obsessive thoughts but the sexual side effects were horrendous. 
 My newest therapist wanted me on  Risperdal as well but I was still nursing my son at the time and I looked up the side effects.. NO flipping way.

schizophrenia,Lilpeti,2018/03/05,"Schizotypal I have schizotypal and I wonder if it's okay to post here/be here?

The diagnostic creteria Schizotypal in the icd-10:

"" A disorder characterized by eccentric behaviour and anomalies of thinking and affect which 
resemble those seen in schizophrenia, though no definite and characteristic schizophrenic 
anomalies have occurred at any stage. There is no dominant or typical disturbance, but any 
of the following may be present: 
 
(a)inappropriate or constricted affect (the individual appears cold and aloof); 

(b)behaviour or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar; 

(c)poor rapport with others and a tendency to social withdrawal; 

(d)odd beliefs or magical thinking, influencing behaviour and inconsistent with subcultural 
norms; 

(e)suspiciousness or paranoid ideas; 

(f)obsessive ruminations without inner resistance, often with dysmorphophobic, sexual or 
aggressive contents; 

(g)unusual perceptual experiences including somatosensory (bodily) or other illusions, 
depersonalization or derealization; 

(h)vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate, or stereotyped thinking, manifested by 
odd speech or in other ways, without gross incoherence; 

(i)occasional transient quasi-psychotic episodes with intense illusions, auditory or other 
hallucinations, and delusion-like ideas, usually occurring without external 
provocation. 
 
The disorder runs a chronic course with fluctuations of intensity. Occasionally it evolves into 
overt schizophrenia. There is no definite onset and its evolution and course are usually those

schizophrenia,TheBlackwell,2018/03/05,"Plus one plus two I have audio and visual hallucinations, scattred thoughts and low executive function. Wife refuses to call it schizophrenia because I'm not talking with the squirals and because with the expectation of this past year have held a steady job since she's known me.

So because I'm higher functioning and seem to be able to cope with all my phrens I'm not really schizophrenic. So she says.

Whatever. At my best, which happens like 15percent of the time, I'm not struggling even though all these things are true. So What? 

The more complicated issue is that she has high level anxiety (which I can deal with easily) but I have no merit, because even though I'm ""Not actually schizophrenic"" something is wrong with me.

?? Aka high functioning means I should be high functioning in all areas including meeting her high level anxiety emotional needs.

I can't be the cause, the counselor, and the cure to her issues. And I can't walk, because there's no income and we have two kids and she's turn all that against me, she's made that VERY clear. The family I came from has the same, ""something's wrong with Michael, but Michael is just fine"" phenonoma, so they just keep their distance.

I hate that even though I have good advise about anxiety, I'm not heard because I'm too crazy and because no one person can be six people and people need severval sources to be believed...and yet I can embody six different personas and say it differently but I always look like me, a white boy from the burbs, ",6.03360582306831,7.2263693333333325,5.8480664427025,79.57026315789476,66.65957446808511,9.341097424412096,31.863381858902567,9.549672527348893,2.898408510638298,1200,48,221,24,19,374,151,282,0.11,0.7959999999999999,0.094,-0.6843,4,0,2,0,0,0,37.0,1,0,2,1,16,12,1,1,12,0,22,2,0,2,6,51,43,23,0,4,10,1,0,2,0,1,2,4,0,3,12,21,0,3,4,0,0,2,10,5,0,6,5,6,27,7,21,32,7,16,0,1,2,0,23,10,0,1,6,144,39,2,0.09556213839429133,0.0,0.09325486206863916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07951535446734619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2193143229196733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4077765481262151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100286568529392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757962778816696,0.10929762827892127,0.0,0.098168639933461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985203685650986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19968419051536496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749454338139176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189353673424312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09008747926561853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801529877701847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450528338326324,0.0,0.0,0.0943478273737429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4038665837561687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19948408932126813,0.09483067687648272,0.08494001941987846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09337366757878304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08024812831164109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904232059445204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10409518371222434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14171622951181628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12951075628710454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09122487417869847,0.13250150873449404,0.08344117324238692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06121955286378625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15198969606904453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08699618173124889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904998839164798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14713680575918736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09990229581444246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768092270118652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06348723849109271,0.0,0.28166794733073963,0.07586566349062515,0.05572305138807121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039441652141561,0.1867006469788523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07884877225204477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20896439347669896,0.0,0.06153888399814489
schizophrenia,isuckatchess99,2018/03/05,"I would love some advice. Hey guys , I usually lurk this thread on my main account, but now I need some advice and would appreciate if anyone decided to chip in. 


Ok so, I am currently 18 years old and about 2 years ago, when I was 16 I decided to smoke marijuana. After about half a year of smoking I became psychotic and schizophrenic when I got high. (But I didn’t know it at the time). The more I smoked the worse it got, and I stopped smoking last year. I also smoked a little this year too (and it made the voices worse when I was high, I thought there was a bunch of spirits in my head and that it was ok for me to smoke). Anyways I’m clean and taking my meds and being truthful to my doctor. 


Currently, I feel depression and shame for not listening to my family when they told me not to. I also feel shame for the things i did to my family and others because of my psychotic episodes. 


I just wanna know how I can get over the fact that I ducked my life up for not listening to my family (I still live with them), and what I can tell myself to let the pain of being a dumbass go away.",4.231580952380952,4.361918764444447,5.572079365079368,83.73850000000002,70.24444444444444,9.450793650793653,26.73809523809524,9.424239791934726,1.968942857142857,842,24,185,17,14,284,119,225,0.15,0.768,0.081,-0.9598,2,0,4,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,2,0,16,8,0,2,11,2,14,6,1,2,2,37,31,22,0,5,7,0,2,0,0,2,4,3,1,1,11,12,0,1,7,0,1,1,4,4,0,1,11,5,36,4,29,15,5,31,1,1,0,1,9,10,0,3,20,138,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24614510991741004,0.11164315013007664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20143725626112075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806407206491007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183300104221737,0.0,0.0,0.07677525148182555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847673629606787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12891062933531802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3561908281950954,0.0,0.12736373051545155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658013629655132,0.0,0.0715777707748279,0.0,0.2014603579607393,0.0,0.0,0.12470591704941728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925649179186988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2661368226400778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843278481447827,0.1026624506109207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12878788006641206,0.08895908189614643,0.0,0.1262305498632813,0.11121224718015556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11367079564054307,0.1191727451139314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139897137685511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09338704551396483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215869110135994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134014968038604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058029619517504,0.10529613735303704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469539574685212,0.0,0.11008198088141692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367264146029604,0.0,0.0,0.09998671561827596,0.07343987564558953,0.0,0.0,0.12034639097247657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387112536953923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.256698594646723,0.1789362410635934,0.0,0.0,0.4055240942135128

I said no but I should have kept my mouth shut.  He asked why I was nervous, I said it was because I didn't know why I was being stopped and questioned.  He said they are looking for someone who looks like me and lives in the same apartments as me, he was pretty sure it was me but he let me go.

they have been following me and harassing me for years.  people had me convinced I was crazy.  they left me alone for a while when I moved and changed jobs so I thought I got ""better"" but they've found me again

schizophrenia,ervka,2018/03/06,"Seeking Advice Hi guys. I'm a college student seeking advice about my boyfriend who is currently suffering from schizophrenic like symptoms. 
It's draining his energy, he's forgetful, and hallucinating very often (up to 3-4 times a day). 
As of right now, nobody in our area takes his insurance. 
He might medically withdraw from our university if nothing improves soon. 
Is there any specific way I should help him especially in regards to his hallucinations? I do everything I can to make his day to day life easier and keep tabs on things he may forget. I care for him very deeply and I want to do anything to help him.
Any words of wisdom or any advice at all on what I should do is appreciated. Thanks in advance

schizophrenia,roamstudy,2018/03/06,"ROAM- Remote Cognitive Training Study Hey there!

The Vinogradov lab at the University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry is currently looking for individuals with psychosis to participate in a remote study. 


ROAM is a research study being conducted by Sophia Vinogradov, M.D. in the Department of Psychiatry at The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. ROAM is investigating how completely remote computerized cognitive training programs along with PRIME, a mobile platform targeting motivational deficits and reward processing and provides this population with access to motivational coaching and social networks; to help lessen the symptoms from psychosis and improve cognition.


Participants in the study will engage in a computerized based training app using computes remotely, and will be able to complete assessments over the computer too. Participants will be using the mobile platforms, Brain HQ, and PRIME, which PRIME will be on a personal smartphone. The lab is based at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities however, the study will be entirely remote.


We are recruiting individuals 18-60 years of age with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Schizophreniform Disorder, Psychotic Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, or Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features.


Through your participation in the research study, you could receive up to $330 for participating in the study if you complete all of the appointments and training sessions.


If you have any questions about the ROAM study, are interested in participating, or know someone whom might be, please send us an email at: roam@umn.edu

schizophrenia,De_pressedThrowaway,2018/03/06,"Help with possible delusion? Hello, I’ve been having a strange feeling ever since things with my mental health have been getting bad. Sometimes I’ll see people and they look sick, and I get afraid that they are rotting and wasting away and it scares me. This is accompanied by thoughts of people I see or know wasting away and becoming husks on drugs, even though I know they don’t do drugs or anything.I don’t really wanna feel this way but the thought stays around. It’s also odd because I was never really one to worry about sickness but now the thought of being around decaying sick people makes me paranoid.
Is this a delusion or am I just having paranoia flare ups?

She initially said yes but then something happened and that yes turned into a no. Thing is now my voices wont stop reminding me of how I fucked it up, and I hear her constantly while I'm at work even when she isn't there. It's making life incredibly stressful and I want to just get a new job to get away from it all, but that means I have to start applying places again, which is a nightmare. Plus we're so understaffed at my current job they kinda need me right now. I want to try talking to her again, tell her about my voices and hope that helps them go away, but I feel like after she said no texting her again would be inappropriate.

schizophrenia,SuperPheotus,2018/03/07,"Trying to tell the bf what i need So my boyfriend has no idea how to handle my illness. He thinks I'm ""spiraling"" when actually I'm doing really well considering I'm unable to get my medications. And I understand that I could think I'm doing better than I am but I've gotten a few second opinions from people that have seen it get bad. 

Does anyone have any good articles or books I could point him towards to inform him about schizophrenia? Maybe a movie or YouTube channel? 

What have yall done to help explain to people who don't get it but are trying to?",3.464007936507933,5.131056035714291,4.856190476190476,82.41103174603178,73.46428571428571,7.477777777777778,24.94444444444445,8.167268648758528,1.5254432539682536,444,14,86,7,9,148,77,112,0.07400000000000001,0.821,0.105,0.5246,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,1,0,1,5,4,0,0,3,0,12,2,0,1,0,16,26,8,0,3,4,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,7,1,0,0,6,2,0,0,2,1,1,1,3,1,11,3,11,21,1,3,0,0,1,0,10,2,0,3,1,56,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.1968616742911153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137184916346832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14105595029888982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16843808668193175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17841587081454574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3221337342543757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1765373397715002,0.20644223500375652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31619048153557977,0.0,0.0,0.16920352485492784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352169425100312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277312692826317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20266726120571046,0.0,0.0,0.20322412026796985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14958198209218174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27971162336149474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1907022773112417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292349096741769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763229664484212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2585238897939616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27392604847900154,0.0,0.0,0.21001049181816686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813816105904082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,depthrow4w4y,2018/03/07,"In a tricky situation Hi! I've only had one episode of psychosis before and even then it was caught early and never progressed to acute psychosis (had no hallucinations or delusions, just exhibited disorganised behaviour and negative symptoms), and have been fairly stable and medication free for about 4 years now. However lately I've been feeling quite anxious, having unusual thoughts, mood swings and derealisation and have been withdrawing socially and naturally I'm a little concerned about it being early psychosis. I'm not here for a diagnosis or anything like that, just wondered if anyone could help me with this:

I am at uni, in my final year. I have about 2 months left until graduation, at which point I'll be moving out and leaving the city. Therefore, I probably don't have time to be seen by the psychosis service (they usually have a waiting list, and there will be many people who need the service more than I do so fair enough). As well as that, I probably don't have time to be referred to a general psychiatrist for the same reason. That kinda puts me in a difficult situation - I really want to look after my mental health and tackle this proactively, but for the next 2 months I'll only have access to a GP (and I guess hospital but I'm not nearly at that level). Does anyone have any ideas on how to get around this? Or at the very least keep myself well enough to get through these 2 months? 

Thank you!",9.891327044025154,8.176036116981134,9.676084905660376,65.02268081761008,59.52830188679246,12.606918238993714,39.06446540880504,11.374738998889045,4.439031446540881,1141,45,195,25,12,374,162,265,0.034,0.885,0.081,0.8638,1,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,1,1,2,14,7,0,0,13,0,26,3,0,3,1,43,43,24,0,4,10,0,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,12,15,0,2,6,0,1,3,7,1,2,1,9,3,14,6,35,27,5,36,0,0,2,0,6,15,0,7,19,140,26,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255690413720923,0.0,0.0,0.1371486761147748,0.0,0.1697729295160563,0.0,0.09990275292564484,0.10807270851635976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330338587266837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09692889177030092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062389118589876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25087955679997537,0.0,0.08018427490289949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06138403873648941,0.0,0.0,0.13298895992200732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12685411763119922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373698737955705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12904368156849674,0.0,0.0,0.08137259151949734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13704705347983667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10790686672593508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13694571724067958,0.12854622524630654,0.13190263936630084,0.0,0.0,0.059310440308055226,0.1216757852675488,0.0,0.0,0.10194633985100617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308165048089932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12229882600878884,0.12234374475507825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2907035751179127,0.12903014591927664,0.0,0.09001736987627043,0.09363200465303848,0.0,0.1291114363496683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226452038564677,0.18466199878837145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841642298980465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476327023393808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617818159703485,0.0,0.0,0.12204162653253965,0.0,0.12912500263986074,0.0,0.0,0.07777264682786167,0.12482053971666045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2729198230563403,0.0,0.12375312272998927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261822160294462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117698128080442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0963789047291136,0.14157990357812034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337061490828739,0.10016861329930192,0.07160550820331306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21830831896863626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13165430334797293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15635664317958786
schizophrenia,Whereamiwheredoigo,2018/03/07,"A song i just wrote. My brain was stuck thinking about my ex and our abrupt ugly end, so for the sake of catharsis i wrote a quick song. No music to it yet but i hope you guys like it.

You and I

Were supposed to fight this world together

You and I

Were supposed to break our worldly tethers but

You and I

Never made it to the sunrise

Of the tomorrow that you promised

And im so sick of being lied to

Now i cry

Over all the love i gave

Now i cry

Over this darkness that you made and

Now i cry

Over all the things that shouldve been

But you were too caught up with him

And i am still caught up on you


When the sun sets for you

Do you think about me?

With all you put me through

Why did it take so long to see

That you had no intentions

Of ever loving me

When youre feeling kind of down 

Do you stop to question why

You let your fears get between you and I


Im alone

In this hell on earth called living and

Im alone

Out in the cold and shivering and 

Im alone

Alone again alone again alone again

Alone


When the sun sets for you

Do you think about me?

With all you put me through

Why did it take so long to see

That you had no intentions

Of ever loving me

When youre feeling kind of down
 
Do you stop to question why

You let your fears get between you and I


I am done

Pretending to be happy

I am done

Pretending that im ok and

I am done

Thinking im the right choice

For anyone


When the sun sets for you

Do you think about me?

With all you put me through

Why did it take so long to see

That you had no intentions

Of ever loving me

schizophrenia,kittykittysnarfsnarf,2018/03/07,"My friend has schizophrenia (or is on the psychotic spectrum) but doesn't know it. He feels presences, sees spirits, and communicates with them. They're such strong delusions he's totally convinced of that false reality and he thinks he's psychic. I'm the only one he's ever told. On top of this he's pretty manic most of the time (I always just assumed he was hyper and a hard worker). He's only 21 and a weed smoker and on prescribed Ritalin. I'm worried about telling him cause I don't wanna break his sense of reality and him go into a crisis mode. I also don't have much knowledge of this illness either.

I was not even that high, but I heard loud bomb/explosion noises that sounded as if they were right outside my door. I heard a woman's voice whispering in my ear as I laid in bed.

schizophrenia,RealTalkytalk,2018/03/08,"Question for my schizophrenic brothers and sisters. 
Hello there, I have Schizotypal personality disorder and I have a question for you. Lately I've had some weird experiences during night time. I wake up and it feels like my mind/body is about to snap. I get a feeling that something is about to (not physically) hit me so I brace for impact, but nothing happens. People with Schizotypal personality disorder can develop schizophrenia, so this is something I'm wary of. 

What does it feel like when you have incidents, can you feel it coming or is it like a switch turned on? Any thoughts on these experiences I'm having?

All the best from me to you.

schizophrenia,Kemento,2018/03/08,"A Nak Muay in Need of Assistance I enjoy doing martial arts and fitness related stuff because it helps me calm the voices and relieve stress. But I've gotten to a point where they don't want me to hit the punching bag because it'll lessen their volume and bring my anger and other emotions out. (Which they don't like.) The more I feel emotions (besides my severe anxiety and major depression) the louder and more agonizing they become. I want to practice on the punching bag, but they aren't letting me. If I try to I'm pretty sure I'll have a breakdown.  Do I just need to overcome them and hit the bag, or is there something better I can do? I do Muay Thai, Yoga, and Calisthenics for those who are curious. Any advice is appreciated.

This question is by no means intended to offend anyone, and you absolutely don't have to share anything you don't want to. I am just very ignorant to what schizophrenia is actually like, and how it affects different people in different ways. I know people with it often get stereotyped in the media as being ""crazy people who hear voices that tell them to do things"" and I *hate* that so much, it's so dehumanizing. And google usually just turns up with all kinds of technical terms that are no help at all to show me what people actually experience in their day to day life.

schizophrenia,porpison,2018/03/09,"I have a question about self image. So, I was diagnosed recently with schizophrenia, but I've had audio/visual hallucinations for many years. I've been on pills now for three weeks and it has made a big difference. Quality of life has definitely improved. 

I've noticed recently that the person I see in the mirror, isn't the person I've seen in the past. I mean, it's me but I look different. I'm prettier than I remember seeing myself. I always thought I looked so ugly, but now I see someone different. I don't feel different about myself and I still feel self conscious. I just see myself differently. I haven't talked with a psyciatrist about it, but I was just wondering if anyone else ever dealt with that. 


I'm sorry if this has nothing to do with schizophrenia.

schizophrenia,rudziczka,2018/03/09,"Afraid to choke? Hi, I hope my post is not against the rules here. I just need to post because I hope that when I write down my problem for other people to read I will realize how stupid it is... 
I am battling schizophrenia since childhood, my teenage years were hell, I was in hospital most of the time, but I am a fighter and I mostly cope well nowadays. I am 27, finished university, and I am married since 4 years. I went off medication about 2 years ago. 
Recently, my life situation is a bit complicated, because we immigrated to a new country, friends and family are on the other side of the ocean and my homesickness makes things a bit harder than usual. We also struggle financially a bit. 
Recently I developed problems swallowing (I don't think anything is wrong physically) and whenever I try to eat, I am convinced that I will choke and die, even when I only drink a smoothie. I started blending everything I eat, especially when I am alone. 
I hope this phase will pass soon, because I get hungry all the time when my husband is at work...
Well, that's it, I would be happy if anyone would have some nice words for me, or if anyone had a similar experience... Or maybe there is somebody here who can explain me that it is nearly impossible to choke on a smoothie. If not, that's fine as well. I've been through worse episodes and I just hope it will pass soon!",4.642822966507175,5.945567030303033,5.5622807017543865,79.93184210526317,69.98484848484848,8.739712918660286,32.07655502392345,9.134995656068208,2.7816090909090905,1072,48,207,21,19,352,152,264,0.172,0.696,0.133,-0.9037,0,1,1,0,1,0,40.0,2,0,0,1,18,21,3,2,13,0,28,6,0,2,1,39,39,20,1,12,10,1,0,0,1,6,2,0,1,0,14,9,4,0,3,2,0,3,3,9,3,0,5,0,35,12,22,27,7,32,1,1,0,0,8,8,1,12,19,148,49,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09334784733413473,0.0,0.0,0.10906576226951137,0.0,0.08421356000328564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472654891081014,0.0,0.08665826651385834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19258157207177865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3449022306090556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10929150826922096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316026714625877,0.0,0.21550965300090155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06955394182107916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09464268075867968,0.1030099515004518,0.09927358437257536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08135953101432991,0.0,0.055018293350967966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121007141042332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4183724122319011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438108640029435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07029289812095556,0.0,0.10579452084231998,0.0,0.0,0.10608520734648423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808342614362503,0.0,0.10170566182859128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08009032903174719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730062591054618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20170901123618493,0.0,0.0,0.20152817316119007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10533498492572076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20795490426331092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742212293255798,0.11836890411285303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745364738582299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11008920521915487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996095104786296,0.06747614509697204,0.0,0.0,0.12281011942094015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149619250948244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159802183868656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28404953717526954,0.09762016892809272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766643770903181,0.0,0.10731630734196652,0.1496134146509395,0.1151361127860429,0.0,0.20344177601322366

schizophrenia,MattBur,2018/03/09,"In need of serious help Why why why the fuck why are the voices always right. Tell me. Tell me. I am so sick of it no matter what I do they always find a way back. Pills back. Meditation back. I feel like the last thing I can do is kill myself. I just feel so lonely. I feel like I am in a bubble from everyone else. I don't even have control of my own mind. I talked to someone once as a friend it was all good. Then the voices decided I liked her and with no explanation even ask me what I found attractive about her I cant. It's all the voices. I get pain in my head when they make fake memories about things I am going to do, could do will do. No I am too scared to talk to her. Like I want to ask her out but not with the voices. I need people to talk to I feel so alone right now",-1.0999014778325142,0.8360811609195444,1.4759113300492608,99.2387931034483,90.83908045977013,4.923481116584567,13.458128078817735,6.42735559955562,-0.915663054187192,598,9,153,7,21,204,95,174,0.149,0.75,0.101,-0.8468,0,3,0,0,0,1,17.0,0,0,2,1,14,14,2,1,9,0,18,5,1,2,2,24,32,8,1,4,3,0,4,4,1,1,3,4,0,0,7,4,0,1,7,0,0,1,6,7,0,0,2,8,30,7,20,28,3,15,0,1,0,1,15,6,1,0,11,106,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12228669796518545,0.0,0.0,0.1964902665484534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22076224770625769,0.0,0.0,0.2723696039171909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324274788174845,0.09427066439272426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863377514840936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597052088160304,0.0,0.0,0.11282259256822735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2388024461689196,0.16870092708332673,0.0,0.0,0.10791541710115926,0.0,0.0,0.12945955155694502,0.0912219214234542,0.10915540667514677,0.0616876027964145,0.0,0.06710288197107031,0.09903296059685003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12117565298296085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914098805626897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13062886932680393,0.0,0.0,0.09624421425301104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307355221398925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07881379291489872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192187832332504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1750973752022559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12574253309910838,0.0,0.0,0.1256366394944189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08185606711973037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20166521510126045,0.0,0.0,0.11821039395715438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004178897250346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2847047389156743,0.20639978278913088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15688321453264567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06964176221576575,0.09371983908505507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4261654657505907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,ruslevch,2018/03/09,"What were your first symptoms? Not too long ago, i woke up at my girlfriend's house after a long night of studying. Ive been under great academic strain lately and been sleeping about 4-6 hours a night. When i got out of bed I heard muffled voices. I couldn't decipher what they were saying and figured that it was probably her neighbours being loud. That day went by just fine but on the drive home i began hearing the same voices again. The volume and the tone were identical to the one's i heard at her place except this time i could actually hear them discussing my recent underperformance in one of my courses. 
Upon further research into the topic i realized that many of my symptoms such as emotional and social disconnect, auditory hallucinations and unfounded fear of being watched online align with symptoms of schizophrenia. 
I told my girlfriend about it and she was extremely supportive and told me that it was probably just stress. 
I am extremely afraid of going to the do as I'm very close to graduation and such diagnosis would instantly render me unfit for my line of work. 
It feels as though my life is falling apart before my eyes and for the first time in my life, im unable to do anything about it. 
I've pulled myself through University despite being more or less homeless multiple times throughout the years. I fought off social anxiety and was able to establish an extremely loving relationship with my girlfriend and make friends.
It seems as though this barrier will finally take me down.. 
Can anyone please tell me what your first experiences with schizophrenia were like and what finally pushed you to seek medical help?
Thank you in advance.

schizophrenia,Miracow,2018/03/09,"Just looking through this sub has helped me a lot Last night I did my normal routine of smoking some weed and then going to bed. But as I was going to sleep I started to hear voices in my head of just random shit and it honestly freaked me the fuck out and I'm still feeling a little shook this morning. Not sure whether I have schizophrenia or not and I haven't talked to a therapist yet. But just going through and reading these posts have helped with my anxiety a lot whether I have it. I'm not necessarily feeling swayed toward not having it, but just seeing how you guys cope has helped me a lot. I'm hopefully going to see my therapist this week and I will def have to talk to her about it.

schizophrenia,SpeckledDingo,2018/03/09,"Weird movements? Schizoaffective, apparently. (so say three doctors) I understand that often times schizo people have repetitive movements beyond their control. I sometimes rock, which seems to be pretty common. But, mostly, I touch my fingers. I can't stop touching my fingers. Of course, I'm touching my fingers with my fingers. I think that makes it worse. And, truth be told, I'd prefer to have no nails, anywhere, because I can't stop touching them, and feeling every flaw.
So, I'm just curious... Does this maybe fall under that umbrella of weird uncontrollable movements? Or, is it perhaps anxiety, or something?

schizophrenia,Vuldarz,2018/03/09,"I have dropped things in my life because of negative statements or reports. I really started cutting out everything i did before in m life while having my first psychosis or up to two years before it. Everything started while i was a gamer and skateboarder back then, who was couple times a week in the gym.

It first was gaming, because my surroundings told me that gaming was stupid and a waste of time. Mainly my family which disliked my fun time being a gamer. If i look back at it now, i could still have a fun time if not everybody would told me that i do bad because i game. After a while being criticized for the thing i liked to do, my mind started searching for bad statements and reports in the internet. I just searched bad things and could not stop it, i do not wanted to quit gaming at all, and to this day i established a bad behaviour, the one that let me search the internet for negative things on every topic that get in my mind.

So close to this stopping to game, i quit working out in the gym for the negative statements and reports that you must be on steroids and do drugs, i really fast lost my entire motivation and discipline because of thoughts and the compulsion to search for the negative.

Well, and after a couple of weeks i quit aggressive inline and skateboarding altogether, my mind was always a negative machine, but after the compulsions of searching for the negative i could not accept anything anymore. So i was a skateboarder most of the week and once or twice a week for the fun doing some royal and soul grinds with my skates.

Then came the time where i have destroyed or and thrown away everything i liked, like my aggressive inline skates, i just throw them into the trash. Till now i have thrown so much away and i am in a situation where i would need to save up for twelve months to get myself some new skates. I still got my two skateboards, because they where not fitting into the trash. That is really the reason why i still got my two boards and my last pair of skateboarding shoes.

What happenend in that time was getting overweight while laying down in my bed all day long, just standing up to eat and drink, and after i got this down so i went down to bed. Nowadays my condition and endurance was never so bad before, i have tried skateboarding twice last month, i could just do twice fifteen minutes pushing and trying to ollie on flatground. I lost my hope, it is so exhausting. But i got nothing left, and i can not answer the question of what sould i do ?

I am still laying down at my couch and watching tv sometimes when it runs the whole day for me to feel some kind of social activity. Summer will be there in couple of months. I am now thirty years old and think that i am too old for everything, especially for skateboarding, and if i am not thinking of too old than it is too overweight or dumb.

My life now would just be laying down, trying to sleep, eat and drink, get to the doctor and my person in charge once or twice a month and than it would be it, and also waiting twice a day for the nursing service. And this till my rent, it would be another thirty years or so.

I am now in the situation where i can see myself heading for those thirty years laying trying to sleep and eat and nothing else than letting the television run all day. No change till death.

Somebody been there and made a change ?",9.082034855833287,7.037670017001545,8.394496615679795,74.61534775888718,61.349304482225655,11.582561424079303,36.52981932526781,10.085429814115964,3.433249469701007,2659,92,505,43,29,838,241,647,0.121,0.833,0.046,-0.9927,1,0,3,0,0,0,55.0,0,1,2,9,36,25,6,0,38,0,54,17,4,3,5,105,82,62,1,16,24,0,1,3,0,7,8,0,4,1,31,39,7,4,12,10,1,6,15,14,1,11,22,4,69,11,83,40,10,113,1,2,3,0,14,40,1,16,68,396,100,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044967187008775285,0.04678794390592124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0589621578622035,0.0,0.0,0.055765145200077366,0.0,0.0,0.04627257743328893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566005129670167,0.08647494503491865,0.23474890480280025,0.1713867213597141,0.0,0.14354300903414627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06431224931612975,0.0,0.0,0.11896797026394472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17958062290044471,0.18665259327579786,0.0,0.18131879879849067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057553885356995765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016817302249304,0.06520905883773884,0.1726122764845065,0.04697302945268308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0473762805931533,0.0,0.20214393617946208,0.0,0.053008729631414,0.0,0.028431625780285068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565858091387476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11751161622523068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17988937616449988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057708300305369775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055849172328691264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05855499148156192,0.0,0.09167006543052177,0.0,0.0,0.061094163223660174,0.11499816458784512,0.11915093799433535,0.08241355302189432,0.0,0.0,0.04976186500735244,0.0472191182590039,0.0,0.12276358310115612,0.0,0.0,0.05320627589308141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17032910099108645,0.0,0.17952930285834048,0.0,0.041335590066822164,0.04169390328053213,0.0433681160795082,0.054307376568798284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10790858621935548,0.0,0.17701207873541228,0.11976643298570222,0.03810296791711404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049097950443172465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06299057575577999,0.17942288400221362,0.0,0.0,0.10806731698011916,0.05781390322249527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044808105931460014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264099664486048,0.11254140828684993,0.057319501079181864,0.0,0.0,0.05561300219094362,0.0,0.11939985290350913,0.0,0.1796217074181581,0.09402175521131896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14942710741397405,0.0720599493736737,0.0,0.04464041481752491,0.19672932505249685,0.0,0.0,0.10746053176330993,0.0,0.15270617505607706,0.0,0.1647858980802193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033165967162625334,0.0,0.1804175632627217,0.0,0.050557608764424125,0.052125861819005324,0.050738915103620386,0.0627788934673752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04093617917823568,0.0,0.0,0.1997212324050828,0.0,0.0,0.1448413515515725
schizophrenia,4cactusjack,2018/03/10,"Recently diagnosed with schizophrenia Hey everyone,
I've been dealing with issues for awhile and finally decided to seek treatment at my university.  I've been put on medication for schizophrenia and so far that's what I'm being treated for.  I'm struggling in classes and dealing with baggage of isolating myself for the past two semesters.  I don't have many friends that invite me to do anything and I mainly spend my weekends just trying to waste time till my next class on monday.  I know i should try and join clubs, which I've tried and havent found anything appealing.  I feel very isolated and alone and not sure how to get back in the world if that makes any sense.  Any suggestions, stories, and help would be greatly appreciated",6.801070261437907,8.052030757352945,6.354803921568627,76.41633986928106,64.95588235294117,9.573856209150328,35.69934640522876,9.725611199111238,3.5526807189542486,597,28,103,12,9,185,94,136,0.108,0.818,0.073,-0.5967,0,1,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,1,2,0,10,2,0,2,1,24,17,13,0,3,3,0,1,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,5,12,0,0,4,2,1,1,3,1,0,1,3,1,10,4,18,10,1,17,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,1,9,62,15,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17729072214377098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2328163658045918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28173289821244185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13162675519087458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529578628990748,0.0,0.17374396667403758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635697033560272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655368661405853,0.0,0.0,0.18751918246422816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876898940428817,0.13225314440259775,0.0,0.0894344178809052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188726413091623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11473825982006683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17866731234028774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09407598085775393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11426389372906333,0.17354952236683188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724457119068566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18205173576265832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634105571381151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17208305146087094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16901947221106758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.178954369248413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16133500343846022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09981635989898437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3486596894416865,0.0,0.16721786144148384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14124132172682832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12160126960977295,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,multiplelizards,2018/03/10,"I can’t figure out whether or not I’m faking. 
I’m not taking my medication because I’m 99% sure that I don’t actually have schizophrenia, and I can’t explain my behavior or thoughts so I guess I just subconsciously fake all of it? But then things have happened that I don’t understand, like when I’ve talked about things and don’t remember anything that I say or I start crying because I know I can read the future or am in contact with Gods or because my thoughts have multiple meanings that I can’t comprehend.

My therapist was telling me that my speech has been very jumbled up lately, and I kept telling myself “stop talking weird, just talk normally” but I couldn’t, even though I recognized that my speech was abnormal. Then I thought, maybe I’m not faking, because if I were faking I’d have to put effort into talking the way I was, instead of having to put effort into sounding normal.

Or maybe I’m just fucking stupid. I don’t know if I’m psychotic, which is why I won’t take medication that could fuck my body up when I don’t even know whether I need it or not. I don’t feel like I can trust the opinions of my therapist and psychiatrist. They keep telling me I’m schizophrenic and I just nod and say “okay” because I don’t want to argue with them and annoy them.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Is there a surefire way to know if you’re faking it?

schizophrenia,Call11garda,2018/03/10,"Depression switch to high energy and racing thoughts. I've been depressed since 2 months ago. Been on Fluoxetine/Prozac for 3 weeks and my mind is changing drastically.

My thoughts are racing all the time. I feel like I'm connected to something again and I'm getting into what I call ""the flow"".

I sometimes would like to have the option of suicide but I believe I am immortal and can only die by certain means. I was given the number 11 so if 11 police officers shot me at the same time I may leave this reality but I would be stronger in the next. There is something more to everything.

I don't know where the voices come from but I think these experiences are something genuine and I'm afraid that suppressing them is the wrong thing to do. Maybe my mind will continue to receive important and valuable information from ""out there"" and medication will stop it receiving this. I want to do the right thing and I don't want medical professionals to deceive me if this is something they cannot understand.

I feel a lot of energy inside my mind and body. I feel strong. I feel somewhat invincible. I feel compelled to walk somewhere unknown. I feel it all coming to the surface and the struggle to keep it hidden from my family. They want me to start taking the antipsychotic but I'm scared of what it will do to my mind. I would rather my mind be in a natural state even if it appears ""crazy"" to others.

I'm trying to stay inside. Stay safe. Do not act impulsively. Stay out of trouble. Take some xanax and keep calm.",2.585445205479452,5.241344445205482,3.7694349315068494,84.29024828767125,80.57534246575344,7.074657534246574,25.56335616438357,8.17850203761792,1.886145205479452,1206,48,228,25,32,391,156,292,0.115,0.735,0.15,0.8049,0,0,4,0,0,1,30.0,0,0,3,1,7,14,0,3,14,0,28,4,1,1,3,65,58,19,2,10,9,0,6,2,0,7,3,1,0,0,15,16,0,5,13,0,0,8,4,7,0,0,6,7,31,7,31,43,7,33,0,2,0,0,7,11,0,9,12,152,46,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339937349600013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10599992129984846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450559325190616,0.0,0.0,0.09606980425117784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995279006952905,0.16208926234592005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1620680146599634,0.0,0.0976438512337595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06214128485782519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455621106079354,0.09203174646588297,0.08869357974308167,0.0,0.2854287607988357,0.06721329329676377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0491547617575536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994044159741919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16725153033937926,0.0,0.0,0.051705848103455694,0.0,0.0,0.09962087466778413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192892174155268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07998645353967747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09451955250748044,0.10248454671740913,0.0,0.18955851864951986,0.0,0.0,0.4749877302086101,0.0,0.0750965767808636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000589025008142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07155476484023562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08034682135244542,0.0,0.0,0.09419402746783684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782686901952329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28972039446829806,0.0930510178016326,0.0,0.06659280743910885,0.30084157728492056,0.0,0.07865804464098775,0.0,0.09835653425499752,0.0,0.10291211246487443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147821284228826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250098347890346,0.06028492769489777,0.0,0.14938362865561006,0.10972172697259452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06387654169781637,0.0,0.0,0.09794427373437904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16647871249218646,0.0,0.07546813348273332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200502722957644,0.10286557159427392,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,NoxiousQuadrumvirate,2018/03/10,"I'm feeling pressured to take medication I started on quite heavy doses of antidepressants at 16, for about 4 years after that I was cycled through all kinds of antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, ADHD meds, narcolepsy meds, and anti-psychotics. All were awful. The side-effects were so unbelievably horrid, and they either made me really ill or just a completely flat-lined shell. I don't want to take medication that'll affect the way I think.

On top of this, my father has been diagnosed with early stage kidney failure as a side effect of some relatively benign medication he took about 40 years ago. Potential kidney damage was one of those really rare side-effects that the doctor's told him not to worry about, and yet here we are. I've told my health team this, but they say I shouldn't pay attention to the warning labels because then I'd just never take anything at all. To be honest, I don't *want* to take anything at all. I'm perfectly fine with the idea of never taking something that has that kind of known potential for harm. 

But every single week we have the same conversation. They ask me how I'm going, I say I'm doing well, and they say I could be doing even better if I agreed to just take a little bit of medication. I turn them down every week, and every week that they ask me, the more adamant I am that I will never take anything again. 

I'm worried that they'll keep pressuring me and then when I'm vulnerable, they'll convince me to take something. They're really pushing for injections too, so it wouldn't be a case where I could just not take the pills the next day. 

How do I get them to stop mentioning it? Do I really need to form a new team?

schizophrenia,GrahamBob,2018/03/10,"Your inpatient experiences? Hello there!

I was recently discharged from the hospital after a tragedy in the family followed by heavy drinking and ultimately psychosis. I've been diagnosed with the disorder for about 3 - 4 years as an outpatient and managed, but only recently found work and even more recently got a placement in pre-university science ultimately leading to an B.Sc (Hons) in Chemical and Pharmaceutical sciences.

I won't ramble on about things that have been discussed but I'm simply wondering what are your experiences 'inside' as it were? Mine were simply a lot of haloperidol, a lot of pacing, a lot of smoking cigarettes and being locked out of my room 9am - 5pm. Granted the nurses were absolutely compassionate and lovely provided you were polite I didn't see a doctor until the third day of admission. I also had vivid dreams about other patients getting into my bed and touching me and whispering to me and overall the experience took it's toll on my psyche rather than improving it (apart from making some friends of course). I also left some art in there a friend is retrieving for me to incorporate into his novel about his own experiences.

Is this normal? What was your first admission like?

Any and all responses appreciated,

Kind regards,

P.S. I'm now on the Abilify Maintena injection as it's free where I live which is an absolute blessing. I spoke to the hospital pharmacist about my degree among other things and he said it was the best option for retaining cognitive function without the price tag.",7.320144592249854,9.062402703296703,7.864966261808367,64.26643724696358,64.0915750915751,11.461654135338344,36.71274339695393,11.313756151347434,4.9618322344322365,1250,61,186,39,19,413,174,273,0.015,0.7829999999999999,0.202,0.996,1,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,0,4,0,4,13,9,0,0,20,0,18,4,0,2,1,32,31,19,0,2,4,0,1,1,2,1,2,3,2,0,14,15,1,1,2,4,2,3,3,0,0,2,16,6,21,10,40,13,9,27,1,0,2,1,15,15,0,7,10,145,35,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20699929138377668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08801217959545954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13582161035879967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08346722435299465,0.0,0.0,0.1313617721477322,0.0,0.0,0.14833014173051784,0.1324700773806055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12678541435253135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08548276945749643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5064026972672524,0.1220086267428245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11008726463190564,0.0,0.14190580293328392,0.1999840081172868,0.0,0.06761825373699189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10351151548087267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13477429376782038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14061863034165895,0.0,0.0,0.06322961330529853,0.0,0.1142830119253012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33009279981731754,0.11680944521067713,0.0,0.08639095710822645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12680720712356666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09843213703124748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833692384629655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12311105253490548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313349347660294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17196597900477908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437938809063775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12475929739627803,0.1403538845342245,0.0942215940725896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083344264809118
schizophrenia,gohanssb,2018/03/10,"My first step is telling my wife about my experiences. Any advice? I'm not diagnosed yet, but it's something that I want to do so I can have some sort of explanation for my experiences. The first thing I need to do is talk to my wife about this. She's definitely taken note of any negative symptoms that I display and had chalked it up to me being eccentric or possibly highly functioning autistic. What she doesn't know is that I've been very successful at hiding any paranoia/delusions/auditory hallucinations. I've always been able to ignore or rationalize them, but they've been getting more intense and I think she's finally noticing the paranoia at least. 

The thing is, she suffers from anxiety herself and there are a lot of people in her family and at work that are always piling their problems on her and I feel really bad coming out with this while she is suffering. I'm also starting to feel guilty that I could possibly pass something on to our daughter. I don't even know how to start this conversation. I was thinking maybe a letter?

Does anyone have any advice for this situation? I want to see a doctor but I want to be able to talk to my wife about it before I proceed any further.

schizophrenia,worriedson123,2018/03/11,"Won't see Doctor Hey all, I'm currently a college student and I'm really worried about my mother who has Schizophrenia. She was diagnosed a couple years back and was put on various medications(most recently Rexulti), but stopped taking them a couple months ago due to the fact that she says it doesnt work. She has never acknowledged that she has schizo, saying that for certain its people using technology to harass and spy on her. Because she doesn't believe that she has a medical condition, its really difficult to get her back to the doctor and instead focuses her time on seeking out lawyers so that she can sue the voices. The times that she has gone to the doctor in the past shes usually gone alone and has refused to tell me her doctors information, so I have no way to get in contact with her providers to request help. I'm really at a loss of what to do.

schizophrenia,fapstronautwarrior12,2018/03/11,"Am I going to develop schizophrenia? My mom took me to the e.r because i said i wanted to commit suicide and I was drunk. It wasn't a total waste of time because i now have a psychiatrist. But while I was there I confessed that I had multiple occasions on marijuana where I thought people were going to hurt me and were talking about me. For me, marijuana is the devil. Anyways the psychiatrist there gave me Olanzapine and I seriously think Olanzapine is the worst, my memory was shot and when I was coming off of it I seriously felt out of my mind, hearing sounds only slightly. He gave me some more for when I got home but I refuse to take that ever again. I have been feeling lonely and depressed for a while and can't focus on anything. My social anxiety has been bad buut now i'm scared of losing my mind. I really don't want schizophrenia because I know exactly what it feels like, it's like something triggers it and I'm in a different world where everyone is talking about me and watching my every move, my anxiety to the top, really really scary, when I'm around people that feeling subsides. But now i have no friends and i'm scared of losing my mind. Maybe this feeling will subside in time, I'm just wondering if anyone has experience before their schizophrenia developed. Am I at risk, or is it certain that I have it only slightly?",3.3708333333333336,5.651247352490422,5.017533524904216,78.45894396551725,75.4750957854406,7.874904214559388,28.49952107279693,8.72156446121922,2.5288555555555563,1073,46,192,23,24,362,132,261,0.217,0.698,0.085,-0.9892,1,2,1,0,0,2,23.0,0,0,1,3,17,17,0,3,9,0,25,1,0,1,5,41,51,19,1,3,6,1,5,2,1,1,0,3,1,0,13,12,1,1,10,1,0,5,4,13,0,0,17,9,36,4,24,33,4,29,2,5,1,0,13,12,0,4,14,142,49,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18223701969327236,0.0,0.0,0.08328419431962361,0.0,0.09801704325232673,0.10603278723388347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09945153190856934,0.21782430042426384,0.0,0.1013534877134896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260236455379243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025889147867388,0.0,0.0,0.1244441697021948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077414427329637,0.1003549661941408,0.11381431696719001,0.0,0.11651203373685295,0.0,0.0,0.24090154890186255,0.08509191444129137,0.1143638846679392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09202377327897844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13538544903493224,0.0,0.09526281948293346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342451638351807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11947662973499573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12750927889792624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06545951532991617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11638185781158575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2665063268919405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11966159193367368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3608001927932934,0.13949971150056242,0.0,0.12659464352135252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811764199908716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651511839389554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22891395876692486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113300495307247,0.0,0.23849895557966186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121417226532925,0.0,0.09169638106090466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13028655849623855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08955558783088557,0.19147155228041893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632061543041024,0.0,0.09455970928525267,0.13890751882488522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323351363942294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14050784366057886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12916926879099724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Always when I go to sleep I hear voices in my head, usually voices that I heard before and sometimes I have strange feelings that someone is watching me by the window and from time to time I even have visual halucinations. One time I saw some kind of white siluate on my courtain, one time I saw a slender figure by the door.
I have those hallucinations when I go to sleep or when I wake up.

schizophrenia,myoddme,2018/03/11,"Have been hallucinating constantly for month and half. Like the title says.

Daytime its the shapes of things changing constantly and my ability to understand dimension. I saw.my wifes wonder woman night light turn its head and look at me. My kitchen lamp started descending from the ceiling. I see a white car taking turns everywhere I go. 

Nightime I see people walking around my house that arent there. 

I thought my wife poisoned me, and that she would shoot me and/or stab me. Furthermore I was resigned to this fate without resistance and felt I deserved it as I was overcome with dread and guilt. (Spoiler she didnt kill me)

I have been having wild bouts of crying. I thought I heard God's voice yesterday, and even now I don't want to discount that maybe I did. 

I can't remember my days very well this past month. Everything is like a dream Im just walking through. My memory from  2 hours ago feels like a memory from years ago. My memory  is fragmented into video clips. I dont remember driving places but I get home just fine. 

I am prone to extreme anger or sadness quickly.

Then just throw on the hallucinating. I get this feeling when I think I may be hallucinating its like a high feeling  like im on drugs combined with a surreal and dreamlike state of mind.

I have also been extremely lethargic, my arms and legs feel weak, I get so tired mentally fighting to stay in control.

schizophrenia,dingbobber33,2018/03/11,"A Spontaneous Poem I am a lion: my claws ethereal, my jaws of the void. 

I am not here to cast you down but to cast light into your shadow.


I am fraught with shadow, as is much that is paradoxical, but I am not afraid. 

I have faith.


Not in millennials, not in some guru or god, but in mother earth. 

She shall resurrect herself to her former glory.




Let those who seek have courage.

 Let those who serve be fulfilled. 


The time has come for a new era on earth; a new era where peace and prosperity shall be normalcy, not rarity. 


Let those who seek be fulfilled.

 Let those who serve have courage.


Alas, now is not the time for private poetry, but for war! 


Will you rise, anew, and serve, to the betterment of this earth, or will you continue down the path of dishonorable, self-gratifying non-virtue?


Let those who are slaves be freed.

 Let those who enslaved be punished.

 Let those who are free thrive.

schizophrenia,WoodZillaTV,2018/03/11,"Don't understand why Schizophrenics don't ignore their voices or whatever A video that haunts me constantly is of that guy in a Turkish mental asylum whose fellow roommate in the asylum ripped his eyes out in the middle of the night. It's horrifying. The title of the video said the assaulting patient was a schizo.

That kind of thing really messes with me.

And in the comments, someone said they had a sister who would punch their own family and TVs in the middle of the night, because they looked evil or something like that.

I don't understand it. I do hate schizos, honestly. If you know you have schizophrenia and was diagnosed, why the hell would you rip out a guy's eyes or hurt family because of it?

schizophrenia,worriedroommatehelp,2018/03/11,"Roommate help Hello all, I created this account entirely to reach out to you guys.

My roommate had taken some drugs about 4 months ago which caused him to have a schizophrenic episode (according to the doctors), he refused help in the hospital so they sent him home. Once he came home the first time he had a violent episode which resulted in the police being called and him being arrested but sent home the next day.

Since then his behaviour has been worrisome. He’s self medicating with weed, has quit his job (or got fired, unsure), lost his car and licence, run through most of his money and cut himself off from all his family and friends. I see him only because he comes out of his part of the apartment to eat and get water. He refuses contact with his family because he says that they were out to get him and held him at the hospital against his will. When I ask him what his plans are he shuts down, refuses to speak to me. And when bringing up what happened 4 months ago he acts like nothing happened. 

I am starting to get very worried about him. He can’t keep track of time or days. He will ask me the same question within a short time period over and over. And he’s become almost entitled and mean about things. This is all new behaviour since 4 months ago.

I’m reaching out to you guys cause it seems like his family and I are at a loss. He doesn’t want our help but he’s now digging himself a financial hole, self medicating and is barely functioning on a daily basis. I don’t know enough about schizophrenia to know if this is normal behaviour but due to what the doctor said I’m reaching out to you guys.

Any advice or ideas would be wonderful. I just wanna make sure he’s safe but this whole thing has become incredibly taxing on me.

schizophrenia,lilwan7,2018/03/11,"What should I do? I have a friend who's thoughts and feelings have been getting more 'unhinged' over the last year.

So first of all, his brother has schizophrenia, and is currently living in a center. This of course brings a lot of worry in his mind as to whether he could be schizophrenic. He also is a frequent drug user (weed,MDMA,acid)

My friend believes himself to be a very spiritual person, and he always brings up spirituality whenever he has the chance. But what he says makes less and less sense as time goes on.
So with most of his realisations whenever I ask him to explain how he knows, he fumbles his words and I haven't really got a response other than, 'you just don't understand "" ""you haven't experienced it"".

I'll give a specific example to explain.

Recently we were talking about acid trips. He has an issue where he only gets visuals for half the amount of time has me. I've put this down to variation in brain chemistry and how the chemical reacts slightly differently with everyone. So that's why his visuals are lesser. it is probably just a biological difference.
He immediately disregarded this idea and said that because he is very spiritual and has a deeper understanding of psychedelics, he focuses so much that his brain processes the acid much faster. (He constantly reaffirms that he is more spiritual than others, especially me. and that I just haven't reached his level yet)

Every chance he gets, he tries to relate his life to his spiritual beliefs. Another example was that he had been feeling depressed for a few days (had a big family fall out). I asked him what he thought caused his depressive days. His response was that he's seen "" enlightened masters"" (ekhart tolle,mooji ect) describe becoming depressed during their awakening. So he said that his depression was just proof that he has reached a certain point on his path. 

There always seems to be a simple reason for his issues, if it was considered logically. But he always goes directly to an extreme form of Spirituality.

I am a very non confrontational person so bringing this up seems very difficult especially as he gets very defensive whenever I ask how he knows something, he kind of shuts down and doesn't respond. He always seems so jumbled up when he tries to explain it and often ends up repeating ""yeah""(it looks like he is constantly trying to reaffirm his thoughts and look for validation). The other times he sort of rambles about a topic but repeating a couple of specific words but never being able to simplify any of his ideas.


I have noticed that I am forcing myself to be open to whatever he says, simply because he believes this so much. And it is getting to a point where my own psyche is taking a hell of a battering (trying to silence my own views and disregard other friends  opinions) just to make sure I am not making a mistake with my views and doubting him unnecessarily.

It just seems like everything makes sense to him, but no one else gets it because they are not on his spiritual path. 

He doesn't have anyone who really challenges his views. and I don't believe he has ever really developed a way of finding truth outside of personal experience.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, even just to open him up to critiquing his ideas, I don't want to carry on as things are, just in case he really does need help.",7.672625786163522,7.828142709119498,7.942452830188682,69.58540880503145,62.94654088050314,11.343396226415095,36.69182389937107,10.980518767755715,4.173080503144654,2737,121,475,68,36,897,288,636,0.055,0.8740000000000001,0.071,0.8797,2,0,2,0,0,0,69.0,1,2,2,3,33,21,3,1,30,0,53,5,2,11,7,104,100,43,0,9,19,1,3,2,3,2,3,4,0,3,33,24,0,3,25,0,0,8,12,10,0,3,16,17,51,11,72,75,15,59,2,4,7,0,90,29,1,12,23,315,84,3,0.06561496644733086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247226496189605,0.21838763355819654,0.0,0.0,0.08924085443451676,0.0688030133943428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04587951016393337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18402340877659687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11999482359057842,0.07246657533497655,0.0,0.22177679378931395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14649600545498068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06740464501576013,0.0,0.05652148364819039,0.0,0.14181293717136687,0.0,0.05238821156978078,0.07260171235736387,0.0,0.08463245033557855,0.0,0.2260562978181356,0.0,0.0,0.1371073490074893,0.0,0.0,0.05742009930951528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07609252970576004,0.0,0.054812884938146886,0.0,0.05811538471848581,0.0,0.0,0.043338066508975225,0.05935249367933362,0.055283439182174,0.06269791230803763,0.058970500965400637,0.06418402771041723,0.061855950784074215,0.0,0.09953069563476068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059970890617516474,0.055812056940678485,0.0,0.0,0.15208188093673833,0.0,0.20568667086516795,0.0629438547168057,0.0,0.0,0.05247828270918846,0.07234073214936264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08796065781102745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22221393131361256,0.0,0.1369699553350857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832789045181957,0.07212053915967122,0.05348495516748682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04634579126684174,0.06411231653238172,0.0,0.05793921749490505,0.0,0.11020009252836016,0.0,0.0,0.05578349806011587,0.0,0.0,0.17519399844863173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06625241138745375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470365028077062,0.09730533243294973,0.05060630715855394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747030741933556,0.0,0.0,0.04446239939339015,0.0499031387068224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17187737344371326,0.0,0.0,0.12405470384832418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07074403157665167,0.0,0.0,0.06596116425490635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1681385106935989,0.06746311366508602,0.06478686351820566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1248297175350766,0.1043593098216618,0.0,0.0,0.05228663306017886,0.23893360451141984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0505136068283778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06184132935537784,0.0,0.049334288885064304,0.052738824579610113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04359166813784476,0.0,0.0,0.15627286228891776,0.1147818437910637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17819302055288586,0.0,0.0,0.1366149882154963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27069609537118805,0.03870140723579628,0.05208210624059855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05920730146354846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06663518345353027,0.0,0.04661098957882688,0.0,0.0,0.04225388712090265
schizophrenia,GeansaiGorm,2018/03/12,"Can I tell the difference between symptoms you can ignore &amp; events you interpret as real causing an episode? It's safer to walk your dog at night with less people and you're disguised by the darkness but you still feel on edge.

Every car that passes has the person inside looking at you. You feel harassed by people's stares. You feel like you walk with a constant spotlight on you. 

You try to ignore this feeling especially in public but you don't know how long before it reaches a breaking point. You don't want to attract attention to yourself. You've confronted people in public before who you thought were following you and it was all in your head. 

Its hard to tell whether you're experiencing normal daily symptoms or whether you're going to have an episode. It sometimes feels like the second one. How does I know if you're able to ignore it or whether you'll believe its happening for real and act accordingly.",4.977733990147783,7.027626609195405,5.058292282430212,80.93379310344828,70.26436781609196,7.0403940886699505,30.81937602627258,7.7094869923839395,2.1836893267651893,746,32,128,9,14,233,103,174,0.132,0.8029999999999999,0.064,-0.8809999999999999,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,16,0,0,3,8,2,0,8,0,9,3,1,3,1,34,22,14,0,3,8,0,6,2,0,1,2,0,0,1,10,5,0,3,10,0,0,7,2,5,0,2,3,9,18,3,21,18,2,21,0,0,2,0,22,8,0,3,7,83,28,0,0.1413214557896314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15312173830458506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240508300119854,0.1592208864107287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451760638825723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527182883416406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476508425615728,0.0,0.0,0.12367135830999122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11906942164717348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3572818714093663,0.20192015250694945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031624007947423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12497009663349602,0.0,0.1265962660246941,0.0,0.1450365848811442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15533315245324586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13808504975270633,0.0,0.0,0.12506504124695805,0.1186744301451476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326206128806067,0.1384650212876766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576307587107703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2939235102413719,0.12339644417284605,0.0,0.0,0.13359445485253255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217095117853885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13977053335621314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128594971459661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2937742071688246,0.0,0.0,0.2470423627108896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121934501371718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594799189716696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335505613738818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,seasquirrel22,2018/03/12,"is it possible that i am on the spectrum? Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this. I have anxiety and ocd (pure ocd: meaning only thoughts are affected. ie: what if i'm a murderer? etc. completely unjustified thoughts with absolutely zero validity behind them). I was just wondering what my likelihood of being on the schizophrenic spectrum is? I had a traumatic childhood that helped develop my anxiety/depression/ptsd. i constantly lock doors and 'check' my home to make sure it's safe and even then will keep some sort of weapon close or near me if i am home alone. I had someone break into my home when i was by myself once so i feel my actions are now justified because you truly cannot trust anyone (but i did do it even before that incident). I met my dad when i was 18 (briefly) and quickly figured out he was highly delusional. He is a vietnam veteran so i know that has something to do with it. He always would tell me outlandish stories about how he met a beautiful doctor/model and that they were running away to some far off land together to get married, etc. there were plenty other stories just like that. My grandmother had OCD when she was alive. I remember her taking 2 hours just to pick out the perfect tomatoes. Anyways, i guess seeing the instability in my parental figures and when my ocd and anxiety get severe enough...i get afraid that maybe i too am on the spectrum that my father is. I am just curious if any of my symptoms might sound to anyone like early signs of anything in relation to schizophrenia or some sort of paranoid schizophrenia. I just don't want to ignore any type of issue i might have before it could possibly get worse.

schizophrenia,teddycuddles,2018/03/12,"Interested in oppinions about possible symptoms Hello,

Since I was 16 and in a very stressfull job combined with study i've been having experiences i can't explain. It all started at work when i saw an upper torso'd women crawl along shelves (combined with sounds of her being in pain). Many followed, including people outside my house, in my room and many other places. Later this was followed by hearing things others didn't, such as yelling, arguements between people and low volume whispers i could never make out what was said. Because I'm also psychic i've never really looked into it too much, however things are starting to scare me now (wich never was the case before). 

I'm now 26 and it never really went away. Because i also started to struggle with motiviation, concentration and memory issues i visited a psychologist who beleives i suffer from PTSD due to sever childhoodsituations.  Researching online ofcourse i also came across schizophrenia. Are my symptoms possible to fit or am i save? 

ps: not looking for a diagnosis, just an oppinion from people who have more experience then i do. if more questions are needed to make things clearer, please do ask.

schizophrenia,friendofthefire,2018/03/12,"Could It Be Possible That I Am / Have Developed Schizophrenia I have a history of schizophrenia  in my family. I believe my uncle is diagnosed with it, and so is my grandfather. My father acts similar, but I don’t know for sure if he suffers from schizophrenia.

After my parents got a divorce, my father began abusing me and my brother. Child services did nothing. After a year or two of this abuse, out of the blue he nearly killed us, and then kicked us onto the street and told us we weren’t his children anymore because we didn’t love him anymore. I was always an imaginative child, but after those years, I wasn’t the same. I don’t remember much. But recently (today) I found journals from me in the 5th grade, talking about how the goverment was watching me and shadows were stalking me. How if I didn’t do things bad things would happen. Or that there were correlations between things (like if I didn’t use a certain pen, a giant earthquake would happen.) There were other things too, but they were even more stupid...

Anyway, after being abandoned by our father, I had to go to court ordered therapy, where my mom was told that I was traumatized and emotionally disturbed. She was also told that I suffered from delusional beliefs and that I should continue to go to therapy and take yearly mental health evaluations. But after the court requirements were met, I never returned. The whole therapy ordeal is a blur to me. I was only 11.

For a long time I think that I’ve been delusional but not that delusional. My thoughts were never so intrusive. And most of my beliefs were really silly or laughable. Laughable enough that I don’t even think I realized something was wrong. Everyone in my family just thought I was really imaginative and creative.

Well, over a year ago (I’m 16 and about to turn 17), shortly before I turned 15, something inside me snapped. I began suffering from these intense flashbacks where I reexperienced everything. Everything triggered me so much. And I had such bad anxiety.

It hasn’t stopped or gotten any better. Every day I get “triggered” and experience these memories that I don’t want. I’m good enough at hiding it (and luckily it mostly happens at night) that nobody realizes anything is wrong.

This probably seems like a PTSD post or something but I’m getting there.

I developed these weird intrusive thoughts. Worse than what I had before. “If you don’t wipe the table, your house will burn.” “If you don’t write a fanfic, your whole family will die.” “If you don’t kill your plant, your blood will turn to stone and you’ll die.” “If you don’t drink a cup of mouthwash, another school shooting will happen.” “Turn the air conditioning to 60° or you’ll be kidnapped by aliens.” “If you don’t spray that kid with water, you’ll fail every class.” They’re so ridiculous that I feel like nobody will believe me. But it happens all the time and I cannot say no.

I began hearing things also. At first it was just a person repeating my name. But then it was people yelling at me. And then other people having conversations. And sometimes it’s just static or nonsensical whispering or buzzing. But I can hardly focus. And sometimes when I’m in class, all I can hear is that haunting static in my mind.

My mornings are great.  I pop up before the alarm, put on coffee, do some yoga and meditation, and get going with my day.  Nights have been rough.  I get really tired and lethargic and don't have the energy to even do a relaxing night sequence or a few minutes of meditation.

I’m going to go see a doctor tomorrow to see if I can get CBD oil, I think it could help me with my depression and insomnia too (I take 20mg of citalopram and 7.5mg of zopiclone).

I will lose everything

Everything will be lost

My life especially

If I stay inside 

Someone can come in

I will be trapped…

My soul especially

They can see me

Even if I close the blinds

They can hear me

Even when I am silent

I hear my name

I hear them say

This and that and at the end of the day

I close my eyes

I can not sleep

I am afraid 

They suffocate me

In the long, long night

I stay awake

You are real

You are not real

You are imagined 

You are seen

You are a ghost

A living thing

You are not here

You are there

You are right next to me

Stroking my hair but I do not

Feel

A

Thing

I count down the days

For the weekend

So I can forever, never leave

My bed

So I can forever, never leave

My room

So I can forever, never leave…

schizophrenia,ElaraSophie,2018/03/13,"Negative symptoms and trevicta Hi,

I'm getting trevicta (525mg every 72 days paliperidone depot) as treatment for my psychosis, even the positive symptoms nearly faded, the negative symptoms seems to stay, most cruel of all how it effects my work ability (I just can't work as I could before... Not so many lines of code per hour as I used to) my boss expects me to be back in 2019 to work in full power (at the moment I'm on temporarily retirement). Can I expect it to get better? Or do I have to do something?

schizophrenia,-wowzerz-,2018/03/13,"Is this normal? Since last year of May, I hallucinate ants. It's  not 24/7 but to give a more detailed explanation:  It usually happens twice a month and what will happen will be that I see either a few ants, one ant, and worse cases a bunch of them crawling all over me or on places surrounding me, if it's a few or one, I'll try to flick or kill them and if it's a bunch I see, I'll hop around and stuff but not matter what I do, I eventually realize that there weren't any ants at all. About a week ago, I saw a real ant on my right hand and when I picked up my left hand to flick it, I saw thousands of them crawling up my jacket sleeves so I freaked out and started hopping and shaking my jacket but after a while, I realized there weren't actually any ants except for the first one.  I don't even fear ants, so I don't know what this means.  And I'm not on drugs nor do I drink very often. And I would go to a phyciatrist but I'd like to know if this isn't a big deal before I start making any appointments.

schizophrenia,wowiee23,2018/03/13,"Help for my mother Hello, I am a 21 year old person living in Australia. The past few months have been horrible.

Around midway through november, my mother had left the house, which we worried about. She had been diagnozed a schitzophrenic her whole life but generally gets by normally enough with the right medication. We tried as best as we could to get in touch with her, including contacting the police. Eventually, the police had found her, however She'd told them she did not want to be found. A few weeks after this had happened, we got a court case (me and my dad) for Domestic Violence. In the case, my mother had detailed abuse from me and my dad against her, aswell as claims that my dad had been sexually abusing her. These claims we're 100% false, as we'd never even think of abusing her, and my dad had definitely never touched me ever. So we basically tried telling the police these claims were false and that she's a diagnosed schitzopherinic. They did not help out in one bit, so we ended up calling up a solicitor. Months had passed (court getting delayed/us putting in evidence), and it came to the conclusion recently (yesterday) of her dropping the case. Beforehand, we were ready to get a subpoena of her medical history, but it had been too late. So now I'm in the position of trying to get her help but we have no idea what to do. She'd also tryed to get a DV against my nan (living in NSW) for abuse, but also dropped the case. 

She has had contact with me during the case (telling me to bring down her stuff to the car), which I ended up doing. When I saw my mother, I could tell from the get go that she wasn't right. There were packs of cigarettes lying around the car, along with fastfood and other messes. It turned out she'd moved in with another woman, who also was in the car. She spoke with stutters, even asking me if I had any weapons on me. After I gave her the stuff, she offered me to come and live with her at a flat. I denied and she took off.

What are my options here? seeing my family going from normal to this is devistating and I worry about my mother every night. If someone see's this, don't hesitate to ask questions and get in contact.

Thank you.",4.6647887323943635,5.828223272300472,5.2935399061032875,82.40228169014085,69.7981220657277,8.68469483568075,28.04976525821597,9.029198982220553,2.154568638497653,1718,59,338,32,30,554,210,426,0.127,0.8290000000000001,0.044,-0.9904,1,0,1,0,3,0,61.0,9,1,2,2,18,5,1,0,26,0,38,4,0,0,3,56,69,27,0,7,8,9,2,0,0,0,4,1,0,2,19,32,0,0,6,0,0,12,7,3,0,1,31,6,63,2,64,31,6,57,0,0,3,0,65,24,0,4,19,247,82,0,0.0,0.38044993462294135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1925871295606488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054589600835043516,0.08417510256362137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14292314084997426,0.15009215966647296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842434254933756,0.0,0.0876392650746393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08196952217818197,0.09181295899878554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914961203611565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12818575421214268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08147720848965981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14219925052309065,0.08294530303983763,0.0,0.10604146572458067,0.07261313126258193,0.06763496151771523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567591511693696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17603429829623166,0.0,0.0,0.3355220604813205,0.0,0.0912440109622682,0.0,0.06420307209643039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07098671984581947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614194719285862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262631431157983,0.0,0.09062045171472498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09055344454066096,0.0,0.08721877966896434,0.0,0.056700448727720364,0.0,0.0,0.21265229534949134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16173678420204166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281491216501375,0.08531938346082027,0.0,0.0,0.12382571301121695,0.0,0.0,0.07533243988716873,0.1573044742602718,0.0,0.0,0.08423487438262217,0.0,0.054396266159340095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07663135755575681,0.0,0.07009283859447936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08069832253639553,0.08992612155029751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0792616574824134,0.0,0.0,0.13710844122418314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279372074976261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0680165577212274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18379082729572052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2104910790367449,0.07390622904727694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05143683549908384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07670598915203833,0.08918823050720008,0.21800521577727808,0.08731590547066621,0.0,0.0,0.09656067229080133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04734814309306819,0.0,0.06439158369767431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962392130893225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16304586455824707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051694324225719235
schizophrenia,EternalElemental,2018/03/13,Nothing seems real Within the past year I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia. For a while things were looking up and my symtoms were mostly gone. I had a wonderful girlfriend and things were going my way. Last month however my girlfriend broke up with me. I also found out my father was having an affair. Since then it seems Like everybody is cospiring against me. I've become so lost in my own head that I don't even know what normal is anymore. I have so many strange thoughts like wiping penut butter on the walls to protect me from the shadows. Or listening to music to see if people placed messages in the songs for me. This is so much different from what I experienced before. When I was diagnosed all I had was the occasional hallucination or dellusion. Now every waking moment I'm paranoid I can't trust anybody. I know that if people at school find out I'll be treated differently. I'm trying so hard to keep myself grounded. Does anybody have any advice about that? I'll have full conversations with people and I'll talk about them only to find out they never happened. At times Its like I lose control I forget my name I act different my and I don't remember any of it. Am I just blacked out then or is that a symptom too? This is really hard and I have no idea what I can do. I talk to my counselor about it but she doesn't really give the best advice. And at that I don't trust her at all. I'm convinced that my medication is poison. Can anybody give me advice on this?,2.454084186575656,4.8898631740614364,3.804665529010241,85.18053640500572,79.3754266211604,6.364004550625713,24.10113765642776,7.554174236665415,1.3059730147895343,1182,42,224,18,30,387,157,293,0.08900000000000001,0.843,0.067,-0.307,4,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,2,4,13,12,1,0,10,0,30,7,2,1,3,41,50,21,0,3,7,1,2,3,2,0,5,2,0,0,18,13,0,3,11,1,0,3,7,4,0,0,13,9,37,8,33,36,7,35,0,3,3,0,16,19,0,9,15,162,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3149914296032957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592629140096235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14613692907252135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10655974801233913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186681015882335,0.09143050924690213,0.0,0.11276026301559465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12051229937093075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.218115334348386,0.0,0.3367815177957186,0.0,0.0,0.09402864902295467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096852659797842,0.0,0.09052974763457236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19641142712318527,0.0,0.0,0.11781141174755284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20614821968228805,0.061065291531338585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501609358297476,0.0,0.19250497493227392,0.0,0.11027285801368386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129594576787354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550490230930704,0.0,0.0,0.11810144784732578,0.08758462869148492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15748129788429968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09022943139467188,0.12020705816327032,0.1172924093841766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10893561607253407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082427632726828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576413279647094,0.0,0.07898679445123738,0.0,0.0828706803258867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10527642832207053,0.10309945141043347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08171920235306956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025714705049439,0.22347317084369744,0.0,0.11226050593190623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12229958166704535,0.13766814407643166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171787145593126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874332070953233,0.08562230869901782,0.19563362227301773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888226622101944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11167982706486757,0.0,0.17272559559845865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14276762711830715,0.0,0.0,0.08530187336650465,0.06265391290867511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295027868895937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528738450408682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165229958143711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06919312174175409
schizophrenia,thasquidkid,2018/03/13,"Alternatives to Military Service So my SZ has been recessed and treated for more than two years at this point, and I have been looking into joining the coast guard to get some excitement into my life. Unfortunately, the military won’t even take people with mild ADHD, let alone people who were hospitalized.
Are there any alternatives out there? Doing meaningful physical work is something I want in my life. 

I’ve been thinking about AmeriCorps and being a merchant mariner.

I started seeing a psychiatrist 3 years ago went on a bunch of meds but still wouldn't snap out of it. I was hospitalised twice but no treatment has worked. As i write this post i am still convinced i am being filmed for the entertainment of others. I live a relatively normal life but i am in a lot of pain, i feel like my heart is being squeezed all the time and i get drunk every night to sleep. I understand it is crazy and that the logistics of filming someone 24/7 are basically impossible, but on the other hand i do think it is possible. I think the show started about 20years ago and i have only become aware of it 5 years ago. I tried to kill myself with meds twice now and i don't know what to do. I google myself and nothing comes up so i think they censor my internet or something, i am so scared and have been since i became aware of the filming.

schizophrenia,queenramsey,2018/03/14,"Advice for taking care of someone with schizophrenia? My boyfriend (21) and I (19) have been together for 3 years and lived together for 2. Two months ago his symptoms started. He previoiusly had severe depression and at the time he had been off of his antidepressants for about a month. At the end january he smoke weed for the first time in awhile and he had the worst anxiety attack of his life, I believe this is what triggered the symptoms to start. He came home after smoking, crying, thinking that the FBI was going to track him down. I brushed this off as his anxiety attack as he had never said anything like that before. The next few days he endlessly researched things on Wikipedia and came to the conclusion he is the next messiah of this generation. I was worried but I thought it was a breakdown of sorts. He started losing sleep and panicking about bombs being hidden in the house. He broke our basement door and smashed his glasses. At this point he was hearing voices. I then admitted him to our local hospital and they only kept him for 3 days and sent him home. He was given new meds. Over the next couple of weeks he continued to check in our attic for bounty hunters and stay awake. Every time I would be doing my college work he would try to break my laptop because he felt the FBI were listening. He then went back to the hospital and stayed for a few more days. He currently is slightly better but the voices are still strong. He worries I'm being targeted by the government and he need to protect me. I try to keep him occupied and take his mind off of things but when I talk to him he just stares at me in silence. Is there anything I can do that may help him cope more? I want him to be able to take care of himself when I'm in my classes and I'm worried about him. Any advice?",4.7386324786324785,5.9965332564102605,5.047423361823364,83.88183589743592,69.71225071225071,8.123122507122508,29.70951566951567,8.488131031819089,2.1556788831908817,1427,55,275,22,25,451,183,351,0.099,0.8340000000000001,0.067,-0.7903,1,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,3,0,1,6,9,11,2,0,18,0,28,4,1,1,1,37,56,23,0,4,4,0,1,1,0,3,3,5,3,0,11,17,0,3,5,0,1,5,1,6,0,2,21,8,37,5,51,28,5,55,0,3,1,0,47,17,0,2,31,178,48,6,0.09309898998933797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819505110607246,0.0825266373539272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063310505693149,0.0,0.1424409450374042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15322507242636785,0.0,0.0,0.21182708263889752,0.0,0.07158737664410564,0.0,0.05675228018391665,0.0,0.07922038341630848,0.10489068080441837,0.0,0.08233849103639654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21296088538775385,0.1898412500331126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10301226165211226,0.10226486891150424,0.18012343996753696,0.0,0.08018602365853039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08245807188632535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07843991439253045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938963026100973,0.0,0.0,0.07918995332528979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05291030147800699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10492932794647886,0.0,0.062402290547369066,0.0,0.1867717555739317,0.0,0.0,0.10742373473803048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08275065994272299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657585698937009,0.04548346389716303,0.0,0.0822081138131507,0.0,0.0,0.10415395599870207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341199021322044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09400344035047456,0.0,0.14862145118663064,0.0,0.0,0.06903172142407532,0.07180368045045657,0.08991558466822902,0.2970354961160239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07080597708805188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880086377928433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855845893404958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1051753591140151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931662249664982,0.0,0.07888247210032437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19768783287697544,0.1984622722277152,0.07434897366635328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935309951310503,0.2099965624791634,0.07482944162636697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370166427933425,0.059654073612713174,0.0,0.07391019879343891,0.1628603092350844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12641620604911438,0.0,0.09094418540724823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054912196407367934,0.0,0.07467839412493918,0.0,0.0,0.08630369643898438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06777717351585731,0.2836396304000673,0.0,0.1322697026958203,0.0,0.0,0.05995269718284759

schizophrenia,dontnalethenail,2018/03/14,"Will Learning to Hallucinate What I Want When I Want Cause Schizophrenia? I'm learning to induce hallucinations for fun by shutting my eyes, looking for static, and trying to put the static together into different shapes, then slowly making it brighter and brighter and more colorful until i have the full hallucination of what I want. I got a VR set a day ago, and it's so cool but not too real. This is why it would be so cool to induce a hallucination of something encouraging you to work out, cool scenery, or just anything to be entertained, but I'm worried if I learn to do this it will make me spark hallucinations I don't want, or make me delusional, hear voices, etc... please, any advice is deeply appreciated.

schizophrenia,justwonderingagain7,2018/03/14,"Can schizophrenia cause homosexuality? Or is it just nervousness and anxiety from seeing people of the same sex who are well situated in society? Fear of being judged by them. Right now I feel like a fat blob, I haven't gone outside in months, I have no future goals, I have no motivation, and I'm currently not in school and not working. These nervous facial ticks that are kind of like flirts traumatize me and my mind confuses cuteness in general and people who are well built in general with sexuality, which again traumatizes me and disgusts me. This is all recent after being diagnosed with schizophrenia. I told my psychiatrist this and after asking if I can go to a group therapy he told me no because it would traumatize me. I think it's because most of the people there are ""LGBTQ+"". The mental health clinic has a lot of posters that say ""LGBTQ+ friendly space"". Can this be reversed? Is my amygdala too irreversibly big now?

It happened after observing politics. Then one day at school some girl came into our class to give a speech and she used a word ""latinx"" and described it. After that the females in the class looked ordinary or masculine and the males in the class looked feminine. I went to the restroom and almost threw up and then left the class and never returned to school again. Then on the way back men on the streets and on billboard ads stuck to my mind and it took a few months for their memory to dissolve. But I didn't have any sexual dreams or desires, my mind just seemed to notice them after that. It was a nightmare when I wasn't asleep. Then after slightly recovering I started watching YouTube videos by gay people and I noticed this pattern that scared me, they either came off as having a weak immune system or being American Psycho-esque. All my life I was inbetween and unaware, meek, then the political climate changed. Not even the most sexually active heterosexual women behave like the majority of the gay men I've studied. Now the state of politics is disgusting like gay sex. People freely talk about being proud of genocide, freely talk about race, IQ, tribalism, etc... I didn't want to be a ""special snowflake"" when I first encountered this content on the internet, so I braved through it, but now I realized that was like being raped.",6.2662364532019685,7.691617676190479,6.353513957307063,75.3064285714286,66.28571428571428,9.412151067323482,32.101806239737265,9.668497473035632,3.1454934318555017,1824,74,313,38,29,580,228,420,0.086,0.823,0.091,-0.3515,1,0,0,0,0,0,52.0,1,0,4,5,19,23,3,5,26,0,31,15,3,3,3,61,54,33,1,4,13,0,1,5,1,1,7,2,0,5,23,22,1,0,5,2,0,7,11,9,2,2,15,7,35,14,47,31,11,60,0,0,4,6,23,20,0,12,35,227,58,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101600229470488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06899810965206597,0.0,0.0776186814260295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09485392027207004,0.0,0.0,0.07801854699019174,0.0,0.12370143022118968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2320925786441058,0.0,0.10423013354872486,0.10733407433352336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06543504233996521,0.0,0.0,0.1029824962908488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315772168385535,0.06701515094275537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11417373645684575,0.05130258553043333,0.07248496721540032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08630411371791649,0.0,0.0,0.07838982390937208,0.0,0.0,0.09733225924816052,0.0576635858951676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897231231743707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785009665540987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056577798938132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11023951139528028,0.0,0.07166609974779592,0.24784773040217864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704062139727491,0.0,0.0,0.08625995213329057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10225052894214086,0.0,0.3073451845295572,0.0,0.16197310499028267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825428280663106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310318939548813,0.0,0.0,0.06875374576316264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3517072753621917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10018216749196887,0.0,0.0,0.0866485843191684,0.0,0.08068720484486851,0.10158185468976882,0.308056982469748,0.08085262885668143,0.0923678238409259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404831657790153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181581540266059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16310373648137358,0.0,0.0,0.1160314305069517,0.0,0.0,0.06501319595000178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19390389999279808,0.11272878376240315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08763118869001868,0.0,0.0,0.0598453243655161,0.08053636196269857,0.0,0.0,0.18245429001457888,0.09405693170636044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07386604796398398,0.0,0.0,0.072076185068602,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,froufur,2018/03/15,"Contemporary portrayals of schizophrenia in the media Hello, everyone. I'm a media student and I'm going to be doing a case study on how schizophrenia (or similar, such as schizoid/schizotypal personality disorders, schizoaffective disorders, other psychosis inducing disorders) is portrayed within the media. 


I am schizophrenic myself, so I think this is an issue that I resonate with and something I can make a good judgement on, and I happened to stumble upon the subreddit while doing some research, so I thought I'd ask the community here for some recommendations if that's okay!


What I'm looking to do is collect a bunch of portrayals of schizophrenia (or similar) within the media, positive or negative, fiction or non-fiction, coming from print (newspapers, posters...), e-media (online news, websites, youtube videos), and / or broadcast (film, tv, documentaries...). 


Currently, I have a few texts which I am going to use, such as ""They look like people"" (2015) and ""The Voices"" (2014), but these are 3-4 years old, and I was wondering if there are any other films that represent schizophrenia that are also more recent? I was thinking of ""Split"", but I haven't actually seen that so I wouldn't know. I have an abundance of old texts that I can compare the newer representations to, in order to take a look if representations in film have changed.


For print and e-media, there are many news articles and youtube videos that seem to be raising awareness of schizophrenia and creating a more positive image of it, whilst hollywood is still hanging on that idea that schizophrenia causes violence, which is what I will be exploring within my case study. 


Just a heads up, I'm not asking for help writing it, I'm just asking if there are any texts I should look at that might come in handy. I'd love to hear your views on how you feel schizophrenia / similar disorders are represented in the media, though! Discussion is very welcome, and of course examples are always appreciated :) ",11.55562920268972,9.659125907780982,10.536899135446683,60.72123727185401,56.49279538904899,13.749010566762733,44.74716618635927,12.340626583579946,5.6622016906820365,1578,75,245,39,15,503,182,347,0.032,0.867,0.101,0.9737,1,0,1,0,0,0,75.0,0,2,1,0,16,5,0,0,18,1,33,3,1,6,0,50,63,31,0,6,14,0,1,1,0,4,1,2,0,1,20,13,0,0,10,6,0,6,4,0,0,0,4,9,21,5,38,52,6,31,0,0,6,1,14,15,0,14,10,176,41,2,0.0,0.0,0.11050783145966654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09055956584768368,0.09422639415267717,0.0,0.0,0.1540168513658563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31759787797841704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633070143202567,0.11979499334459705,0.19509586727251185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5191404529916707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820755921809676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05725854469179861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12871604719061158,0.09498199522269198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001395037901136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621893583074658,0.0,0.1276319350897306,0.0,0.07590370826214356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12783640500164528,0.0,0.11819519986729556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062234827482132514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05532430851686992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.380378950403221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022053029696194,0.0,0.07558989711111645,0.11480958779943515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12013183913631045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376568051269128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850772641004815,0.09887852391738666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181278790047178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309124023276424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871792042348535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043518686989292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514387145437588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451217691027119,0.11125966468216708,0.08990147825672637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780470676329456,0.0,0.09343648836687134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12280609043139415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07292411859531264
schizophrenia,cosmicrush,2018/03/15,"Creativity Theory Of Schizophrenia I started a podcast called Qwerky Science. 

Many of you might have read my blog post, [Exploring Darkness](https://mad.science.blog/2018/02/20/exploring-darkness-theory-of-creativity/)

I've started podcasting now, and took this theory further in audio. 

**Synopsis:**

It begins as an exploration of what creativity is, in terms of risk-taking, pattern recognition, and then eventually it gets into the pharmacological theories that I have for how creativity occurs. Creativity is a skill, and not something within the brain mechanics, but instead, is a byproduct of risk-taking and novelty-seeking. Big picture thinking is really the same as detail-oriented thinking, but the behaviors we engage with, change the outcome of memory, resulting in either detail-orientation, or pattern recognition, and clearly, a spectrum in-between.

It also explains why narcissism, delusions, and grandiosity would be correlated to disorders of creativity.

schizophrenia,pondd,2018/03/16,"I feel deeply insulted. I'm living with my girlfriend at her parent's house, and I haven't had a job in a long time. This was okay, but now the dad wants me to pay rent, which I am unable to do. I am willing to leave if needed, but he went beyond and began to berate me. Saying that I do nothing, and I lie about trying. What hurt the most was him saying in response that if I do have emotional problems, he says maybe I should be living at home with some sort of caretaker, or nurse. But previously he's refused to acknowledge this illness as being real, seems unfair. I don't know, I've never felt so persecuted. Why must we suffer and others deny our experience? One of the most frustrating parts of the illness for me is when I ask for support, others seem to think I'm unable to make my own decisions. Ah oh well. I have nothing to prove to him, but I know I can be successful in any case. It is now my mission! To make it big, and prove the obstacles that can be overcome. I say this often when I post here, but we are strong!",2.502734051367028,3.894112380281694,4.309616128141396,86.48102734051369,75.43192488262909,7.077492405412871,23.327533830433573,7.724431198458867,1.0252228113780726,799,23,169,11,17,271,127,213,0.206,0.713,0.081,-0.9843,3,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,3,0,0,2,10,10,2,0,7,2,24,2,0,2,4,43,41,17,0,7,8,2,2,0,1,3,2,4,2,0,12,9,0,1,11,0,2,1,3,5,2,1,6,6,27,5,25,28,5,17,0,2,0,0,19,7,0,10,8,123,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834859507548037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13520297647575316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16268140223224636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14146903885231532,0.0,0.0,0.07312573106858603,0.0,0.13886075390230673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450686545571609,0.0,0.0,0.16687551731859945,0.1548219059602235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14351600559075306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15896203028052594,0.0,0.0,0.15313486845653734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554095061731111,0.1279867984377519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19307394267187256,0.0,0.1452932358611838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072361173452832,0.11154216849535152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775393259902705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09800028342923364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16058671956842732,0.1566126088101873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13850885051289824,0.0,0.0,0.13838467324514506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646126288763591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4600400374489218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2633186836782424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16411645943364764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266857476664413,0.0,0.0,0.08433083067582195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981895194453346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08530238875912001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300334398936014,0.13406696411071858,0.13049975718067994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,heatedchimera,2018/03/16,"Do you think I might have schizophrenia? Or is it just my depression/anxiety getting worse? I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety around 3 months ago, and have been on prozac and wellbutrin since, yesterday I also started taking lithium. Tried to hang myself twice, but it didn't end up happening. 
So my parents used to fight a lot when I was younger, and my dad used to hit my mom after getting drunk, it got pretty intense and really started to affect me (things are better now and we pretend that none of this happened) but when I'm alone in my room I hear them fighting really loudly from their room, even when they're asleep. It's not like when I think of thoughts, it feels like real voices and I usually get up to go check on them several times every night only to find them either asleep or not in their room. I've been feeling sleepy way more than I used to, but whenever I try to go to sleep I'm sort of in this state where I'm neither asleep nor awake, and I keep having random thoughts/situations play out in my head and it feels like I have no control of what's happening, usually it's something that I'm scared by, like losing a friend or something like that, but then when I 'wake up' I'm surprised to be in my room and it takes me a moment to collect myself. Melatonin helps me go to sleep, but waking up is also the same, I'm lying in my bed with my eyes closed and thinking all these thoughts. Before I get into this state, when I close my eyes, I start seeing really crazy stuff, not just phosphenes like they used to be, it's almost like I'm on shrooms- I see animals morphing into shapes, etc, etc, nothing really makes sense, and I have no control over any of this. I also lose all sense of time during all of this and it feels like hours. 
Any help to help me figure out what this might be would be appreciated.

schizophrenia,struggler7,2018/03/16,"Stupid story! The following is my story, please note that I am from India and English is not my native language. I was in computer engineering department, struggling being an average student (prodromal phase). She was in electronics department, we met since our classes were common in the first year. 

It was one sided love, I kept falling for her every time I saw her, talked to her. Even though she had said ""no"" we were best friends, we used to hang out all the time even though I was shy and quiet. We use to tell each other everything or so I thought...

My schizophrenia elevated from having party with other friends once in hostel. At the party I kind of hallucinated but then things went to normal thereafter for a month. Even before this I felt depressed and was doing cognitive behavioral therapy on my own.

Even though we weren't dating I used to ask her from time to time if she's seeing some other guys. I don't know why she used to deny to the fact that she indeed was with other guys in reality. 3 years went by one day I get call her and she says that -- ""I am seeing someone!""

I was happy for her so I said I wanted to see the lucky guy, she said OK come to this another city 300 km away. I went there to find out that she was actually TESTING me, she said it was a joke. 

This made me go broke, doesn't sound much but it was a lot to take in at the time. I've been on Abilify 10-15mg ever since and have gained 30kg of weight.",2.834494252873565,4.499534282758621,4.218362068965519,86.34076149425293,75.13793103448276,7.316091954022987,23.117816091954023,8.07648339933343,1.1502643678160926,1122,32,233,18,24,371,165,290,0.061,0.8240000000000001,0.115,0.9426,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,6,0,0,3,11,13,1,1,11,1,25,2,0,5,3,39,54,15,0,3,5,0,2,0,2,0,0,7,0,3,15,16,1,1,4,1,0,10,5,4,0,3,28,13,43,9,36,25,7,39,0,2,4,1,37,15,0,5,14,163,58,4,0.0,0.0,0.09126354806779978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806550582347884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08743003043391709,0.0,0.08786658045963301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07957995601888286,0.0,0.09814510326335872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549596507395637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08056053958109087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06031366681333013,0.0,0.08054997919590101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470804230190109,0.08459560166629644,0.07879594453209207,0.0,0.08405114428187903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979535995594448,0.0,0.08547700795289345,0.07954938780902968,0.0,0.0,0.14450904444323465,0.0,0.04886115308141095,0.0,0.05315045551393817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778031318121553,0.0,0.09955543545201692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09738830915158554,0.0513970014105276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07950868259962157,0.08440685566937689,0.08849235760048903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464801379931102,0.0,0.06874910443217272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163126843219792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09959740499037552,0.12674525348614618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10265858455755457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35584166413518764,0.07437209505922518,0.0,0.0,0.22357371570914386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547239951956632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07924051096062071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776903610059642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07031657125577666,0.07516908422735495,0.08174196212578276,0.0,0.1069500498389083,0.0,0.06213156626041706,0.0,0.27565336198188617,0.07424566905236565,0.2726658570947541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3230903887642329,0.0,0.0,0.055161436824086335,0.0,0.0,0.11388406042704816,0.0,0.2600862582596712,0.08438865799653307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12044963175581495

I was diagnosed Paranoid Schizophrenia in February with delusions of command. I was in the hospital for three weeks, and I have to keep going back for counselling, but thats a voluntary program. I need a job but until then I will keep going back for help.\\

I had auditory hallucinations. Im on risperidone injection once per month. I want to keep taking it because I don't want Serafvil to come back. I want to play World of w/arcraft again but I made a priest called Serafvil. Maybe I will name change that character.

Anyway I hope everyone has a good weekend. Maybe I hope my mood improves throughout the day.",2.6575555555555543,5.458628006451613,3.6031720430107534,84.56698028673837,81.83870967741936,6.541218637992832,29.25627240143369,7.793537801064563,2.2721971326164883,651,32,117,12,18,208,100,155,0.01,0.804,0.18600000000000005,0.9696,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,0,8,7,0,0,8,2,12,1,0,3,0,23,30,9,0,6,4,0,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5,4,0,3,2,2,0,4,1,0,0,1,6,1,18,6,16,21,0,26,1,0,0,0,4,6,0,2,15,75,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12737757668444227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3314793932175896,0.0,0.08759557099293093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14672938590660595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15201100765659764,0.12378113035334927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09267184520772047,0.0,0.0,0.14584812073303022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13730740871188266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726568684762417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1633311667603303,0.12052514383053507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096316205340991,0.0,0.0,0.28544452573700074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3104320499044416,0.0,0.14259581942042854,0.38317004801750143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13596835508277025,0.09591800214443262,0.0,0.28872330913320793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11469654467011473,0.0,0.0,0.10654854809658344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15303124127612816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13762076887918165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12271535107710545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804129066005944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2724134620905197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542663581018116,0.0,0.11526403085497555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm a Psychology student, currently in the 4th grade, and I have to do an interview about schizophrenia to my Clinical Psychology class. Is there anyone who would be so kind to answer a couple of questions (maximum 10 mins), through Skype or other media?
It would help me a lot. It would be anonyme, of course, and you could reject answering any question that you wouldn't be willing to answer. If there's anyone who would be so kind to do this, please text me a private message or reply here.

schizophrenia,paperclip1213,2018/03/17,"Where can I learn more about delusions? Can anyone help me understand my experience a little more? I'm not schizophrenic. I have borderline personality disorder, but I'm coming here because you guys are more qualified with answering this particular question than the BPD sub. And I'm coming here instead of going to a professional because the NHS is ultra slow when it comes to mental health. I've been dealing with them for 4 years and I've only been seen three times.

I know very little about delusions. I've tried Google but I just see the same information being regurgitated over and over and over again. I'm not entirely sure where to go because on the other end of the spectrum, I find individuals speaking their own experiences which I can't relate to at all.

There are times when I'm more susceptible to delusions. I notice this when my paranoia is on a high. I have no idea what triggers it. Maybe stress? I'm starting a new job in 2 days and I'm not stressed per se, just a little bit anxious.

Do you have signs before full on symptoms?

Earlier this week I was experiencing a persecutory delusion where I believed I was going to be attacked and murdered by villains from a TV show. That's calmed down now but the paranoia is still making me feel insane. Are delusions awkward like this? I always assumed they were more straight forward on/off type of experiences.",4.624566596194505,6.8821225348837185,5.4487526427061335,76.88530655391122,71.71317829457364,7.79168428470754,30.331923890063425,8.575989854853784,2.55266046511628,1106,48,193,20,22,360,157,258,0.156,0.7909999999999999,0.053,-0.9817,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,2,3,0,17,9,3,3,13,0,20,3,0,2,2,35,40,12,1,0,8,0,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,2,10,11,0,0,10,2,0,7,5,6,0,1,6,5,21,3,26,32,10,40,0,0,2,0,12,19,0,2,17,128,31,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098625628687033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13390403956525146,0.0,0.08287823738087703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348438564584422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21676254690779834,0.0,0.10085945457863624,0.13354160129118495,0.0,0.0,0.12940297650967106,0.0,0.14928313456122605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3063067318401689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644140362413165,0.1221982012568565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13584451048347773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498151861189636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34783233728766744,0.0,0.0,0.05993182715644401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833336473693128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20208829793031824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11736235167962213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12599079139439254,0.0,0.0,0.0794474946680145,0.12523240321148812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13380482109873054,0.0,0.0,0.11762174976659118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06514044224921631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05790728551397765,0.3563916100283164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911903232646611,0.0,0.11907831855336685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11944936037541658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11447605321599386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349460596670721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09014665067296522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349495672302576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13277961407673142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09445227229158366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389544096677402,0.0,0.0946574178145932,0.0,0.2715491532817801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11171218602706627,0.1231970218472846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13823043391613746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08047341506169342,0.0,0.0,0.12339287606442613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09779884384156401,0.0,0.0,0.0950768195688793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632879415142217

schizophrenia,Gir247,2018/03/18,"I'm 18 years old and have been given medicine for my minor symptoms. will I get worse? I hear someone clearing there throat next to me and people knocking on my door when I'm in my room and there is nobody there. I also sometimes see flickering at the corner of my eyes like something is constantly moving behind me (kinda like in the game SCP containment breach with the giant bug one if you know what I'm talking about), basically I'm scared that as I get older things are going to get worse. when I take my medicine things seem fine but I don't like the idea of relying on something for the rest of my life. will I ever get better, will I ever get worse? P.S. My uncle suffered from schizophrenia and he from what I've heard became very badly after coming back from Vietnam.",6.057308802308802,6.104015798701299,6.101515151515155,81.79449494949498,66.33766233766234,8.143145743145743,28.799422799422803,7.3871296695380915,1.6246141414141408,619,18,118,5,9,196,98,154,0.121,0.804,0.075,-0.8573,0,0,2,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,0,1,10,8,0,1,5,0,9,4,2,0,3,16,27,10,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,3,2,2,2,0,5,6,0,1,3,1,0,3,1,3,0,1,3,4,18,5,20,21,1,22,0,1,2,0,6,8,0,3,14,74,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807940141466955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11353734162976435,0.1232854977406284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13058857335357302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12719144029886742,0.0,0.1595622634758672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26712423910852395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3857174037937314,0.0,0.08391556243927449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16641756567317764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16668417124466195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08114715554837655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10429287347995866,0.21640986809742746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569335669175604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15703243681425574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15493875787074798,0.0,0.10005463857228106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10236516986529086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14782810221712156,0.0,0.11766167018362493,0.1344192833063594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251073387977308,0.2273435866327539,0.14603426290147606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15346975779948166,0.11101795024470547,0.11867924592536212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19619042875779985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12183058204150066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4514182276278684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09508477864072204
schizophrenia,turdmogrol,2018/03/18,"We're schizophrenic symptoms in childhood just part of being a kid, or possibly something more? Edit: Title should be were, not we're.

When I was a child, I had a few symptoms, occasionally just randomly mixing words together in a nonsensical sentence, and then, one very major delusion. This disappeared, and I eventually broke out of the delusion after a year or 2, but during that year, it was debilitating. I was constantly afraid my father was trying to kill me. I wouldn't eat anything I didn't watch him make. I would stay away from Windows for fear of snipers, literally crawling on my floor and running to to get behind a wall with a fear more real than I've felt in a long time. One day he took me to get stamps, sent me inside with money, and I knew 100% that the money was poisoned. I held it with just the pads of my fingers, but when I got home and tried to wash it off, I perceived it as having spread all over my hands. For the next year and a half, I wouldn't touch my face, I stopped wearing contacts, and I wouldn't eat anything I touched. I would cry alone at night, hating myself for thinking he'd do that, but unable to shake the fear. Also, while typing this, I remember being constantly afraid my stomach had either started bleeding, developed ulcers, or was just leaking bile. I would spend days laying in a position that I  thought would be least likely to allow gastric acid to melt my vital organs, the whole time in a deep depression about my inevitable death. This was around the ages of 10-12.  As I grew up, I was still afraid of windows, especially at night or alone. I moved, was isolated and lonely, and more recently (15-17/present) the loneliness has lead to me often times blanking out in class to imagine this world I created where I had super powers, was a rockstar, and all kinds of other things I was lacking in real life. As I came out of depression, I still find myself in this or some other fantasy world. Am/was I just really paranoid?",6.852294713160852,6.550785433070871,7.064191976002999,76.73023622047245,64.74803149606299,9.776827896512936,33.36595425571804,9.23628265651192,2.854259992500937,1554,58,291,24,21,503,209,381,0.188,0.7759999999999999,0.036000000000000004,-0.9963,1,4,1,0,0,1,57.0,0,0,0,3,14,18,3,7,20,0,32,15,5,3,2,63,46,26,2,9,15,1,5,1,0,8,8,0,3,2,16,18,2,2,8,1,3,9,5,14,0,3,24,7,44,4,51,9,13,61,0,4,1,0,8,25,0,8,27,210,60,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21193113340686945,0.0,0.08181978857682674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16839000855257896,0.09108039457588717,0.0,0.0,0.09612657176471504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11701898633150057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22112833408746346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11238619031432863,0.13196703436042434,0.0,0.1762443312421452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093837885978351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3453922133291604,0.0,0.0,0.09823666822801913,0.0,0.09351236495417893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690879544003126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08182917202561693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010130530342352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10262843091031347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11319434081035135,0.10654340068468897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07226680315081473,0.04998503673949773,0.0,0.0,0.09054391757473333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06829482167105408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874268595510407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088111950595483,0.1920279195792348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1386600757801235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079517041103533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115342703067908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23290952633666065,0.06554442335661892,0.0,0.10102189184066382,0.0,0.11590085346606885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07876566094396928,0.0,0.0,0.07241777371844399,0.10905220401787936,0.16341482648107725,0.08553837414280582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21268507437623915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679723101973903,0.06555813488466866,0.0,0.0812252121005247,0.17897886051351106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11367367352566014,0.13892782480507235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441906332012399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11422897744493947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29072130318488804,0.0,0.0,0.1976589411544491
schizophrenia,Thelightofdawn1,2018/03/18,"Brother was diagnosed Hello , my brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis a few months ago but I was not understanding of it. I couldn't beleive it or I didn't want to beleive it. My brother was smoking weed , drinking alcohol , doing cocaine sometimes and taking oxycottins and something triggered him where he would think people were out to kill him or people were talking about him. 

He went on a few violent rampages too and caused alot of trouble with other people within our area - neibours etc. He has always been quite short tempered and angry and has been kicked out of school many times. 

When he first told me and my parents about his voices I didn't want and couldn't beleive in it. I thought he was lieing to himself and that it was the drugs which were causing him to be dilusional. I told him instead of getting help straight away to stop the drugs and then after a few months see if it goes away. However at this point my parents had become sick of his behavior and thought it was best to call the mental health support team so they put him on injections for it. 

 The problem is he is still drinking heavily,  much more than before and he also from time to time is smoking weed. He has been drinking every single day and he doesn't want no help to stop. He doesn't consider being supportive in this household such as doing chores or anything. He seems to be abit unsympathetic in a way towards the family or others.

 It's hard to deal with because I feel really sorry for him and I had really high hopes for him and his future. I feel depressed because I have got my life together finally and this all of a sudden hit me. I got my place at uni and was happy with myself. I just have a fear in me that in the future I'm going to have to deal with him or baby sit him in a way because I'm his only brother. I know that mental illness is hard for a person and I'm very understanding and listen to him well but he doesn't seem to help himself. 

He is always depressed and listens to music all the time. I want to help him and go places with him but he just has lost motivation to do it. He has said he wants to die sometimes aswel. I just don't know how to deal with it. It's just sad watching what is happening. 

Can someone give me advice? How to cope?

schizophrenia,Stoic_Stranger,2018/03/19,"[Poem] Lost in a World of My Own My therapist suggested I write so I thought I'd share a poem that I wrote.

I sit in my room alone

With hatred in my heart

Waiting for someone to help me

For anything to start

I’m told that I am useless 

Powerless and weak

Control out of my hands

All of a sudden meek

Nothing is my fault

It’s my illness that’s to blame

At times I’ve lost my way

At times I’ve lost my name

What if they’re all wrong?

And I deserve this shame

The horrors were my doing

Maybe I’m the one to blame

But it’s hard to draw the line

What are my limitations?

Maybe I’m just lazy

Maybe it’s my medications

They take away my soul

My goals and motivations

I’ve lost what made me special

My dreams and aspirations

Maybe it’s the fact

That I’ve lost my will to live

Maybe, maybe, maybe

Is that all I have to give?

I live in a world you can’t imagine

I’ve seen things that haunt my dreams

I’ve heard demons whisper schemes

In silence I hear screams

It’s hard to see in darkness

I cannot find my way

When lost in a different world

I find it hard to stay",-0.6722988505747125,1.4596168275862098,1.2096206896551709,100.16411494252877,91.93103448275863,4.47264367816092,18.50919540229885,6.079149491110277,-0.4065556321839073,832,25,205,8,30,271,116,232,0.25,0.6859999999999999,0.064,-0.9902,2,1,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,1,1,10,3,14,0,1,9,0,10,5,2,3,4,25,31,8,0,1,3,0,4,0,0,1,3,4,1,0,17,6,0,3,5,2,0,0,2,12,0,1,13,10,33,2,26,17,4,24,2,7,2,0,12,15,0,1,5,109,50,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09072643687202686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208674457233108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230240837897669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825004270273713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152260440813688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16012831223775742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403321276169921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354152493933845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873075655368428,0.1038055701216834,0.058715951745798974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15470354057282645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5737497811023604,0.0,0.0,0.0828885580337322,0.0,0.0,0.6160367655086902,0.0,0.0,0.08824706000397355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08405387297877118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059359540100152486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06980528568368373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422258678014591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06200322217940037,0.09336917841692463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06586375767702791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10170951731026162,0.058197070067379425,0.0,0.0,0.06954404442227535,0.10215969076855494,0.0,0.0,0.08370486727259441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13906446417953816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577606254253053,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,theputtyslumpkin,2018/03/19,"Do you have a steady job? And if you do, how do you handle bad mental health days while at work? A few weeks ago I started a job that I’m extremely excited to have. I’ve been doing great.. more than great, actually, for three months now. Doctors say it’s mania, but whatever. I’m not going to complain about feeling like I can do anything and being mega-productive and on top of the world. But today is the first bad day I’ve had in a while. I’ve been distracted at work because of the things I’m seeing and hearing every few minutes. My boss has kind of gotten onto me for not being “with it” and I have no idea how to handle this. Everything has put me in an awful mood, because I really am trying my best despite the things I’m currently experiencing. I don’t know how to explain anything (or even if I should explain anything) to my boss. I work at a medical practice where the doctors (my bosses) don’t really believe in mental health issues...

I was just wondering if you guys are able to hold a job, and what you do to help yourself get through the bad stuff. Today is just one of those days where I feel like I should walk out and apply for disability or something. I feel utterly inadequately equipped to have a job right now.",4.229319259962047,5.097712762096776,5.56312144212524,81.16100569259964,70.5725806451613,8.41593927893738,28.7011385199241,8.671277953709913,2.0981851992409872,967,35,193,16,17,325,134,248,0.096,0.7959999999999999,0.107,0.1953,5,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,5,0,6,11,13,0,1,14,1,27,5,0,6,0,37,44,19,0,5,11,0,3,2,0,2,5,2,0,1,9,9,0,1,8,0,0,3,5,5,0,3,5,7,22,7,28,35,4,32,0,0,1,0,12,14,0,6,17,136,31,12,0.10386696453202422,0.0,0.10135917439349368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207179708361236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25642098531276825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601737305747,0.12663267504082382,0.0,0.0,0.1170225007177854,0.1090019711938869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20095679827071128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21262447883732105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686031504807292,0.0,0.0875123973636775,0.0,0.093348930340848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15755477436145088,0.14840516043055788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834918697047638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05426620201711517,0.0,0.05902998955868631,0.0,0.0,0.2290273901583064,0.0,0.10284462482760526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22081145251862247,0.11706561784863848,0.0,0.06961983690416987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11725316022628025,0.0,0.10841012548685844,0.41228774144995,0.0,0.0,0.10816146008097027,0.057082567351009875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014883046946325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10463503940713532,0.20934694095500406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08290562014081798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038294326506986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10441498760278768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13307967428968964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08870182019089631,0.0,0.08259917911056107,0.0,0.0,0.0827685230307922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799618637775157,0.0,0.0,0.0735175720960993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890282443562375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380091919120222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19690747506194384,0.0,0.0,0.07051885091062846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08331581378887032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126392923669122,0.2268491616866723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’m so nervous, I don’t even know if I have it or if I’m just crazy but I’ve been thinking about it nonstop and I don’t know what to do.",0.2877994955863841,2.3006685491803296,3.3519672131147544,87.74568095838589,84.81967213114754,6.0489281210592685,22.499369482976046,7.321109707123232,0.8786158890290041,441,16,98,7,13,158,76,122,0.059,0.841,0.101,0.5842,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,9,5,0,1,6,0,9,2,0,0,0,19,20,14,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,5,6,0,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,2,0,2,2,11,4,15,18,0,16,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,3,10,64,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19018083602201016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2249687113107185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24171828643340235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21907401606363552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43919096210649744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14170467966776604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11209069437389267,0.0,0.12193063587589785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2418073479294549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358161939912868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228170607660048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22512845913024915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1518557665475732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13747151169057598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456616949630699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3441894613142445,0.0,0.3858027081459641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1381596831954984
schizophrenia,philosolobster1999,2018/03/19,"Is this avolition Hello everyone. I have gone through something that seems like avolition and I would like to know if it matches other people's experience. I'm not wondering if I have schizophrenia, I am just wondering if I am correctly understanding the nature of this particular symptom. (if I really match the negative symptoms then I will talk to my doctor about it, but when I asked him, he didn't seem to think there was any reason to think I have schizophrenia)

When I am at home, I get lost in the internet or video games. It feels rather addictive. Then I can't will myself to go to class, study or do homework. I wish that I could, I know that it's important, but I just can't force myself to do these things. Then, I have a backlog of missed emails and messages on my phone. I can't will myself to open them up and look at them, because the weight of all that I have to do gives me a little anxiety. I don't feel like I don't care about school, I feel like I care very much about school but just lack the ability to get myself to start working. I tell myself ""tomorrow, I'll pull myself out of the hole"" but it just goes on. for several weeks. People thought i was missing or dead. Btw I'm not depressed - I always feel alright, except for some angst and anxiety when I have to face the backlog of work and missed classes.

But it is environment dependent. Once I get myself back on track, after I have gone to some classes and caught up on my emails and messages and homework, I can get myself to work. When I'm in class, in my school office, I don't have much of a problem at all. Finally, when I'm working with others in a group environment, I find that I'm often MORE motivated and ready to work than most other people! In your experience, is avolition like this, being so environment-dependent? My therapist was not sure.",4.5532231404958665,5.5351271101928425,5.513571349862257,81.39472066115705,69.9090909090909,9.003592286501377,28.569586776859502,9.281916038205594,2.3264630082644624,1443,51,288,29,25,475,161,363,0.108,0.787,0.105,0.1629,0,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,0,1,2,7,17,15,0,0,11,1,34,6,1,3,4,64,72,30,1,10,21,0,5,5,0,4,4,0,3,0,19,12,1,0,17,2,0,5,11,6,0,0,9,6,50,9,46,57,9,36,0,5,1,0,17,17,0,16,19,211,69,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795733754720584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08240090852326362,0.0,0.0,0.06734380846557331,0.0,0.15151538619430482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09257969922977127,0.0,0.0,0.07614797147000511,0.0,0.06036778011558064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2019354077356297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07906741162811354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0852944098258933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013614201982495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462742651712402,0.0,0.19374072093184985,0.0,0.0,0.20029021149548248,0.14149413001030295,0.0,0.10848254472016856,0.09051164283101693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069563894166047,0.09499861746043334,0.05628104166250918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993351829719378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088486166202422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419053242037857,0.0992540946586061,0.0,0.0,0.0831602741944156,0.0,0.10810296346262643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14559691627826712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546373771474364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20596483736186733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09475835341053526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06344116566109942,0.10181935244661927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3006709970539607,0.0,0.18030641907416012,0.0,0.11187573313347557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07623814641200485,0.0,0.0,0.07009395680061117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933346204662558,0.2058602142814285,0.0,0.0795965776816907,0.08655660109573261,0.0,0.0,0.11498148421913898,0.06579114394123066,0.1269088743987238,0.0,0.07861877293038927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10309374174203867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08171013652690859,0.0,0.0,0.0794359074438844,0.1205918836934442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11387963399716375,0.0,0.2147876614558839,0.3604751645573845,0.0,0.0,0.07034808383397227,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,marleebelle98,2018/03/19,"My boyfriend of 2+ years recently was hospitalized from having severe symptoms of schizophrenia. My boyfriend of 2+ years recently was hospitalized from having severe symptoms of schizophrenia. We’ve been living together for over a year, and he got these symptoms after taking and quitting unprescribed anti psychotics and anti depressants. I was able to talk him into getting help and, although he genuinely didn’t believe he needed it, was committed. He seemed like he was starting to make some headway, until yesterday when he escaped which means now nobody can visit him. He called me three times that night, but told me he was going to discontinue taking the medication and going to the groups and classes. Today he called me and was immediately infuriated by me asking how he was; he ended saying he couldn’t talk to me because he was too annoyed. I want to give him his space, but I want to show him support because I’m afraid being in that stressful environment could make him lose momentum on his growing process. I’ve been taking him books and calling every now and then, but letting him call me whenever he feels he wants to. How can I show him support and that getting help is not only okay, but could also be what he needs to help him find mental balance?",10.979267241379313,8.901672185344829,10.089896551724141,64.04475862068968,57.75,12.21103448275862,42.59655172413793,10.577609850970193,4.640203793103447,1025,45,163,17,10,327,129,232,0.11,0.794,0.096,-0.6484,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,2,7,9,1,2,3,1,23,4,0,4,1,34,48,21,0,8,5,0,1,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,7,11,0,0,4,3,0,4,3,5,0,1,14,2,23,4,23,28,1,26,0,2,0,0,42,5,0,2,18,105,30,2,0.10382899463902984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303200950044963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706609410348696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265863828521327,0.0,0.0,0.11697972165082983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4240840492159331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16579800715415588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942776094048019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196167117184098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748040609120168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052499059401718035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09489782007923678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084927286303503,0.09960223265826183,0.11801682078696216,0.0,0.08304153197200134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20878315945580025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061721816480186,0.0,0.050725602175532576,0.0,0.0916829045016268,0.0,0.0,0.11615808657281322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861332033381799,0.0,0.0,0.11310021367469755,0.0,0.10459678873457882,0.10463520575597783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15397576782485325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743647789973904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07896662913667006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11043491636218036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20503721236559344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256898392765204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09452201717505206,0.0,0.23459442038754105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07349069681040793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893576255745412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23564782537423504,0.0,0.3237542425258725,0.23419944687220345,0.16690762583687407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06054352174467512,0.0,0.09841774651211632,0.09921305387140704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18372309346377164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20058740514068368

schizophrenia,koreancryptotrader,2018/03/20,"early signs of schizophrenia? Just read http://schizophrenia.com/earlysigns.htm and I'm like ....not sure how to describe what I'm feeling...but it hits so many points

Please just bare with me I'm fucking serious and concerned about my mental health....

Examples of Physical Symptoms----

&gt; --A blank, vacant facial expression. An inability to smile or express emotion through the face is so characteristic of the disease that it was given the name of affective flattening or a blunt affect.

this is pretty much me.

&gt; --Overly acute senses- lights are too bright, sounds are too loud.

I don't think so but I can hear small sounds other people cannot (phone ringing in a noisy room)

&gt; --Staring, while in deep thought, with infrequent blinking.

yup....I zone out like this

&gt; --Clumsy, inexact motor skills

yeah always tripping knocking over shit....

&gt; --Sleep disturbances- insomnia or excessive sleeping

can't fucking sleep normally wake up during night or fall asleep really late and end up sleeping a lot waking up during afternoon. might be the espresso

&gt; --Involuntary movements of the tongue or mouth (facial dyskinesias). Grimacing at the corners of the mouth with the facial      muscles, or odd movements with the tongue.

used to stick my tongue out and touch the top left corner of my mouth . I don't do this as much anymore but sometimes happens.

&gt; --Parkinsonian type symptoms- rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs

I'm shaking my legs a lot...restless when im sitting or even in bed

&gt; --An awkward gait (how you walk)

I guess I have a weird awkward way of walking but not sure

&gt; --Eye movements- difficulty focusing on slow moving objects

hmmm I guess I have choppy eye movements but not trouble.

&gt; --Unusual gestures or postures

I have forward shoulder problem or sometimes lean to the right...can't seem to sit still straight

&gt; --Movement is speeded up- i.e. constant pacing 

sometimes I experience this just on the move, even during meals.

&gt; --Movement is slowed down- staying in bed (in extreme cases, catatonia)

what I feel these days....can't seem to get out of bed.

Examples of Feelings/Emotions----

&gt; --The inability to experience joy or pleasure from activities (called anhedonia)

used to feel this when hanging out with friends although now that im on zoloft i find social activities fun again

&gt; --Sometimes feeling nothing at all

yeah just absolutely emptyness
 
&gt; --Appearing desireless- seeking nothing, wanting nothing

yeah pretty much me

&gt; --Feeling indifferent to important events

yup....

&gt; --Feeling detached from your own body (depersonalization)

feel detached from reality sometimes...

&gt; --Hypersensitivity to criticism, insults, or hurt feelings

yeah this is me

Examples of Mood----

&gt; --Sudden irritability, anger, hostility, suspiciousness, resentment

yup 

&gt; --Depression- feeling discouraged and hopeless about the future

yeah but better on zoloft

&gt; --Low motivation, energy, and little or no enthusiasm

yeah this is me although zoloft helps

&gt; --Suicidal thoughts or suicidal ideation

reduced a lot after i started zoloft...before used to have them frequently daily

&gt; --Rapidly changing mood- from happy to sad to angry for no apparent reason (called labile mood)

used to get this but improved with zoloft

--Severe Anxiety

anxiety is still there but a bit improved with zoloft but worse in some ways hard to say

Changes in Behavior associated with schizophrenia ----

&gt; --Dropping out of activities and life in general

this is me.

&gt; --Inability to form or keep relationships

yeahp

&gt; --Social isolation- few close friends if any. Little interaction outside of immediate family.

yeah hang out with family at home and sometimes with a few friends.

&gt; --Increased withdrawal, spending most of the days alone.
pretty much

&gt; --Becoming lost in thoughts and not wanting to be disturbed with human contact
yeah sometimes when i get ideas

&gt; --Neglect in self-care- i.e. hygiene, clothing, or appearance
yeah this happens but I try to groom when going out

&gt; --Replaying or rehearsing conversations out loud- i.e. talking to yourself (very common sign)

THIS. I DO THIS ALL THE TIME. REHEARSING CONVO...talking to myself

&gt; --Finding it difficult to deal with stressful situations
yeah but zoloft helps

&gt; --Inability to cope with minor problems

yeap

&gt; --Lack of goal-directed behavior. Not being able to engage in purposeful activity
yeap this is me

&gt; --Functional impairment in interpersonal relationships, work, education, or self-care

oh yeah big time

&gt; --Deterioration of academic or job-related performance

yeah seem to only do well in day trading alone not really passionate about anything else or good at if anything.

&gt; --Inappropriate responses- laughing or smiling when talking of a sad event, making      irrational statements.

oh yeah...wtf is wrong with me

&gt; --Catatonia- staying in the same rigid position for hours, as if in a daze.

i do this lying down in bed....it feels like i can't move sometimes

&gt; --Intense and excessive preoccupation with religion or spirituality 

well lately mild interest but theoretical science of things too

&gt; --Drug or alcohol abuse

eh much better than before but just zoloft and sometimes reefer

&gt; --Smoke or have the desire to want to smoke (70-90% do smoke) - note: this is a very normal behavior for people who do not have schizophrenia also! 

quit for 5 years and counting and not really wanting to take up this addiction again. unhealthy as fuck.

&gt; --Frequent moves, trips, or walks that lead nowhere

sometimes I just walk around downtown smoking a reefer going nowhere

Examples of Cognitive Problems Associated with Schizophrenia ----

&gt; --Ruminating thoughts- these are the same thoughts that go around and round your head but get you nowhere. Often about past disappointments, missed opportunities, failed relationships.

yeah but MUCH better with zoloft...my god this thing is a wonder in some cases

&gt; --Making up new words (neologisms)

THIS IS ME 100%. I DO IT CONSTANTLY....it makes my family nuts

&gt; --Becoming incoherent or stringing unrelated words together (word salad)

YUP but not as bad as above...

&gt; --Frequent loose association of thoughts or speech- when one thought does not logically relate to the next. For example, ""I need to go to the store to buy some band-aids. I read an article about how expensive AIDS drugs are. People take too many street drugs. The streets should be clean from the rain today, etc"" The need to go to the store to buy band-aids is forgotten.

I guess sometimes? I'm not sure....maybe I have made such weird statements

&gt; --Directionless- lack goals, or the ability to set and achieve goals

yeah again only interested in making money ....day trading, online poker, sports betting you name it...if it ain't crypto I'm not tradin it!

&gt; --Lack of insight (called anosognosia). Those who are developing schizophrenia are unaware that they are becoming sick.      The part of their brain that should recognize that something is wrong is damaged by the disease.

yeah I often say weird shit like ""fuck donald in the ass"" or ""ass rape"" a lot....I realize that this might make me seem such way.

&gt; --Racing thoughts 

yeah...but its a given

&gt; --In conversation you tend to say very little (called poverty of speech or alogia)

yeah I do this....

&gt; --Suddenly halting speech in the middle of a sentence (thought blocking)

hahahha used to do this shit all the time with coworkers

&gt; --Trouble with social cues- i.e. not being able to interpret body language, eye contact, voice tone, and gestures appropriately.

100% ME

&gt; --Often not responding appropriately and thus coming off as cold, distant, or detached.

yup....people get wrong idea ALL the time

&gt; --Difficulty expressing thoughts verbally. Or not having much to say about anything. 
yeah

&gt; --Speaking in an abstract or tangential way. Odd use of words or language structure

yeah for sure

&gt; --Difficulty focusing attention and engaging in goal directed behavior

yup

&gt; --Poor concentration/ memory. Forgetfulness

oh yeah

&gt; --Nonsensical logic

yup

&gt; --Difficulty understanding simple things

yeah unfortunately....

&gt; --Thoughts, behavior, and actions are not integrated 

yeah they are separate no?

&gt; --Obsessive compulsive tendencies- with thoughts or actions

big time

&gt; --Thought insertion/ withdrawal- thoughts are put it or taken away without a conscious effort

perhaps.

&gt; --Conversations that seem deep, but are not logical or coherent

yeah but not that often

&gt; --Overpowering, intense feeling that people are talking about you, looking at you

this one

&gt; --Thinking people are working together to harass you

this one

&gt; --Delusions of reference- thinking that random events convey a special meaning to you. An example is that a newspaper headline or a license plate has a hidden meaning for you to figure out. That they are signs trying to tell you something. 

but what about wall street journal?

&gt; --Delusions of grandeur- the belief that you have an important mission, special purpose, or are an unrecognized genius, or famous person.

not really 

&gt; --Delusions that someone, often a famous person, is in love with you when in reality they aren't. Also called erotomania or de Clerembault syndrome. 

used to get this in high school ?

Examples of Hallucinations----


&gt; --Auditory hallucinations can be either inside the person's head or externally. When external, they sound as real as an actual voice. Sometimes they come from no apparent source, other times they come from real people who don't actually say anything, other times a person will hallucinate sounds. 

sometimes I hear someone calling my name inside my name which is pretty loud but very rare and often when im tired.

what do you think am I schizophrenic?

schizophrenia,Itstartedin1990,2018/03/20,Anyone else feel chronic lightheadedness? My head feels light all the time and all I feel is a chronic adrenaline in my stomach all the the time when I'm anxious. It drives me nuts. I got off meds because they were causing me to feel even worse with akethesia at any dose.

schizophrenia,adkn,2018/03/21,"Dating an alcoholic who also has schizophrenia, need advice About a month and a half ago I started dating this wonderful and gorgeous man who I’ve had a crush on for what seems like forever (approximately 1.5 years), and it turned out he had a crush on me the entire time also. Tall, hilarious blonde-haired blue-eyed pretty boy that plays many different instruments and listens to the exact same types of music that I do so he’s basically the man of my dreams. It’s going well so far, but he told me on the first date that he suffers from schizophrenia but that he’s finally on anti-psychotics that seem to work for him, and he hasn’t had any delusions or psychotic episodes in front of me as of yet. However, he does get distant at times and sometimes won’t respond to my texts for multiple days at a time and makes me really worried about him as he’s told me that he thinks about suicide every day, and on top of all of this he’s an alcoholic (he’s tried going to AA but is turned off by the spirituality component). He’s also tried therapy but has gotten involuntarily hospitalized by every therapist he’s seen, so I don’t really know what his options for help in these two areas are. I really care for him and sometimes his behaviors make me really anxious, but I don’t want to force him to change or come off as boring or controlling like his previous boyfriends have. I want him to know that I’m a safe person to open up to and that he shouldn’t feel compelled to be distant or to push me away :(

I know I’m probably never going to experience what neurotypicals would view as a “normal relationship” and that I kinda have to play by a completely different ballgame. Two of my aunts suffer from schizophrenia and I’ve personally seen how severe the delusions can be; I could pay off my tuition with the amount of times I’ve had to prevent my aunt from hiding her own meds from herself. I myself have MDD and have to take two pills a day just to function and know that trying to communicate emotions while in my catatonic phases/episodes can be like pulling hen’s teeth. But I’ve also never dated someone with specifically schizophrenia before and I’d like some help, advice, pointers, really anything, because I would like to see where this could go and, quite frankly, I’ve never been more in love with a person more that I have with him.",9.957434210526316,7.169200401315791,9.65859649122807,68.56184210526321,60.337719298245624,12.84561403508772,38.91228070175438,11.10113133989139,4.117778070175438,1877,68,352,37,19,614,220,456,0.081,0.79,0.129,0.947,3,0,2,0,0,1,37.0,0,0,0,5,16,15,0,0,19,0,29,5,1,5,5,68,64,39,1,9,11,2,1,5,0,4,3,1,0,6,22,23,2,3,9,3,2,8,8,3,2,5,10,6,37,12,66,45,7,53,0,2,4,1,43,23,0,10,27,226,59,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.160193431270395,0.07265835710964835,0.17519452284067552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621943233159505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05574003108496147,0.0,0.0,0.09259881471806948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0674514459056472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07701022538351414,0.0,0.0,0.04996601791377374,0.0,0.06974745479983492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357031003148914,0.0,0.08670968914938988,0.0706068823630562,0.08594031628690266,0.0,0.09193240005368296,0.13088716193446345,0.0,0.0,0.1585848356919248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17127509466557025,0.0,0.0,0.07172943694219094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220128066304502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13812062369972494,0.0,0.0,0.0801789656185301,0.0,0.0,0.041444725466034935,0.0,0.0,0.08979029479702058,0.0,0.06972066344505533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04282411346400949,0.0,0.18633380459116666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10988083499890748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801865802427544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20022345926024848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739779668789857,0.0,0.10942655111612618,0.08310116634692896,0.0,0.0,0.09104630402069902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06542487868590291,0.0,0.0,0.06077712152033472,0.18965285475943655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030976734530726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2147099599003517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08338939848821192,0.08837375088226121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08718146272817437,0.0,0.0,0.2625491954337281,0.0,0.0,0.08800134642086985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531668865274969,0.14923844720111962,0.0,0.09259881471806948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06944994987469337,0.0,0.16213392972721852,0.0,0.05801631092680664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08965804783581212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06162860751239835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09373583676283194,0.0951694246375475,0.0,0.05252082385241527,0.0,0.0,0.19118130237379924,0.0,0.0,0.15664500763275913,0.0,0.1669496202330061,0.1783120305221998,0.2402080823441474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09669193133680552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369772772240499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888917332569236,0.05967258857377175,0.08324095999724727,0.0,0.11645330043006526,0.0,0.0,0.05278373893893613

schizophrenia,BreMarieNirvana,2018/03/21,"I don't think I'm schizophrenic, but I hear thingsthat make me paranoid. I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I get so scared.

I waited and it was ""definitely"" a knock. I live on the second floor... then I heard walking, breathing, and the snap of a camera. I texted my boyfriend, and he told me to turn around. Nothing was there. But I am still so afraid. Does this happen to anyone else? What is this? Does it go away?",1.4575372208436723,3.7157628306451613,2.5945161290322574,93.45023573200994,81.98387096774194,5.105707196029776,23.248138957816376,6.297961479604792,0.3795888337468982,477,17,104,4,13,152,80,124,0.094,0.8690000000000001,0.037000000000000005,-0.7581,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,1,0,5,3,0,3,8,0,10,2,1,1,0,15,24,13,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,0,8,5,0,1,3,0,0,2,2,3,0,1,6,2,17,0,11,18,0,13,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,1,3,69,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345138261469117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14859431348282173,0.21774509639736514,0.0,0.18918198530230107,0.0,0.0,0.19966333887147392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394298333598361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2169999462330212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3719438244447626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17752768018433773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11102948258953403,0.0,0.12077626504798385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1879249016032634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2395180516716291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11679180930823102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18765322943999804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14185434757676313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20391234296257998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21620253214068008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814852861351703,0.0,0.0,0.2127629909867513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697134792041502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361700085726364,0.0,0.168711905051912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2030656648889618,0.0,0.0,0.2311535591391485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,ssmads,2018/03/21,"Not diagnosed, but hoping someone can offer me advice on my ""delusion"". (had a previous episode with psychosis, and feel like it could be coming back) I really hope this is okay to post here + that I don't come off as insensitive or anything since I haven't been diagnosed with schizophrenia but I did go through an episode of psychosis and am currently feeling another episode coming on.
(if this isn't the place to post this though, please lmk + I'll take this down.)

Recently, I went through something my therapist told me was psychosis and it was honestly the worst I've felt in my life mental health wise. I've dealt with depression/anxiety most of my life (21/f now), but this was a whole different level. 
It all started with this paranoid thought pertaining to my boyfriend, it gradually started getting more intense to the point where no one could convince me it wasn't true, not even him. I ended up barely eating at all; felt suicidal; unable to do anything but sit, think about it constantly, cry, etc.; was only sleeping maybe 2 hours a night, and that went on for a week (the whole thing probably built up over a month) until my mom finally made me see a therapist which is where she told me what I was going through + explained all the info about it. She was going to get me prescribed meds but I couldn't afford any then. It eventually went away almost as soon as it came on, I looked back on it + thought the whole ""delusion"" was super weird and wondered how I could've even thought it. 

Anyway, super long story short - I've felt fine these past couple weeks, until today; I started getting the same paranoia about the same ""delusion"" + can actually feel it getting more intense as it did the last time. I'm also getting these ""signs"" of confirmation about it - such as, I'll be watching tv + someone on the show will say something similar to what my ""delusion"" is, or I'll hear someone talking about something similar + it just instantly clicks on my mind like, ""yep it's not a delusion, and here's your sign to know what you're thinking is real"".
At this point, idk what to think or do. I've asked my boyfriend if it's true + he keeps denying it/saying I'm being delusional, but I feel like he's just doing that to hide the truth. It really feels like an intuition to me, that just came back out of nowhere. 

**My next therapy appointment is next week, is there anything I can do to calm myself until then or? Also, if it really is a delusion, how can I let it go (especially when I keep getting signs that confirm it)? Are meds like the best option for that?**
I'm just scared to stop believing it in case it really is true + I'll end up looking stupid. My boyfriend's now mad at me because I won't let this go, and if it isn't true, then I'm sure it would be insulting; but I just feel like he's mad because I figured out the truth. Everything just feels unreal and I don't know who to trust anymore. Idk I'm sorry for rambling, hopefully this makes sense, I'm just scared of getting as bad as I did before. Thanks in advance for anyone who reads all this/comments.

Im frequently am experiencing brain fog, as if my IQ temporarely lowers, its much harder to focus and think

Furthermore on marihuana all my senses become stronger, a higher perception of depth, HPPD like symptoms like static on the walls etc. Aswell as depersonalization

When sober I also sometimes experience these symptoms

I have vivid dreams that seem more real than real life quite often

schizophrenia,klukluxkafka,2018/03/22,"Hatred of Women I keep going over and over in my head memories of being rejected by this girl I knew in college. It causes me to want to lash out at every women I see, especially young, fit, attractive ones that I know think that I'm not good enough for them. I live downtown and I literally cannot sit down in a cafe to read and do homework without my concentration being distracted by homicidal ideations towards the women in my immediate vicinity. I have fantasies of passing girls in the streets and saying, menacingly ""I can smell your c*unt.""

I know that this sounds like Eliot Rodger but the difference is that I recognize how harmful and counterproductive these thoughts are. I don't want to act on these hateful urges. I want to do well in school, be happy, land a career, and eventually be in a healthy relationship. 

I can't get it off my head how I was rejected by this girl in college. I wasn't sexually attracted to her (she was fat, but had a nice face), and she made a point to not talk to me. I keep thinking of how she made unfavorable comparisons of me to high-status fraternity boys.

My insecurity at being rejected by this girl was that I dropped out of college and yelled at my family for giving me shitty genes. I got a nose job because I was insecure about my nose.

And then I see these good-looking women working cushy jobs downtown, and I just seethe in my hatred. 

I'm not going to act on anything harmful because I have a good support system, and am very honest with social workers, friends, and family about my latent misogyny.

It's fucking hell having to deal with this every day.

schizophrenia,DrErik,2018/03/22,"15-minute pharmacology lectures on schizophrenia-related topics Hello r/schizophrenia.
I've been very busy for the last several months trying to set up some services that I hope will help physicians (including psychiatrists) and nurse practitioners to improve their abilities to help people with schizophrenia and related conditions. 

Part of that effort has resulted in recordings of weekly lectures about schizophrenia-related topics. The lectures are geared toward educating clinicians. But on the other hand, they're not *excessively* technical. And they're relatively short - about 15 minutes per topic. 

They're on a YouTube channel called [15-Minute Pharmacology](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMKHzQuZuD_1Or0ZuYwXQ8w)",12.589019607843134,16.98295084313726,8.843725490196082,51.84343137254905,55.27450980392157,11.2,45.647058823529406,10.980518767755715,6.77189411764706,614,35,60,17,9,173,75,102,0.0,0.838,0.162,0.9371,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,4,0,4,2,1,1,0,9,5,4,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,15,3,2,11,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,2,3,35,5,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32547632107183644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4272987851791173,0.0,0.0,0.31658768805217025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598213444188398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544208112657261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451719351115834,0.0,0.2209790331081824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36009337787113344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21640828725163272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26299965367093475,0.0,0.0,0.25567961375144743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He started on risperidal, which didn't  work and was hospitalized there times while  on  it, then went on Clozapine but couldn't keep up with the blood work went off of it and was hospitalized, and is now on zyprexa, but he still seems a bit off and there doesn't seem to be any traction on a job search and still living with his parents, which I think is a good thing at this point. 

Any positive results on Zyprexa?

Also, when is a good time for his parents and siblings to start talking to him about a job?

schizophrenia,innocently_evil,2018/03/24,"People diagnosed with schizophrenia, how has that affected your work life and do any of you have successful jobs/careers? **please read entire post before answering** 


Hello! Sorry if that question sounded rude, I wasn't quite sure how to phrase it but I hope you get the point.

 14f here,I believe I have schizophrenia and am currently gathering up the courage to tell my parents and request perfesional help and get a diagnosis or see if I am overreacting/have something else. On the outside I am normal, nobody knows what I experience. People say I am nice,kind,helpful,and easy to talk to. But I know Im not normal. The voices,the hallucinations,the self harm and much more. Part of me wants to tell no one. I am completely functional, have high grades, and again no one can tell. Im afraid that once I get the diagnosis everyone will know and I will be judged. Schizophrenia is a serious, highly misunderstood condition. I am always thinking about my future. I reallly want to become a child pshycologyst so that I can help other kids who may or may not experince what I am feeling now.  I am wondering If I would be able to become a psychologist if I need one myself? Wont colleges and employers know about my condition? My future is important to me and I feel if getting a diagnosis will effect me in the way I think it would I think I just won't tell anyone. I am coming here hoping to find some success stories that will change my view.

The lunatic is on the grass. 


Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs. 


Got to keep the loonies on the path. 




The lunatic is in the hall. 

The lunatics are in my hall. 

The paper holds their folded faces to the floor 

And every day the paper boy brings more. 




And if the dam breaks open many years too soon 

And if there is no room upon the hill 

And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too 

I'll see you on the dark side of the moon. 




The lunatic is in my head. 

The lunatic is in my head 

You raise the blade, you make the change 

You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane. 

You lock the door 

And throw away the key 

There's someone in my head but it's not me. 





And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear 

You shout and no one seems to hear. 

And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes 

I'll see you on the dark side of the moon. 





""I can't think of anything to say except... 

I think it's marvelous! HaHaHa!""

schizophrenia,MegalowGigolos,2018/03/24,"Identity Compromised Hi,

My identity was compromised and people were told to antagonize me.  I've been pushed to several psychotic breaks.  These sicko people's goal was for me to lose control.

Be careful, do not give people the benefit of a doubt and know there are some sicko mother fuckers out there.  My life is basically being ruined, my career, identity, reputation, everything, I have been completely alienated.

This is an atrocity on to me and people were getting off on it.  These sick fucks are basically praying on peoples genuine incompetence.

Be careful.

schizophrenia,Lostsoullll,2018/03/24,"Already dead I had a psychotic break after a move to a new city. Everything was going well until depression slowly took me under. It was a slow descent into maddness. I used to think I had such a good understanding of the world, and a spiritual grasp of reality that other people didn't after a number of spiritual experiences whilst travelling the world. I guess they turned on me somehow or maybe I had symptoms sooner. 
In this new city I had a seady job and a place to live with good rent. This giant wave started to grow from the beginning of the year I moved there and slowly crushed me. Ive been depressed before but never new the ground could fall out beneath me and it did. 
Im staying with my parents now after being driven home by my sister because I was too incapcitated to drive safely. They all think this is a phase and will pass, but they don't know how severe things have gotten. Ive been here for a month now and taking meds seeing doctors and therapists. No one really knows how severe things are. I feel like Ive lost my personality, my creativity, my beautiful essence that once touched so many, my cognitive function, my ability to write.EVERYTHING. The saddest part is my parents always thought of me being the most successful, everyone always saying I can wait to see what you become. you have so many gifts you beautiful soul... and this is what ive become. A once intesely feeling person wih a bright light to share... a lifeless zombie, a corpse, I feel nothing, and not just depressed feel nothing Just  The scariest day of my life will be the day I watch the hope drain from my fathers eyes. a deep darkness in my whole body and chest. Nothing helps. Every waking hour of every day is sheer torment. I never knew in my wildest dreams, things could get this dark. I dont want to be remembered like this.",4.850306369847921,6.424166401146138,5.502306590257881,79.52175170817723,69.80229226361031,8.119947101608991,28.609323341415035,8.617729084823388,2.1960719858937634,1450,53,264,24,26,469,198,349,0.1,0.747,0.153,0.9718,4,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,0,3,3,3,14,14,0,0,26,0,33,7,4,3,3,48,61,18,1,4,6,4,5,2,0,2,3,1,2,2,16,14,0,2,13,2,1,10,7,4,1,1,17,12,41,10,34,36,4,47,1,4,5,0,15,14,0,5,23,182,57,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974807785625574,0.0,0.1470049642617116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05384869850035917,0.19511995516812145,0.07516728011355904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09812118674822723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.141057935269917,0.0,0.0,0.1709078962153879,0.0,0.22825054771039216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041545913024257,0.0,0.0,0.10352892801674833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14885348348397767,0.08440866552703273,0.15878108564428073,0.08640938633760346,0.0,0.0,0.17866098754573473,0.06310713042543141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04615182219339788,0.0,0.050203284566172256,0.1481837964699532,0.0,0.0,0.09731186937370624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05920964089068227,0.0,0.08860803408859025,0.08773740516075983,0.08699299289424227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541784858906713,0.0,0.08765967503085273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09709411754651913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06239420500014028,0.08631284333292401,0.0,0.07800215111466305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642898704158062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17911732167115174,0.08874520850371989,0.0,0.09812118674822723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07050881206622213,0.18777400255520085,0.0,0.0,0.13626006663564955,0.2559458682677813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542818171162565,0.0,0.0,0.18814953950763025,0.05985864059535664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19617295776445465,0.09565908929477364,0.0,0.06124093795034316,0.15426286875812956,0.0922921349184037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05659019092063931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006726872588374,0.0,0.0,0.07024819290704974,0.0,0.0,0.14078442994490398,0.0,0.0,0.1995886750010312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06252455099767927,0.09415423509199433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09181474447822964,0.06641754623430357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256470032500327,0.17605918922157068,0.11320405854634095,0.0,0.07012877717039122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981443509307786,0.0,0.09608401040830096,0.0,0.09196070827371912,0.0,0.0762937898221419,0.0,0.0,0.052102757787886166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07942451461979272,0.0,0.0,0.0986237930129832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056885374550948865

schizophrenia,prettyraddude,2018/03/24,"I need help getting across my older brother (23) who will not go to the doctor or get social security. We are a low income family of 7 people. Recently, rent in our area has shot up, and it has gotten very difficult for our family to afford expenses month to month.


We seeked help from various organizations for low-income families and the overwhelming majority of advisers tell us that my older brother should apply for social security to help us with living expenses and his cigarette addiction. 


My older brother was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder since mid 2017 and since then has refused to go to the doctor and is not working. He loves eating healthy though, but his request for specific ingredients like seasonings, vegetables and meats is very expensive. He also has a cigarette addiction he is very demanding about and sometimes resorts to stealing our spare change to buy swishers. 


Recently, he has gained weight very quickly and it's very concerning for us since diabetes and heart disease also runs in our family. However, he refuses to go to the doctor claiming he doesn't need to because he's eating healthy and feels fine. He often indulges on alcohol and sugary snacks despite having a healthy breakfast. He has had appointments with doctors and psychologists that my mother has tried to make for them to which he bails on last minute, despite us living literally across the street from the doctor's claiming he ""doesn't feel like it today"".


The social security office has requested a recent appointment and doctor's note as proof of his diagnosis and is requiring proof of treatment and regular doctor's visits in order for him to qualify. Even presented with the idea that he can get ""free"" money, he says he doesn't want to go to therapy/to the doctors and that he just wants to work for his money. When asked when/how/where he will work he says he'll figure it out ""next week/next month/next year"".


It's very frustrating that he's very demanding of resources and money for his hobbies but won't try to help us out with bills. Is there anything we can do?

schizophrenia,Okioter,2018/03/25,"Any males here experience housing discrimination? This post contains traumatic points in my life, if you have experienced abuse at the hands of a family member and can't stand reliving it don't read. 

Okay so I'm gonna level with you guys, at the age of 4 I was raped multiple times by an older cousin, well he broke his legs recently so I've since forgive and forgotten. Anyways I cannot stand locker room talk, it's like reliving the experience through the eyes of my cousin, so I cannot room with men. Tried it once and got molested just about every night by said drunk roommate. So it's 2018 and having grown up around women even into adulthood as a cheerleader I feel that it's acceptable for me to room with a female in a rent situation. Called a young lady in town offering cheap rent looking for a roommate, well her bf answers and gives me the runaround about how 15-20 years ago men understood you don't live with women outside of marriage. I explain I'm an outlier who can't room with men, I don't owe him an explanation especially considering they offered a rental situation and not a sublet. Well in my state gender discrimination is illegal for most rent situations excluding sublets and such. I've been researching heavily for the past 3 hours and cannot find any resource or program that provides appropriate housing for men, much less men who have been raped, and even waaaay less for men who were raped by other men. Granted I was a child... Anyone out there have similar housing needs?

Since then, my blood pressure is averaging like 165/108. Pulse has also gone up from low 80s to upper 90s, low 100s.

Under a doctor's care, I have cut out Abilify in the past month since I thought that might have contributed to it. I've cut out coffee/caffeine, and alcohol use is negligible.

I never had such high numbers when I was on olanzapine, or, I think abilify for that matter. I know I'm not that healthy, but I can't see any other way, aside from a med, that my numbers have increased so much in this amount of time. I know these are more uncommon side effects of perphenazine, but I think I may have to switch APs again.

Sorry for the typo in the title, I am using my phone and I am not good at typing on this thing lol

My boyfriend is 25, and recently had a psychotic episode where he was seeing people and super paranoid, was spitting out medication, wouldn't sleep.

We use to smoke pot all the time before this happened, ever since we haven't touched it. 

I have been doing a lot of research because after it happened the doctor said it could be schizophrenia symptoms and I read that smoking pot can make it worse. But I also read that cbd oil can help treat symptoms of schizophrenia in some sufferers because it didnt contain the thc, and I was just wondering if anyone had any experience with it? I don't want him to take something that might make it worse. But his doctor also reccomended it to him.

I was referred to a psych from my pdoc and finally diagnosed as schizoaffective, PTSD, panic disorder, MDD (major depression). 

I've been going to weekly therapy sessions and bi-weekly psych sessions for a year, I'm on Latuda 120mg, Trazadone 150mg, Prozasin 3mg, and Ativan. 5mg as needed. I have been working hard on getting better but I still have symptoms. I hardly leave my house, I have no motivation and barely shower or take care of myself. I have turned down fun events like being in weddings, going to concerts, or attending fun outings. I have panic attacks at while grocery shopping, visiting places, driving, and staying the night at places but I also have atleast 1 panic attack per week in my own bed. In 2016, I had a panic attack that was so bad, I went into psychosis and couldnt even walk down my stairs. I had my husband call 911 and they carried me down my stairs on a stretcher and took me to the ER. I thought I was dying. I'm paranoid, I hardly sleep &amp; I'm heavily dependent on my husband. My medications give me vivid nightmares, brain fog, major forgetfulness, more anxiety, nausea, etc.

1. How can I summarize and accurately relay why I can't work any job? What do you say when they ask, because I have so many reasons and I don't want to ramble.

2. How do you explain that even though your medication helps you, it doesn't cure you and in fact, causes more side effects.

3. What can I expect at a video conference? I specifically declined wanting a video conference hearing! I feel like it's less personal and he won't really listen. Also, will there still be vocational experts/other people asking me questions or will it just be a judge?

4. Any insight would be helpful. I'm sick to my stomach just thinking about it.

schizophrenia,d122yX,2018/03/26,"Ive just been diagnosed as Paranoid Schitzophrenic... I've been battling with my mental health for over 10yrs..  Today i recieved the diagnosis and told to think about Clozapine as a possible treatment, but ill need a two week stay in hospital to start me on the meds.

Im totally clueless about the whole situation on the meds and would love someone to give me their experiences with the illness and meds, what to expect from treatment etc.

My head is all over the place. Ive gone from paranoid personality disorder to full blown paranoid schitzophrenic in the space of 18months. Yet all this manifested in my early 20s and i just got fobbed off by different doctors...

schizophrenia,systememes,2018/03/27,"new to thread, starts of a bad episode hi everyone! i am the host of a DID system who is schizoaffective. we can feel ourselves slipping into an episode. i don't really want to be hospitalized again. i am unmedicated due to lack of money which makes it hard. 

i guess i just wanted to reach out to a community that understands. :) 

lately our thoughts have become very disorganized, and our em otions either haywire or stunted completely. it leads to very stressful interactions.

i haven't had any strong hallucinations yet thankfully, but my delusions are getting a bit out of hand. x) i can tell this is the start of a not-great episode, and am trying to ease myself into it as painlessly as possible. 

thanks for reading!!!! i hope you all have a wonderful day!!!!!!",4.173972527472529,6.693166078571429,5.129999999999999,77.46423076923078,73.92857142857143,8.593406593406593,29.340659340659343,9.265573868473778,2.9083296703296715,601,26,107,15,13,196,100,140,0.08199999999999999,0.723,0.195,0.9677,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,3,1,0,2,3,6,0,1,9,0,15,1,1,2,1,23,29,6,0,4,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,4,1,1,1,2,2,0,0,3,3,14,4,19,25,4,14,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,4,8,74,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221077682365304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.149926095364324,0.0,0.19831122958132186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19603431614184247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882664939196003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158021143606328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17157841424841852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079153407933054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09381331190554303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19796684850965995,0.19780689731840975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16085155896319694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1783447795763699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2025528461437727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11985849023159025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342131852073245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202428264847634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17960978419241455,0.0,0.11503149776806895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.254188672331053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056867392015195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15694439662322646,0.330631642279662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14255152957278855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12191026292226527,0.0,0.0,0.18692953383693686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2963135777716985,0.2118196870758943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947264535724097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I met a man who wasn't there

He wasn't there again today

Oh how I wish he'd go away


When I came home last night at three

The man was waiting there for me

But when I looked around the hall

I couldn't see him there at all


Go away go away

Don't you come back anymore

Go away go away

And please don't slam the door

schizophrenia,denimcowboy,2018/03/28,"Can't even really speak anymore/ Wet Brain rant I used to be a crazy outgoing kid when I was younger but since schizophrenia, I can no longer even really speak or move. I can't even talk to my parents who I love dearly and cut me more breaks than they should. I know this world is going to end with us not being on the best of terms and close and it kills me but I just don't know what to say.

 I used to have tons of friends and be the life of the party now all I do is sit in my parents basement everyday and lay in bed.... literally its like I can't change or do anything I'm catatonic. Even to sit on my computer right now feels like a task I seriously don't want to do anything ever. 

Nothing feels good I don't have a job and I doubt I can ever hold one. I went in for an interview a few days ago and I was speaking literal gibberish to the owner he must have thought I was a crackhead...no wonder I never got called back. I'm 27 and a fucking manchild my mom still feeds me dinner that I can't even eat because I fucked my stomach lining up so bad from drinking heavily. 

Which not to mention i'm pretty sure gave me ""wet Brain"" from literally only drinking everyday no food. Wet brain is like dementia imagine that along with schizophrenia.... I'm truly suffering. I know everyone has issues but I feel like schizos feel hurt so much more. Every day I look up at my tiny window is another reminder of a day full of doing nothing, no interactions and being trapped in my brain thinking irrational thoughts over and over...but then again even if I had those opportunities to hang out or have a job it would give me anxiety so why do i even dream of having it?

I have 0 motivation and It's due to my Adderall abuse from years ago and drinking which I recently stopped only because my body cant handle it anymore. Not only was I cursed with this disease but I made the mistake of using chemicals to only make things worse. now I feel there's no going back.

Anyone else feel like things will only get worse? My parents will eventually die and I'll be homeless. No career no car no friends no nothing. I feel like I couldn't be happy even if I was rich and had everything my mind is set on negativity and sadness.

schizophrenia,scienceofspin,2018/03/28,"How to help my partner during episodes Are any of you un medicated? 

My partner is diagnosed yet un medicated and deals with crippling depression and hallucinations that are difficult for me to explain because they are difficult for him to explain to me. Sometimes he has particularly bad episodes where he ""goes away"" (disassociates) and that happened in front of me for the first time last night. 

I didnt know what to do. I have bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms but its nothing like what he goes through. I'll hear ghosts and see shadow people but what he deals with is tenfold worse. I have some grounding skills that I learned in inpatient along with breathing techniques. He will not do them when he's in these states. 
Last night was honestly scary because I couldnt read any of his body language or facial expressions. All I could do (all he wanted me to do) was hold him and hold his hand. I eventually got him talking and that kindof brought him down. I made him food and got him to fall asleep. 

Does anyone know what Im supposed to do in these situations? How do you ground someone who doesnt believe in the mental health system? Are any of you unmedicated?

schizophrenia,ExtraordinarySuccess,2018/03/28,"What if SZ enables a sort of “superpower”? So SZ is still a mental illness but when I think of it, a key part of SZ is increased open mindedness (mostly to ideas), reduced inhibition, more creativity, seeing patterns other people don’t see (even if that is making sense out of nonsense), being very sensitive to things in the environment, and less of a cognitive filter. These are things that can lead to the more problematic aspects of SZ but I also wonder if these allow someone to be especially perceptive and just more sensitive and attuned to people and the universe. This could manifest maybe as making you more of an empath or better at understanding things, but does it maybe go a step beyond and maybe one is more tuned in to the universe and can predict things or control things? Like a supercharged gut instinct? I mean this all in a more subtle way and not like you can control the weather. I’ve had so many strange experiences I try to write off as me just imagining them but I can’t disprove it all.

schizophrenia,RustyMuffin444,2018/03/28,"Slightly Odd Visual 'Hallucination' I went to bed around 1:00am and was just lying in bed but couldn't fall asleep so I starting browsing on my phone until 3:00am. All of a sudden I see a medium-sized spider crawling on the wall next to my bed; I have a fear of spiders so I immediately jump out of the bed and stared at it watching where it crawls. My cat was also on my bed and I accidently woke her up, she locked her eyes on the spider and I freaked out because I knew she would attack it and possibly cause it to fall on my bed so I quickly picked her up and moved her away.

Now comes the strange part. I see the spider crawling towards a corner of my wall, I look away for less than a second and look back and suddenly the spider is nowhere to be found? I'm just staring at the corner wondering where it's fine for 30 minutes. After this, I decide to just go into my bed and try to sleep, but then I suddenly see the spider again this time walking past the corner on the other side of my wall towards my doorframe. Again I lock my eyes on it watching where it goes and it stops on my doorframe. I look away for a second to check where my cat is, look back to the dorrframe and again the spider has disappeared?? I checked the whole doorframe thouroughlt with my flashlight and no spider was to be seen.

My question is was this a hallucination or was this a real spider? The fact that my cat looked at it the first time I saw it made it seem real but I'm just really confused. Oddly, this similar sort of scenario has happeded 4-5 times before, where I see a spider somewhere in my room, look away for less than a second and its suddenly gone (3 of those instances the spider was right in the middle of a light coloured wall so I knew it couldn't have suddenly hid in a corner or something)

Can anyone help me out because I'm quite confused ",4.986317135549871,5.2073142139037465,5.5806161357823765,84.01470936991399,68.62566844919786,7.894722157637759,28.82771448500349,7.423996415210882,1.5408227388979308,1452,47,298,13,23,470,164,374,0.08900000000000001,0.8909999999999999,0.02,-0.9743,0,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,2,22,6,1,3,29,0,19,4,4,3,2,50,46,25,0,3,9,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,0,21,20,0,1,7,0,2,10,3,5,0,4,15,20,42,1,54,26,5,78,0,0,19,0,9,45,0,8,23,215,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459156024637149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396325184218129,0.0,0.0,0.09416588357222393,0.0,0.12033907126634845,0.3975320312189157,0.16267529746291354,0.0,0.12896399467904535,0.0,0.0900102786378271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10866434094042818,0.0,0.09111938454938444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903096928288512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997570393806613,0.0,0.11598139489168713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060116737302566885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709015447487854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5329671459601302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10009080380803746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11242651234286774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11249734229900453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11454852787882358,0.1009781824085649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11925011522593555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11849687379730567,0.1125091628753582,0.0,0.2407996961586085,0.06776484189981688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033482916974296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3371691977696719,0.09629737927068573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585555771423648,0.0,0.0,0.08143396932431254,0.0,0.0,0.07487103761774883,0.0,0.0,0.0884361186399738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850420457605975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181710968893955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805834595781883,0.0,0.1180986604278728,0.0,0.0,0.1147129924940374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514248405254761,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,DuckDemure,2018/03/28,I feel trapped by my brain I think I should be capable of being an adult. I am at least average in intelligence. I should be able to hold down a simple job or have friends or go to school or at the very least keep up with personal hygiene and eating. But instead I'm hiding in a dark corner smoking a cigarette and completely terrified of something that only exists in my head. I hate my brain and by extension myself. My body won't cooperate with me because the voices and the fear are too powerful. I feel claustrophobic even though I'm outside.

schizophrenia,melancholygirlfriend,2018/03/29,"Father (50) Diagnosed with Late Onset Schizophrenia This is long, I apologize and thank you for reading in advance. My dad slit his wrists and throat in an attempted suicide late February. He has been in and out of hospitals ever since because something is CLEARLY mentally wrong with him. I think backstory is necessary. He abused drugs like marijuana/pills/hallucinogens early on in life and developed a crack problem from 2002-2008. His mother was diagnosed with dementia and schizophrenia in 2008 and his step father (they were very close) shot himself shortly after. My father is the one who found him and has since suffered depression/anxiety/PTSD. He also had a major stroke in 2011, which fortunately only gave him difficulty with numbers and larger, uncommon words. Nothing we couldn’t work around and allow him to live a normal life. He has gone from being normal to telling us a sweatshirt told him he has “mold in his body that is giving him cancer and diabetes.” Different colors “mess” with him. He’s swore up and down he’s seen relatives that are dead or people somehow in connection to his father. He has been released from the most recent mental ward and diagnosed as schizophrenic. Since being released he has had trouble writing, eating, bathing, carrying conversation, all problems he did not have before. Something is obviously wrong, I’m just not sure that schizophrenia is the correct diagnoses.  Currently my uncle and his wife are caring for my father, they say he’s up and down as a whole. I’m looking for ANY AND ALL advice on how to handle this matter. He’s on Latuda, Abilify, and Celexa as of right now. Does this sound like schizophrenia? If it sounds like something else, then what? What questions should I be asking doctors? If it is schizophrenia or something else, where do we go from here? How can we help him to the best of our abilities? I know I can’t get a diagnosis from the internet and I’m not looking for one, but the waiting and my curiosities are getting the best of me and eating me alive so truly any insight is appreciated. I want to research all of the possibilities. Again, thank you.

schizophrenia,TheChemist158,2018/03/29,"Considering meeting a long time online friend who I think has schizophrenia Posting here because you guys probably have more experience and will be more sympathetic. So, who is he? A good friend that I've had entirely online for seven years now. We have voice chatted a lot, we know each other's cities and full names, but have never met in person. Our friendship has outlived many of our real life friendship. I want to meet him in real life.

Why do i think he's schizophrenic? I'm very sure he is *something* and that is my best guess. He is normally a very chill dude but every now and then for a few weeks he'll get very paranoid. Believing that some government agency or something is deeply involved in his life, mind controlling people, giving him hidden messages, ect... he's never talked about any hallucinations and as far as I know this paranoia is his only symptom (though he also gets seizures, not sure that those are related).

As far as how he is doing, not great but slowly getting better. He has some real life friends that filter in and out of his life but he feels very isolated particularly when he is in ""crazy mode"" as he calls it. His mom wants him to take meds but he doesn't like to (and being a 35 year old man living on his own he doesn't have to). He's unemployed but wants a job, also on disability.

So, what do I want? I guess just a little insight. I know it sounds like a stupid idea to meet a guy I met online that I know is crazy, but he's never even implied he ever wants to hurt anyone (except occasionally himself) even in crazy mode. But is it a stupid idea? Online when he goes on a rant about being controlled by the government it's easy to navigate because I am removed from him with a screen. I don't know what to do if it happens in real life. I guess I'm just asking how to be friends with him in real life?",3.7582308291163855,5.204917558583105,4.7299601012066965,84.49637261580379,72.32425068119892,7.313701829505644,25.368723238614248,7.83500028581142,1.3246886726352671,1452,45,290,19,28,473,183,367,0.114,0.7559999999999999,0.13,0.6716,3,0,2,0,0,0,45.0,4,1,0,4,19,15,2,0,14,0,32,9,0,4,6,68,60,32,0,7,15,1,1,2,4,2,9,2,0,4,18,13,0,2,11,1,0,1,8,3,0,1,3,4,29,12,37,51,10,33,0,1,1,0,58,16,0,8,17,181,47,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064434012718712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051295689272499036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052743132330058166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07051783367819868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196411552703856,0.0,0.0,0.08498494382910222,0.07916021570513236,0.06671261910053726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702351867662065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920463571471134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09964297215224564,0.06823168811224407,0.06355389885435833,0.0,0.0,0.0737860246308355,0.0,0.0,0.038140196876627286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331113167973967,0.0,0.1182288047671758,0.0723603204748736,0.0,0.0632679719162899,0.0,0.08316298048897948,0.24928736199193136,0.14937716439981633,0.06670341361696812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075048123073457,0.1703049101581997,0.0,0.0,0.07485366133358108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072746160008025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3729541869771141,0.07370358538640688,0.07560171179261092,0.06660698434910685,0.06675409077888977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641287670575686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07647522837970569,0.0,0.0,0.08378687326773465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07616384064494433,0.08834391451806929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745311891296584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07390639709210738,0.0,0.0,0.07915218056449325,0.0,0.0,0.0573686998639379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0522943808253044,0.06586346875175819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224207882123572,0.0,0.08132741185938724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4292851491518715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11614098929556868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14218571235843244,0.07840172560739901,0.05671474952057736,0.06062860727577622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966663207116872,0.0741106072158554,0.0,0.043984442107370535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489540089399869,0.22245588890372686,0.0,0.06050622496949391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06806477499082912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971502246608138

schizophrenia,needahand3407,2018/03/29,"Struggling I have been struggling lately since I started going back to my doctor. I was taken off insurance last year when I turned 26, and I haven't been able to afford medicine so I came off of it. About a month or two ago I started going back to my doctor because I was having a really hard time not being on any medicine. They found the perfect medicine for me that was working 90%, but the out of pocket cost is to much, so now we are trying to find another medicine and I am just struggling. I feel like a lab rat trying medicine after medicine. The side effects are getting to me. I heard a new voice today that I've never heard before and went into a full on panic attack. I used to have a big support system, but that recently was cut down to just my husband. I love having him as my support system, but it was nice to have other friends to. I feel like I mess everything up.

schizophrenia,SarahAB227,2018/03/29,"I cannot do this again. Cannot. I'm going to make an extremely long story short. Probably in July of 2017 my mother started talking to a ""guardian angel"" named Rose. We didn't think much of it at the time. It seemed harmless. She had gotten a tablet around that time and it made a bell noise when she got an email and she said it was a noise angels were making it say hello or whatever.

To add to this my mother is also physically disabled, she's been in a wheelchair for over 10 years now, it's a long story, we don't know why she's like that, but we've learned to deal with it. They call it an ""undiagnosed neurodegenerative disease"". 

She hurt her ankle about a month after she started talking to Rose. She said she forgot to put her brakes on her wheel chair when she got up. Remember this, it will come in later.

She started talking to something. Someone else. We took her to a local emergency room which put her in a local mental ward at a sister hospital. That place was a hot mess and all they did was enough to make her a zombie and send her home which wasn't going to cut it. We took her to another hospital which admits to a local mental facility but they didn't have any spaces so they kept her at hospital 2 (naming things this way for privacy sake, I can add names later if helpful). At this time it hit a new high (or low, however you want to look at it). This voice was telling her what to do, when to do it, if she could or couldn't do it. It turns out when she hurt her ankle she didn't forget to put her brakes on, the ""angels"" told her she was healed at could walk. And ""Rose"" she was talking to before was telling her she was going to drag her to hell. She wouldn't eat, she would say everyone hates her, everyone is poisoning her food. She said she got mouthy with a nurse and the nurse shoved a rag in her mouth. She called the cops at one point because she heard a nurse say ""I'm taking a picture of you"" while taking a bath. The nurse was just in the room. My mom was behind a curtain. She told us she'd find one way or another to kill herself. We'd bring her food from the outside (they'd let us) to try and get her to eat and she would refuse it or take it and throw it away. So we'd eat it being there and hungry and she'd try and take it away from us. After the police incident since hospital 2 is a voluntary facility they had to put her in a non-voluntary facility. She wheeled after the cops that day saying she doesn't want to be there, they can't keep her. The non-voluntary facility was a shit hole, but the doctor from hospital 2, god bless him, did help get her started with ECT's. Which have helped.

Now that I've really condensed this shit storm, it's been at least 2.5 months of smooth sailing in 2018 and I talked to my dad tonight during my dinner, I'm on night shift, and he said he thinks they're coming back. She's doing some telltale signs of what she did when this all started before and when she was home in between hospital 1 and hospital 2. 

I can't do this again. I cannot tell you what this did to my family the first time around. Luckily we're all very close knit and love each other, so our relationships our fine. But emotionally I work full time, evenings, an hour from home, which is 20 minutes from my parents. My sister lives an hour away. My moms sister, who helps, she's getting older and can't make that drive all the time. My dad isn't getting any younger. It's a lot on a family to deal with all of that as much as we love her, it is exhausting. We're not going to let it get as far as we did last time, we know better know.

I guess this is half venting/emotional break down and half, what do we do if it comes back?",3.179666388657214,4.1293572228047175,4.264924580007151,89.1940245442631,73.10222804718221,7.541227213153819,23.4402239961873,7.877588486780915,0.9019774049803404,2863,73,641,38,55,934,297,763,0.077,0.86,0.063,-0.9526,2,0,1,0,0,0,93.0,15,3,7,3,23,19,7,0,43,0,68,15,3,5,5,97,130,46,1,11,14,10,2,1,0,4,4,10,7,0,55,41,6,6,10,1,0,18,16,12,0,5,42,13,101,7,86,71,13,109,5,3,1,2,135,44,3,12,45,419,156,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0449636382527539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07647075076850822,0.117915009280012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010551200050798,0.0,0.0,0.15847756909983685,0.08646812053682779,0.0,0.03427463914538334,0.0,0.09568778719563674,0.0,0.0,0.049727025220876485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148253660993538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453002769812785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08978322530742316,0.0,0.0,0.03626089786763046,0.11593236872443315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05754934327396141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17259865413238068,0.04696932239800161,0.1264925945838458,0.0,0.058096134603955775,0.0,0.03713651671980233,0.0,0.0,0.10745205110809164,0.0,0.0,0.1060090924931464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051389232642799314,0.047825515827172906,0.1359765772586907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14687792793822638,0.0,0.12781734826196925,0.0,0.13490638463435045,0.0,0.06193890103628439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0555111966730744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15074749302936882,0.05940549450005304,0.16919675748976554,0.0,0.11074189433221544,0.0,0.12038145918712145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04997594809208987,0.06220535986446042,0.0,0.09270045334589228,0.04583141546990578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11498908907175935,0.0,0.027469016347983276,0.0,0.049648285965554116,0.09951587572228288,0.04721539178329142,0.0,0.0,0.047801043638380336,0.10149170277535348,0.05320207691812852,0.15012425280323102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11332447735324976,0.0,0.0,0.13170162180952688,0.08975756731142889,0.0,0.0826646558240797,0.0,0.0,0.05430309069631159,0.0,0.05276397104278913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07619992175392536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062431939162042725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05874384541093824,0.0,0.05315142038788609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06062076883214122,0.0,0.0,0.2260892629995533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03601959614604844,0.0,0.0,0.060365314644210015,0.06369270978426514,0.0,0.21393390456907085,0.17885159935580233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05118572720026266,0.0,0.0,0.11542965955583773,0.046510445176761415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04763981742006897,0.04328525833451935,0.0,0.0,0.1989840500191738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16909878927435068,0.2259602698678083,0.14743110956840222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037353828701838544,0.07205426248960886,0.0,0.0,0.22949943264740566,0.0,0.0,0.10745205110809164,0.1249375493184062,0.07634706183470208,0.06115737011478203,0.0,0.0,0.20289763045993828,0.0,0.0,0.04639205613686266,0.06632669948920676,0.08925862019275603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05073491084979731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04093294854447771,0.0,0.0,0.07988218825877506,0.0,0.0,0.036207480211814976

I read that it had to do with the lack of congruence between what's felt and what's expressed, like smiling at a sad new, which is something my psychiatrist told me I display. Trouble is, I can't read my emotions, which doesn't help. If anyone can relate, do meds help ? If so, what meds ? AD's didn't, nor did depakene.

Number 5 makes me sad, even worse are the comments about it. People don't understand, and I doubt they want to, laughing at other people's misfortune is too fun for them to be inconvenienced by empathy.

schizophrenia,Afuckindragonyo,2018/03/31,"I have a delusion that I’m supposed to be resurrected tomorrow (but not that I’m jesus) I don’t think that I’m going to actually die and be resurrected. But that tomorrow is the day I’m going to get clean and stay clean. Also that tomorrow is when I’m finally going to commit to my dreams, along with other life changes that are long overdue. It will be a metaphorical resurection. Or in less grandiose terms, the day I finally get my shit together and stop being a lazy fuckup.

The badnews is that I’m using it as justification to use a lot day. This has happened a few times around holidays and shit. I thought I was being born again on Christmas last year, just like Christ was born on Christmas. I don’t think I’m JC, and I dont think I’m the savior of man (well not anymore at least), but I do think I have these holidays are symbolic of events in my life (but also that they could be for others at the same time).

Does this happen to anyone else?

This has happened a few other times. Including the halloween after I first went crazy, when I thought there was a chance I was going to be massacred along with my friends at the party I was at (was on edge the whole night).

Apologies for the iffy prose: I’m entering nod territory

schizophrenia,sundown73,2018/03/31,"Does anyone else struggle with OCD because of past psychosis? I have a hard time leaving the house or going to bed at night. 

When I check things like the stove, even though I can see that the orange burner light is off, I start to worry what if I'm hallucinating that the light is off when in reality its on and I'll set the house on fire. So I stand there for like 20 minutes each time repeating in my head 'the light is off....the light is really off...its really off...it's dark its really off...'  It's maddening. I do this with the locks and worrying about the front door really being closed. 

I know this is a bit of OCD, but its based on the fact that times when I was psychotic I really did see things that were not there. So now I worry I can't trust what I'm seeing.

schizophrenia,CheeseIntolerant,2018/03/31,"ill never win the war but I won some battles Back in 2008 I started studying on the uni and thats when all started going wrong. It started with acrippling depression which then turned into religious delusions where I ended up being a very delusional militant christian. 

Dropped out of  uni  and 2 years forward ambulance is driving me to a mental hospital cause i disturbed some neighbours . I stayed there for 40 days, absolutely hated itcause they doped me with high dose of risperidone, some antidepressants and benzos. At the end they just told me I had unspecified unorganic psychosis and discharged me. Risperidone helped with the positive symptoms but I was stuck with crippling negative symptoms and unability to do pretty much anything with life. 
I moved back to my hometown to live with my parents and mostly spent months and years not doing anything but browsing internet and sleeping. Ive gained 50 kilograms, got a bad tooth decay and showered once a week.  At the end it left a tool on my parents and our relationships. At the beggining they were supportive and understanding but seeing me waste away my years has somehow made them very inpatient and angry. Fights between us became a regular thing and it got to the point that my younger sister moved out as soon as she could because it became too toxic for her.

In 2015 I got delusional again after quitting meds on my own (dont do this please!)  and had to be hospitalized again. Ive spent a month there, but once Ive become more rational and was put in therapy, I realized how much Ive messed up in life and how much im messing up other people's lives. I realized my mom is working two shifts to support us cause im unable to do anything. Dad started drinking away our family problems.  Guilt washed over me so badly, for my own life,cause I was  25 and never had any job or education, had no friends, nothing.

When I was  discharged I was on risperidone, zoloft and lithium and had no idea what to do with my life. I started therapy together with my entire family, therapist helped us resolve problems to an acceptable level and dad quit drinking. I realized that I have to move and do anything that doesnt include smoking and browsing internet. For my own sake and the sake of my family. So i started with the baby steps. Ill start showering twice a week and brush my teeth twice a day. Ill make dinner tonight. Ill clean the kitchen today. Ill never forget how happy my mom was when I made that basic dinner and set the table for us to eat. As the time went on and it started getting better, I started doing more and more things around the house, cooked all three meals a day, cycled every day and became friends with a bipolar girl that works in my local supermarket. 

Its still hard. I only have her as a friend. Ive never dated. A lot of people think im weird.  Ill be on meds my entire life. But i shower daily. I recently got a job in the local greenhouse.

schizophrenia,tarzan3333,2018/03/31,What do the voices really want from me? My english is bad so apology’s in advance. I don’t think the voices want me to kill myself. I think they wants me to talk all day to myself loudly like i used to do when i didn’t have schizophrenia. I regret i disturbed so many people and i’m sorry for that. But that chapter in my life over. I might have summoned some kind of daemons from hell and they got a taste of me talking loudly to myself all day long. But i don’t want to be that person anymore. I was stupid as a juvenile and people think i’m going to be stupid all my life. I am embarrassed of my past and how stupid i was thinking world was such a great place. I made a fool of myself and that entertained so many people like i was a circus monkey. People probably still like to see me as a circus monkey in 2018 but the difference is i don’t love the world or people anymore. The love died. I don’t want to be forcefully love the world and people but when i hear the voices i feel like a peace of shit. ,1.6000518902891017,3.3126432676056368,3.352058314801088,90.99716085989624,78.76525821596246,5.986557944156165,19.661230541141585,6.8360192770164,0.1970056338028168,788,18,171,8,19,263,95,213,0.14400000000000002,0.6759999999999999,0.179,0.8744,0,0,0,0,0,1,14.0,0,0,2,1,8,21,6,2,14,0,20,7,1,3,3,30,41,19,2,6,5,0,1,4,0,1,2,6,0,1,5,6,1,0,5,1,0,2,5,11,0,0,7,9,32,10,23,30,4,17,1,1,1,3,10,8,2,3,11,117,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22334851050900234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940207687852524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14524227810624685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11686658150231367,0.1176486302594058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05693665143874864,0.08044528887231524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399621884308113,0.0,0.09006078994007294,0.12414780259328308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269144201930416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12458114261420973,0.11726115016244976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15907298624917401,0.22005315622812185,0.0,0.0,0.09965219663345187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048921907653601,0.1065499105921299,0.0,0.2283283138804312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11945648790790235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749455392548653,0.4683982533525136,0.09832265352473403,0.1176486302594058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214076192745378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07213787452005158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08973188971905789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11558777981808105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260524769782698,0.0,0.0,0.0899267828116266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18101583957963602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2886118614453425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725487310277983,0.0,0.0,0.33208778255600124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,unresolvedverse,2018/03/31,"Did being formally diagnosed help you or cause more problems? Hi all! First time poster, long time lurker. I’m a third year student currently studying a bachelor of psychology. In one of my classes the other day we were having a group discussion regarding the pros and cons of the DSM-5 and how it’s used to diagnose disorders. Out of curiosity my question is, did your formal diagnosis help you or hinder you? And do you think the current  DSM criteria for schizophrenia is too precise? Or not precise enough? 

Have an amazing day.

schizophrenia,stareatthesun87,2018/03/31,Weight gain on AntiPsychotics Question I’ve looked into it a bit and couldn’t find an answer on this; do antipsychotics just increase appetite (because they definitely do) or are there other side effects that cause the gain as well? I’m thinking a slow down of metabolism or something like that?

I also walk around and talk to myself out loud. I do compulsive, repetitive things and I need to repeat the things again and again in order to feel comforted. I have problems focusing and I get these episodes where I have brain fog and I have a really hard time remembering things. Several times I was in my apartment and I thought someone was going to pop out of the shadows at me because I watched a scary movie. Sometimes I imagine a face will appear in the mirror. I don't see things or hear any voices as of yet but I do have severe paranoia. I have a strong family history of schizophrenia in my family. There was a great aunt with it and a great uncle on my mom's and dad's side.

schizophrenia,lastnightslovebites,2018/04/01,"Getting really worried about my kid. My 16 year old (the age I was when I started to really become obviously symptomatic) has been having problems lately. Super stressed out, telling me the sky looks like plastic, buildings look like cardboard cutouts, feeling bugs on his skin. I don’t want my kids to have to go through what I do. He’s my oldest and lives with his dad in the US, but spends summers with me (in the UK) and wants to move out here when he graduates. I really don’t think his dad knows how to cope with this. I’m so afraid for him.

News and Commentary from the 
Treatment Advocacy Center

Holding the National Institute of Mental Health to account       

After Dr. E. Fuller Torrey and Elizabeth Sinclair released their analysis,""Hocus Pocus,"" which exposed NIMH's misrepresentation of prevalence data, many of you sent a wake up call to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that ""no, two million people with schizophrenia did not disappear.""

 
Thanks to your letters, tweets and calls alerting lawmakers of the problem, the NIMH director Dr. Joshua A. Gordon now concedes that his agency ""did not provide sufficient context to understand or justify the selected prevalence estimate,"" and that the number used did not ""reflect the full spectrum of knowledge available in the relevant literature."" 

In Psychiatric Times Director Gordon does his best to explain what happened, but his message remains clear: you're right, we did sweep more than two million people with schizophrenia under the rug! The agency is now ""in the process of expeditiously reviewing and updating the information presented on [their] webpage."" 

There are important real-world consequences to the agency's acknowledgement, because federal funding is apportioned to financially strapped community mental health centers on the basis of these estimates.

schizophrenia,Kale_Kruncher,2018/04/01,"Sibling Contacted Everyone I Know So my sibling has schizophrenia but has issues with medicine compliance. Anyway she contacted everyone (literally everyone from my work to acquaintances). Some people I introduced her to because were it not for me and my friends she would not have had any positive socialization. I am not sure I really care about what people think, but I kind of feel like violated/angry. Then she also posts private information about me or some of my family members. I understand she is schizophrenic but from understanding no one is 100% delusional. All people saddle reality and alter reality (so it's like a gradient scale that never reaches absolution). Anyway when I confronted her she told me I have no control over what she does. I am not the only family member she did this to she did it to my dad, but not my mom and brothers. Oddly enough they are not close to her at all. I'm thinking about cutting her out of my life (other than helping out financially) because there only seem to negatives to being associated with her. I am also wondering what she could be thinking doing that to us. My dad is her biggest financial supporter and now had to leave his job....",5.7036356209150325,7.812687865740745,7.010664488017433,67.4301960784314,68.49074074074073,10.823093681917213,33.53921568627451,10.843485225782073,4.442617973856209,953,45,151,31,17,323,126,216,0.08,0.8270000000000001,0.092,0.7729,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,1,2,12,9,2,0,2,0,21,2,0,1,4,39,34,15,0,2,11,4,1,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,10,9,0,1,10,0,0,0,10,2,0,1,6,1,39,7,25,24,5,11,0,0,0,0,29,6,0,5,6,132,49,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2138571966722834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092803108396376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16301790801230046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13632722480289206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14996819999908428,0.1067573133456651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170113533301282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13815915444894705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832996280931956,0.0,0.0,0.2521015672143542,0.0,0.06760827383999607,0.09552312933380004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330474821761156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962363122011396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13955949251266536,0.1326874858495641,0.0,0.0,0.1392393783379482,0.07348404122816622,0.0,0.0,0.14158058961969078,0.0,0.0,0.09444399822537626,0.13064883225202606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566006485009786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10312612759067936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09060600012691224,0.20338640530838487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780950106707627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12805812889523258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565865837813859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12172542696775633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363014748182445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15173360141362344,0.12602098788790886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2570297330761401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12776654269773186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2783956288564922,0.16083780934903072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500382145224602,0.09734316402561884,0.0,0.0,0.09498442246287153,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,timmy242,2018/04/02,"Aunt with schizophrenia, neuropsych report indicates she can live on her own (with visiting nurses). She is in denial. Help? I'm not sure if this is the place to ask about other people's experiences, and this is my first family experience with schizophrenia.  I am trying to figure out what is best for my aunt, ultimately.

WARNING, LONG STORY:

My aunt has been in and out of hospitals/facilities for more than a year.  She is in her late 60s and has been diagnosed as schizophrenic, prescribed Risperdal, and is currently on intramuscular injections.  She refuses to take medications orally, and denies she even has schizophrenia.  She designated me as health POA, and I ordered the injections.

Historically, she has been on ""anti-anxiety"" medication (not sure which one, her words) since the 1970's and slowly weened herself off of them over a period of years.

Last spring (about 2 months after she stopped taking her meds) she began to have hallucinations, hear voices, see deceased relatives, and see 'beings' (that only she could see) that were physically/sexually threatening to her.  She confided all of this to me, her closest still living relative.  I was supportive and willing to help her in any way I could.  I live about 4 hours away, however, so it is difficult to monitor her at home, and had to rely on police wellness checks.

Eventually, she was forced to call the police because she was afraid to go into her house (where the 'beings' would torment her).  The main form of torment, again according to her, would be for the beings to put her on the floor of her rec room, where she was unable to get up.  She is quite overweight, and is unable to get up from the floor on her own, at any rate.

She has been in and out of hospitals/facilities since then, mainly because she would be found on the floor, having been there for days, by either the police or me, and need to be hospitalized.

In this latest facility (where she currently resides, and has been given shots of Risperdal) she had a neuro-psychology assessment that determined she could live on her own, with visiting nurses, provided she continued her medication.

At this point, she seems to be thinking much clearer and denies that she was having delusions at all, or that she even needs medication.  I fear that her living on her own is just going to lead down the same cycle as before (where she will refuse medication) and am unsure what to do next.

Anybody have a similar experience?  I don't seem to be getting anywhere with the medical professionals, who have determined she isn't a good candidate for an assisted living facility.",8.716702355460384,8.589882537473237,8.675071520342613,66.13775503211994,60.884368308351185,12.268573875802998,36.02475374732334,11.67915571911669,4.409516556745183,2063,81,344,56,25,672,228,467,0.077,0.883,0.041,-0.9346,3,0,0,0,0,0,78.0,0,0,1,4,15,9,0,2,19,0,57,10,0,1,4,55,79,24,0,9,7,3,0,0,0,5,10,2,2,0,17,25,1,3,5,0,1,6,4,3,1,2,17,5,59,6,77,46,14,71,0,0,3,0,59,40,0,5,23,279,76,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112155044866743,0.0,0.0625553428631349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0764457653172907,0.0,0.07682746941426412,0.0,0.0,0.099694883215984,0.0,0.06958193439470448,0.0,0.08581465079990867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08349833688219603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19586482275883246,0.0,0.0,0.05273616394451628,0.0,0.0,0.08299684104418707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10801924658418524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23996606936474324,0.0770873476676721,0.09201621438042178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06955520661953378,0.0,0.08965875822728712,0.0,0.0,0.12816745767063353,0.0,0.09294580428624423,0.06858645935274829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691979366501999,0.09216296738787663,0.0,0.10962007250402812,0.0,0.08202396581972186,0.0,0.08052893114160006,0.09435388899464738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06665507977362538,0.092242358100654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4332369525655296,0.07236563137970863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908302384858292,0.4942600176754369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06526961635472854,0.0,0.06011181601003961,0.12126577792590422,0.0,0.0,0.08696543116952753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05541081167989452,0.06219127754788838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05669039667649594,0.0,0.08543431752935242,0.0,0.07730095459003132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220342807812027,0.0,0.08697456899890432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1954850492146872,0.14888428362177958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352852580169388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06530321092716157,0.06836503895392795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279387680358683,0.15413825172262696,0.0,0.12296470852080015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05239618463702333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05551780852606993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06490679360905316,0.0,0.0,0.07352283277054167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742654108417184,0.0,0.0,0.1053169515789974

schizophrenia,rickyrosae,2018/04/02,"Schizophrenia in Asia Hello everyone. I'm American but based in Saigon, Vietnam. My girlfriend's brother has been having a tough time lately. Started about 2 months ago. Repeating strange things, muttering to himself. Over Chinese New Year he was hospitalized while my girlfriend and I were on holiday. Doctors said he was stressed. A girl he liked rebuffed him. He was worried about studying abroad in the fall. 

I saw him when he got out. He was taking an antipsychotic, though I didn't know it at the time. Not sure what specifically. Anyway, he was his charming self, subdued though. I just thought he was taking stuff to sleep better. Anyway, he relapsed about a week ago. Stopped taking his medicine. Hallucinated seeing his mother outside my apartment, a few days later got fired from his job (though still showed up for the next few days), kicked out of a school, stole his parents motorbike, talked with everyone on the street, got into the backseat of random cars, etc. 

I thought he was manic. Took him to a therapist today and she suspects SZ. Hallucinations, disorganized speech, diminished emotional expression. 

Took him to a new doctor, the doctor prescribed risperidone and some muscle relaxants. 

Anyway, on the off chance that anyone knows good resources in Asia (Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, etc) I would greatly appreciate any advice. Mental health is a rather new idea here, or at least in Vietnam anyway. He went to shaman a few days ago (mom trying to cover all her bases, though she does believe in therapy and medication). I worry less about him being socially isolated (community culture, big family, supportive friends) than I do about getting a good doctor who he trusts. I mean, he was in a mental hospital for a week and they said it was because of stress while prescribing an antipsychotic. Don't know what they told him. Seemed strange to me... 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Any advice appreciated. Thanks.

schizophrenia,SHD25,2018/04/02,"How did you first know you were developing this? I ask because I am scared I might be. At 15-16 I lost 2 uncles and gran to cancer. As well as being in a long term relationship with bipolar girlfriend. At 17 I got sucker punched down an alley. At 18 after a four year relationship she dumped me. - she was the closest person in my life and it felt like I got discarded completely. At 20 dad was having health trouble and I failed to get into uni - should I add that my dad was late 70s at this age and it conflicted the fuck out of me. Shit job shit job shit job another uncle dead. A guy who got me another job died. unemployment and failing at everything i worked my ass off at and I feel done with life. - guitar used to be my life and identity and it lead absolutely no where. don't know if it's the combined stress of everything but I am nothing like myself anymore. Not 1 thing. Everyone wonders what's happened to me. The irony is before all of this I was the coolest mentally healthiest person I know. Now I don't recognise myself.

I used to be the most funny charming guy I know. I could make anyone laugh. Tell amazing stories I was fun passionate etc. 

But for example my brother is down to visit and he's talking to me and I have to fake interest and fake smile etc. 

I just bought a McDonald's and it felt like the guy taking my order could see right through me. All of this is so unlike me. I have isolated myself from friends. Haven't had sex in years and I my dad goes ohhhhh things will work out it's just a stage your going through. But it's not - I'm 26 and so out of touch with myself it scares the fuck out of me. Everyone else is so normal and doesn't seem to see that there is something seriously off with me. Which makes it worse because I have to pretend i am the me they knew?  

I used to be overflowing with character abundance and love for everything and everyone. Now it's like the opposite. 

My friends wonder what's happened to me. It started off as depression etc and I just feel like it has spiralled. 

I don't think I here voices? But I am locked inside my head and it is hard to come out.

People use to see me as really innovative and visionary type. I know I used to inspire a lot of people but it's like I gave up on everything and just cracked 

Does any of this sound relatable?

schizophrenia,thumbbreaker,2018/04/02,"Struggling today with hearing voices. My formal diagnosis isn't schizophrenia but my anxiety drives the voices. I was hospitalised last month for drug-induced psychosis. My primary reason was due to my neighbours plotting against me because our housemates had been smoking weed and I was trying to come off from it after smoking for two years straight. The voices of the neighbours were threatening to hurt me.

Hospitalisation ended four weeks ago - I'm meant to be staying at an outpatient facility but we have the option to take overnight leave to our own homes if we like.

Last night I couldn't sleep at our house - I was too busy hearing my housemate talk on the phone about me. This morning as I was smoking a cigarette, my neighbours started talking again about the smoke coming into their house. 

I know smoking ciggies is legal, so there's no reason for them to be so aggravating. My deeper anxiety was triggered today because my outgoing weed-smoking housemate has been abusive, thus I've retaliated and told him to piss off and have nothing else to do with us.

I don't know what to do. It's basically the guilt that's talking to me for being such a jerk to our outgoing housemate. I'm trying to reacclimatise to going back to work since I only just made rent this month with my brother's help. I work in a call centre so all I hear are voices. Self-soothing isn't working, I have to take a valium to treat my anxiety. I'm not formally diagnosed with schizophrenia but today I'm really struggling with my anxiety and the voices.

Though, I don't believe that schizophrenia or related mental disorders are really, for example, explained by shamanism or the ability to perceive the spirit-world. I'm just trying to understand schizophrenia and related mental disorders. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about five years ago. I'm really more interested in discussing anyone else's symptoms (like hallucinations and delusions). Is anyone else interested in this?

Thanks",11.047345360824742,14.734667175257735,9.940811855670102,45.38791881443302,57.659793814432994,13.097422680412373,47.176546391752574,12.161744961471696,7.90147525773196,544,34,53,20,8,171,65,97,0.024,0.823,0.153,0.9339,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,2,0,6,2,0,0,0,15,13,8,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,6,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,4,13,11,1,6,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,3,37,4,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393936467870806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3298609581083753,0.4833671251446564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17716818448088306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596065960367938,0.0,0.0,0.3604468579281701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3940894459809369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07682496348353116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169443246224161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2014782126564844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16344414387051287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14477572149085713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15449844572013094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10676320118678924,0.0,0.0,0.16370398152213894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17053215242753944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126457787439427
schizophrenia,Maleficent_Nya,2018/04/03,"Advice on effed up situation Okay, so I live with my family (mom, dad, three kids, and a dog), and six figure income bracket in a not so expensive area (so not financially squeezed or anything). My sister is 22 and I am 24. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago at uni and had to go right back to live at home within the first semester. In the first year and a half she was diagnosed, she was hospitalized many times and left homeless by my mother on one occasion (yes, I am pointing the finger). She was hospitalized serval times because she got combative with my mother and finally kicked out on to the streets so I moved back home. I switched unis and promised I would deal with everything regarding my sister but my mom needed to stay away from her. I said that because growing up my mother was extremely physically and emotionally abusive. For example, she would have my brother hold us down while she hit/whipped us with our own toys (yoyo/jump rope/etc) or electrical cord. She also screeches/yells about things like the dishes whether she left them out or someone else in the house did. My mom abruptly becomes aggressive and then she sometimes acts extremely sweet and friendly (especially with non-nuclear family members). When we were kids and even sometimes now she tells us how she should have sat on our heads as babies. Additionally, on the inside I'm always at least slightly angry at my mom, so I always feel like I’m walking on eggshells or imprisoned in my mind because she always wants me to smile or pretend like we’re friends. My mother has always constantly talked down to all of us growing up (father included) and has only toned any of it down because we're physically bigger than her now.  So ever since two years ago I have done everything to keep my mom away from my sister. I do everything around the house and go to college with my sister and we're finishing up soon, which is why I want to leave. My brother (who has stopped being my mom's henchman) and my dad help out a bit too btw. 

Thing is even though I really want to leave, I feel really guilty because I don't want to leave my sister behind. It's just I can't take it anymore with my mother. She's using my sister’s illness to manipulate me, see I have to clean up after everyone now because apparently every mess must be my sister’s doing. I also apparently need to be everyone’s cook because when I make food for my sister, my brother and mom eat it. In fact, my mother expects me to have her food ready when she comes home otherwise she acts in a very stress inducing way. So, I usually have to make full-on family meals. Now, since she stays away from sister all abuse is directed at me. I don't have a lot of money saved up or anything, but I don’t know if I might do more harm than good if I take her with me across the country where we know no one. Even with medication I sometimes have to intervene on her behalf because she can still have some delusions or use crass language. Once a cop accused her of trying to lie to an officer and I had to step in between them and wave over his partner. 

Anyway imo my mom is just a fucking monster and probably the cause of my sister’s disorder and most of her and my stress. I just can’t with my mother anymore. For some reason, she also on a regular basis tries to tell my sister that one day I’ll betray her. So, she makes my sister suspicious of me, which makes it hard for me to get her to consistently take her medicine. It’s fucking unbearable with this woman/my mother.

Anyway my point is I want to leave but I don’t know what to do about my sister. I thought about getting a job in the new city then bringing her over once I have a stable situation. But it’s hard for me to trust my mother for what could take months. My brother is likely to go back to his old ways and father is just a pushover. Also, staying in my current city isn’t an option.

Any advice?

schizophrenia,Nice_toknowyou,2018/04/03,"If you have been diagnosed with this disorder by a licensed professional First of all, I will start off by saying if you click on my username, you will see I've asked this same type of response under the borderline personality forum, and schizotypal forum. Oh by the way, I have borderline personality disorder. Just a heads up.

I would like to learn more/understand your disorder -- what it is like in your day to day life, your childhood/upbringing and anything else you'd like to share.

I am interested in POSSIBLY becoming a mental health counselor one day. Who the heck knows though. I change so much. But I'd like to get as much knowledge as I can beforehand. I guess it sounds more like I am studying a person ... but not really. I want to understand them. But I do think its best to have open communication with me.

That being said, if I ask something that you are uncomfortable answering, just tell me you don't want to answer. But i will want to start off by asking general questions first. I can be a VERY paranoid person so I understand if there are things you would prefer not to discuss with me!

Also, I am not the best at giving advice at this point in my life so it might not be best to go into this with those expectations. However! I CAN definitely be a soundboard/ a good listener AND give you some company!

If you are interested, shoot me a PM!

This is just for me personally. I am not in school - this isn't some project or anything like that. This is for my eyes only.

schizophrenia,Yuanakil,2018/04/03,"Anybody Share This Experience? To preface this, I'm a bit atypical. I have schizoaffective order (depressive type) and OCD with a focus on scrupulosity. My hallucinations are visual and tactile, almost never auditory, and I experience delusions of grandeur and persecution and--most recently--aggressive paranoia. That said...

You hear a lot of charming and sleazy men say that they fall in love with every woman they meet, and maybe it's cute, but we know they're not serious. I, however, actually fall a bit in love and a lot in lust with at least 10% of the women that I meet, and it haunts me. I can't stand myself, not just because I'd have no chance, but also because these women don't deserve to be burdened with my affections, I don't actually want to feel a need for their approval, and--most importantly--I'm married.

My marriage exacerbates the issue; my illnesses fucked up my life, my wife grew distant because I couldn't fulfill my vows due to my disability, I felt horribly lonely, I cheated, she knows, and now there's zero romance or passion, which makes these sudden gusts of desire all that much harder to push away. The aforementioned scrupulosity has me reeling with guilt every day, but the paranoia has me fighting with my wife over every goddamned thing that I get wrong, and I get a lot wrong, thanks to the combination of illness, meds and ECT treatments. 

I don't know what kind of fucked-up delusion this is that has me falling in love with relative strangers, for my entire life but especially in the past three years, but it'd be driving me insane if I wasn't already. Does anybody else deal with this? How do you manage it? I know that it's a lot worse for me than it might otherwise be, due to me having the kind of OCD that I do as well, but I figure I can't be the only person who falls madly in love.",9.045017908309458,7.271939467048714,8.977046919770775,69.55204602435529,61.20630372492837,11.819555873925502,38.7179441260745,10.550175099000144,3.9787262177650433,1450,59,265,27,16,475,188,349,0.188,0.667,0.146,-0.9497,1,2,0,0,3,0,55.0,1,2,3,1,7,24,4,1,16,0,23,11,0,3,2,53,43,22,0,5,11,2,2,0,0,1,4,3,0,5,24,20,0,0,7,0,0,7,11,11,1,2,3,5,42,13,38,33,9,28,0,2,0,7,28,11,1,8,8,180,66,2,0.0,0.0,0.20713680556377187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10627471851815858,0.0,0.11711803518542735,0.08487280464723297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971342982797153,0.0,0.0,0.19408914840397887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2317348072348061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844562007533217,0.10941624905583737,0.09141034800921838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09287582449623896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08865870910822786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26825946263286443,0.0,0.0,0.20763267792212287,0.0,0.0,0.053662948055488977,0.0,0.10190226223675564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09811626325202273,0.11089798040644938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11961718447103288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11077303667124656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2210379026895838,0.23330696456868594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499267200022143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3609146231315596,0.3831489531405982,0.0,0.07084316836949946,0.0,0.1066227066026839,0.0,0.11788745198254685,0.0,0.0,0.11258806311061488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07801838838695573,0.07869468257862472,0.0818546564457395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071729600053583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131390796237742,0.0,0.09266936701487913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100954744741983,0.08439951393413142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771103013664016,0.0,0.0,0.07050862273235138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06259872674225145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542438247820184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815640602465654,0.0,0.2320748536922164,0.0,0.06834478957222086

schizophrenia,schithrowawa,2018/04/03,"Should I disclose my schizophrenia to a group So I'm going to get a bachelors in Human Services. One of my courses is a group work course that I'm currently in. The major assignment is where you have to faciliate group and I'm considering self-disclosing my schizophrenia. This group is currently in a working stage and I feel a litte bit more closer to the isolated side then intimacy. I feel like a day for disclosure would really add to the cohesiveness of the group.          

My experience with it has obivously been residual, I currently really only have auditory hallucinations, there is a voice in my head. Initally what happened was the stressed that caused it, which for me was a concoction of things. At the time I first got the diagnoses I was 18 years old transition from high school to college, I was experiemnting with psychedelic drugs, and my girlfriend at the time siad that she cheated on me with one of my friends. There was three nights without sleep. I was having delusions of persecution and it concerned my family and I was hospitalized. I've since had treatment and I only go to counseling and don't take medication.

Mostly why I want to disclose is that in the group I'm a member that is very withdrawn. I hardly have appropriate time for the floor to talk about this illness that I have. I'm not one to have it define me, I'm stronger then it and I thank God everyday that it isn't as severe as most cases. It's just that other people in the class and they've talked about their clincal depression they have had a parent pass away when they were young, not to say that these are not something devestating it's just that they have a lot less stigma to deal with then me. It is not something that I can just whip out and tell a group. People don't get semicolon tattoos to signinfy they survived schizophrenia, nobody is out there wearing t shirts that say I love someone with schizophrenia. So I kind of need the time where the class period is mine to disclose that to a group. Just to make myself feel comfortable, and sort of ease myself into saying it, and ease the group also into hearing it.

I'm also going to open up for disclosure for anyone else if they have anything that they want to disclose to the group.

If you took the time to read that and want to give me your input at all please let me know what you think. There are pros and cons to this I feel and I just want possible a second opinion from someone who can relate more.",6.0102889358703315,6.737058503171253,6.2507547568710375,78.32993058491898,66.50528541226214,9.520197322057788,30.77723749119098,9.558583805096642,2.704675038759691,1964,71,370,38,30,629,217,473,0.033,0.885,0.083,0.9507,4,0,3,0,0,0,33.0,0,4,7,4,18,9,1,1,30,0,40,9,4,2,1,59,72,27,0,9,12,1,5,1,2,2,4,5,0,1,36,26,0,0,6,1,0,5,8,3,0,6,13,10,48,6,62,56,9,49,0,1,0,1,37,23,0,7,21,269,84,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614274227927086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057262622581506,0.10341474677179896,0.08305681784780293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09482708897069432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11018945603001076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10368294695352877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06509152193175445,0.10405443280767562,0.08693089003624559,0.102441859532633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704679579867913,0.0,0.0843140920048308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872893980536546,0.09514785312504367,0.0,0.2041330303637845,0.07210443616297722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585103501093537,0.0,0.0,0.07797829358332735,0.0,0.10546355363380264,0.09682128506317736,0.17208259206702478,0.0,0.08072296799540846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08925209537647197,0.0,0.09041348541706036,0.0,0.10358333277802736,0.0,0.11375548322656008,0.0,0.0,0.1066381219304762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10510309845124316,0.05546850691227366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032077975640596,0.0,0.049309316238818096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580710526547447,0.09109329588595656,0.0,0.06737158115541943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10167639046315652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07483834102666131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471599933558401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590909199286924,0.0,0.20517840854974911,0.15352367725234006,0.0,0.0,0.11207085803674338,0.0,0.0,0.13994435402887145,0.0,0.0,0.1107908681608142,0.0,0.11378344785573362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10095734668979968,0.0,0.12931672795705434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24079084123541425,0.0,0.10214658238970717,0.0,0.0,0.1052920370560622,0.11402220936404335,0.0,0.08349036676726568,0.0,0.10100292405250323,0.0,0.17103537985976708,0.15540174170470086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11561501246956682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07588682436149911,0.16224747567472994,0.08821729802836467,0.09292281455136726,0.0,0.0,0.06705342953879836,0.06467189014789353,0.0,0.0,0.29426557121878083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1121369810152762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08327784795939776,0.2381245952718992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910736566518724,0.0,0.0,0.0972929506834469,0.0,0.14695653304783193,0.0,0.0,0.07169780003771288,0.0,0.0,0.0649956325103797

schizophrenia,abcspace,2018/04/04,"Started seeing/feeling a present behind him. Might this be an onset? A sibling (let's call Bill) of mine in the last weeks started to see and feel a person behind him. It happens when Bill wakes up to go to work. This person appears in the backseat when Bill is driving. This person walks behind Bill to work. This person is gone after Bill is preoccupied with work. When Bill looks at this person, the person looks back at Bill but doesnt say or do anything to Bill.

Bill tells himself what he is seeing is not real.

Do you think Bill is developing schizophrenia? I'm trying to convince Bill to go see a doctor.

Oh, one more thing. Bill has been averaging 4 hours of sleep because of work. This can be the reason for the hallucination?

Thank you for any help.",2.630408163265308,5.09947965986395,3.4837006802721078,87.54106122448981,78.93197278911566,5.00843537414966,22.044897959183675,6.079149491110277,0.3645804081632651,598,18,113,4,15,190,87,147,0.0,0.932,0.068,0.8702,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,2,0,4,4,2,0,0,10,0,16,3,2,1,0,11,32,6,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,9,2,0,0,3,0,12,6,2,0,0,1,2,7,6,2,22,26,1,22,0,0,5,0,16,5,0,3,11,73,15,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08369117422118479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10127534199175166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09463250285501584,0.0,0.07502175059763637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12566726000014408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259663875626372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244548189878176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13988595449081914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882955447794998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249059003434875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211982238829833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10031770156165327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584644181371205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066940125444265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13055681361496976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339477333567208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6447548848207231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14007952215001496,0.0,0.12653548052683164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09786944819422484,0.0,0.0,0.2942102971519325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231579290014272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17421781405341874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10756777419263054,0.11330544639659315,0.0,0.0,0.08176160830897115,0.07885767793298823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08355580648902089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09871856850363002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35838293659681864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Act943,2018/04/04,They diagnosed me as a meth addict! WTF! Luckily got it straightened out I went to the psych ward after a psychotic breakdown. I screamed and cried for the first day (sorry nurses) but then I felt a little better. I also have extremely fucked up teeth. I took a drug test and it came back positive for meth!! Here's the thing though: it DIDNT say I had bentos in my system when I SHOULD have tested positive for them because I am prescribed them. So obviously it was a faulty test! They were about to send my ass to a rehab center!! The doctor did not believe me but I begged for a second test which came back clean except for the benzo. So glad I was able to convince them.,1.6662656641604023,4.1606416917293245,3.039428571428573,89.0639047619048,83.21052631578948,5.651929824561403,19.392982456140352,7.03164865440522,0.45878486215538894,527,14,103,7,15,171,88,133,0.13699999999999998,0.682,0.181,0.8206,0,0,3,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,5,2,9,5,1,0,12,0,10,8,2,0,1,12,17,11,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,1,5,2,1,0,6,5,0,0,1,0,0,5,2,2,0,2,12,3,19,3,16,4,0,18,0,0,0,2,7,5,2,0,7,79,25,6,0.19095630621051768,0.0,0.0,0.20817055997889106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527076890859378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29366722489309594,0.0,0.11640519187357673,0.0,0.0,0.21514236582600996,0.0,0.16888533494357744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4368062859288176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20975653575490008,0.1231510200847217,0.0,0.0,0.19381663120500767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19545187091798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22144869058935726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833479999097863,0.0,0.0,0.1624273365125921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17653602806269925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527252022671049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19138838484457105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15185611912352193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21375995097961992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686288479381164,0.0,0.1876136013137108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21215948239359456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17701840896651666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Aleksandra1128,2018/04/04,What Does a Psychotic Episode Feel Like? Hi! I’m really curious what a psychotic episode feels like. What thoughts go through you head? What emotions do you feel? What do you see? How do you interact with people during an episode? Thanks! ,1.9595930232558127,4.538582023255814,1.8736918604651187,91.20263081395348,100.86046511627909,6.801162790697672,28.630813953488367,7.6454224807358475,2.628351162790698,189,10,35,5,8,56,28,43,0.0,0.7490000000000001,0.251,0.9009,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,4,0,0,1,3,0,0,3,0,3,1,1,1,0,6,11,1,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,4,3,2,10,0,1,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,0,2,18,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2557473652812282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3287385989678531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.443306672738194,0.4175627057592052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16609073491481707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29992978940009896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2855542960113904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20260730904246368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872209454062704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2328830636897063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690618215440161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2320115155723527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,relytbackwards,2018/04/04,"My friend thinks his room is bugged and that shadow people are following him what can I do to help him? My friend has been experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. I am no doctor but it seems like pretty common things you hear about the condition. Shadow figures following him around campus, strange voices, the FBI listening to him. He just went back to school so I think he may be stressed which is bringing the symptoms back out. He has been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a doctor after he withdrew from classes for having a pretty bad episode. Family is heavily religious (from India) so I'm not sure how helpful they are with the situation even though they know about it. What kinds of things can I say to him to help him? Should I tell him outright that these things aren't real?

 I have asked him how his medication is working and if he sees a doctor at school. He says the meds don't work and he has spoken to a counselor and doctor. I'm just worried he will backslide and if there's anything I can do to help I would want to know the right way to approach it. 

He seems pretty functional too, he's been getting homework done by the sound of it but I don't know if he has a lot of friends on campus or extra curricular things to do. Thank you for any advice!",4.761726907630521,6.122879248995986,5.15921686746988,82.71223895582331,69.76305220883535,7.9429718875502004,28.29116465863454,8.344100000000001,1.9179333333333333,1019,36,195,15,18,324,136,249,0.08800000000000001,0.768,0.14400000000000002,0.9446,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,2,2,15,9,0,1,12,0,31,9,0,2,1,35,51,16,0,6,9,0,0,1,3,4,9,6,2,0,14,9,0,0,8,0,0,5,5,2,0,0,5,8,25,7,29,41,2,16,0,0,1,0,38,6,0,8,5,138,39,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09953977486959986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06927063240260264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08382493198168899,0.09068005810814128,0.09522856606138344,0.0,0.0,0.15665339576389198,0.08505171775330721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10338924762487577,0.0,0.0,0.11674432753817095,0.4170461895957704,0.0,0.1042416655863432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672798415749284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09602778583482056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23609832371552256,0.0,0.05321944326172237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480750034854365,0.0,0.273107667188005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10607509783103586,0.16794444837390962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04976533157526763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08660065421244997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131473186267206,0.10261669945429054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061928365223219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3108952178451268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159428957268674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08699082138403649,0.0,0.1620117923400248,0.0,0.2061824794845712,0.08117197355924292,0.18546530052426016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144987747293584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11668422662282295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09600508691247506,0.21175023442726296,0.0,0.0,0.08903313657388895,0.0937821699789755,0.0,0.0,0.27069417374156873,0.13053995886787612,0.10008031283703783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06008169623838469,0.08085445750170636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442842961934553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14831559535031238,0.10344726812261794,0.0,0.0723608653345127,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,mistertrevinwhite,2018/04/04,"What Is A Day As A Paranoid Schizophrenic Like? Hello, all. I have a large fascination with psychology and am trying to familiarize myself with the different types of schizophrenia. 

I, myself, have bipolar disorder and when people ask me what it’s like living with them I can give them symptoms. But, symptoms just show what it *is* and not what it’s *like*.

So, could someone give me a little walkthrough or snapshot into your daily life dealing with it? Preferably a detailed “good day” and a “bad day”, if that isn’t asking too much.

Thanks in advance.",2.268943894389441,5.187372594059409,3.158772277227726,84.40858745874591,90.3861386138614,5.06957095709571,24.55511551155116,6.742157984588678,1.3483380858085812,436,18,73,6,15,138,69,101,0.078,0.784,0.13699999999999998,0.7319,1,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,2,1,4,6,0,0,7,0,8,5,0,0,1,17,13,10,0,3,5,0,0,3,0,0,5,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,10,5,9,12,2,8,0,0,0,0,9,3,0,2,7,57,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3519266536790599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1571585484091162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15028094615152235,0.0,0.0,0.3641652672551528,0.1940499018813318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966532309060336,0.215720146935938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36112177750774505,0.0,0.15787272864313978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329476451480835,0.2758691115734684,0.18864914062021088,0.1662045747222213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383657431329273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1304902993337237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15948094561895435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3912720441978927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17329067642469426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277912288082972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,Gypsy_says,2018/04/04,"Tw: An artist wishes to ask some questions for a painting. Hello, I have received permission to ask these questions but I feel like I should go in depth as to what I am doing.

I have been interviewing many people over these past few years to learn about their own issues they live with. I have been wanting to interview this community with a different approach. I am not a psych major there for I will not ask psychological questions. My questions are based on human senses and the seven elements of art.   

My questions are:

1: What colors can you associate with your surroundings and or What colors do you best identify with?

2: what textures do you feel/ visualize?

3: What smell do you recall the most of?

4: Name a shape and a plane of space you prefer. 

If you do not wish to partake that is okay I understand the private life, If you do partake I am grateful and look forward to your answers. If you wish to answer but not let anyone else read feel free to PM me. 

I look forward to interviewing you all along with the approved list of people.",4.248750000000001,6.086598975000001,4.979000000000003,81.62950000000002,71.75,7.6,28.0,8.278499904357787,1.9815500000000004,825,31,153,13,16,266,118,200,0.028,0.8490000000000001,0.123,0.9666,1,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,11,2,2,2,4,0,0,10,1,21,1,0,0,1,42,35,11,0,9,10,0,3,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,9,10,0,0,13,3,1,5,4,0,0,1,2,8,27,5,27,30,7,14,0,0,4,0,28,9,0,11,5,116,36,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08246986320391106,0.12084855666626232,0.0,0.0,0.3307878679152453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12377596612087975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12322738708953485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985278854658361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17890955732220273,0.08425990791002609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703084272426083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12310390236478826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12060671965713912,0.08330801815879223,0.057621953190204564,0.0,0.1041475666124858,0.0,0.1980881339708935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11957768422805445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259181664406835,0.16353637876521346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6606267794314103,0.0,0.11797688446929333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12278487008120645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06956699731820633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4068926734725941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07595269169708133

So much anxiety and paranoia. Voices are starting to creep up too, though it’s mosty at night. 

I’ve called the Pharmacy and the hospital (where I was prescribed) and nothing is happening it seems. Is there anything I can do to speed this up?

schizophrenia,Maslover51,2018/04/05,"Could i get some sort of disability? I work with developmentally disabled children and at risk teens. For over a year I just did community based services with one little boy. But my company needed people for their school based stuff and I needed more money so I figured why not? Things have been going great, I'm sure I can handle it. Well, I was wrong. Thing is, I'm unmedicated but can usually handle myself so to speak. But with a great deal of added stress and redused sleep from this new position things are not going well at all. I've had 2 major issues (not sure if I should call them melt downs or episodes or whatever else) in the past month and a lot more trouble with just every day Life. But I needed the money. I'm going to try to make it to the end of the semester for the sake of one of the kids I work with who doesn't do well with change. But after that, since my mental illness is directly effecting my ability to work more hours, could I get some disability in addition to just working with that one child in the community? If so, how? Any help is appreciated. I'm at home right now because last night was really bad. I told my employer that I wasn't feeling well because they don't know I have these problems.

schizophrenia,flint4c,2018/04/05,"While high on marijuana I become schizophrenic Smoking weed always makes my mental condition much worse. After 30 minutes of smoking I begin to hear voices narrating my actions and if I focus my vision on something I begin to hallucinate symmetric patterns of what i am looking at (almost like LSD which I have taken in the past). I have since stopped smoking weed. 

I have voices in my head for most of the day and almost every day but i do not have visual or auditory hallucinations sober.",6.741666666666667,8.03272338888889,7.828888888888893,65.65000000000002,65.1111111111111,9.555555555555557,33.888888888888886,9.725611199111238,3.6592222222222235,395,17,59,8,6,134,62,90,0.042,0.919,0.039,-0.0644,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,6,2,1,1,0,11,12,6,0,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,4,13,1,12,11,2,15,0,0,1,0,1,6,0,5,9,44,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4642736526412311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19289495677579946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560298253006254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2990127707017996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1953205213631521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2379168470277745,0.0,0.2612808950584865,0.0,0.0,0.2449332828190685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11325680236389912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19467258048091352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547433717171662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2336226345347724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17041626952606373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213008830741502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19176603306467405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17846834725928934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938140565007488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23624701331500364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,fablechaser130,2018/04/05,"My girlfriend is gonna run out of antipsychotics before her next doctor visit and idk what to do She takes 20mg of olanzapine daily along with 50mg of Serataline. We moved and havent gotten set up with a new doctor until recently, she has her first visit on either the 11th or the 14th id have to check. She has like 65mg left. 


When she dosnt take her meds her symptoms get really bad. She sees a dark shadow-ey guy she named fig. He pokes her and scares her. He is always there even with her meds but when shes on them he is less aggresive and apparently doesnt mess with her as much. She also sees little blob things that act similar to cats she calls blobbies. Sometimes when shes doing bad she will interact with them she says they are nice. Along with those hallucinations (positive symptoms I believe they are called) she also hears 3 voices which are very mean to her. When she doesnt get her meds they sometimes will scream at her and she normally cant do much besides lie in my arms and cry while I rub her head. 

Im very worried about these symptoms comming back in full force. If I were to go to a pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist is there any way I could get them to give me like 5 days (100mg or so) of olanzapine so she wont have to go through that? I understand that it is a controlled substance but its not like it is drugs. Has anyone ever gone through a situation like this? Any tips would be appreciated. 

I also have some seroquel that I aquired a long time ago and never threw away. She has never taken/been perscribed it but my understanding is is that it is an antipsychotic as well. Would giving her that prevent withdrawl/ rebound symptoms?  I know its generally not advisable to just take random meds but im at a loss here and I hate to see her suffer. Any advice would be great, thank you if you read this far. I hope that you are doing good &lt;3 stay strong everyone.

schizophrenia,loopy457,2018/04/06,"Do I have schizophrenia? I’ve shown a lot of the signs for it you know intense paranoia, delusions, every so often I’ll hallucinate either visual or audio. The delusions are difficult to deal with because I don’t know if I’m living in a delusion right now.

A lot of my friends say I most likely have it, even my friend who is currently diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

It’s getting worse as time goes by and I’m worried it will get really bad so I wanna get help. What should I do? I tried to talk to my mum about it but you see, I think she might have it too. She told be that I might be seeing dead people and that she is a guardian angel who has passed down their powers to me. So she just brushes off my worries. Is there any thing else I can do to get help. I tried to go to the nhs for other mental health reasons but they’ve put me on a 18 month waiting list so that’s a dead end.

schizophrenia,Wasted_Weasel,2018/04/06,"Posting this I posted on legaladvice. Any help would be nice! Hi legaladvice. Not a lurker, just got pointed out on your direction. I live on Bogota, Colombia at the time, and am a Colombian national.

I'm in some bit of a predicament, and I think I'll be posting this here and on r/financialadvice also, heck even maybe even over at r/schizophrenia.

First of all, what's the deal? As of today (apr06/2018) I recieved on my mail a ""Permanent Mental Disability"" Disability Card from my health provider.

I do have a mental condition, was diagnosed as a type something bipolar, and with schizoid personality disorder by two separate psichiatrists. But I am not disabled dude cmon!

And now for the backstory:

Year 201xxsomething. I had a couple of psicotic breaks, couple little moments that my brain was not firing correctly and that leaded me to being instituzionalized for a couple days, analyzed and brain scanned. Always had suffered from crippling migraines, not something I cannot endure, been in pain since I was 12 so I have learnt how to jus ignore it. So I saw this psichiatrist and she said I was bipolar, and I wanted a second opinion. I went to this other hot AF, totally true she-doctor and we had over 100 sessions. She was super cool. She even did not tell my parents what she told me: That I had schizoid personality disorder. Nah, she told them I was depressed and nothing to worry about. Those two diagnoses came from private practices, and IDK if my health provider has access to those records, but Im inclined to think they dont.

I've always had jobs. I've always rocked my jobs. All my jobs have ended because the company went broke or dissolved. Important jobs! I've been lead designer for a couple architectural firms, chief designer and prodution manager at a plastic injection factory, and associate at an architec's studio to name a few. Have had my fair share of solo projects. And not being egomaniac, I fucking rock.

By the ending of 2017 (but hey c'mon who wasn't affected by that crp year) I began feeling ""strange"" helicopters unto me, my phone wanted to asssassinate me, and I kept vividly dreaming of murdering my family and pets. Worry not, as I am not a violent one, nor I have the guts to dis-gut anyone. So I went to the doctor's.

I was broke (and still am) by that time, so I had to chose my health provider's psychiatrists, so off I went. It was a 10-fucking-minutes session. She asked me what did I feel, I told her, she wrote me a prescription and let me go.

I stuck to the prescription for a while, feeling awesome as ever, nigthmarish thoughts erradicated.

And now this pops up in my mail.

Now, could this be an error? could this 10-minute-session left an impression too big for the doctor to call disability?

I am looking at the following possibilities here:

Supposedly I dont have to work ever again (Disability Retirement), and I am inclined to claim it, but could it be an error? then I would get in so much trouble.

According to my brother (a surgeon involved in public health) I could sue the health provider for false claims.

And according to my father I'm fucked up as I cannot drive, sign any document, have a bank account or basically anything as long as I dont have my caregiver's permission which, in any eventuality would suck.

My wife's the one making the contributions to the health system as I am currently unemployed (and in hindsight have been for a long while, I was always so happy the companys went bankrupt so I could enjoy a couple more hours of sleep).

I've contributed enough (according to my country's retirement laws - at least 50 weeks worth of work) to my retirement fund, so technically I could do this.

It's like free money, why not? Because I feel I am being dishonest.

Honestly yeah, I'm a bit off but not a disabled guy, I am mostly normal in social situations and overall enjoy doing stuff (except for the waking up early in the morning part)

I've been doing great unemplyed, am currently designing a school campus, I own a cannabis start-up on Colombia (that's where Im from) and have like a nice life.

I don't have many friends (and the ones I've got seriously think I'm joking) to ask for advice... so legaladvice will you advice me?

schizophrenia,precisioneffect,2018/04/06,"Schizophrenia Research Inquiry Hi,

I Hope you’re doing well

I write you from precisioneffect—a healthcare advertising agency based in Boston, MA.

Right now, we’re doing research on schizophrenia and we’re looking for schizophrenia patients or caregivers of patients with schizophrenia to speak with. Our goal is to better understand the challenges of living with schizophrenia so we can better design support tools and materials to help patients and caregivers cope with the day-to-day.

If you are someone who suffers from schizophrenia or a caregiver of a loved one diagnosed with schizophrenia and you’re available 4/9-4/12 for a 1 hour long telephone interview please respond to us via email at precisioneffectResearch@gmail.com.
All participants will be compensated for your time $200 honorarium.

schizophrenia,HappilyAverage,2018/04/06,"What can I do to make things easier? I hope you can help me out. I have been through the side bar but my question hasn’t really been answered there. I support a lady who has a learning disability and also schizophrenia. She has a community mental health team and is on meds but she has been having a really bad time over the last few weeks. She is hallucinating, terrified, not sleeping, manic etc. Due to her learning disability it is really difficult to explain to her what is happening. She is a 71 year old lovely lady and it is heart breaking to watch. She has really good medical support. My question is what can I do? From her perspective what might help? Quite, music, physical contact, no physical contact? I just want some ideas on how I can help day to day.

it’s not what you think 

not a soul trapped on its way to god 

not a hero, crippled in a war. 

it’s ugly in every imperfect stroke 

of a saturated black brush 

on a canvas of skin and bone and soul,

succinctly described in a room with sticky walls.

leave with new poison. 

it’s a third eye that’s not spiritual- 

it’s not holy creatures that show their faces 

their opal claws are something else 

something not made on this earth. 

hot breath on the neck 

whispering in weak ears 

dark things. vile. thick secrets that crawl. 

it’s unfiltered hopelessness that reflects in broken mirrors. 

it’s a guardian. not an angel but still something 

that stands over the foot of the bed 

looking on with rheumy eyes, yellowed.

something watching. no rest. 

no talking because they see everything.

it’s not showering, not eating, 

nothing to do to prove humanity. 

what can be done? 

it’s not knowing when sleep will come, 

sweating through stained sheets, 

splayed out like a crucifixion, 

but no cause is to die for. 

it’s not your moment to pity

not your monster to fear 

it is, and it will be. 

no running. no break. no freedom. 

chained. 

don’t you dare say it’s a beautiful struggle,

that there is anything poetic about it. 

there are no fallen angels. 

there are no lost souls. 

there’s no salvation in god, no martyrdom. 

it is not for you to pity. 

not for you to make into art. 

it’s so ugly.

schizophrenia,midorilied,2018/04/06,"I need to vent. School is kicking my ass. I've been taking my medication sporadically because I'm so busy and overwhelmed by school. Trying to keep myself on a constant schedule. I started hearing voices for the first time in months during class so I packed up my stuff and hid in the bathroom. 

I had a panic attack at my job a couple weeks ago and had to leave early. Everyone is judging me. I don't know how to react. 

Seven months ago, I posted about my older brother's paranoid schizophrenia. He's been doing much better, since he's been seeing a psychiatrist, taking his medication and eating/sleeping regularly. I'm happy for him. 

Life is happening. Whack.

schizophrenia,INTELDracula,2018/04/06,Possible synmtopms of schizophrenia flare? I've been diagnosed with unspecified  schizophrenia for 4 years now but never had expierance with hallucinations before. My synmtopms were a lot different  compared to normal people. Recently I haven't been able to get my seroquel medicine due to certain events. It been a good month now without them and I've been experiencing synmtopms I never had before. One of them is that I am constantly thinking if that make sense like my brian just won't shut off. Another is that every time I look in the mirror my eyes get abnormally large. My eye also start to look like it off track or veering to the side. Is this normal synmtopms for a flare up of schizophrenia?,6.0593700787401605,8.25937135433071,6.3661496062992144,72.040562992126,67.74015748031496,9.804409448818898,32.385039370078744,10.125756701596842,3.718203779527559,570,25,92,15,10,183,81,127,0.0,0.893,0.107,0.924,1,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,2,0,4,4,0,0,5,0,13,3,2,1,3,16,20,5,0,3,5,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,7,5,11,4,17,12,1,18,0,0,4,0,2,6,0,3,14,64,17,0,0.1856585750682369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14847109540547335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946792038284145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3159635459657645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20063096323162413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884395456119572,0.0,0.19397369553291446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15642535688367298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1939978853961092,0.0,0.0,0.15572160425580509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18140680360296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31181288750069125,0.0,0.0,0.15784028130954209,0.0,0.0,0.12392854052051032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14819090333334126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863826771614493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3638119690378853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12580705534792594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12871227935763346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093021476759324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18331544486249898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141009501273973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11896251833903272,0.0,0.0,0.10825900814899987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17896824112407897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955803528845713
schizophrenia,thespottedhawk,2018/04/06,"I love to write but all my stories manifest into delusions. It's really quite stressful and I don't know what to do. I've thrown away/deleted countless books I've attempted to write, because the schizo seizes it and turns it into a delusion. 
As a recent example, I began writing a sci-fi story. After about two months of rough drafts, my brain is now trying to convince me that I'm going to be abducted by aliens. The tactile hallucinations have gotten worse and I feel like I'm constantly being watched. I know it's just a delusion but I can't get it out of my head, probably because of how invested I was in finishing the story. 
I ended up deleting all of it. This time it really upset me, because I really wanted to see this one through to the end. I wish I wasn't so weak. 

Are there any schizo writers here who experience the same issue? What do you do to cope? I'd really like to continue writing this story, but if I do the delusion will get worse.

schizophrenia,karlrowden,2018/04/07,"Use of low dose neuroleptics (antipsychotics) It's well known that neuroleptics can rob us of motivation and creativity. I'm not schizophrenic myself, but I got them prescribed and understand very well how they feel. I have a schizophrenic friend, so I somewhat understand what kind of problems people with this condition are dealing. So I want to suggest you following two articles regarding usage of low dose neuroleptics:

*  http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/index.php/articles/45-use-of-low-dose-neuroleptics/67-example-news-1 - Use of low dose neuroleptics, by practicing psychiatrists who are critical about mainstream approach to neuroleptic treatment 
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6UikVwxX_sSVHRxdnN6MmlEX3c/view - A Guide to Minimal Use of Neuroleptics: Why and How

I hope some can find this helpful. I suggested approach with low dose neuroleptic to my friend with schizophrenia, and he was able to stop his normal dose injectable antipsychotic and use small dose of oral antipsychotics on demand, despite that he had psychotic episodes before. 

So I'm not to tell you what to do, but I understand very well what typical doses of neuroleptics can do to drive, creativity, and ability to think, and I know that some people might benefit from this approach, that's why I'm posting this. If you'll decide to reduce your dosage, please be extremely careful, go slow, and better consult with your doctor, because as you're probably aware neuroleptics can cause withdrawal psychosis even in healthy people.

schizophrenia,minimumdosage,2018/04/07,"Anaesthesia Hi, Everyone. I just wanted to share a positive anecdote. So, today I've undergone a procedure called MUA (manipulation under anaesthesia). It's a procedure recommended to me by my chiropractor, it's when they perform adjustments on the spine and other areas while the patient is under anaesthesia.

For some background information, I'm a 29 year old male. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 2 years ago, but was silently dealing with the symptoms for over 4. I'm on 2mg of risperidone daily. On my best days, I'm being productive at work. On my worst days, I'm running naked through the street, and pooping on my front step.

Anyway, the point of this post is that after I woke up from the anaesthesia... I felt like my old self again. It felt like my brain had reset. Even as I type this, my symptoms are coming back. But, for a few moments I had a level of clarity and lucidity I haven't felt in years. It made me realize that it IS possible for me to be completely healthy. It gives me hope.

I'm not a medical professional by any means, but I just wanted to share the circumstances of a very positive experience I had.",4.895494186046513,6.473940953488379,6.225508720930238,74.362449127907,69.69767441860465,10.212209302325583,32.50726744186046,10.411451182825502,3.7211918604651166,895,41,162,26,16,302,126,215,0.026,0.805,0.16899999999999998,0.9835,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,1,3,8,7,0,0,15,0,12,7,3,2,0,25,28,10,0,3,6,0,3,2,0,0,4,0,0,2,11,6,0,0,7,0,0,4,2,1,0,0,10,3,21,6,31,16,4,35,0,0,0,0,10,15,0,2,17,110,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12859372106878694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09865097828854197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115480702883654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15223955134627745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16194347695429126,0.14813029274855918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496293746952633,0.1521006736291009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871132694429244,0.1495583798385193,0.0,0.14724061364751007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958158163172108,0.0,0.0,0.1386183587109359,0.0,0.14190400045480764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4178630881661363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391621109952759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14408491148395086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14174545473239716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372665203940176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580212016229551,0.0,0.14614039801268944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30444819660683986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371358216310292,0.16354198138965662,0.13893471070158134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1513371996473022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30156167273987144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375071722640546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196960060343275,0.17112932004729225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10561097877465102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802564359597893

schizophrenia,IntrepidStabbing,2018/04/07,"Pity Parties Yo,  

I've been here a fort night.  You see lots of posts, people feeling bad for themselves.  Mercy me, I'm lost, I can't go on.  

Please do your best to encourage them to go on.  It should be a key here to encourage and empower others, not pity or remorse with them.  

It's like people can feed on other peoples misery.  While we have idea's of humanity, but, people should be more offensive towards this world.  Maybe that's an agenda of some parties, to brake people.  

Don't feel bad for yourself, No remorse, no self remorse, no remorse, no pity.  We had survived overwhelming odds throughout the eons.  Mankind is an ancient species on this planet.  Religion, dogma's, agenda's, they cripple people.  

I just get upset with the morale.  Many people are defeated, overwhelmed or demoralized by their afflictions or superficial inconveniences.  

That's enough, do your best to motivate yourselves and each other.  

I struggle myself, It's not out of pity or remorse.  I just becomed overwhelmed or deliberately driven to psychotic epsidoes.  People may instigate such things.  I am deeply ashamed I've lost control on several occassions now.  

My medicine is a tea-spoon of honey, and chill out.

schizophrenia,Rain0189,2018/04/07,"Missing my other half This is a long shot, but I have an identical twin sister coping with paranoid schizophrenia. I haven’t had a legitimate relationship with her in approximately 7 years, despite numerous attempts. Ever since her initial diagnosis, she’s refrained from associating with me (except on rare occasions). I miss her very much. I honestly can’t express that enough.

I’m just wondering if there’s any insight on a way to possibly repair our relationship or see if she’s okay. The only information I have of hers is a phone number, and I rarely text it, outside of randomly trying to check in and say hi. I typically only do this several months apart at a time. The only contact she has with my immediate family is randomly showing up at my parents if she is in financial strife. At the very least, I want her to know that I am here for her if she needs anything in the event that my parents aren't around. I know this is a long shot, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",5.684481781376518,6.901123942105265,7.0647368421052645,70.44354251012147,67.47368421052633,10.267206477732794,33.562753036437236,10.389873798559362,3.738165991902834,799,36,141,21,13,273,121,190,0.033,0.8640000000000001,0.103,0.9279,2,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,1,0,1,5,6,0,0,11,1,16,0,0,0,1,28,26,9,0,7,9,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,8,7,0,1,5,1,1,0,3,2,0,1,1,2,28,4,23,23,3,20,0,2,1,0,24,12,0,8,7,103,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525649990681554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21234273398344272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284787984142844,0.13898567682007126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16132039939059062,0.0,0.0,0.14122534859695451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14718215985116506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.172130006377642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1716060716648769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763340612359766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12461867476826592,0.0,0.1147709342793198,0.1157658140484398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35622369287613204,0.0,0.0,0.3467199815962976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17600915901602585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33524284306100993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241580512903838,0.0,0.0,0.12441259874908953,0.0,0.0,0.17637849403860553,0.0,0.1291494458779093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14374029571792524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103861184318676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10599963828431397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2576414102441782,0.0920874488879503,0.12392594065602422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16931251847290454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11090777899380666,0.0,0.0,0.1005403407389376

I always hear such sounds in the shower if I have heard something instrumental earlier. It makes for a nice shower.

schizophrenia,Z1094,2018/04/08,"I believe my mom isnt taking medication, how do I go about getting her back on track? First some back story, my mom has been paranoid schizophrenic since I was about 7(23 now) and while she's stable on medication, she ends up believing she doesn't need it and going off the rails(surprise surprise). It's gotten to the point she had to be involuntarily committed to a psych ward about 5-6 times. It's pretty much routine at this point that we have to wait till she does something that's deemed dangerous to herself or others before we can get any help. 

I know she's slipping again because her brother died recently and she's starting to say things that don't make sense. I had a friend over about an hour ago and she walked into my room while we were talking about PC builds and goes ""Where did you say you were planning on dumping me?"" I asked what she meant and she just stared at me silently and wouldn't give me any replies. She sat there for about a minute before I didn't know what else to say besides asking her to get out of my room because I had company over
 
I'm out of ideas as to what to do at this point, I honestly don't feel like dealing with this all again but I'm back living with her so I kinda have to. I can ask if she's taking her meds (which she lies about) or watch her take them but I think she ends up spitting them out. I've tried talking to her a few times but she ends up just staring at the TV and not responding to me. I can call her doctor and schedule an appointment, but you know you can't really force someone to take medication. I really don't know what to do and don't want to wait till I feel like I'm in danger before she gets help.

  Does anyone have any suggestions?",5.446965811965812,5.111370925925929,5.81119515669516,84.65764743589746,67.66096866096866,8.957321937321938,28.66111111111111,8.395991825355821,1.7079924786324794,1349,39,293,17,20,433,173,351,0.066,0.89,0.044,-0.7988,0,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,3,4,2,2,19,8,3,0,9,0,28,6,1,2,2,49,61,24,1,4,10,3,2,2,1,1,5,3,2,0,16,19,0,2,9,1,0,3,10,3,0,1,12,8,57,5,49,47,4,48,0,0,3,0,53,24,0,5,23,196,73,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08083630087731412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18604128016114155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06376364172478459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2557569308015148,0.0,0.0,0.2103633046116771,0.0,0.11117972435362787,0.0,0.2327933000102599,0.2054845539475695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09311733741075816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940150583626332,0.0,0.0,0.09464300996853944,0.0,0.0,0.0933389859305516,0.15960565520822415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617930410785792,0.0,0.24230741936739034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09221893890318096,0.13029531930843435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756795985773872,0.0,0.0,0.07045479586444182,0.0,0.1905764489310878,0.08747977880754255,0.10365315216813538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1222482945109517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08980585640908717,0.0,0.0,0.10294478916556886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20046718910223504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891037146410173,0.0,0.08052430143562729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060871439720561415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10129387338717187,0.27559936253259965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2136061877646528,0.0,0.0,0.0670366915412634,0.06761779204917448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586180517902669,0.0,0.0,0.09277515724720696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11683999804812162,0.0,0.0900412044306189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21755887165111826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754350534863818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726677655968635,0.07020413941915493,0.0,0.0,0.06454624288839557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742604626748762,0.1465935230548337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06058398399188448,0.05843222016224865,0.0,0.0,0.10634970219243373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191345482870601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05378746757344921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,BukkakeFan,2018/04/08,"PSA announcement about medication I’ve become a very typical schizophrenic story. I spent a lot of time on this forum telling people how they really don’t need to take their medications. 

Well, I’ve learned the hard way that we do need to take them. I had a bad psychotic break down and my symptoms are worse than ever. I have to take a higher dose than I otherwise would have had I not stopped taking them. I spent a week in a nightmare-ish hospital, and now I’m hearing voices when that used to not be a symptom of mine. In addition, I hear sounds as words now and I’m afraid of birds...birds. I also think I’m going to die nearly every day and spend the first portion of each day convincing myself that I’m not going to die. 

Please, please, please, do not stop taking your medication... EVER. I’d also like to apologize to anyone who I’ve advised to stop taking their meds.

schizophrenia,kapsemaj,2018/04/08,My recovery story I was all good untill 2016. I started hearing voices in my head and had delusional thoughts. I thought my professor could read my mind and I believed he was God and was going to send me to pain forever. I went from working full time and going to school full time to doing neither from the summer of 2016 till 2018. The voices lasted a week then they came back about a year later and lasted for about a month. I tried to kill myself to avoid being in pain but luckily I failed. I just got a job in February working 50 hours a week at Dominos as an assistant manager. I make decent money after overtime and I'm chasing a manager position that pays a healthy salary. I also got a girlfriend a few weeks after I started working. Life has been great lately and I just wanted to share my story. My advice to anyone struggling is to do your research and self reflecting. I really believe life is about finding out who you are and your purpose. On top of that being mentally strong helps too. Exercise is key. When I heard bad voices I would run and the voices would become positive and uplifting and it was like a battle between my angels and demons. I still run here and there just to maintain good health and I try to eat healthy.

schizophrenia,VisualPause,2018/04/08,"Where Should I Start? So I've had mild symptoms, mostly in the form of auditory hallucinations and some visual hallucinations for a few years, but only in the past 6 months has it gotten worse and I even had a few mild episodes of psychosis as well. I did some research and it's more than likely schizophrenia.

I'm curious as to where I should start out seeking help before it gets worse? I've read in some articles that I'll have to get admitted into a psychiatric hospital at least once for evaluation.

schizophrenia,creepyoccultshit,2018/04/08,"a vent about dreams hello, i have had recurring dreams! they're always different but always deal with watching an alternate version of myself as if i shared a head with them. and also they're almost always in an active dissociative or psychotic episode when i do peek in. sometimes i am of different appearance but i always recognize them as me, and sometimes they have supernatural abilities.

i know that this is a recipe for delusion fuel but i swear there's something to this. i believe this is some kind of power ive been rewarded with for being a good person to most people i meet, and maybe my other selves were bestowed with similar powers? or maybe we are just able to mentally cross the boundaries between multiverses...

one of the dreams i was peeking in on myself in the middle of a breakdown at a school, when suddenly dream me teleported home to finish out the breakdown, and they knew i was there because they kept yelling at me and telling me to leave although i couldn't... 

another time (the weirdest) i was peeking in on myself and it was normal until they must have sensed me. but then, they tried to materialize me and suddenly i felt pain in my dream like pins and needles and while i was asked some questions i was in too much pain and discomfort to coherently answer. so they let me wake up.

dunno what the point of this post is actually i guess i just wanted to share ^_^ have a good day or night",6.2582875816993475,6.9881129333333325,6.5996732026143805,76.03441176470591,65.96296296296296,9.612200435729848,32.17864923747277,9.627879704456738,3.0001590413943355,1132,44,204,22,17,366,152,270,0.055,0.802,0.14400000000000002,0.9737,6,0,1,0,1,0,25.0,1,0,8,3,10,10,0,1,15,0,24,4,2,0,1,43,32,28,0,5,10,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,1,1,8,16,0,1,5,5,0,2,1,3,0,1,12,3,40,7,38,16,5,30,0,0,1,0,18,15,0,12,13,159,48,1,0.1300722762226994,0.0,0.1269317784419355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13024859573566094,0.0,0.0,0.10401875230147367,0.4329222147603328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13639212283018845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12160001980161005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07929085229813812,0.0,0.0,0.14654691321937854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08388585755270983,0.13409880533112034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2717956883599025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12488978323058722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2181969081165082,0.0,0.0,0.14328927673739014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13349168125708835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13047309849652053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13545025962479873,0.07148432132809822,0.0,0.0,0.13772775956579145,0.0,0.13300771510404688,0.0,0.06354674395795812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26135016873579564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131082261106614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09561808933160423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12206401989736365,0.12744321373905654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08814034066546847,0.0,0.276812145356609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09017573870588004,0.11357409447608408,0.0,0.0,0.12296034410561515,0.0,0.12457328532325013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14571071780827732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316400877647778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001359929926912,0.2572896142474814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11368890258628625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584619027899288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08831053738676023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671999857261906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,chanovsky,2018/04/08,"Uncle Steve I had an Uncle Steve growing up- my dad's little brother. He was a grown adult and still lived with his mom... my mamaw, a large, jolly lady who was always sprawled out on the couch wearing a mumu and watching basketball or ice skating. When I was young, I had no idea about Uncle Steve's health issues, I just accepted him as who he was. 

When we would drive up to visit my mamaw, I would peer out the car window, looking for Uncle Steve. I would spot him wandering the neighborhood, or he would be in his regular spot- seated in the middle of the lawn wearing 4 baseball caps stacked on top of each other, talking to the grass. 

He never really talked to any of us when we visited. I only remember mamaw yelling ""STEVE!! Come say 'Hi' to your nieces!!"" He would appear in the doorway, unkempt, unable to make eye contact for more than a second. ""Hi,"" he would say and then disappear back into his bedroom. Or he would wander in and mamaw would angrily yell, ""You smell like paint!"" That's when I found out he huffed paint.

My dad told me a story about how one night when they were kids. It was during curfew (Memphis in the 60's) that everyone was in their homes, but Steve disappeared. Later in the night, a police officer showed up at the house with Steve, who they had found at the top of the UP Bank building downtown. The tallest building in Memphis at 430 feet. 

He used to drag things into the shed in their backyard, mainly I remember the hood of a car... that mamaw would have someone get rid of.. that Uncle Steve would drag back. My dad used to go over to help clean the house. He said one time he had spent hours cleaning and taking stuff out to the curb. And the next day when he went back, Steve had brought it all back inside.

Eventually, mamaw ended up in the hospital and then at an assisted living facility. No one knew what to do about Steve. A relative went to the house to check in on him one day and found him dead on the kitchen floor, a sandwich half made on the counter. Soon after that, the day after Christmas, mamaw passed away.

It was then that I learned Steve's biggest secret. When cleaning out the house, we discovered the surprise that was his bedroom. Opening the door, we were met with a wall of trash. Nothing even fell out or budged when the door was opened. At the top, a small tunnel... a tunnel Steve would crawl into where he would sleep somewhere inside, near the ceiling. It was mostly broken furniture and random junk he had gathered on his walks. Sadly, the photos I had of it were lost when my computer was stolen. I do have a single sheet of notebook paper I saved from his room where he had filled the page, writing ""O""s all over it. The other side was filled with ""O""s and ""8""s, with a small square of ""#""s at the top right. 

We don't know how Uncle Steve died. Apparently the situation wasn't ""important enough"" for an autopsy was the response I got every time I asked about it.",4.406968151228085,5.658987481546575,4.7124214496978,85.9951776758541,70.49384885764499,7.3789875262548765,25.828839641647736,7.678348718463194,1.293494114621287,2283,68,450,26,41,718,268,569,0.076,0.875,0.049,-0.9615,2,0,0,0,1,0,97.0,6,2,4,5,25,6,0,0,52,0,43,8,5,6,3,77,68,30,2,12,6,5,0,1,0,12,1,5,14,2,22,33,2,1,11,1,3,20,5,2,0,6,39,10,44,4,80,16,9,113,0,2,4,0,64,60,0,7,34,297,66,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06108882103800122,0.0,0.0,0.049926074082173234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06863497963014302,0.0,0.06897768341251442,0.2258125491528852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324224028860123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14204366414859132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07619524961809153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06502566612914193,0.07585938129221237,0.0,0.048491232694167656,0.0,0.06185698462024108,0.07015308480681601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24149383627932244,0.0,0.0,0.03835734964066729,0.0,0.041724570075373016,0.0,0.05871827756124199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803883240482824,0.0,0.0,0.04920986409215152,0.0,0.07364323190243233,0.0,0.07230095121162683,0.33885341966522997,0.0,0.08287885085184568,0.0,0.07662826830181592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04034806035585577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03586783525391022,0.07358311618829556,0.12965710304965175,0.0,0.061651785141416525,0.0,0.08014332253122608,0.0,0.0,0.06946893568707614,0.04900641416267887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08598509706161568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05662371245172535,0.0,0.07807980693336157,0.1377937525486817,0.0,0.07044558663736962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19899702306095174,0.05583693288902727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04703280685817849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663342867816133,0.06269771246848507,0.06983637443639792,0.11676828211329912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08252377827636567,0.07347001573764321,0.0,0.06220598149940116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0586309069333746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08404489425483758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05520044327846296,0.11801959896744063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048774989137122624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08562008021570572,0.0,0.0,0.07015308480681601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08831160522280737,0.12681742269487736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361165795409021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6258399205615405,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,WillyYerWonka,2018/04/08,"Terrified of Schizophrenia Hi there,
I am a 23 year old guy, and my mother has Schizophrenia,
I am absolutely terrified that there's a chance that I will get it as well.
Terrified because I saw from up close that it '' CAN '' do to someone.
My mother, thought that my father sexually abused me, and my sister, and no matter what was being said, she believed we were.
now when I am an adult I sort of understand it a bit more,
Excuse me as this is a very black and white picture, but this is how I think this goes. If me and my mother stand infront of a yellow wall, but she genuinely believes it's blue, then that's her reality, you simply can not tell her otherwise because she sees what she sees. And for me, that was very hard to live with, obviously 5 year old me didn't understand it at all. She was also depressed, and the combination of those two almost killed her, multiple times.
One day, I came back from school, and there my mother was, sitting on the couch, and she just looked so sad, so I made a joke wich made her laugh and I said '' there, now you're like my mother again, smiling!'' to which she burst in to tears and told me and my sister to go to our rooms, 10 minutes later there was an ambulance infront of our house, she took 2 months worth of pills. 
I don't remember exactly how long she was in the hospital for, but the day she got back, she tried again, this time I found her on the floor and I called 911. that's where I was placed in a foster home and my sisters as well.
With that childhood, I had a rough going as a teenager, I started to hang with the wrong people, started to smoke weed, which I never liked so I quickly stopped.. 
Always was I scared of getting schizophrenia, ( not sure if one just kinda gets it one day ).
But is there a way to kind of see it coming? or any way to avoid it happening? I guess with this post I'd just hope to get some insight on what it's like to live with it? I know this sounds so ignorant but to me I'd seem like hearing voices I can just shut out? don't listen to them? as in if they tell me to do X just be like, ignoring them. but what is it like?
I'm totally new to posting things like this so sorry for the mess that this post is..

schizophrenia,punchherghost,2018/04/09,"Auditory hallucinations...? Today I have been hearing a whole crowd of people talking to each other from outside of my bedroom, in the kitchen, but when I open the door to try and figure out if there's actually people in my house or if I'm hallucinating, they all immediately stop but then start up again once I close my door again. I generally don't get auditory hallucinations except for the occasional whisper, it's mostly paranoid delusions and visual hallucinations for me. I feel like I'm losing it a little. It seriously sounds like a big crowd of people are all in my kitchen talking amongst themselves. :/ Has anyone else dealt with something similar to this?",7.186499999999999,8.588042650000002,8.156666666666666,63.30000000000001,64.16666666666666,10.0,35.83333333333333,10.125756701596842,3.9265833333333333,538,25,86,12,8,182,81,120,0.114,0.833,0.054000000000000006,-0.7425,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,1,4,4,0,0,6,0,5,2,0,0,2,20,11,9,0,2,6,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,5,0,5,7,2,1,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,4,11,2,16,10,5,16,0,1,0,0,6,9,0,4,9,60,16,0,0.0,0.0,0.20580652976233849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474651464683473,0.21609045312971487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17617864874483047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663662680379232,0.15066594242601086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11018577042830953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376979558888247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.243348572423884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2060687246679656,0.21137571869999808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359414943670843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2246000372369433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4386314305121518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16235998167755106,0.0,0.0,0.14927505556538898,0.0,0.0,0.17632060332018076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33902447796029056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999071340569452,0.0,0.0,0.1431862490552782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354606622065775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,pastaferet,2018/04/09,"On /r/AskDocs people said I might have early schizophrenia https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8ashqn/14_m_i_hallucinate_infrequently_what_should_i_do/

Basically, to summarize that post I hallucinate sometimes (Auditory, visual, tactile) and am a teen (14)

Also, I do have intrusive thoughts (am not going to say of what, and they're rare) which can make concentrating or doing complex tasks hard.

I know I have a delusion as well- a grandiose delusion (delusion that I'm an undiscovered genius) however I can control that now and I don't let that influence my decisions too much. I know it's a delusion because it's a thought that is incorrect (all evidence goes against it) yet it cannot be gotten rid of (the delusion still exists in my head, just isn't significant).

Does this look like early schizophrenia to any of you guys?

schizophrenia,xXViralGodXx,2018/04/10,"Closing 3rd Eye Hello,

I would once again like to share the ability you may have to turn off your schizophrenia.  If a number of your problems reside in your mind, imagine, always being on like a television in your head, give the following a try.  

Take a moment to focus on your mind.  Now focus, *will* it shut like an eye, or turn it off.  Be patience and really will it off, do not strain or get upset, just keep practicing.  

In time, if accomplished, it will become second nature to you.  It may come back and may even be more overwhelming.  Collect yourself and focus on turning it back off.  

There should be more exercises like this to try first over immediately resorting to psychiatric medicine.  I learned how to turn my 3rd eye off and the rest of my problems were [Reactive Hypoglycemia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-answers/reactive-hypoglycemia/faq-20057778).  Which means I was having sugar drops, causing me to have some aught number of psychotic episodes.  Unfortunately, I can not just say have some sugar.  

Ask a Dr. to take look at your blood work, ask about residual hypoglycemia, he/she may not be able to tell you much.  Since I personally started moderating my sugar levels I have been much more stable.  

Good luck.",5.607545454545456,8.396398300000005,5.434545454545457,75.69181818181819,70.54545454545455,8.581818181818182,28.72727272727273,9.255337874911486,2.8636090909090903,1006,39,163,23,20,312,132,220,0.047,0.8190000000000001,0.135,0.9401,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,9,0,3,10,12,0,3,9,0,24,10,5,2,0,34,40,9,0,6,9,0,0,4,0,9,2,1,0,1,8,6,3,1,3,1,0,2,3,5,0,2,3,8,19,7,27,23,8,27,0,1,4,0,17,16,0,11,12,117,27,3,0.12869143768685198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10708158541158937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24061824434018664,0.0,0.0,0.19791154386562507,0.0,0.0,0.14212958215236676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322015561924125,0.0,0.11085627844857958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499948087431061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10946487115438487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06723596464816799,0.12345255352009067,0.0,0.10794027220782587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13207454254738166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11438686283046053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514885439927665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10806839589015506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14018270282871134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598833325173184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18920602825287625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13705218110232908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11236839952800734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2462806514160487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824430303147918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023405965446744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10645488711518676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108846196594853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935198905869645,0.0,0.11248198884303348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750410122243309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747460773230837,0.5599173181067498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936888993436537,0.0,0.0,0.09141870499501133,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,nadiaelizabeth,2018/04/10,"relationship and commitment issues for some reason in every relationship I quickly lose interest no matter how into it I was in the beginning. Usually after a month or two I get sick of my significant other and become distant and push them away. Of course I don’t want to hurt his feelings so I push my disinterest aside and pretend like I still want to be in the relationship. I also find myself completely unable to tell my significant others that I love them, out of fear of rejection, despite having no terrible or any history of being rejected by anyone in any way. Does this happen to anyone else? Why? Is it more toxic to myself and my relationships by faking feelings that I don’t have just to make others happy? Sorry if this does not make sense Or seems all over the place, I can try to elaborate if needed.

schizophrenia,seestheunseen,2018/04/10,"Advice Please First off, a bit of background. I'm turning to reddit for advice after my boyfriend made this account to ask for advice about dating someone with mental health issues on another subreddit. That was his first post ever and there were a lot of very helpful and sincere responses, so I asked him if I could try it- and here I am.

OK, so now for the actual post (thanks for bearing with me, I hope it isn't too long or boring).

So I-like a lot of folks on here I'm schizophrenic. My thing is, I started making big life decisions a few years back before I knew what was up with me for totally illogical reasons. For example- I moved across the country one day because I saw a painting that ""told"" me to. Like the exact city. So I left school and packed up and left everything behind within a week of that moment and moved to the new city. At the time I was convinced that the reason other people didn't do things like that is because I was from a very rich family (I'm not), and was literally convinced that I was the smartest human on earth, and was very seriously considering that I might have been some kind of a minor god/angel.

Here's were things start to get bad. So my life, by sheer dumb luck, ended up being awesome for a while, all the while I was getting crazier and crazier. But I managed to pull off what most people considered to be insanely successful things. I got to be a great athlete, had a great GPA and my new college, got a fantastic job way above what anyone my age ever has, everything just happened to work perfectly.

The problem is, I couldn't keep it up. I got more and more paranoid and began to persistently believe I was dying of AIDS or throat cancer or that my blood was rancid. I thought those around me were conspiring to  destroy my life force and basically went off the rails completely. I threw up all the time for no reason and started seeing figures following me and yelling at me to get  my attention. I would cut parts of my body (not my wrist, places like my forehead or legs or hands or other places) because I was convinced that feeling the warm, wet blood would feel good enough to make me feel better.

So now I'm with a psychiatrist and back in touch with reality more or less, but I can't remember who I was. Its like I know my life story but I don't feel like it was actually me, or how I had a few years of such success. Now I wake up every day and everyone has these huge expectations but I have no idea how to meet them. I am  not trying to brag but people routinely comment (professors and such) that I may be an actual genius, and they mean it, but I feel like a totally useless person. I can't even take care of myself in my private life because I have no concept of time, so I can literally forget to eat until I get sick. Everyone expects me to preform great as an athlete but I have no idea how I ever did that or how to go about doing it now, I feel like I have no idea where that expectation came from because it wasn't me who was a  great athlete. And everyone expects me to be an executive in the company I work for in the next few years, but I don't have any idea how I even ended up with my job. I can't remember any of the skills I needed to even get in the door, I'm under qualified and have probably just been lucky no one has noticed yet. The job is literally the product of insanely good luck but now I'm stuck.

I don't know what to do with myself. Sometimes I want to end it because I feel like I'm living under expectations that have nothing to do with me. I feel like I won a lottery ticket years ago when things were good, and because of that everyone in my life expects me to keep winning them and hates me for not being able to anymore. 

Does anyone out there have any words of help? I'm sorry if I sound like a total arrogant prick. I just have no idea what to do. I feel like I woke up in someone else's shadow. 

If you made it this far thank you for reading my keyboard diarrhea. 
 
I guess I  just want help or want to feel like someone, somewhere at least has let me vent to them.",5.14898552875696,5.113170922424246,6.137538651824367,81.04753246753245,68.26060606060607,9.207421150278293,30.41249226963513,8.957266950251167,2.296914162028448,3181,112,656,51,49,1060,329,825,0.112,0.765,0.123,0.9117,3,0,0,0,1,0,77.0,0,2,4,12,43,51,5,0,39,1,71,21,10,12,10,141,138,62,1,19,30,0,14,12,0,4,10,2,1,2,42,34,1,2,28,2,2,8,21,11,0,4,41,19,98,40,100,84,20,92,0,1,2,0,20,38,2,24,55,471,140,15,0.04807080910319121,0.0,0.14073052616140835,0.0,0.0,0.14092271491500374,0.04261187184332777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806939582535984,0.050406434715753824,0.0,0.0,0.047673325618635784,0.06722445485386902,0.0,0.0,0.04279321170520458,0.08987943485850004,0.0,0.0,0.07392696993278138,0.04013711768212702,0.20512463336530498,0.0,0.040904717964428065,0.05415934044215096,0.0,0.04251472421890649,0.05248087331028252,0.053395832125462436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05498019940438505,0.049011393632186935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05040132875927992,0.0,0.0,0.0383806295115612,0.0,0.0,0.0620033901454872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049889910447126734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04206708898966865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04918843860321344,0.04015699269421829,0.0,0.12772940608008904,0.0496699959408534,0.0,0.09525094813817883,0.13044839681878728,0.04050172994643469,0.1837348725094656,0.08640588719656785,0.0,0.045316880630037706,0.0,0.2430604544877701,0.2403925693982513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08177801133238048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12557506853469586,0.0,0.027319748605574068,0.12095854191499987,0.11533985217541713,0.2119929469645295,0.052955415778103865,0.0,0.042508857733666965,0.0,0.0,0.047459971859053415,0.0,0.05109702218431726,0.0,0.0,0.09666255015810564,0.0,0.0,0.04774515996334763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2713304613925432,0.0,0.050173435515437736,0.14310858176217192,0.08545508770235408,0.0,0.05005835034556805,0.05283691904569755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044581494878128,0.04915565920497419,0.2037230045538176,0.2818196301295399,0.0,0.042447405136166995,0.04254115335617953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173616574226411,0.0,0.09097152375395667,0.06417527670466057,0.0,0.0,0.05236320355395981,0.0,0.0,0.048444069201051286,0.05099553189151459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218332503142914,0.0,0.03564389584700583,0.0,0.09285417396006704,0.05112385083268297,0.0,0.0,0.046125237811402924,0.05472893477516068,0.0,0.0,0.06514804866128061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05205600179260611,0.0,0.09997873905845722,0.04197357633136328,0.10044752832532676,0.052767313002256,0.0,0.0,0.09207709424379673,0.0,0.05182846263955822,0.045997272207178086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04808381774683247,0.0,0.0,0.14827439382009294,0.0,0.0,0.10890971173944476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04865022519044407,0.03830621110660812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12219072167238658,0.0,0.04754325937046213,0.05381133517591497,0.10207429830700608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03614326595959245,0.0,0.0,0.08851428501066366,0.0,0.0,0.1596805478233419,0.0,0.0,0.03816285286645117,0.0840914260898321,0.0,0.0,0.0459337181273664,0.0,0.0652738478605688,0.052287236423947135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11899035567758295,0.0850602260423394,0.03815637075412665,0.0385595034760737,0.0,0.0,0.04456212163948615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999224309539286,0.0,0.0,0.06829624713603029,0.0,0.0,0.12382409999627925

Every single job I try to improve in my past mistakes and half of the time I'm not really sure what I did wrong.

Today I got fired through the recruiters, had only been working at the company for two weeks, so again couldn't get a whole lot of feedback on what it was exactly, but the gist seemed to be I don't ""gel"" well with the team.

I am just beyond help at this point, I don't even know what to improve on, people just don't like me even though I try hard every single timw to do everything right.

Any help is appreciated.",7.4962857142857136,5.553880133333338,7.556476190476192,79.05300000000003,64.33333333333334,10.438095238095238,31.42857142857143,8.841846274778883,2.2700571428571426,580,15,121,7,7,188,96,150,0.101,0.755,0.14400000000000002,0.8956,2,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,3,13,6,0,0,7,0,14,1,0,0,2,17,19,8,0,3,8,0,4,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,6,2,1,3,6,4,12,4,20,11,4,18,0,0,0,0,7,9,0,3,11,84,20,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2460979511286914,0.0,0.0,0.10056426307424536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15450434223620044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19534822920081896,0.0,0.3737887780295519,0.0,0.13290605542232115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07726180499884737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11827407663210875,0.0,0.0,0.14642560292139026,0.0,0.0,0.13247247677267884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19824325502805765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29349847510310995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08127162070631584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044528400109098,0.14449453463699655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572327796873642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11247028955389267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14116930483262696,0.10252217964522296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397955000818009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947364608365006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12628970666622996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13462545833755735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11384614542536654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13937624765165538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14529249350867052,0.0,0.17246139275999367,0.0,0.14017405286860776,0.0,0.0,0.20080320734741575,0.0,0.2889168199254217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23724270057616165,0.0,0.13296292690173267,0.0,0.0,0.16510403927465792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765924917600243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16168483885267654,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,FlyingHippoOfFate,2018/04/11,"I'm really at a loss of what to do Hey everyone. Long-time lurker, first-time poster. 
I was diagnosed schiz at the age of 19, though I had been experiencing psychosis since the age of 15. I'm 25, almost 26 now. Things have just been getting worse with time. I'm finding it harder to function in normalized society. Every time I have a good job, my schiz seems to come up and ruin things for me. I'm finding it harder to associate with people because of delusional thinking, even if I've been close to them for years. My paranoid thinking makes me never feel safe, and I don't quite know what to do. 


There's a lot more I wanted to say, but at this point I feel like I'm rambling.

schizophrenia,paleyellowgoddess,2018/04/11,"Lithium for schizophrenia? I’ve been on many psych meds (for BPD, schizophrenia spectrum, HPD, social phobia, GAD, PTSD, and some affective mood disorder). 
Abilify, seroquel, invega, risperdal, latuda, zyprexa, vraylar, geodon, haldol (as needed), zoloft, Lexapro, ativan, klonopin, trazodone, atarax/vistaril, topamax, trileptal, lamictal, remeron, minipress, and now Lithium. 
Out of all of those, only abilify, invega, and Zoloft helped without any side effects (other than weight gain and abilify gave me a movement disorder that’s now gone away). The rest either did not help, had horrible side effects, or made me manic. 
I’ve now been on Lithium about two weeks, psych said she only prescribed it to try and get the mania and suicidal tendencies to decrease as she doesn’t want me back on an antipsychotic (we’ve tried almost all available). 
Anyone else w Schizophrenia been on lithium? Did it help at all or make things worse?",9.758039215686274,10.781971601307195,7.8530718954248355,69.03882352941179,58.47712418300654,10.460130718954249,41.83660130718954,10.25414643259724,4.757922875816993,737,38,103,14,9,218,110,153,0.111,0.8420000000000001,0.047,-0.8861,0,0,0,0,0,0,49.0,0,0,0,3,5,1,0,0,4,0,7,3,0,5,3,24,15,10,1,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,6,7,1,0,2,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,10,2,5,0,18,5,6,16,0,0,0,0,8,9,0,4,5,60,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16929175987110026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11496835658398134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182124917527758,0.17322459930511805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588398657153484,0.12999869381586596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129284100486828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3875207432655476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14123009782676865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08832822392256337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33995726520078096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599711076107465,0.1128505896354646,0.17140292782678634,0.0,0.0,0.18779042175901106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12535776609896807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25715943137750874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976251170975015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1608172352090285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17233801692413578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1849270302433028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11231767060768737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295647980682832,0.0,0.16514958177425626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971749409126994,0.0,0.1356118096179444,0.2058726852772132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16297030088506326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17228921960512034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,VirtualCarob,2018/04/11,"I am schizo? Hi everyone,

My psy gave me some risperidone today, which is an antipsychotic. I've made a few research, and discovered that it was prescribed to cure schizophrenia and bipolarity. 

Does it mean that am either schizo or bipolar ? 

PS : I used to take escitalopram and prazepam, but the doctor changed my prescription because I didn't work for me. 

Thanks !

schizophrenia,throwmeaway111111223,2018/04/11,"May possibly have schizophrenia and feel motivated to finally get help. Should my first appointment be with a psychologist, counselor, therapist, or psychiatrist? Hi Reddit! I think I’m finally ready to get help. I’ve seen a decline in my mental health and capabilities over the past few years, and just had my worst episode yet. After being relatively bedridden for the past 8 months, I’m tired of living in my own filth, feeling paranoid and sick all the time. I want to be better.

I may not have schizophrenia, but I have many of the symptoms (cognitive, depressive, social, weird thoughts) and it or BPD runs in my family. So with that in mind, I was wondering where I should make my first appointment with for a diagnosis and to start my treatment on the right track? (I went once two years ago for mental health but the appointment felt like a dead end, so I further receded into myself and got worse. I want to do it right this time)

Note: I am a university student so will be going to university services. They have available psychologist/therapist/counselor services or psychiatric services for appointments.

Thanks in advance for your time and help.",6.108605072463767,8.21535805797102,6.158040458937203,73.95561141304348,67.45410628019323,9.812681159420292,33.22735507246377,10.125756701596842,3.714671739130435,926,42,155,24,16,293,121,207,0.11,0.777,0.114,-0.6654,0,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,1,5,6,6,0,0,11,0,17,5,0,2,1,35,36,16,1,4,7,0,3,1,0,5,5,0,0,0,4,12,0,0,7,0,0,4,1,3,0,3,7,4,20,3,25,20,4,33,0,1,1,0,7,12,0,6,18,104,24,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11049067197416952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102387725424227,0.0,0.0,0.1569865825950471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735694463075156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11039887319461833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750463840208207,0.0,0.126048970791251,0.0,0.1196791803439634,0.27308599873542044,0.0,0.21204671454114474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13024420759186606,0.0,0.07083888247607956,0.0,0.09969035404905738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2649845722704753,0.0,0.0,0.2506416559444876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06089547146041897,0.0,0.1100642171810455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320180668543542,0.12637092382439996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25122659614050474,0.0,0.12585637347204273,0.0,0.09949081010632993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13274333773462227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23797637454230314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14051901811025758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21289306885850928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270603407123634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822469203496472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12955434987708184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475678498822806,0.0,0.28944595220420605,0.0,0.07986777228300089,0.0,0.09895456536546864,0.21804529521944965,0.14326161027725506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12176049430798888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14703823335506194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11554758220067407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13517267500506114,0.0,0.0,0.1270243637173242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605351680570201

schizophrenia,Schizthorway23,2018/04/11,"So i guess I'm heading out to get a job due to sibling pressure. Tires of my siblings telling my parents what a worthless piece of useless garbage I am. I feel like I can't work due to the fact that when I'm out in public too long, I think people are out to harm me in some way, or kill me. Or I just get dissociated from reality.

However, im really tired or being told what a worthless piece of trash i am or a 'leecher' by my siblings or them telling my parents, so... Off I go.

Any advice on what to tell potential employers since im 27 and haven't worked since I was 21?

schizophrenia,Mentallyillginger,2018/04/12,"Is it possible to function off antipsychotics for any of us? My psychotic episode that led to hospitalization was mainly typified by delusions. Which were manifested by interaction with my new age occult belief systems. Aside from that my affect hadn't changed, something that was noted by the psychiatrist I saw in the hospital. I was still articulate.

 
I developed schizophrenia about 4 months prior to my 19th birthday. I'm currently on the lowest dose of latuda for treatment of schizophrenia which is 40mg. 

I have some delusional thinking and hypervigilance but I can think about my own thoughts and recognize my delusions for what they are, delusions. I can talk myself down from them.  

I don't know if my case of schizophrenia could properly be referred to as ""acute"" or ""mild"" but that's how I view it. I'm just wondering if it would be at all possible for someone with schizophrenia to be relatively normal and function without being on an antipsychotic.

schizophrenia,TRIPITIS,2018/04/12,"Advice re: family member with Schizophrenia Looking for advice -

Situation: My family member was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his late teens, he was committed and medicated, moved to a group home over a period of about 10 years. He left the group home and traveled across the country. We have been sending him money via his cellphone and a western union like service. Has been homeless for most of the last 3 years. 

A month ago he got caught up with the police, and then sent to a state mental hospital. He's been treated with anti-psychotics before, they cause him to sleep 12-14 hours a day and he voices displeasure at being on them previously. He's back on them, much more lucid than usual, but sounds exhausted and wants out of the hospital and off of the anti-psychotics. 

I've tried once living with him before while not being medicated, and he was generally demanding, unreasonable, and occasionally violent. I don't blame him for his behavior, I understand that his daily experience is very stressful, but I can't live with him and can't afford to get him his own place (nor do I think he would be able to keep it in a state that would permit on-going rental). So non-medicated stable housing seems off of the table.

From my perspective it appears to me that he should have a choice in whether or not he is medicated - the pros of medication are that he is around people,more lucidity, has a stable environment and home, and is generally safer. 

The cons of medication are severely limited freedom, extreme drowsiness and from his perspective, a less vibrant life. 

As a family member it feels wrong to leave him in a mental hospital when he's telling me that it's not what he wants. 

Can anyone who's been in my family member's situation give advice on how to proceed, and what you feel the best path forward is?
Can anyone give advice who's been in my situation before?

I understand the black and white advice is that medicating this illness is always the right thing to do, I would like to hear from people who have dealt with this before and can give a more nuanced perspective.

schizophrenia,MegalowGigalo,2018/04/12,"My judgement may be askewed on occassion... Hi,

I was talking about how I was a simple man, with simple desires in life.  Someone said, ""Like hacking people up with a sword.""  I cracked up, it was wonderful.  I had been going about how I had simple desires in life, just wanted to be a soldier, live the grunt or policeman life.  Slowly let go of my humanity.  Sharpen my knives, fantasize about the quickening of the kill.  

I had said, ""At least it's not the iron age.  Then I would be hacking people up with a giant razor blade.""  Then went on to monologue all the things I don't take for granted about the modern age, electricity, computers, broadband, technology, food, toiletries.  Not that the iron age was an inconvenience, but now, with this baby smooth skin and all.  

I just don't know anymore.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe my entire philosophy is all fucked up.",4.2703461538461545,6.1966111500000025,4.992500000000003,81.19019230769233,71.875,7.673076923076922,29.18269230769231,8.384062270229773,2.2084711538461543,664,27,122,11,13,214,98,160,0.104,0.87,0.026,-0.9204,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,0,0,9,4,2,0,12,0,17,6,1,2,3,23,28,7,1,4,6,0,2,1,0,2,3,2,0,2,5,5,1,0,2,0,0,3,4,3,0,0,11,4,13,1,22,11,4,20,0,0,0,1,6,10,1,3,8,85,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18510209665113495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256923743577016,0.0,0.0,0.17255067682309727,0.0,0.0,0.21214977899074414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20649549574815548,0.0,0.10257543782640743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19085758048212614,0.3954995250450859,0.0911855210041424,0.0,0.16481131924711542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3750208085635456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2587928571531266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35508505840642207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581440528106184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14033412232363587,0.15001851302655364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12399891894660828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100883004471425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17302216784027746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024089887188356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258754632948802,0.20406745910896512,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,Slamdutch,2018/04/12,Thoughts aren’t mine (not voices) Recently I’ve been having these random thoughts. They are in my head like normal thoughts and I can tell they are separate from the auditory hallucinations I regularly experience. The thing is though these thoughts aren’t coming from my head. I know nobody put them there but that’s what it feels like. I was telling my therapist and the only way I could explain it is like when you’re listening to the radio in the car and get far away from the tower that plays what you’re listening to and another radio station starts to fade in so you hear two songs at once. Basically I’m hearing thoughts that come from other people and I know aren’t mine. Does any of this make any sense?,3.08944099378882,5.6543594347826085,3.7310973084886143,85.86913043478263,77.84057971014492,7.131262939958592,24.349896480331264,8.192908349453996,1.5413026915113877,574,20,112,11,14,181,85,138,0.0,0.918,0.08199999999999999,0.8674,4,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,3,0,4,4,0,0,6,0,12,2,2,1,0,22,31,9,0,2,2,0,1,3,0,0,0,6,0,0,12,7,0,0,9,4,0,4,4,0,0,1,7,7,15,4,13,23,0,15,0,0,0,0,11,6,0,1,7,70,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884511273820369,0.14529226018291316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130181698063167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387143731937873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106288996717103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12125480552415405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13553828522365288,0.0,0.0,0.0700601083825059,0.09898730457163447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07239189057078038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2844051061454191,0.0,0.312334421127412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15229792451184276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20308027762890105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924898879762453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13575939859939806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14756189710021386,0.0,0.10538113747110683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960600701739442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392910886615283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136811301806964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09807349393148487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24221512608967946,0.0,0.0,0.16087886045406594,0.0920531191357922,0.0,0.1361345142142668,0.5500058850880915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13535300406462816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10998249288025168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,rot_goblin,2018/04/12,"Psychosis and Marijuana Would smoking marijuana very occasionally (like once a month) affect my psychosis?

I used to smoke extremely regularly, a few bowls a day for example but eventually I stopped because the excessive use was harming my psychosis. 

I’m much better now than I was back then in my state of mind and I am medicated on risperidone. I would like to have a joint or two very occasionally  (not packed much at all due to my low tolerance) like once or twice a month. Will this cause me much harm?

schizophrenia,pissoffhets,2018/04/12,"Fish Tank My existence and your existence can be summed up with a fish tank. There's a small child pounding on the glass,and the fish dart away and clash with the invisble barrier which contains their world. I know the feeling in my own world. Tormented by something incomprehensible and so much larger than myself. I fear the day my question is answered: Am I on the outside or the inside of the tank? 
I know how it feels to fish to escape beyond the dimensions of my own personal hell I've conjured from the brain chemicals in my head. 
I want to be left alone, but I'm afraid to be left alone, but you're afraid to not be left alone. I'm afraid of about everything at this point and I have no indication as to why. As we drove home from group therapy today, I started crying and you didn't hear it and I made sure of such becquse I didn't want you to think I was crying over a Baja Blast. I thought of how my anger writhed through my veins out my vocal cords and could drive the car into an accident, murdering us all gruesomely at the hands of my own lack of self-control. I am the kid asked of in movies to save the world from the end of it all, but what if I don't want to? What if I were to not save the world?

schizophrenia,Dial_H_For_Hornets,2018/04/12,"Think my friend has schizophrenia, not sure how to help He is under the impression that the entirety of every government is lizard people that worship satan and have a massive pedophilia ring, and tries to convince me of it every chance he gets. I also just became aware that he recently had a period in his life where he would do acid daily for weeks at a time, and I know that definitely messes up your brain chemistry. I tried to argue against all his theories but even after disproving every argument he made (which I now think was the wrong strategy) he still wasn't convinced and would make up whole new things to explain how it was still possible and in his mind that posibility he invented equates to truth. I'm genuinely worried that if he doesn't get help he might act on his beliefs and shoot up a public place, I know he has access to guns. I need someone who knows the disorder to guide me in approaching him about it in a way that could coerce him to seek help",13.778156028368798,7.6500475957446845,12.25872340425532,62.981666666666676,57.085106382978715,16.150354609929078,46.226950354609926,12.745084868956482,5.505901418439715,780,28,146,17,6,249,121,188,0.114,0.777,0.109,-0.6147,0,0,0,2,0,0,10.0,0,1,0,0,10,10,1,0,9,0,15,2,1,4,3,30,27,11,0,5,4,0,0,0,1,3,1,1,0,0,13,6,0,0,7,0,0,2,3,3,0,0,5,2,16,7,24,18,2,24,3,0,0,0,25,12,0,2,9,97,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12112816061733575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1690873425364312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12093412987008358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17359438394033536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000425707705956,0.0,0.3828526158876399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170230820318054,0.0,0.15827058430133414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3045755513434857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497270202882961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698567047913976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14332180331782268,0.10110544493690714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16068262441356596,0.15293856161255598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11231091267377692,0.0,0.1462878394071618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10500819438879187,0.0,0.15825084932445965,0.0,0.0,0.17075636232093866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495554578371122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12833755631163218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419235944452212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275592030165518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10062799049388817,0.19410796410520575,0.0,0.0,0.08832166619053651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056723950270874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12022750942010045,0.12149774666141876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691075737028172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15382216128817922,0.0,0.21519572049489413,0.16560546261028947,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,hotmustardisbae,2018/04/12,"Boyfriend sort of cheated on me during an episode where he thought the U.S. government was trying to kill him. What should I do? I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years. About 3 years into the relationship, he was diagnosed with paranoia schizophrenia. He takes his medication everyday and goes to the psychologist every week.

Last month he had an “episode” (I think that’s what you call it). For about a couple weeks he was *obsessed* with the idea that the U.S. government was planning on nuking the entire country, and that we had to pack all our things and move to Indonesia (I don’t know why he chose Indonesia). I tried comforting him but we ended up having a *HUGE* argument. I didn’t want to leave my family, friends, and schooling to live in a country I know so little about. He got frustrated with me, saying that I didn’t care for his safety and that I was selfish for choosing to stay. I began to notice that his phone was buzzing a lot throughout the night. When I asked him who was texting him so late, he would avoid the question and pretend he was sleeping. On one particular night I got fed up with the buzzing, and unlocked his phone. To my dismay, I found hundreds of exchanged messages from three different Asian women. When I read the conversations, it was mostly my boyfriend asking them about their country and asking them if he could live with them. He also complimented and flirted with them a lot. There was dozens of exchanged photos, some of which were naked pictures of the girl (He didn’t ask for them).

When I confronted him, he broke down and cried. I never saw him cry like that. It was as if his life was in danger and he was about to die. He tried to explain to me that he didn’t really want to be with them, and that he loved me more than anything. He said that he just wanted to use them to find a way to escape from the U.S. and to be safe with me. I don’t believe that he was lying, but I still can’t believe he went behind my back. I love my boyfriend and I know he loves me, even more than his own life. But his episodes are becoming more frequent, each one being more severe and scary.

What should I do when he has another episode like that? Should I consider leaving him?

**Tl;dr** Boyfriend had an episode and become fearful of his life. Tried to flirt with girls from different countries to persuade them to let him live with them to escape U.S. Not sure where our relationship stands.

schizophrenia,infernosmalls,2018/04/12,"Diagnosed schizoaffective at 16, turn 18 in two months. Im stressed as hell. Let me start off by saying I'm not bad. My brother was super far gone full schizophrenic who was always zombied out on meds and eventually killed himself. We share a mother who has never been diagnosed with anything (that I know of) but, to say the least, is definitely troubled.

I don't know, I really only struggle with delusions and intrusive thoughts and depression. The depression died down considerably when I stopped drinking and doing drugs. I always assumed the thoughts were a result of smoking weed which gave me intense panic and confusion and ""internal voices"" and I've stayed away from weed for about two years because of this. I feel like I genuinely am getting better too. I stopped taking medication sometime this summer. I was started on Abilify when I was first diagnosed in the treatment center then moved into Latuda which made me extremely energetic and happy (I'm apprehensive to say manic because I don't know if I really was or not). I still get  ""persecutory delusions"" but I feel like I'm generally on top of that. 

I'm just worried I've plateaued. Don't get me wrong, I'm very functional. But I'm in a new school right now and I haven't made a single friend, I never go out and I'm so angry and hateful some days. I know how important being able to be social is, I've lost two jobs now because I'm generally withdrawn from the group and poor at customer service. I can't go a day without thinking ""there's something going on"". There are so many little things that stress me out. 

I want to go to a shrink so bad, and I know my dad is willing and able to get me in with one. But I'll have to wait until after I graduate which is two months because I'm out of home state until I graduate.(*edit: also I've been expensive as fuck this past year with the institutionalization and the meds I was taking were really expensive out of pocket. I just feel like shit having him spend more money on me when I know he's retiring soon and needs to be frugal)

 On top of that I find going into specifics of the things that are happening is so god damn difficult with a new shrink, actually with my old ones too. I don't even know how to explain most of the things that happen. It comes out as near gibberish. Nothing makes sense. I feel like an idiot but its so confusing I barely know what's going on.

Ok sorry this is a long rant but whatever",4.1759715504978665,5.8471587894736885,5.365388335704125,79.4610156472262,71.63157894736842,8.419345661450924,28.41678520625889,8.994212911058018,2.3818443812233285,1935,74,363,39,37,642,239,475,0.189,0.6990000000000001,0.113,-0.9932,2,0,3,0,0,0,49.0,1,0,0,6,23,32,7,7,18,1,34,9,1,6,2,83,88,41,2,3,13,3,4,4,1,1,6,4,1,0,21,32,1,3,19,1,5,9,11,22,0,7,17,8,42,10,61,66,6,73,1,3,0,1,18,32,4,7,34,240,63,4,0.14342458087742324,0.0,0.06998085084592186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05734829275490076,0.11934074079363788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05901310474791788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737605749141691,0.0,0.11975353418390293,0.17486058656809325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342369325557183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06177378837280197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09249698944640294,0.0,0.12353138134762755,0.2183593957903124,0.0744260355648592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025074347583217,0.08316348976351158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04736529150005009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14503955503619834,0.20492509847283494,0.0,0.0,0.06554373428330072,0.060998437612927565,0.0,0.0,0.055404737702920766,0.06629685695413574,0.14986684775436254,0.0,0.244534483600209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268298832029531,0.07633906665663079,0.0,0.07080104016688119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07193327437279265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774615795646319,0.0,0.07116338287248071,0.0,0.07933902431066149,0.0,0.31528959509360266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07333067562990997,0.0,0.14014001112259344,0.07187455451426111,0.0,0.06346312038408344,0.0,0.0,0.07828243627905596,0.0,0.0,0.13571180628750454,0.047868510722901325,0.07270500681579736,0.0,0.0,0.15931237659753272,0.07224258810140746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11448013210604167,0.07621881573614556,0.0,0.05317375469717193,0.11061787861761524,0.13852035394654788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880987676711235,0.0,0.07524998550973731,0.0,0.0971882078598699,0.05454042835820936,0.0,0.08413892155368884,0.0,0.0,0.06845749563855041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13782218865954635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06124190420536173,0.0,0.17108547503232632,0.0,0.07257666646044121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07361163560203307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07310164916058197,0.0,0.055207624725240906,0.07092528892240428,0.08027603797444498,0.10151665654730667,0.07643575998381125,0.057269527778897066,0.1199093717411342,0.1642923728140124,0.07496925637410555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10783743541049848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14292737779809772,0.04595034009775074,0.0,0.11386309653552655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800237929472996,0.2802099502210938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05917014993055286,0.04229776690212995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912808892386597,0.0,0.0,0.07282731193792727,0.0,0.0,0.07840613201077888,0.0,0.0923607277254645
schizophrenia,Sylloby,2018/04/13,"Paranoid Let’s start off with some background so everything makes sense:
I’m a minor and I only live with one of my parents who is only at home for a couple hours a day. I also stay home all day due to illness(es) most of the time so I’m not at school during the day. I’ve been struggling with schizophrenia since I was really little, in therapy for it.

Most everyday recently I’ll be hanging out and then suddenly I’ll assume some sort of disaster has happened outside or invasion of sorts (just at complete random) and I’ll become super paranoid, grab some sort of makeshift weapon from the kitchen and stand at the window looking through the shut blinds or at door for super long staring out the peep hole like a crazy lady...
It’s driving me mad my neighbors probably think I’m some sorta weirdo now, it’s extremely mentally exhausting!

I’ll check the news or something (I don’t wanna ask anybody because what if they’re dead or maybe nothing’s happened and they’ll think I’m weird) and obviously nothing’s been reported yet so I settle down for a bit but I’m still extremely alarmed and alert until someone comes home or texts me but usually that takes hours and hours...

Or if I’m in the bathroom or my bedroom (etc.) and the door is shut I’ll assume someone or something is in the house trying to get me which is.. alarming to say the least.

My next therapy appointment isn’t for awhile if I remember correctly (due to a busy schedule on her part) but even so she doesn’t really offer me any help, just kinda nods and says bye when the time is up, I’m sorta at a loss, none of the other therapists are any better though and I’m not looking to change anytime soon... I’m not on any meds since I just recently started therapy.

Anyone going through the same thing got any advice on how to deal with it? I can’t invite anyone over during the day due to schedules and me being sick all the time and my other parent lives a couple cities away and works too often to come over so I’m not really sure what to do...

schizophrenia,schizophrenicbread,2018/04/13,"Bipolar-schizo trouble at work Hello friends. Bipolar-schizo here. Lately things have been ok, but I'm here at work, and about 2 hours ago I ended up convincing myself I'm going to die today. Normally I'm not concerned with death, but I am extremely fearful of it today. I'm scared to eat my lunch because I think I'm going to choke on it. I'm dreading getting off work because I have to take the highway home and Florida drivers are terrible. 
I don't know if this is a mental episode or if this is something normal people go through. I have been having more frequent episodes lately though. Last night I became overwhelmed with anxiety at work, and on the drive home becoming convinced that I passed through a wormhole and was a millionaire in my new reality. Because there was more traffic than usual on a Thursday night. I've been on my meds but things seem to be worsening. I also felt like I was doing constant front flips last night and couldn't stop it. Anyone out there suffer from this? How do you get through it?

schizophrenia,InfantBackRibs,2018/04/13,"How to stop mumbling/vocalizing? Hey, I’ve had schizophrenia ramping up on me like crazy as of late (extreme paranoia, derealization and insane incoherent involuntary/non-self award mumblings, inability to cry) and need some tips to overcome this. It’s making daily life in highschool hell. I hate my existence and feel hopeless now. I don’t know what to do, my aunt I live with refuses to spend any money on me for a therapist and my public school counselors have had me on a waiting list for 2 months. I don’t know any other schizophrenics and any advice or support would be great, thanks",5.864518348623854,7.596912825688072,6.070538990825689,75.80745986238534,67.53211009174312,8.385779816513761,32.89105504587156,8.841846274778883,2.892090825688073,474,21,81,8,8,151,82,109,0.193,0.6779999999999999,0.13,-0.765,1,0,0,0,0,1,15.0,0,0,0,1,2,8,2,0,2,0,8,2,0,2,0,18,17,8,0,2,1,1,1,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,4,6,0,3,3,0,2,0,2,3,0,0,2,1,10,5,15,13,1,9,1,1,0,0,4,5,1,2,5,48,14,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21223450561108634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4430877538328745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23857183767482865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.109817247183177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394515585325837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21442910044482524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387227083676352,0.0,0.2449985695052893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534069620329221,0.10610753899418747,0.0,0.19178180144304205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14497529513339852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17335812926224567,0.0,0.0,0.1610428372254611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2198067890770377,0.0,0.0,0.22657541778906934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1815796678745898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24646342031847554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19995838353760928,0.0,0.25217308384072584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15428478213839097,0.0,0.0,0.0

So I end up having to apologize (in my head not out loud) about my thoughts. I’m not sure if my hallucinations are real or not, they usually only show up for a second. I’m loosing grip on my memory, not sure if my memories are real or if I dreamed them.

schizophrenia,radsaucebadsauce,2018/04/13,"Sleep Meds? Hey all,


I've been taking 50 mg of trazadone for sleep for about a year, along with geodon and wellbutrin for the other crap. I'm relatively stable (except for the season change wonky), but have night terrors whenever I take trazadone. I'm talking sleep paralysis with aliens, awful. If I can fall asleep on my own, it's not bad. If I take a low dose of seroquel to sleep, it's not bad. I'd rather not take seroquel, as I'm finally starting to lose weight and would like to continue.


OTC stuff doesn't touch my insomnia, and I swear I've tried it all.

schizophrenia,Reason2StayHere,2018/04/13,"Looking for advice about imagining monsters I work as a janitor during the evening.  When it gets dark out, I become scared because there might be monsters in the building coming to get me.  So far, I've been able to just talk myself down and convince myself that monsters don't exist, the building is locked and safe, the company wouldn't have me clean a dangerous building, etc.  However, it's really nerve wracking.

Do any of you have ideas of things I could try or what not so that I'm not scared all the time?",6.183333333333334,6.578748292929294,6.101565656565657,80.70568181818183,66.07070707070707,9.024242424242424,32.66161616161617,8.841846274778883,2.642385858585859,407,16,76,6,6,128,73,99,0.113,0.838,0.049,-0.7398,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,1,7,5,1,2,7,0,10,0,0,0,1,15,15,7,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,6,4,0,1,2,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,1,1,8,2,10,10,2,7,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,2,2,54,14,1,0.23502941129874294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22966802059294625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15982805918507406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14327174766358708,0.2595715194564178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202457026907557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18765186040479093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2621199208171907,0.15523470954765012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24558633384474965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2653195974780141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973655118211303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2493290639980779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15056585915000292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4706108838446947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18890773804606067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15614309744700924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13704753978475576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15956954253610384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17110421061226355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,so_confused19,2018/04/14,"Is my mother a paranoid schizophrenic? Hello,

I'm 20 years old, my mother is in her early fifties and we live in America. 

*My father passed away two yrs ago and honestly I don't think we've grieved/accepted it at all. Also, there have been many more traumatic events in our lives over the past 13 yrs.*

Since late last year, my mother has convinced herself that people are watching her, specifically the neighbors. It began when we would talk on the phone, she mentioned that she could hear someone else breathing/talking on the phone as well. Then the mailman was telling someone about her whereabouts (he wears a Bluetooth). 

We have some new neighbors who moved in next door a few weeks ago. Yesterday, she complained about her stomach hurting *this happens quite often*, later on, that day I caught her trying to go outside to confront ""them"". She started saying ""I want you to tell me what yall did to me."", I immediately got up and stopped her. I asked her what she was talking about and she told me to mind my business. She told me that the woman and two other neighbors used a machine on her that caused her stomach to become upset. She went on and on, talking to herself *which she does all the time* about the neighbors and what she's going to do to them. 

At this point, I'm completely fed up and don't know what to do. I asked my cousin, whose brother had schizophrenic, what I should do and he really didn't give me any advice. I don't have anyone to help me with this because I'm an only child. If I get the whole family involved, I truly believe she's going to attack me. 

Also, she had me reach out to an old coworker of hers who is a former cop. They talked back in February,  but after that, she's been blowing him up since the beginning of April and he has ignored her. She also gave me a list of people to contact ""when she dies"". 

Someone, please give me some assistance.

schizophrenia,GetHautnah,2018/04/14,"The end of the world - thoughts and obsessions Lately, I've been worrying a lot. With the current political climate, I'm not sure what to think. 

I have always had schizophrenia, diagnosed at 15, was very sick many years, been very well for about 3 years (only the occasional episode, no more than some hours or a day). I have a few daily symptoms left, but nothing special (such as problems with perception, sometimes idk know close things are, can't 'feel' where my body is etc). 

Haven't, as far as I know (hehe), had any strong delusions for a long time. I have a partner, and I have had reoccurring thoughts and visuals of infidelity and lying, but given my minds history, its been nothing, really. I trust them completely, and I do not believe my illness at all when it gives me these thoughts. Been quite proud of myself for not getting carried away, since I spend years floating on a bad psychosis.

But here comes the kicker. I have had the amazing opportunity to have a little savings account, and I still live an okay life without breaking into it. Its not much, but its gives a feeling of security (in case my current living situation fails, I won't be homeless). 
Lately, I've been having problems with spending the money. I am actually terrified that the world is gonna 'end' soon and that I wasted the money on nothing. I'd rather spend it on nice things and experiences than it just goes to waste. This is from the political stress in the world. The whole thing with Trump and Russia scares the living hell out of me. Im not that educated in politics, so I don't really know, but I feel like this is **not** nothing. I'm really not sure if I'm overreacting. Besides from the money, I am very anxious in general, too. The whole situation leave me in constant fear.
Is it my disease that makes me overreact and obsess or is this is a fair concern? 

I don't want to freak anyone out, but it's getting bad and Idk if i should seek psych help or actually just find more time for my loved ones, since it's actually quite dangerous.

More exact concerns: getting killed by an atomic bomb, going to war, getting killed in terrorist attack, etc.

Anything, guys. Maybe I just needed the air it somewhere where I think people may understand.

About 3 months into our relationship, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite the strain it obviously puts on her, we still love eachother and I try to be there for her when it gets bad. Recently, however, it feels like the voices in her head are trying to get her to push me away. They tell her I am the devil, sometimes she hears my voice saying horrible and mean things to her, and sometimes she hears the voices of girls I am supposedly cheating on her with. I know she loves and trusts me, and knows theyre just voices, but it still seems like lately its been getting worse. I love her and just want to make her happy, but it feels like a rift is forming.

schizophrenia,IlikeLasagna666,2018/04/14,"Delusions are inspirational I feel some delusions are great inspiration for art and writing. What's a delusion you've had that could be a great art or writing piece? I'll tell you one of mine.

 Recently I went up to my mom's cabin for a week, and everything was going great. But I started getting hungry. Not just for food  but for everything I could put in my body. Cigarettes, coffee, alcohol, even weed (which I should probably avoid). I ended up eating a piece of toast with weed butter on it and I thought everything would be fine. I was chopping wood alone deep in the wilderness, when I started hearing snapping branches nearby. I thought nothing of it. The feeling of being watched is pretty much constant for me so I didn't notice anything unusual, but my mind began racing. Why have I been so hungry? I'm deep in native land, a reservation nearby. I began thinking that I was being stalked by a Wendigo. I was pretty calm throughout the whole thing, I'm used to my brain coming up with fantastical nonsense, but then the hallucinations began. I could see eyes that changed so quickly that they appeared to be thousands of colors at once. Even when I closed my eyes I could see them. I was sitting next to a fire at this point and in the roaring flames I could hear native singing, loud and almost savage in nature. That night I had sleep paralysis of something wrapping its huge hands around me. I went home the next day and for about a week afterwards I was terrified of becoming a cannibal. I looked up wendigo psychosis online and apparently fear of becoming cannibalistic is one of the symptoms. But it has been scientifically debunked to be a threat, as starvation in North America is pretty scarce. I'm over this delusion but I'm sure I'll have another one equally if not more terrifying and mystical in the future.

schizophrenia,dermotjamesbuckley,2018/04/15,"4 years ago Is it weird to think that a bunch of famous people are the ones controlling your mind? I have this every day and I talk aloud and in my head to these people. I just want them to leave me alone but it’s been 4 years and I just want it to end. I take medication every morning and evening. Does the bullying ever stop and will I ever stop hearing these things? 

I’ve been to an acute psychiatric unit five times now and all they do is bump up the medication and introduce another. I’m on abilify 30mg every evening and 5mg haloperidol too and I take Prozac in the morning for the depression. They even prescribed 2mg anti cholinergic akineton for the shaky hands that I have because of the haloperidol. 

I see disgusting imagery and regularly get persuasive voices. It’s like the worst way to live. How and when will it ever stop?",2.710993975903616,5.008497132530124,3.7393825301204835,86.73208584337351,77.67469879518072,7.282530120481929,24.832831325301214,8.278499904357787,1.6303024096385546,668,24,133,13,16,215,101,166,0.22,0.747,0.033,-0.9872,0,1,0,0,0,1,11.0,0,1,3,1,12,6,1,1,10,0,10,5,2,2,4,28,19,14,0,2,3,0,1,1,0,2,3,2,0,0,11,11,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,5,0,2,2,4,15,1,14,15,3,19,0,1,1,0,6,4,0,1,15,89,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12307292485614928,0.0,0.0,0.14379594974618956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455854221764197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08463532913058795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557204128160769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954005358247266,0.0,0.1195823406922092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12149946618580912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297067238455395,0.0,0.0,0.2751067314242529,0.376765090215055,0.3509350434946064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253795857830342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424894808408373,0.0,0.15648231537872906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470110854331548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06783001360404442,0.0,0.12259790703092542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2797325728437783,0.0,0.0,0.14018841335867074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09408130352609716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19250778882459485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11063718248241114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482283575390243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2087801949586148,0.1115940082086868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922388583890764,0.08896280709480854,0.0,0.0,0.08095848501447496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1637823819998041,0.11020440894668912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17881629572919824
schizophrenia,hello-u,2018/04/15,"descent some foreign spirit guide has possessed me to be communicative today and i'm home alone. i'm also suffering from these uncontrollable thoughts that terrorize my mind. i am undoubtedly a troubled person and feel no safety anywhere on the internet and i have no particular individual to vent to. i am alone in all definitions of the word aside from the ghosts that rot my brain. i want to scream into the internet void and get laughed at by my peers for being an ""edgelord"". i don't have any particular need for approval but god do i just want to scream and be heard by someone out there that can put a face and name to my words. nothing i have to say in this post has moral justice or carries any real weight. maybe its a love letter for the denouncement of my position as a human but what a lie that would be to completely regard myself nonhuman as if i have some superior advantage that other humans don't possess themselves.. in that is the greatest delusion, the delusion of individuality.

times like this suicide is a temptation. no reason to exist if my existence is arbitrary. all online and offline communities have cast me out, ignored my presence, made me feel less than the idealized human worth. i have no worth. no self actualization to dreams and ideas that once formed in my head long ago. all of this stuff has subsided. i'm fucked.. i'm nothing. i'm a symptom to the disease, a corrupt immoral person who is undeserving of love or the notice of my peers. i'm perfectly fine as a ghost. there is something wrong about me that keeps people from communicating with me, to purposely targeting and eliminating me from social groups. i'm so upset that every face i encounter is this grimacing nightmare and i can never determine whether my presence is a hindrance and if they are going to eliminate me because of it. i don't want to be nonhuman, i don't want to exist outside of the crowd.

at what point is existing when your existence isn't real. what sort of qualifications do i have to live up to to be worth the emotional and social cost? uhg i don't fucking know.

schizophrenia,NaltRightNow,2018/04/15,"I hear voices But its not the same that you guys describe. Its always the same voice - mine...same as my regular thoughts, but its always bad stuff, and its not like a regular thought, its different. Almost like it got dropped in there out of nowhere, and it comes in waves - sometimes lasts for hours of constant negativity. I also find myself arguing with the voice , not aloud, but in my head. So I think it is a different entity than my own thoughts.

schizophrenia,Zephandrypus,2018/04/15,"Which symptoms are the most “prominent” in your day-to-day life, when off your medication? Between positive, negative, and thought disorder, how often does each pop up to ruin your day, and at what “potency?” 

My current thoughts are this:

- Negative symptoms are a constant, underlying “stress”.
- Thought disorder pulses like a very slow migraine, scrambling all your circuits whenever it peaks.
- Positive sympoms come and go like the weather, with certain hallucinations or delusions sticking around to rain or shine on you a while, with others just momentarily passing in front of the sun, and a select few having the potential to destroy your life.

schizophrenia,sageb1,2018/04/15,"what it is So it is a disease tied to the immune system,
Causing hallucinations and disordered thought.
However, one comorbidity is fear.
I do not know how else to explain this but immunology is the main comorbidity.
Zero affect is another, but that comes after the meds.
Oh, and hallucinations is not comorbid because they are comorbid with existence.
Please do not listen to the antipsychiatry advocates!
Help only comes from this reddit.
Really.
Eventually you will no longer need meds if you survive until your 70s.
Now, it is said a lot of schizophrenics die before then.
It's been said, they suicide before 30 but that's propaganda.

schizophrenia,SSPerkins1479,2018/04/15,"Is seeing stars normal? Hi, first time poster. Feel free to delete if this violates a rule or something but i need to ask someone and i don’t know who can help. I've been diagnosed as Schizoaffective for a few years now. I've had symptoms for what feels like forever but I never really talked about it. A lot of stuff i just assumed was ""normal"" that everyone thought that way. It’s been coming out in bits and pieces for awhile now that no, not everyone thinks this way. My meds are working great, I just got them bumped a little though and I’m now at the high end of the treatment range for my antipsychotic. My psychiatrist works 2.5 hrs from where I live and I’d have to take a half day off from work if he called me in. obviously I’d like to avoid that so i decided to ask you guys if this is something i should draw to his attention. 

At night sometimes i see stars. It’s not every night. And it’s not usually a bad experience (though sometimes they turn red and i get scared). Some nights I’m just lying on my back and i feel like it’s a good night for stars so i focus really hard and kind of relax my eyes at the darkest spot of the room and i get the whole night sky. Its beautiful, there’s these great swirls of color and it just twists and moves. 

My question is kind of three fold:

Can everyone do this? Is it normal?

If not should i talk to my psychiatrist about it and get my antipsychotics bumped? Its literally the only symptom im getting if it even is a symptom. 

And the last one my parents have harped on about me for: Am i making everything worse by indulging it? They tell me i shouldn’t look for the stars but they’re so beautiful i feel like i HAVE to. I don’t want to make everything worse and if this is normal and everyone can do it then there’s no harm in looking right? Besides it’s not like i can make myself MORE crazy right? 

Hope someone here can help.

schizophrenia,MAGNETICICE,2018/04/15,I believe the cure to schizophrenia is replacing the voices with more applicable voices of mathematics. If you replace the voices in your head with things such as terence toa structure and randomness in the prime numbers wouldn't you only hear those voices in your head. it is an interesting theory on how your IQ can be increased as well. If you only listen to educational videos every day of your life from the smartest people in the world you will develope to learn how to intelligently speak in fashions such as that. anyone at any age can increase there iq score if they apply this every day.,10.427339449541288,9.004621091743124,9.800073394495412,63.6291009174312,58.26605504587153,12.022752293577984,38.313761467889904,10.793553405168565,4.13950128440367,485,18,79,9,5,156,73,109,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.9349,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,8,1,0,6,2,0,0,7,0,7,3,2,2,0,11,9,9,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,2,1,7,0,0,5,3,0,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,7,10,2,19,6,3,13,0,0,0,0,12,8,0,4,3,59,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16615732558633622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1708458924190169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27528377495298034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151538988434228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4117283933208071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015198632844616,0.0,0.2753852037079085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725822276776075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3716581208654353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16939229366753847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16232643762832236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2196880249578581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,flattenedflounder,2018/04/15,"I'm working on a story about someone with schizophrenia Hey, I hate to be that guy, but  I'm working on a fictional story about a character with schizophrenia. I want to be as sensitive on the subject as possible and I figured I'd ask a few questions. 

How did friends and family react to the onset of the illness? 

Was there something that snapped you out of the delusional thought process, did someone say something that helped you gain rapport? 

I understand a lot of people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes. What were the effects that cigarettes had on the illness?

What are some misconceptions that people have about schizophrenia in stories that you have read? 

Mental health is very important to me and I want to be as sensitive as possible with this work. My Dad's side of the family has bipolar so I have an idea of how destruction mental health disorders can be.

schizophrenia,anwarunya,2018/04/15,"I'm almost certain I don't have schizophrenia I just want some input.  I assume as someone with schizophrenia, most of you have some insight into other mental disorders with somewhat similar symptoms.  While I have had auditory and visual hallucinations, they have been very few and far between.  I do however constantly have internal voices.  Sometimes my own internal voice, which obviously almost everyone has, but often times they aren't my own thoughts or voice.  I also have a very hard time separating the way I feel and the way the internal voices male me feel.  Emotions and logic blend together and the emotion almost always wins even if I know better.

I'm sure this isn't the right place to be, but I didn't know where else to go and just hoped I could get some advice.  Any responses are appreciated.",5.553571428571432,7.823247979591841,6.205187074829932,72.39308673469391,69.20408163265307,8.981632653061224,30.617346938775512,9.516144504307137,3.2164653061224486,651,27,104,15,12,212,96,147,0.014,0.836,0.15,0.9628,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,2,2,6,5,0,0,6,0,17,1,0,0,3,38,28,13,0,4,6,0,3,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,3,9,0,0,8,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,4,7,16,5,8,22,8,12,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,13,4,75,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517229026982888,0.0,0.0,0.4664256143886063,0.0,0.0,0.124165152993578,0.1291926980489118,0.0,0.0,0.10558534448804367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13731904121632058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1677860204161003,0.0,0.12396625739989245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17794683854625312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12970376348927612,0.349303859059846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025508935518671,0.0,0.0,0.14836210862554938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15701303104311748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08111941605487244,0.0,0.08824052733993801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13908670602897094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15421291586247968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17065887636530822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15647033486688228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16221860232659238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13259523588218708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13155530665240808,0.0,0.15356079365434092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14633517585552452,0.16137951013268462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232628568567809,0.18107223191212526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2562193350787137,0.09157916384949154,0.24648384034070975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,the-salty-otter3,2018/04/15,"A little help? Hi. I'm Salty. So, I've been reading up about schizophrenia, but I'm not entirely sure I have it, but I do think I have some of the symptoms. 

I isolate myself from people I don't know well and also family and friends. I'm compulsive and very messy, and a lot of things annoy me (normally people). Luckily I don't self-harm and I'm not depressed, though I do have down periods. I often get into patterns or rhythms at random, like snapping my fingers repetitively and tapping my fingers. 

I'm often confused and I have a horrible memory. When I get focused on something I'll completely forget most other things for a while and not remember them until I'm snapped out of my ""work zone"" (which I suppose if kind of good, until I'm not getting other work done). I get confused about whether my thoughts are my own or if I'm mind-reading someone else. This one's kind of irrational and I don't think this anymore, but I do often wonder if someone or something is thinking my thoughts. Admittedly, I do think that I'm better than a lot of people and deserve more. 

On my mood, I'm not angry or anxious, but I do tend to be apathetic at times. I used to feel ""detached"" from my own mind, but not as much anymore. I don't really get excited about many things anymore either. 

I'm not paranoid, depressed, and I don't have any visionary hallucinations, but I do have one voice (I think) which I describe as a very blunt, mean, and scolding sort of personality. I know that this voice is not my own because it uses pronouns like you and we, like it's talking to me. But it also helps me make decisions and gets me through my days sometimes.

I'm tired often and have headaches, but I have no problems with speech or movement. 

So, I need to know. Am I possibly schizophrenic? I know I shouldn't be asking strangers on the internet for help, but I really want to know the opinions of other people who have schizophrenia and deal with it on a daily basis. 

Thank you so much and I apologize for length.",4.32680735930736,5.433544689393936,5.45046176046176,81.17545454545456,70.54040404040404,8.182395382395383,31.56709956709957,8.527137837955566,2.4691554112554117,1571,69,303,25,28,521,180,396,0.124,0.731,0.145,0.8107,0,0,2,0,0,0,57.0,1,2,1,3,15,19,1,2,10,0,29,5,2,3,1,91,71,47,0,8,27,0,3,3,1,1,3,3,0,1,19,22,0,0,18,1,0,1,15,6,1,2,4,6,49,12,39,64,11,21,0,2,0,0,16,11,0,22,12,216,68,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14201295448317655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060381219526410124,0.0,0.0,0.1003090463091907,0.26417172900433583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08300800430286819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05412643369203456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07852880731736142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093096128632921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057263129036044184,0.09154006905669716,0.15295186302704186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086446413518136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07417384917027385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370466121093967,0.0,0.04489561663074886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06860004121818288,0.0,0.2783391554431932,0.0,0.0,0.07447404168748266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17854507857291949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.184925228665317,0.2439872486070033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13013702804904334,0.08899234265225876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509746029960081,0.0,0.0,0.059268971297213625,0.09002057714044619,0.0,0.09671990111557753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17930807236164673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13054384010165676,0.06583772282274054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08699675256371041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12033474647704955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24622720024961375,0.07752925483356148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10009900004427903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0849614102559647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776309233234985,0.0,0.11376413179104525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058338523072057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262882976880983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15046538682729324,0.13671196683636122,0.0878169980620984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368487521266567,0.09228829697562414,0.0,0.07136719083842813,0.0,0.08174722240518867,0.0,0.0,0.1769672489152389,0.2844698265333588,0.08723713253494038,0.14098096010217706,0.05177499887998736,0.10205269099044198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533745799220994,0.0,0.14652446315644252,0.0523714879489492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07983416208400221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09629052197546796,0.12928244208870462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,gg205,2018/04/15,"My best imitation of sanity is a failure I’m laughed at when I’m unwell. I really try to be a positive person, but I’ve been diagnosed for almost 10 years now (I’m 27 ..recently bought a condo) I don’t know if it’s because I’m alone, but I think my illness is getting worse again (schizoaffective bipolar) I just realized I have no idea what sanity is. I try to blend in with the rest of the people by imitating the way they talk and such, but I don’t know how long I can keep doing this. 
I think about suicide multiple times a day. I haven’t attempted in years and I still don’t want to.. I just feel like something horrible is about to happen. I’m not sure what the point of this post was.. 
Maybe I’m just hoping someone can relate..

schizophrenia,ParadoxWithinMe,2018/04/16,"Does anyone else have this issue? Help I have very vivid dreams, but lately when I wake up, as the day goes on, I cannot differentiate between what I have dreamed and what has actually happened. Sometimes I cant tell if it’s a memory from the day before, years ago or if it ever even happened and was actually a dream. 

If you do experience this,is there anyway to make it stop? I’m grow concerned about what is real and what is not as far as this goes.

schizophrenia,jag140,2018/04/16,"Prodromal, depression, or just over thinking things? Just as a bit of background information, I was diagnosed as schizoaffective by two doctors although I'm on the 'borderline' of psychotic if that makes sense. I almost was just diagnosed with bipolar because they were skeptical about me being psychotic but ultimately gave that diagnosis because apparently I have 'odd thoughts' and ideas. Whatever that means...

Anyways, I can't focus, I have literally no energy to finish even short essays and it has brought the end of my college career from a 3.8 and participating in a ton of activities to being a failing drug addled outcast that everyone hates. I have been dealing with isolation for a while now because people can't stand me and for some reason, everyone thinks I a creep so I have to go out at night.

And furthermore, I just feel dumber, like standardized tests are mediocre rather than good for me... I also am tired all the time and skipped class for a week to wander around town aimlessly for hours on end. That's all I do is sleep, walk, and block out the world with music. Sometimes I'll skip class to walk 15+ miles a day.

With that said, I have noticed some strange effects when I am off my medications... my pupils dilate like I'm intoxicated and whenever I would smoke weed, I would hear things, depersonalize, and see shadow people on occasion. Not to mention the embarrassing effect of perceiving strangers as familiar people talking to me only for their faces to morph into strangers again. I have stopped drugs since then, but weed in particular has become way more powerful than it used to be for me.

One night I panicked after seeing my eyes dilate, hearing creaks and cracking noises so I walked it off only to hear the occasional voice or dog bark at 4 in the morning. I tried texting my friends about it but for some reason, they couldn't understand me and my loosely connected language, as cliche as that sounds. So I just wandered aimlessly all night instead of typing a short and easy essay. I feel like I have an extreme form of ADHD without the hyperactivity.

Just last night, my phone rang at 3:52 in the morning, playing bizzare indescribable fantastical music on the alarm that I've never heard before. Also when I'm in dark locations, I see blobs of color morph into different shapes. But perhaps the weirdest visual disturbance I've had is that of light. It used to look normal but for the past 2 months or so, light spikes in all directions and I see a moving almost-cross or flower shaped rainbow halo around it. Light just looks different. Occasionally I'll also get minor auditory hallucinations of cracking but today I woke up to someone screaming.

I feel nothing but fatigue, I need some sleep but it's destroying my academic career very quickly. Am I just depressed, am I overreacting, or is something actually going to happen? I know this sounds like hypochondriac ranting but it really has me worried and while I'm still skeptical about my diagnosis, is there truth to it? Will I be okay? And should I talk to someone about this or am I overreacting? I really wish this wasn't happening at the end of my college career.",6.895900757092036,8.13421315771231,7.203592538538718,70.46115456535621,64.736568457539,10.233129617805346,34.768265985587895,10.307518312809881,3.8414083188908164,2540,113,419,60,38,825,297,577,0.122,0.7959999999999999,0.08199999999999999,-0.9749,5,1,4,0,0,0,66.0,0,0,3,5,32,21,4,3,24,1,38,14,4,7,6,92,76,49,0,9,27,0,3,4,1,4,10,10,0,0,23,25,0,2,16,1,0,7,8,12,0,2,12,24,54,9,78,55,12,68,0,4,8,0,16,31,0,12,32,294,77,12,0.0,0.0,0.07630760608829404,0.0,0.09397589127888832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566031557888683,0.0,0.0,0.18759893087090784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392212889892195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430018990793359,0.08636087443267898,0.06653867907810651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536932072159516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05042968004611311,0.08061620927180893,0.13469947669215745,0.15873373509305802,0.0,0.16339547573070234,0.0,0.08003648940972721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18136409435129724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2077742222154208,0.0,0.0,0.051647443012671934,0.0,0.0,0.14943845509454165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11861410406353293,0.055862937871029125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06041371102172169,0.0,0.040853963069529695,0.0,0.08888070009633951,0.06558674241633948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382961860378592,0.0,0.0,0.07720194622370319,0.0,0.0,0.2643963047271057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07700689485490439,0.0,0.0,0.08827329165507637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04297424569599671,0.0637398342050172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528096420190236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13132918603258287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05219615675034761,0.0,0.0,0.08517791027940694,0.0,0.07877382010942396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062414965809127226,0.08310952635479417,0.0,0.05798103164822874,0.060309251787038026,0.0,0.0,0.29352501831186595,0.0766150657620763,0.07503076781517656,0.0890261859391837,0.0,0.0,0.05298734862574463,0.11894252421160993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0746465289837503,0.1626329079845901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001881815318729,0.16079615908814712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438190304758538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2492470125071975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468419170503112,0.0,0.15650410353071645,0.0,0.13250972210999568,0.060198777661039884,0.07733742793018161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062447091079764386,0.0653750061231965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12570129017945994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10389933734170556,0.10020914034104343,0.0,0.0620785558720646,0.045596471444341424,0.08987431600626282,0.07412026653125486,0.0,0.0,0.053089665827356906,0.0,0.07638571925400416,0.08140435634196383,0.0,0.13507174900990696,0.0,0.06451954268213997,0.0,0.06206801158247715,0.06272377747321976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992105776113637,0.07537774856228871,0.0,0.0,0.07941140704425312,0.0,0.11109579277322637,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,rethrokun,2018/04/16,"What is real I have not been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but I'm not sure where else to go. I've seen a psychiatrist recently, but it's hard for me to tell if she's looking out for my best interests or not. She prescribed me Geodon but I'm taking Lexapro and they seem to have a major interaction with each other. Which I asked her about this, she said not to listen to the pharmacy (who are the ones who called me to warn me).

She said in our last session that have a distorted perception of reality, and I just don't know what to believe. My wife tells me I'm the things I accuse her of are not real, but I just feel like it's all this big thing and everyone is in on it. I don't know what I have, I know it causes me extreme anxiety though. I dont know why she would want to hurt me, she tells me in my face that she loves e, but I feel I can't let my guard down.

  


More than one doctor has made me feel like I'm delusional. I ask them right out but they won't tell me. I'm not dealing with jealousy btw, since this has nothing to do with anything like that. This also isn't the only thing I'm dealing with. I would say more but I'm afraid they will find out I'm writing this. It makes it so hard to tell anyone including my therapist, things I'm dealing with for fear that I'm being listened to or monitored. I'm so exhausted.

  


Am I dealing with anything remotely close to schizophrenia? I just want to know what I'm dealing with to help me deal with it.",2.6449691444600285,3.6456558419354863,4.05490883590463,89.99714586255259,74.45161290322581,7.584852734922861,25.09116409537167,8.04050195162591,1.1822103786816265,1141,36,262,17,23,378,141,310,0.091,0.8059999999999999,0.103,0.6896,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,1,0,4,1,9,11,0,2,7,0,24,5,1,3,2,60,60,17,0,5,19,1,5,3,0,4,3,5,0,0,28,17,0,1,11,0,0,1,12,4,0,2,5,12,45,7,38,49,6,15,0,1,2,1,40,12,0,4,5,176,73,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06968588392103893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666191640018733,0.0,0.0,0.060930364297399286,0.0,0.14341770852218047,0.0,0.16292840814186504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817702056254618,0.09144812921976687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889797561332827,0.0,0.0,0.08951685755737895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5390255261957451,0.0,0.08844533857439349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08919155590963934,0.0,0.0,0.10212751514284167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07279434840388002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08326607289321616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805680713652144,0.1321819156771838,0.12450576938460912,0.0,0.0,0.07964444693302916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049523710937320914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15612077652408385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05840815328143971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09328524911621486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394495227075285,0.07103078893259157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910662731735068,0.0,0.12771671237258767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07317571350879959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786473169585948,0.08245404287869919,0.0581666745680768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361324905533855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11809673568421848,0.06627395127205639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198368958154428,0.0,0.0,0.08604030822790568,0.0,0.0,0.0744171451763666,0.16578032628022274,0.06929728262724187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079329048597908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07208316785853358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08212848639392671,0.0,0.06551848926414948,0.0,0.3808213179570125,0.0,0.0,0.10117633965907827,0.2315679666569922,0.0,0.08561467809127668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279494411659196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863036101191598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12380361364593613,0.0,0.0,0.0
schizophrenia,ScarKrueger,2018/04/16,"It's getting harder to tell what's real Hello. I am somewhat new to Reddit and I have Schizoaffective disorder as well as paranoia, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

Recently, it's been getting hard to tell what's real and what's not. I've always been pretty high functioning except that I'm not fit for work yet, but I have my own place with my therapy cat, Kally. The past few weeks have been hard because I keep hearing and seeing and feeling and smelling all these strange things that I've never had problems with before. The most troubling thing to me is that I keep hearing people break into my apartment every night even when I have my headphones cranked up. I sometimes get the courage to check with mace in hand but no one is ever there. Usually I would be able to brush these things off but last night I was genuinely terrified. My bathroom door seemed to close on it's own and then I heard what I thought sounded like jars and cans moving around in my pantry. I was too afraid to check the pantry. Now, I don't really have any kind of spirituality but I'm kinda 50/50 on ghosts. But honestly I'm leaning more on the idea that it is just my disorder. I'm also getting pretty bad tactile hallucinations where I can feel hundreds of ants crawling on me when I try to sleep. It prevents me from sleeping even more than just my insomnia.

I can't see my doctor until the end of may but I haven't seen him since February even though I was suppose to see him each month. I don't know what to do. I think maybe I need a change of meds as I've been on Haldol for about 5 years. The only time I feel safe is when I'm talking to my boyfriend but he lives in a different state. I'm flying out to see him again at the end of may but I don't know if I can wait that long. Please if you have any tips for these things, please leave a comment. I'm getting desperate.

Thank you for reading, have a great day.

schizophrenia,Justagirlinadress,2018/04/16,Delusions of control/feel like I’m being mind controlled I’m in a psychiatric hospital at the moment as I have schizophrenia. I have delusions of control where I feel like I’m being controlled in everything I do and say. It feels like mind control. I’m feeling very hopeless right now and I’m wondering if any other schizophrenics have experienced this and if you ever got better. Please don’t tell me anything about illuminati conspiracies and mind control as I’m trying to get better. ,5.879571428571433,7.965302544444448,6.206507936507936,73.465,68.0,8.253968253968255,35.079365079365076,8.841846274778883,3.409269841269841,399,20,62,7,7,128,54,90,0.037000000000000005,0.772,0.191,0.8958,0,0,0,0,0,1,6.0,0,1,0,7,4,6,0,0,2,0,7,1,0,5,1,19,19,8,0,2,2,0,3,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,4,0,5,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,5,6,5,9,16,0,8,0,1,0,0,3,5,0,3,6,36,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712268345115475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09332676013356968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20060384324912836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7631936958310738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10258583047132827,0.0,0.0,0.10192558795473701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22937399786986384,0.2430603625103777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05925203991592681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09070433068098326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16621918037131642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3435352866366543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12449011466802498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968515133767556,0.0,0.09018817746151032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991253316231234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699794003759497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09357512053000223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12298829841309085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm not delusional in any way and still feel very in touch with reality at the moment despite this, will this change if I don't get help ? Will I start being delusional?

schizophrenia,Grimcicle,2018/04/16,"They’re Multiplying For years I’ve had another with me; I started calling him Zach a couple years ago as a personal nod to Deadly Premonition (though he does not think of himself by that name or any other, he simply is). But a while ago another appeared. Then another who always seems angry and demonic and speaks a language I cannot understand. Recently a woman appeared who frequently calls my name from different directions and ridicules me a lot and points out my negative qualities to me.

Anyway, anyone else have their number of others increase in a relatively short period of time?",8.553899371069187,8.928303509433963,9.0,62.00333333333335,61.07547169811321,13.104402515723276,39.36477987421385,12.45797560212912,5.5927345911949695,476,23,72,16,6,159,80,106,0.096,0.8690000000000001,0.035,-0.802,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,0,2,1,1,0,7,0,4,0,0,0,0,17,10,10,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,5,6,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,1,0,0,1,1,10,0,12,9,2,18,1,0,0,0,14,4,0,5,11,51,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3094421508987232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452330423927208,0.0,0.0,0.11869464020541245,0.5490679558126923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12204392228683895,0.17883904841440942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3564540789425661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193127557577958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18235938643890212,0.0,0.0,0.15274300254718026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458075608437387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14838948536745106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15240346385912792,0.0,0.0,0.1649987388889299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17233930589432556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588966085105977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12354182474362735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11183955532698253,0.17148676591829426,0.0,0.10177692520780887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18170452284052924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2247988305748816
schizophrenia,MeechieBoy96,2018/04/16,"What i thought was meth and the path to hell To make a long story short.. a little more than a week ago I had picked up what I thought was a gram of meth.. I blew through it in 2 days and started to think I was getting gangrene because I am an IV user and to me my hands and feet looked like they were turning green or whatever but to everyone else my skin was fine. This was also accompanied by a dark feeling.. like something was in my room with me. I couldn't sleep because of this feeling.. and the meth.. whatever this thing I was feeling was.. it was trying to communicate. It left handprints with long fingernails on my window and they would disappear and come back. To prove I wasn't crazy I showed my sister and she saw it. They would disappear when I said and come back when I said.. so I felt relief that she had seen it too... Later on in the day I grew confident that there was some kind of entity following me and I started fucking with it.. that's when things got nutty... I went into a full blown hallucination infront of my sister.. saw satanic symbols morphing from the wood of the bedroom door.. saw mist coming from the ceiling and this demon entity told me that smoking meth opens a gateway to meet the ""all powerful"" being beyond the gate that was now on my door... My sister told me she saw this.. I felt relief thru all the madness.. but when my mom got home.. my sister denied seeing any of it... And that's when I spiraled deeper into madness. I felt my body going numb as the delusions and paranoia got worse. I went to the hospital where I spent the whole night fighting nurses and ripping out my IVs hallucinating and thinking the hospital staff was going to kill me purposely . Days leading to the hospital visit I would hear voices or noises that felt all too real. Examples are me hearing my cats screaming in pain when they are really sleeping in the other room with my mom.. or my step dad's cousin that lives upstairs telling me to come to the basement at 3 am to help with something. I would see strange things floating around as if it were clouds of smoke that would disappear and shadows on my ceiling.. not to mention it always seems to happen around night time when my mind starts to go wild. I have had paranoia for the last few years and other delusions leading up to all this and excluding the meth use.. so when I went to the hospital they said it was ""substance induced psychosis"" and they let me go.. ever since the hospital visit I have been scared to use any drugs and just scared in general.. I can barely sleep by myself.. I feel more comfortable with someone else I feel comfortable with in the same room as me. I'm sorry if all this seems disorganized and clusterfucked but I'm scared. Is it possible that I had the problem already and the drugs brought it out? Could this be some kind of paranormal shit? My animals act very strange around me now and when in my room.. and I feel very weak and strained of energy. I'm actually scared for my life.. after spending all of it not caring and doing really destructive things to myself and others.. there's way more to my experiences but I put all the major shit I went thru in this post. Ask me anything you'd like..",4.098701923076924,5.678226338141028,4.740576923076926,84.2294230769231,71.67628205128204,7.764102564102564,27.743589743589745,8.344100000000001,1.8834397435897443,2521,92,490,40,48,807,271,624,0.152,0.782,0.066,-0.9958,2,0,10,0,2,1,79.0,0,1,6,3,27,30,9,5,32,0,41,18,9,7,9,104,105,51,1,10,12,8,12,3,0,5,8,7,10,0,41,46,0,0,18,1,2,25,4,19,0,0,46,28,78,11,77,48,17,92,3,0,9,1,33,34,4,9,34,345,119,3,0.0,0.0,0.06382877925925971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057980251390351525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07217936179697769,0.05230675927629535,0.054424701248095404,0.0,0.0,0.08895937489847038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05382521633884833,0.17468097962869464,0.06114765677366669,0.0,0.0,0.10058943941700554,0.0,0.07974422750141452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0726535501940425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06668782198148447,0.0,0.0,0.22537282438803485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052222971001653073,0.0,0.0,0.12654825963432645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15170504406218502,0.0,0.10927999314612867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0591652866821582,0.0,0.06250015334013698,0.0,0.06398158130337643,0.0,0.0,0.19843352067802664,0.04672749301056437,0.2512077748665125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060468648165269465,0.03417298385188088,0.0,0.14869150999949945,0.0,0.15693827412803027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05784008425578285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474391543779039,0.0,0.04384160810713124,0.0,0.06560956369972902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236426834134962,0.13622474731425285,0.0,0.05331625529945662,0.0,0.0,0.07106599059227485,0.06688411831429829,0.04619960943223071,0.09586514447032643,0.06555600595010126,0.057756468190646386,0.11576805520750673,0.0549262521476081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043660352331649714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604344097656444,0.15321013369879352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227619667377585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06959873066905596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0737376997495569,0.06264278991518132,0.0,0.0,0.0625866288073005,0.0,0.06575311248277574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07444863118784757,0.08380408783870319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18665397778359766,0.0,0.2619393006503478,0.0,0.10424342577294136,0.11908998537867567,0.0,0.0,0.13428075774900475,0.05410617899776357,0.0,0.19636573055126014,0.0,0.055419991766471166,0.10070855811038776,0.0,0.07321890839767342,0.1388883712523565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0571694807752738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17381669294391427,0.08382161918679104,0.0,0.1038533022489742,0.03813993466725295,0.0,0.0,0.12500030668027395,0.0,0.044407743012161716,0.0711451288390631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129830339814324,0.0,0.10793691111215324,0.0,0.051917831176292895,0.05246635757400914,0.0,0.0,0.2425355097888659,0.0,0.07302570355555847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06665634672537489,0.23231985633744506,0.0,0.0,0.04212061178845191

schizophrenia,Symbyax_Throwaway,2018/04/16,"Possibly Schizophrenic? I'm starting the Symbyax combo, and I've read up a lot on depression, social anxiety, and Schizophrenia. I dunno what to expect. I don't have hallucinations/other major schizophrenic symptoms. I do think I overthink reality and how this ""life"" isn't all there is.

I have long periods of clarity where I speak openly to the people helping but when it comes to taking meds I struggle. I can see its a delusion when I'm calmer but my mind jumps to thinking its something to control me, or hurt me, or do nothing and its all a trick. This means I sometimes miss meds which just makes it worse the next time. I also really struggle talking this through with the people I'm seeing about it so I guess if anyone has advice about how to work through these delusions it would be greatly appreciated.

I have to pretend to be like everyone else because if I do a good enough job then I'll get to kill the body off and be free thoughts in the air. ,1.8377795655671747,3.9538429469026535,3.2446822204344343,90.09667739340307,79.70796460176993,7.2949316170555125,25.316975060337892,8.296473431620573,1.6148123893805315,435,17,94,9,11,142,65,113,0.181,0.7070000000000001,0.112,-0.8954,1,1,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,3,7,2,0,9,0,15,4,2,0,2,14,26,6,1,2,4,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,6,2,0,0,5,1,1,0,2,3,0,0,3,2,11,5,10,19,3,7,0,0,1,0,1,6,0,2,2,63,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17071445591973194,0.12463611241708886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4542149987884534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075212543904769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20923221417297305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17079898993890172,0.0,0.0,0.21126046966630932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19536902875254325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10682122055580352,0.0,0.0,0.17149023866469967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304397897565561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20289368946434166,0.0,0.2262032341792476,0.0,0.1123651423950876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998881824841982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28349180721075457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1309814646168705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16292709504456998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15740227930337108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13583326066667353,0.2620177304184678,0.0,0.32463470421754226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I don't know if it counted as a panic attack or not. It wasn't really anxiety, I don't think. It was pretty firmly directed at ""people are a danger,"" which is a thought I get a lot. I was pretty freaked out and couldn't stop thinking of people. I can't even stand when my mom is in the house with me. I just stay in my room. It is like a constant revulsion to just be as far away from people as possible and I don't know why. I couldn't get my brain to slow down. It was so scared and paranoid. I wish I could be around people again. I don't really get lonely anymore but I think maybe if I stopped thinking I can't let anyone know anything about me at all because if they do the world will end, it would be better. I don't know. I'll probably get paranoid and delete this in 10 minutes anyway.

schizophrenia,TheMantisman,2018/04/17,"Perhaps you guys can help with this So recently, maybe the last month or so, I have been seeing and hearing some strange things. At some point, almost everyday, I hear voices. Not traditional voices that speak to me, but rather sharp, harsh sounding whispering. I can never make out anything they have to say. The thing about them is they never last. I hear them for a few minutes or so, but then they fade away. I've only heard them extensively once, where I heard them all night. All of the articles I've read don't mention the consistency or length of auditory hallucinations. I've also seen strange shadowy figures, often lurking in the corners of my eyes, but occaisionaly they are right in front of my face, and they are getting closer. If anyone has any information or advice as to what's happening, that would be great! I'm sorry if this was hard to read I wrote this very quickly.

schizophrenia,CrazyYosef,2018/04/18,"Extreme anger I wake-up.. Does anyone else wake up with an extreme anger at waking up? Not just waking up but the fact you're waking up still alive. This morning like a lot of mornings I woke up with an extreme anger that I woke up at all and didn't die. Its not that honestly want to die, but I just hate the fact I'm living. I'll wake up and my first thought is always ""FUCK! Again.. another fucking day of this shit. Why!?"" I get so angry I could put a hole into my bedroom wall. For hours I'm like this, just so mad and pissed off.

schizophrenia,Dirty_Urchin,2018/04/18,"Floatation tanks and schizo affective disorder. My son is diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I have just purchased some vouchers for a floatation tank. As far as I have read these sessions are great for sore bodies and generalised anxiety disorder. He is in a good place at the minute, and he practices mindfulness. Has anyone had experience using floatation tanks and what was your experience. Or, do you think it will help still his mind or kick in over active thought processes?

schizophrenia,maddogmular,2018/04/18,"Hangover induced schizophrenic episode So Its probably nothing but recently I've been feeling a little more out of touch with reality, my mind keeps making conspiracy theories about people around me. I caught on to it so i can quickly dissmiss them but it still happens. I've never been diagnosed with a mental illness except social anxiety but ever since I was little I always thought that I was never normal. Last weekend I had a hangover from a crazy night and reality was completely warped. It felt like I was in a war with my own thoughts. Paranoia, delusions even some small hallucinations. Reality as of right now feels pretty normal but I'm wondering if it could mean that I'm prone to having schizophrenic episodes in the future. I'm at the age Google says symptoms are most likely to appear so I'm a little spooked.

schizophrenia,lolitapms,2018/04/18,"What's my chance of developing schizophrenia? Schizophrenia runs in my family. My father has 7 siblings, 3 of them developed schizophrenia (two males, one females).  They all were diagnosed psychosis in their mid 30s, early 40s. 2 of them live a normal life; the other one not so much. He ended up killing one of our relatives who was 5 years old. He went to jail and after that, he went to a mental institution, where he stayed for 6 years. Now he lives in a nursing home, he has improved but he hasn't fully recovered yet. Even when I've had the chance to see him and talk to him. He gives me this pervy uncle creepy vibe. I feel so bad for my aunt and uncles because I remember them as some of the most brilliant people I've known and for them because they never were able to find love, have a family. And to be completely honest with all of you, I'm really afraid of developing it and that I might not be able to fulfill my dreams such as becoming a nurse, travel, find love and have a family. All of the sudden, I felt extreme anxiety. And I just felt very afraid that if i  develop schizophrenia that might interfere with my dreams. Sorry for this post I needed to vent out this fear I have.",4.261637046307882,5.5031816468085095,5.065857321652069,83.36411764705883,70.82978723404256,8.42302878598248,25.73842302878598,8.841846274778883,1.7932728410513143,937,28,186,17,17,304,137,235,0.069,0.7759999999999999,0.155,0.9737,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,1,1,7,0,9,8,1,3,10,0,14,4,0,0,4,34,25,15,1,3,5,2,3,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,11,11,0,1,7,3,0,4,4,5,0,4,8,4,26,3,30,13,6,24,0,0,1,2,27,7,0,5,11,123,37,0,0.2484456013016375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503010248511892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372084975358406,0.15145013256477807,0.13719432362904946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13024524304469773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608352779116974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100245300959652,0.0,0.0,0.08204798825673028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513186027223586,0.13978518672650986,0.0628107804865869,0.0,0.23854673872263285,0.0,0.2270747786181289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11916582968850885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12460559756083855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13743412378101186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774223780433761,0.0,0.0,0.21938201768376586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242318551386228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251873655414958,0.2635615214482232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913180517369864,0.09210963266119042,0.09580828195465567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171196963987407,0.0,0.0,0.13035093275875906,0.0,0.2525297538970334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08612044886199953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11897110466978275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07958030700351801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14072021734962895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898948893848476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390572550581079,0.0,0.13240497712421692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984558168707117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12134762595694658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10249682020105033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23031156147658596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599908216292506

schizophrenia,floatinlimbo,2018/04/19,"Confused and terrified I am having issues with my neighbours next door banging around. I am quiet as a mouse but terrified because I think they are flipping out because they can hear everything I'm doing like typing, doing dishes, pulling the blanket over me in my bed, clearing my nose when it's stuffed up, and my music at medium low volume through my headphones. 

I hear them swearing at me all the time at everything I do. It's gotten to the point that I am frozen in fear most of the time and it's very hard to transition between tasks because of this extreme fear of making noise and pissing them off. To make matters worse I am also clumsy and drop or bump into things a lot so that doesn't help and also makes me more afraid to move at all. 

Since I moved here I have attempted suicide twice without telling anyone but my family doctor because of this fear of my neighbours that is plaguing me. 

Yesterday they got extra mad and the husband or bf stormed outside and I heard what I thought was a car door. But then after I cleared my nose once I heard it again three more times. I looked out the window of my front door and there he was standing in front of their front door across from me, and he was smacking the window of their front door like a crazed menace. Then when I looked away I heard him and the wife or gf storm past my window shouting my name and some other stuff but I didn't hear the rest, and they went down into the basement below me and were banging around. 

The pest control guy came over that morning and set up traps in the basement because this is an old building and they do that twice a year. I thought the neighbours must think I called pest control and are mad at me and have gone down there to destroy the mouse traps so that I will have a mouse problem and not be able to live here. 

I became terrified and sent a panicked text to my mom about it, and then she came about 15 minutes later even though I told her not to, and she told me to come home because she said I was being paranoid. 

My paranoia/anxiety is also spreading in other areas. I thought my caseworker was secretly telling the staff at the local mental clinic about stuff I had told her, and that they now are starting to hate me. But they are all so nice so I know that doesn't make sense...

So far I believe all these things are true. And every time I go out I hear people swearing at me as they walk by, saying horrible things to me. Real people, not just voices. 

Right now I can't tell if this stuff at my apartment is really happening or if I am developing a form of schizophrenia because no one is around to see/hear these things except me. I have been hospitalized once and put on seroquel. And at the time I took it I actually had more vivid hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. I have always had those since I was a teenager but the seroquel made t more intense so I thought I must not have schizophrenia. 

In short I'm just very confused. I'm going to the doctor soon, maybe she can help clarify things. I am on an SSRI for my anxiety but it is not really helping to decrease this fear. I'm not looking for a diagnosis on here of course just venting. Thanks if you've read all of this.

schizophrenia,Intpgoat,2018/04/19,"Difference between auditory hallucinations and just ""internal dialogue"" First of all, hi. I'm bipolar and have a dense history of psychosis.

Now to the point, there's a LOT of people that respond ""yes"", when they're asked about hearing voices. Obviously, that's not the case.

My experience (bipolar): voices exist, but they ""sound in my skull"". I can discriminate the inner voices from external voices. They speak all day, tell me I'm shit and comment all my actions, and they are NOT my thoughts. I can't even tell if they have volume or not, and they speak different languages. 

As most people with schizophrenia have experienced this hallucinations. 

What makes it different from what I tell, and specially from what ""normal"" people define as hearing voices?

Could you try to give a fairly accurate description? 

PD: I hate when people call me stupid for telling this, as they say it's normal. 

Can't remember well my last psychosis but I'm 100% sure the voices pushed me to be reckless.

schizophrenia,amithirsty,2018/04/19,"One year since my last episode. I'm going through what my therapist calls 'anniversary symptoms' just being a little... off since it's around that time of the year. The episode was caused by trauma so PTSD is a factor too. Does anyone else get this? 
Therapist also doesn't know I've been off of my meds for over a month. I missed an appointment with the psychiatrist a while back by accident and they haven't checked on me since, I figured they dont really care... so I never called back.

That being said, I missed you all ! I'm a long time member of the sub, just made a new account. Afraid of people and all that.

schizophrenia,GRIFST3R,2018/04/19,"A Poem I wrote about one of my Delusions I wrote this poem about a delusion that comes up in my thoughts from time to time, specifically about feelings I feel that I don’t think are truly my own, please feel free to comment and critique.

N1ghtSt4lk3r 

Shadow at the corner of my eye
What things the mind will provide
Are you real or not?
Synapses running hot
You like to play with a knife?
Only a product of my strife?
The pills may keep you at bay
But at heart I know you're here to stay
You're a venom in my blood
Drowning in your rage flood
Hungry for the taste of flesh
Your hatred always fresh
Thinking me merely a puppet
Know I can't fight it, so fuck it
My tissue merely a vessel
Within your anger I nestle
Can never let you surface
No recognition for my service
You want to feast on wicked men
I feel your presence once again
My dreams you make a hell
Sleep merely a prison cell
Sometimes your laugh appears
My loss of control nears 
Laughing at tyrants and maniacs
You're capable of more brutal attacks
Watching violence I feel you lick my lips
Didn't stand a chance during acid trips
The sight of a fresh blood splatter
Lights up your grey matter
Wishing the world was on fire
So your adrenaline wouldn't expire
The idea of burning nuclear flame
Driving you insane in the membrane 
The impact of hollow points 
It energizes your joints
I can't cut you out with a razor
Your power sweltering like a laser
I bash my head against the wall
Even then your shadow won't stall
Oh the games you love to play
Maybe suicide the only way
Have to keep you off the streets
Already seen you act in the sheets
Biting like a rabid mutt
A scene truly uncut 
Aroused by the thought of torture 
Everyday with you a scorcher
Feel your will to kill 
Ace card in my wallet still
Your existence tire me out
I wish my pain could shout
Every single day I wonder
Your existence my own blunder
A living skeleton in my closet
More defenses I must deposit
Always beside me Shadowman
You think I should have ran?
The vision of prophecy near
It is me you shall learn to fear
The battle between us on the horizon
An arsenal to size in
My stronghold exponentially grows
The weapons against you I have chose
Either blue moon or blood red sun
The battle seemingly already begun
A goddess against a queen
Snakes against steel

schizophrenia,discreteUser,2018/04/19,"Is this schizophrenia or OCD? (Fear of synchroniticies and occult stuff) Hi all! I have some doubts about what I'm actually treating.

I am diagnosed with pure\-O OCD and I was treating it with 75mg of clomipramine.

Well, everything was kinda under control until a series of synchronicities \(and very very unlikely\) containing too direct symbolic messages began to freak me out \(more details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/84je0x/ocd\_synchronicities\_and\_chaos\_magick/](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/84je0x/ocd_synchronicities_and_chaos_magick/) \). It's important to state that I always found stuff in the occult very interesting \(specialy liking games like persona or bands like tool\), but they also scare me.

With this, and without knowing how to take the 'messages' on the synchronicities, I started to become very scaried with them being negative and even threatening me. I started a lot of 'what if' questions that gave me fear about spirits, chaos magick \(and manifesting\), law of attraction, entities and stuff like this. It's also important to state that I don't fully believe these stuff, but I give some credit and chance to it being agnostic.

Nowadays, I often test my head, trying to find logical proofs that it was nothing, or that there is no bad outcome, that nothing bad will happen if I contrariate any synchronicity \(I'm fearful about playing a game that I love because the most strong coincidence was about me avoiding this game\).

I don't halucinate, I kinda act normal with my friends and in general in my social circle, but my obsession fears sometimes makes me depression about the possibilities. I'm also afraid about developing severe schizophrenia. Now I am not sure if this is OCD, schizophrenia or something else. I recognize that I'm kinda new to metaphysics and maybe I can have turned this into my new OCD focus, but also, the theme may be unusual and too subjective for just OCD.

Oh, another thing: I'm changing from clomipramine to zoloft... and I was much less fearful \(next to nothing\) before reducing my clomipramine dosage to raise the zoloft dosage. The reduction kinda triggered my fears all again and now I'm waiting for the zoloft to kick in. Dunno if clomipramine kinda serves as treatment for schizo too.

If anyone here could give me a light on this, it would be very much appreciated!

schizophrenia,Izendore,2018/04/19,"Can't sit through a Movie, TV Show, Video Game or Book So, I don't know if it is related to Schizophrenia or not but I didn't know where else to post this.

So, I have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia almost 5 years ago. I had multiple episodes, relapses etc. I had to go through painful experience of trying out multiple medications before finding the right antipsychotic that controlled my positive symptoms pretty well. But I think I am still struglling with negative symptoms though.

So, I am currently doing part-time job and also studying in correspondence (distance education) course. 

But, I can't do any studying at all. But it's not just studying, I can't focus on ANYTHING at all. When I am not in front my laptop, I have this strong urge to be in front of it. But when I am in front of laptop, I can't find anything entertaining. I have over 150 TV Shows in my hard disk, over 60 Anime and countless audibooks and podcasts. But I can't sit through them. 

I have this rendency to buy stuff on imuplse. I feel good when buying that new book. But after that my excitment fades away. Same with downloading stuff. I have multiple 2 TB hard disks full with downloaded content. But I don't consume them.

I have noticed recently that the reason I download all these tv shows and movies is so that I don't miss out on things. And so that I stay relevent. But I realized that I don't actually enjoy recent movies and tv shows at all, except hadnful of shows and movies. 

And also, if I hear someone on the interset say that the movie or tv show is cheesy or boring then I feel like I have to hate that thing too or else I am not cool. But at the same time, if everyone loves it then I feel disgusted by it (FRIENDS for example). 

So, my problem is that I hoard digital content too much but I don't consume them. I procrastinate EVERYTHING, including entertainement. I care too much about what other people think about the stuff I consume. I am constantly thinking about spending my time productively, yet, I don't do productive thing at all.

How can I fix this? How can I stop worrying about hoarding stuff and just enjoy them? and if it really the case that I am over those things and that I hav outgrown those things, then how can I stop wasting my time with those things and do something productive with my time?",4.285772070626006,6.038954829213487,4.8278972712680615,83.09449438202249,71.49438202247191,8.501444622792938,29.79293739967897,9.081645337920577,2.5096375601926155,1829,76,355,38,35,583,195,445,0.12,0.8009999999999999,0.079,-0.9453,2,0,1,0,0,0,54.0,0,0,4,2,28,19,2,0,8,1,41,6,0,5,5,74,55,50,0,5,27,0,5,1,1,0,5,2,0,0,38,20,0,3,12,17,3,4,17,6,1,0,4,8,55,13,47,50,11,54,0,1,0,1,9,23,0,10,24,264,93,6,0.0,0.0,0.09083148036094467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250873863800773,0.0,0.0932049712910641,0.0,0.0,0.1488701627412131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06329677465075527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15319184034359998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874505949678111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920320177431671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490003824170948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005851141114338,0.10439578694226832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09447302097933516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15551078473519087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380746437161864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889407805781765,0.08365322215483832,0.09104892515669936,0.0,0.0,0.14119031137356838,0.06649551210223915,0.0,0.0,0.1701446707598452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719124486732274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052898826074601085,0.07807007991883473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16676064147195233,0.09189604315631562,0.0,0.0,0.10490657044305024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236634501674967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023073466476139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045473599256782266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08400724950301541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09376709689918272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13684725306590806,0.0,0.0,0.08989608340708098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597082878459296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990424039324852,0.0,0.0,0.10079526809424423,0.0,0.06452911902627813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914375941335474,0.09469460030126264,0.0,0.08906383940506496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05962866160865641,0.09570050690248884,0.183808168419104,0.0,0.0,0.0794887851727275,0.0,0.07401999631611714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07886536374592609,0.07165660634858298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09920961445766734,0.07433284855570747,0.1556360863399355,0.0,0.0,0.4262118205760947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934890213342917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3710245060635977,0.17892340677696114,0.09144944674108477,0.0,0.21709998323013371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06319439419167462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08368901798435391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945260378241846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05993969439574893

schizophrenia,dcsross,2018/04/20,"Looking for Collaborators for an IF game about psychosis! Greetings,

I am diagnosed SZA Bipolar, and I've recently started to turn my short stories into interactive fiction. The one issue I'm having is that CSS makes my head spin, and I can't do visual art. 

I've already written a very plain looking interactive fiction game, that I'll be happy to link to privately. In addition I have samples of traditional fiction and poetry I've written.

Hopefully there's one or two of you that wants to help make something that will help people understand what it's like to suffer from psychosis.

Looking forward to collaborating with you!

schizophrenia,apoplexydeath,2018/04/20,"Can language development cause schizophrenia or mental health problems? I have an incomplete 2nd language stuck deep in my head. This language was also my 1st language. I would only speak that language then I started preschool and English took over for good. That 2nd language was left undeveloped and forgotten in my brain after 1st grade. Now I can only decode it, but can't encode it. (I can read it and understand it somewhat, but can't speak it or write it.) It's like my personality from my formative years was killed off. I get depressed and angry when I observe people interact with my 2nd language. I also recently took an AncestryDNA test and my largest ethnicity percentage, about half of me, was where that 2nd language comes from. I was only 6% of the ethnicity of where English comes from.

schizophrenia,jrt364,2018/04/20,"The world is different and I think I'm being followed I hope I can post here. I don't have an official schizophrenia Dx, but Drs suspect schizoaffective. The schizoaffective subreddit is inactive, though, and I'm not manic.

Anyway... i woke up this morning feeling that the world is warped and different. I look at people's faces and they're almost unrecognizable, including my own when I look in the mirror. The world feels like it's unnavigated, like I'm living in uncharted territory. Nothing looks the same as it used to.

I'm starting to feel the world is fake, but something is holding me back and telling me, ""no, it has to be real. It HAS to be real."" I'm hanging on by a thread. I don't know if I will soon lose touch with reality.

I feel like I'm being followed, but I keep trying to tell myself that's not true. Yet, I can't stop feeling this way. I'm afraid someone has hired a hitman to come get me and torture me to death. Maybe an ex, maybe a ""friend""... Who knows. But I'm deathly afraid. I want to say it's not true, but these feelings of it being the truth are getting stronger and stronger.",2.8208573469873817,4.669389642533944,4.110116694451062,86.31220528697311,75.65158371040724,7.005572755417957,26.563705644201,7.85451343220497,1.5257728506787331,865,33,177,13,19,284,123,221,0.13,0.7440000000000001,0.126,-0.7153,4,0,1,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,0,1,7,13,1,2,13,0,20,3,1,2,3,42,51,16,2,3,9,1,7,3,1,1,2,1,0,0,12,9,0,3,10,0,0,4,7,5,0,0,1,11,19,8,17,44,2,21,0,1,3,0,6,9,0,3,9,107,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13570992268308066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421129002430747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674382968043576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2831920885179889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4111567435661895,0.19363990313319052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047072137270252,0.0,0.1416137022663347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346081062627471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12046192257980998,0.0,0.0,0.14896332149602767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19863378166774803,0.0,0.11967212646335905,0.0,0.3414236499782072,0.15161916282698984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723085879891304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13004105374195246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09395680973406514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979664636005706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3085169950879699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077758818860904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11483091800875625,0.10433469773763522,0.0,0.0,0.09592614905016957,0.0,0.0,0.11330598009590767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23691176235361044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683972311615229,0.13315381330773465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920134004759734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11705113171228908,0.0,0.0,0.07993687007318394,0.10757439734237173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

schizophrenia,NathalieWilder,2018/04/20,"What is it like to live with schizophrenia? Writer interested in your stories. I am a writer and an aspiring journalist, and recently I had a story idea involving a character with schizophrenia (inspired by a true story of a friend of mine, so the story is personal to me). I would love to get some answers to the following questions:


1) What does authors get right/wrong when portraying schizophrenia?

2) What do you wish was portrayed more/less regarding schizophrenia?

3) How did you feel when you found out you had schizophrenia?


4) After being diagnosed, what happens then? Do you go to therapy or support groups? How often do you see or talk to a doctor? How often do you take medication? I would like to know more about the ""rehabilitation"" process.


Bonus question: would you want to share your story? To accurately portray what it is like living with schizophrenia, I would need to hear stories from people, about how you felt when you were diagnosed, what it is like living with it, what the rehabilitation process is like and so on.
