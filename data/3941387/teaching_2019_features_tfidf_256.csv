teaching,Nakatsukasa,2019/01/01,"First time teaching class of 9-13 Hello, I'm currently a college student and I will be teaching a class group of 10 children of age 9-13 in a STEAM Base program on Game design and Programming. 

I have some experience teaching kids when the college is hosting coder dojo but mainly a 1 to 1 experience. 

What I have planned for the class is prepare some paper base teaching materials for the children while they use computers to carry out the activities I go around them answering their questions and helping them to understand, complete each task, trying to communicate and get involve as much as possible

Is there any tip experienced teachers can provide when teaching children in a computer lab? It is first time receiving such a responsibility and I can't help but prepare as much as I could, any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!",9.250539215686274,9.01540218300654,9.298815359477127,62.45841911764707,59.84967320261438,11.833006535947714,44.61519607843137,11.20814326018867,5.365445098039214,686,39,107,16,8,226,96,153,0.02,0.902,0.078,0.8592,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,4,4,5,1,0,0,10,0,13,0,0,1,0,18,19,14,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,2,8,0,0,3,1,0,3,1,0,0,2,0,1,10,1,19,14,6,18,0,0,0,0,16,6,0,3,9,74,12,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19889312761757524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2768230639189183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811902869310175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2134037352117648,0.0,0.0,0.16250701914357765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3981947353158074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3462554163972671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633921499477672,0.0,0.11567425980614572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27285192363817384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29924491486028865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22945637819850034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280070206880693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873887009119422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23736708096940265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13818765584156453,0.0,0.0,0.21188826493593726,0.0,0.17578984605777154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14458621030989344,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,zdnewcomb,2019/01/01,"How do I get my 6th graders to care about poetry/ other difficulties First year teacher here ! I am 23 years old and am currently teaching at the school I attended as a kid. I feel like I am forming good relationships with my students but I feel as if they view me as more of a friend than an authoritative figure. I’m a really positive person for the most part but some days I can’t help but leave my classroom defeated as I feel like my students aren’t learning anything and look at me as the pushover where they can get away with things because I’m new to the position. With that being said, we have started a new unit in poetry which I thoroughly enjoy. I’ve implemented the use of hip hop music that I found appropriate in order to find SOMETHING the kids will resonate with. I’ve used “can I kick it” by a tribe called quest to illustrate the use of rhyme, rhyme scheme alliteration and other poetic devices. I’ve used Tupac shakur’s “the rose that grew from concrete” to illustrate symbolism and imagery. Most of my students are like the rose in shakur’s work so I thought they’d dig that. Where I’m asking for help is how to take these lessons a step further? Are there any other songs and or poems that you guys could send my way for evaluation to see if I can use them? Are there any ways that you guys taught poetry that the children really enjoyed ?? How can I be assured that what I am saying is effective ? How do I gauge their understanding ? Again this is my first real year teaching so ANY advice at all would be so greatly appreciated !",4.6134659090909125,5.944905950657892,5.441854066985649,80.65888755980863,70.08552631578948,8.816746411483255,28.949760765550238,9.218907990703514,2.3861565789473684,1235,46,242,25,22,403,170,304,0.022,0.809,0.16899999999999998,0.994,2,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,1,2,5,7,14,11,0,0,17,0,26,1,1,10,2,44,50,23,0,4,6,0,3,3,1,2,0,3,0,6,17,10,0,0,11,1,0,4,2,1,0,2,4,9,33,10,34,39,7,29,0,1,3,0,23,10,0,6,15,159,50,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11104657152564393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23183494977156535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093515093008109,0.0,0.10623698703632033,0.0,0.10676744275265157,0.0,0.0,0.06927318976953455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11603797406030793,0.0,0.1158623838285565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907313769002839,0.0,0.0,0.07328765880052801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723776549759914,0.1623672379655571,0.0,0.0,0.10386385250841948,0.1933222998887723,0.0,0.12459913634130985,0.08779709560292749,0.0,0.11874322039526147,0.0,0.0,0.09531487797764214,0.0,0.1252872361398263,0.0,0.2250406606403135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523394549481588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12032713671761013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665546097379643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542801548320393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21950622388300364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924485966060315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12305980330896032,0.0,0.0,0.09922506281004577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12934589293667362,0.14559991769210506,0.0,0.0,0.12200559950780054,0.0,0.0,0.1080965718303333,0.09037017669395428,0.0,0.11500858569055596,0.09055545262717933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748474060110922,0.0,0.0,0.0804341647456584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08544227460362963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754966041598629,0.0,0.0,0.09021655535829733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11830205321570884,0.0,0.4907374112812558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804024634351972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273043810382859,0.0,0.0,0.0807257804084157,0.0,0.0,0.2195390857786088
teaching,PhasmaUrbomach,2019/01/01,"Am I crazy? (Teaching related, I swear) I just had my students write a three + paragraph piece of structured creative writing. They are all over the place in terms of literacy development, and creative writing often lets kids shine who struggle with informational writing. It's a fun assignment and I often get great stories from unexpected places. However, it's also a slog. And this is where I start to question my sanity.

I have ~100 students. They've all (or most of them) have written about a page of writing over the course of 8 or so days. They all want my feedback, but I am one human, so some of them have written these things with only verbal feedback from me. I said I was going to grade them over break, but this is what always happens to me....

I started reading them and most of them need some good, constructive criticism and revision. I feel this is my job. If they are to become better writers, they need to write, get constructive crit from me and their peers, then revise. But oh my god, is this time consuming. I have to cycle through 100 Google docs, leave comments, help correct mechanical errors, etc. It takes me 5-10 minutes per student, unless the kid wrote nothing (!!! this has happened and these kids needs a head's up or they will fail), or their piece is perfect (has happened, maybe 5/100 times).

This commenting process has already taken me 4 or 5 hours and I'm only halfway through. I need to finish them by tomorrow so that they can revise and submit by the end of the week. The process is arduous. I keep seeing the same errors over and over: comma splice run-ons, plain old run-ons, good ideas that lack development, etc. I know these kids can do better if they get the benefit of my comments (and their peers'-- they did peer reviews and many of the kids gave comments that are helpful and with which I agree).

Am I wasting my time with this? Or is this worthwhile? I will have devoted ~10 hours over break just doing this. I also graded another project (about 5 hours). I need to create a mini-lesson too. We have a new unit coming up in February that I was supposed to plan over break, but all the grading and trying to rest and do holidays, it didn't get done.

Please either affirm that this is worth my effort, that I am really helping them be better writers, or that I am daft, wasting my time, and should just grade what they have. I really hate doing that, though. It feels lazy on my part. However, this commenting has eaten so much of my time, and it happens every year with this assignment. My fellow grade level department co-worker has told me flat-out that I am nuts to devote this much time to revision. Maybe she is right.

I appreciate your thoughts and if I am crazy, what should I do differently? I am a veteran teacher of 20 years, and this sort of stuff is really killing my soul. At the same time, when their finished products are magnificent, I feel really good about it. It's the fact that I have 4 more hours to do this on New Years Day, after working on it regularly for several days, is making me want to cry.

Happy New Year, my fellow educators.

teaching,southernbelleteach,2019/01/01,"Starting My 1st Year Next Monday and Need Help! Some background: I graduated in May. License was approved in mid-late August, by which time positions in my county and the nearby counties had been filled. I am a birth though 9th grade certified teacher with a focus on history and language arts in middle grades. I have been subbing since the start of school, and in the beginning of December I was offered a 2 week subbing position at a school I have been subbing for the most (and LOVE), and the week before Christmas break I interviewed and was offered the position for a 4th/5th class as the teacher resigned.

The situation: The teacher resigned due to a scandal, so the students have not had much in the way of education this year. This class consists of 31 students, 1 of whom is the former teacher's child. I do have a TA to help and she has her own classroom immediately next to mine. We split the class so I can teach each grade level individually (4th stays with me while 5th does AM with her, for example) in 45 minute increments.  The students have had practically NO social studies, are behind in math, and their reading scores are low. Many are on IEPs and 504s. The school is rural with a majority of low income families, so on Fridays many of the students are sent home with book bags of food.

What I am thinking: I would like to have STEM (or even STEAM) oriented lessons and stay away from worksheets, and I am not planning on sending homework home as most of the students are unable to receive help with the work at home, or their home life is too distracting. I have very few supplies to do much of this. 

The previous teacher is coming in on Thursday to show me the student contracts, important information, and tasks I'll need to perform daily, then collect her stuff and leave. This Friday I am planning on moving all of my stuff I  and rearranging the room (it currently invites chaos and this group needs much more structure).

I am looking for advice on growth techniques, references to excellent materials and/or ideas, and where to find high quality materials for low costs so these students can have a more hands-on education. I am also curious on grants for classroom and school materials/supplies, as well as ANY other advice which you care to share.",7.662714285714286,7.90385074761905,7.361666666666667,73.45250000000003,62.95238095238096,10.142857142857146,37.73809523809524,9.827888789773867,3.743738095238093,1814,85,315,33,24,574,221,420,0.055,0.865,0.079,0.8823,2,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,1,1,2,7,10,12,0,1,30,0,40,3,0,0,1,47,52,32,0,4,4,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,6,1,14,27,1,0,7,4,1,7,3,6,1,0,10,1,30,6,61,40,13,58,0,5,1,1,24,28,0,6,20,222,44,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19597282127343435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018893292724201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818963214010125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421054918185907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08532563030436226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223583639907467,0.0,0.0,0.08637701201776309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08775029047345159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06622990852421155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09452922781543442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09164844949626556,0.0,0.12125149406482093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20163427177862267,0.10594479003670562,0.4023312455747923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11319693077568875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10617549076181423,0.0,0.0,0.0708263603649565,0.04898872055512178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420474925896188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905010321982334,0.0,0.0,0.2033238178490824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10657519534157872,0.2211383731027819,0.2230552878247675,0.0,0.0,0.2132846778055453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030094964244614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4059298130287788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08294753524459418,0.11271196838378973,0.0,0.10221652572051057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14194864348728467,0.2137570880019204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295790537448811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06425141121167224,0.09851851325912617,0.0,0.058470467396510274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273639817587221,0.0,0.07959268628997901,0.16086721053451172,0.0,0.09015820129867104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07300053093782585,0.0,0.0,0.07123164055759992,0.0,0.0,0.12914609737977978
teaching,ItsSaturdaySunday,2019/01/01,"Best way to teach art to children below 10 I'm a part-time art instructor for adults, often at an atelier-setting. People who attend my classes come out with polished works by the end of a series of sessions. Since teens/adults know my style and profile, they come to my classes in order to learn my technique and ask questions on how to translate their vision.

I would often get asked if I teach children because the adults are impressed with their final work. They also want their children to undergo the same training so they can have finished works themselves. Some parents tell me that they're unimpressed with kid's art classes because their children's work come out looking very amateurish or scribbly. They feel that the best way to learn art is to go through what they went through (ie. ""My child was able to complete a masterpiece, therefore he learned a lot and was able to level up his skills in art."")

I've always been reluctant to accept. I'm aware that creative freedom, playing and exploration is important for children's development and instructing them to copy an image to the dot in order to create a ""masterpiece"" would come off as a struggle for them (unless you're trying to teach kids patience and diligence?). I feel that you run the risk of losing their engagement halfway, only to find value in the finished work instead of the process.

\- Is there a good way to teach art to children, that doesn't impede creative freedom, and at the same time make them create ""decent"" enough works that make parents feel that they're getting their money's worth?

\- Or is there a way to explain to parents that this isn't a good method to teach children. Although I've tried and often get disagreed upon. Some parents are *so* fixated with output. I think kid's art teachers are already doing a good job.",7.337946428571428,7.864904044642856,6.4495000000000005,78.74550000000002,63.61309523809525,8.14857142857143,36.44285714285714,7.554174236665415,2.788335,1453,66,245,12,20,441,170,336,0.039,0.787,0.174,0.9928,5,0,1,0,0,0,43.0,0,1,14,10,10,13,0,2,21,0,17,0,0,4,0,50,40,18,0,4,4,4,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,13,11,18,0,0,13,8,2,9,2,4,0,0,4,4,26,9,50,34,8,34,0,1,1,0,40,14,0,10,5,155,37,20,0.18951268724220224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456598145163483,0.07577661375927054,0.07884486866517852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1771687802391706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11552517514967844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988818732570315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32649679891806105,0.09935022347184433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392599527544742,0.09790863292787297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14373496333317504,0.0,0.0,0.10380094278343133,0.08660558141378158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14851883585450665,0.0,0.05385221374066743,0.2384313760353205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09403104990026466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052075608361687134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795714636467608,0.1060081107780044,0.0,0.08055845482774593,0.0,0.0,0.1265011903243037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07206646920822271,0.0,0.0,0.42086282373598943,0.10261188620337544,0.0,0.06569211773054086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10614879086362072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07838342662841162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990599041607016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282122087974994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060716038898940464,0.0,0.0,0.05525318597579409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286666746979495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07818390717450735,0.05588974651993378,0.30085270008672577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08784007985994435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4139024801926043,0.0,0.0,0.13462437563223195,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,eyecu2018,2019/01/02,"Cheaters The most unnerving piece of my current dilemma is that the homework my students (11th graders) were copying from each other is all completely voluntary, part of our college access curriculum delivered outside of school. I feel like I'm beating a dead horse explaining why they should struggle through the material. I don't send report cards home, only the individual students and I will see their actual homework completion number. For context, these students are highly motivated and underserved, and the work is designed to prep them for the SAT and college-level work.

How do I hold them accountable without making them accountable to me? In other words, how do I help them prioritize their own learning over some devised persona of accomplishment?

teaching,Astro551,2019/01/02,"Thoughts on ""New Maths"" for multiplication| Common Core Area Model Have you used the Area Model to teach multiplication? (youtu.be/K-jut8xn-z0?t=16) This video from a Common Core classroom in the US has made its way down under so I thought I'd give my thoughts.

Even though many of the comments are something along the lines of ""how come it takes so long"" and ""old math is way easier"" I certainly think there's value in using the area model.

It helps promote mathematical thinking and does have some links to setting up students to have a much better understanding of expanding binomial products (which they often struggle with).

At the end of the day, I don't think the goal is to use this method in a test or exam - but should maths only be about performance on an exam? Many students struggle to grasp concepts thus leading to negative feelings towards maths, if using something like the area model can promote understanding (not just in multiplication but in all topic areas), then isn't that worth it?

What do other educators think?

teaching,jarfIy,2019/01/02,"How should you deal with a student jokingly writing that you are ""sexy"" in an assignment? Over the Christmas break I've been grading journals kept by my high school students. In one, my resident class clown has written that I am the ""sexiest teacher he's ever had.""   


For what it's worth, I'm a guy, and the student is straight, so the comment is clearly not flirtatious; this particular student simply relishes any opportunity to cross the line. While I'm not too perturbed by the comment itself because I know the student, I'm apprehensive that if I say nothing he will assume I'm just permissive about this sort of thing and do something still more inappropriate.

teaching,lamekittenx,2019/01/02,"career change + wanting to move out of state I am looking to make a career change. I graduated with a BS Aerospace Engineering in May 2018, and have been working full-time for 6 months. I have always planned on going into secondary education for mathematics after a little bit of experience in the engineering field. I would like to get my Master's in education along with the teaching certification.

I am currently in Texas but I would like to move somewhere further north/northwest. I'm trying to figure out the best route: should I get fully certified in Texas and then transfer, or start out trying to get certified in another state? (If that's even possible?) My plan was to take online classes and then get a probationary certificate and complete an internship. 

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated! Tha ks!

Hi all!

I teach elementary school and thought I'd try to teach the ideas of syllables and rhyme through poetry. My major desire is to teach it through the traditional styles of other countries as a tie into the international flavor of my classroom. I found the article below (sorry, on mobile site so cannot imbed link in text) of some traditional styles from around the world but I was wondering if any of you could help add to this as some of these may be too difficult.

teaching,throwaway3936754,2019/01/02,"Thinking about a career change - school counseling?  

TL;DR - I may want to become a guidance counselor. Has anyone pivoted from working in business to this type of career?

Hey all - I'm 30 (almost 31) and really thinking I need a change. I have a bachelors in Finance and Marketing and have worked in general Account Manager type roles since graduation. Lately I have had a lot of anxiety, particularly around work. I started this role 6 months ago (after 5 years at a company I really liked and excelled at) and I think the change stirred up a lot of uneasiness and questions about what I'm doing with my life.

I'm a very caring person and really enjoy talking to people about problems - it's weird to say but I am frequently complimented on this. I want to move into a role/career where I am directly helping people, right now I'm working for a large e-commerce company and I just do not feel remotely fulfilled. I didn't use to feel this way, but lately it is unshakable. I do not want my career to define me, but at the same time I am having a lot of trouble considering my job just a job that pays the bills.

One thought I had is becoming a guidance counselor, however I have no education background or related experience. Has anybody made a similar career change? I'm incredibly nervous about economic instability or making the wrong choice, but at the same time I feel a growing desire to actually make a difference in the lives of others. I know this got rambly but any thoughts folks have on this type of career change, degree programs, what jobs are like after graduation, etc. would be much appreciated!",4.917012735326692,6.9026980365448525,6.393608803986712,71.56168673864894,70.29568106312293,9.534939091915836,32.14299557032115,9.928628108626363,3.625122812846069,1283,59,214,34,24,436,168,301,0.079,0.8059999999999999,0.115,0.8596,4,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,0,5,9,11,0,1,22,0,23,1,0,4,1,52,48,15,0,7,11,0,3,2,0,2,1,1,0,1,12,11,0,0,10,0,4,2,4,5,0,1,7,4,22,6,36,38,8,30,0,0,0,0,8,15,0,8,14,146,34,24,0.0,0.0,0.09272463399962323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0842284256689205,0.0,0.09514759437549948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0646160366375743,0.0,0.07268911551454882,0.0,0.0,0.06643934840050222,0.0,0.0,0.08458686969909739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2098815802029468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687799073124392,0.0,0.5025864124806065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992744135282728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597106974407523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929466108849647,0.0,0.0,0.14413306812112836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759952077935809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06368909311545255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28287446714047915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052219842920514084,0.0,0.21437067135840815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06711458256359606,0.09284276400593992,0.0,0.08390333382902114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24234473620393815,0.0,0.0899090780929677,0.1268515624841599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584309294218755,0.10098993807004666,0.0698497448459849,0.07045523001051568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438719231012968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13174813226103707,0.08296674380049712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09092015101613148,0.0,0.0,0.1064427926910001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182614413028792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08114552887310425,0.0,0.07556275687450484,0.0,0.09616408993474412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07860052632853556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06725478977055778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07637250545957626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18265261494618326,0.0,0.1508686136949953,0.11081244303375977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206572799663488,0.0,0.0784004542627403,0.16813363545564558,0.07542149403049417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27669924788269595,0.0,0.0,0.06749862334742851,0.10388813234112436,0.0,0.06118898649245006

teaching,HGHLLL,2019/01/03,"Looking for help for ideas on a 6th grade unit about Beliefs and Values  Help!

I work at an International Baccalaureate school and I teach 6th grade. My topic for next unit is Beliefs and Values. I teach in China so I have to steer clear of anything religious but I have some ideas of how I want to go with the unit. 

I’m interested in them learning about other beliefs and values that are in a culture, such as superstitions, views on death, roles of the family etc.

I really want to come up with an exciting project for the students to do at the end of the 6 weeks. I don’t want to give them another research project because research projects tend to be very hard for them. English is their second language and a lot of resources are blocked here in China. 

They are hard workers and their speaking/listening skills are pretty good but they have a hard time self monitoring themselves. It is a struggle to get them to write a lot but I want to encourage them. Getting resources in not really an issue for the most part. I also have a lot of leeway on the interpretation of beliefs and values and can interpret it any way I think will interest the kids. We have two 40 minute classes a day for 6 weeks. 

Basically, I want help thinking of general ideas for a final project for a unit about beliefs and values. It needs to be something that 6th grade students will be interested in and something that I can give them more scaffolding (or direct guidance for some of the lower ones) on as they are not very independent learners yet. Please help me help my students feel successful and create something they can be proud of! 

TLDR; I’m hoping to come up with a fun project that my 6th grade Chinese students can do on the topic of Beliefs and Values.

teaching,HibTree,2019/01/03,"Extremely nervous to start substitute teaching. Any advice? Hi, teachers! I think you guys are amazing. My mom has been a teacher for my whole life and I know it’s one of the hardest jobs. I also know it can be very rewarding. I want to go into teaching science in middle school. It’ll be a career change for me as I’ve spent the last five years working in healthcare. There’s a teaching program I’m applying for in the spring, but until then I’ve been hired as a sub to get some experience. The only thing is I’m really nervous to start. I need to sub for at least five days before January 25th and I’m having trouble looking past my anxiety to just take that first call. I know the first day will be difficult because it’s a brand new job. I’m nervous that I won’t be able to manage the class well, especially students who behave badly or don’t take me seriously because I’m a sub and I might seem new. I don’t want the class to erupt into chaos. I’m also worried if there are no plans for me to follow. I know it’ll be much less daunting once I get my first day over with. Does anyone have any tips or advice for me? Thank you so much.",1.4756777493606137,3.4758306890756323,3.3691815856777514,89.33783887468032,80.34453781512605,5.987869930580929,23.37303617099013,7.079830092131019,0.8420892948483738,896,31,189,11,23,301,134,238,0.145,0.797,0.058,-0.9699,2,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,2,0,6,7,11,0,3,13,0,21,1,0,0,0,22,47,14,0,4,5,1,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,1,9,6,0,0,6,0,1,2,4,7,1,6,3,1,21,4,27,34,6,26,0,0,1,0,7,8,0,6,16,117,30,14,0.12240901214740328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392333399235501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1957808855782408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16648465168823964,0.0,0.09364255924456354,0.0,0.0,0.08559122744476061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220641211522853,0.14923879529136638,0.0,0.10416105348768466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124993287550526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949250399616713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368310585704893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10712095142996872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11973950232802914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3123631295997252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12790731320271567,0.0,0.0695678625201612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12120416714340387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24294411307173705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26909116721593895,0.09977968261334896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08646110534427658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279274070632204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298566177526082,0.0,0.14336395558682624,0.0,0.0,0.17996941697959207,0.09076473146833852,0.0,0.2364467734215939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303616029390051,0.08294751460121473,0.09309756969944262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11685325296312868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841834764352104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12388445539843496,0.0,0.11143656729802001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1732834576673198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18407268629064416,0.0,0.0,0.1126977722158806,0.0,0.0,0.08132310848462034,0.07843475232477788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010002547304337,0.14440001374536707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100604026518888,0.0,0.0,0.13666529058473456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911521872760797,0.12431229371053715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882739048581773

I can't download apps on to the iPads so I hope there is something good from the web.,3.157599999999998,4.724433493333333,4.2316666666666665,86.98750000000004,74.06666666666666,6.6000000000000005,25.833333333333336,7.1686216300943375,1.1459333333333337,292,10,59,3,6,95,54,75,0.0,0.831,0.16899999999999998,0.9302,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,2,2,3,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,1,0,6,10,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,2,1,7,3,12,7,0,9,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,1,4,34,7,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17362092961688866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1785201017068845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4939653972206348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13338999359916814,0.0,0.0,0.4282872208121633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535824449955426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2713562737996452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17300603327016062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2428601982756328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19655166753878156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420059434955215,0.2439615776639018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22050761275223515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24611167785928945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,LilCasket,2019/01/03,"A feeling of a family member is an utter insult to the teaching profession I feel 2nd degree insult as someone who is not a teacher or coach when I hear my mother talk about her bad luck as a teacher. I can't explain it but it's nagging me and I hope you wonderful folks can help me navigate this nagging and insulted feeling as teachers (I'm no teacher by any stretch of the definition).

It's never easy to change careers with no related experience later in life, that is late 50s or early 60s. I don't doubt it's particularly difficult to teach grade school kids at that stage of life where energy and patience is valued and needed as well.  Teaching is  a huge undertaking and can't be undervalued in its importance. 

Why would my mom want to teach in her working twilight years? I know her well enough to know:

1) She feeds off the feeling of being so important
2) all summer break off! (I know well enough that you guys don't really get off over the summer but she does think so.)
3) low effort appeal of teaching as ""easy"": death by work sheets - heavy reliance on work sheets. What is a lesson plan? It's out the window.

So it would be no surprise that she can't find stable work, stay in something even part-time or temporary for very long. She blames organizational, leadership and institutional things fot her misfortune.

My sister and brother-in-law teach also (different schools and levels). They reported to me that she doesn't take initiative or think critically enough to solve her own day to day issues, tech issues, or comply to systems of classroom management. She complains to them non-stop. I feel must step in.

I try as much as I can, being outside the realm of the profession by saying frankly ""you probably aren't a good teacher. Why don't you try xyz career again""

She responds by saying she wasn't good at xyz career and she is a good teacher but she needs a teaching job where the expectation is that you aren't a great teacher and that she is just normal...well don't we all wish for that in every sector of the workforce?

My brain broke. I need some help here.",4.605847808105871,6.114271193548388,5.431133995037223,80.05029073614561,70.31513647642679,8.251745244003308,28.56980976013234,8.745826893841286,2.2194156162117453,1653,61,309,29,30,539,212,403,0.161,0.715,0.124,-0.9672,2,0,1,0,0,0,50.0,1,5,2,8,15,21,5,1,20,0,29,4,1,0,4,54,51,30,1,10,10,3,5,0,0,3,2,3,1,2,19,13,1,0,14,1,0,1,16,11,3,0,1,8,42,10,47,43,8,37,0,2,0,0,43,20,0,10,12,202,61,23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07859716180092564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06683605024803105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820624943685055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971672608658767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397075545484118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12676926367605212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10268518522940684,0.0,0.0,0.08600842443779493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30465892900887315,0.0,0.06491522765443285,0.0,0.082807963739859,0.0,0.0,0.0961399782276231,0.09265279811451653,0.0,0.2484750815389393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898292039924978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05134899539157477,0.0,0.0,0.2473062401574096,0.0,0.10835774353689014,0.0,0.09731597145227447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107724817286034,0.0,0.1317545194420242,0.0,0.0,0.09761754572527083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205164571210236,0.0975310623776435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16204188125724028,0.0,0.11086790298650996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13884087746687054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697767451487336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11510827505349512,0.0,0.0,0.07224957300497238,0.21862758248226344,0.07580218072874438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09629681830491124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643129354191012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596607751385632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06296283255329263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15631773405326424,0.0,0.1989360004540202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08327516596596551,0.0756633267483579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10475697716931497,0.0,0.08216928385701491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389684986247055,0.07899643614935102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0652950924891548,0.12595200805386994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13345589025327215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08109405920334516,0.05797006797103733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2651056128249614,0.0,0.17737087797928924,0.0,0.11302100539729293,0.0,0.10658410372693143,0.2862058058250865,0.0,0.0,0.13963534801818234,0.0,0.0,0.06329125691775038

teaching,krimsonic_,2019/01/03,"ELA Question about teaching in workshop style with doing skills-based practice or using questions to practice skills. Confused on which is more effective? Hello all! This is my second go around in teaching 6th grade ELA. I’m always looking for ways to improve but I’m kind of hitting a snag here. I’ve been reading about workshop model lately but I’m not sure exactly how it meshes with the way I taught before and need help making it make sense. 


So during my first year, working with my academic instructor, this is usually how a reading lesson would go. Kids would come in and for a Do Now would complete a vocabulary exercise that contained words from the days reading. For the direct instruction I would model a certain reading skill or do a PowerPoint presentation over a particular skill and do quick “Check for Understandings” right after. After that, the kids would either start or continue reading the days text and answer questions based off the skill I just modeled. This would take place during guided and independent practice. They would then take an exit ticket (a new short passage with questions similar the ones worked on in class). 

To me, I never quite understood how using this method that everything was aligned. So far, I would teach kids a natural reading skill like making an inference, and then they would answer questions that ask them to make inferences. I feel like by having them practice these questions I’m not truly assessing them on their ability to naturally make inferences on their own while reading. Rather, I’m assessing their ability to answer inference questions. The connection or alignment is there I suppose, but isn’t there a subtle difference between the two?

Contrast to the way I’ve been reading up on now, I could teach the same inference lesson really highlighting my own thinking processes I have as i  read and then kids independently read and make their own inferences in the text. I would then make adjustments to my teaching based on their responses. This compared to just reviewing commonly missed questions. That seems more content that skills-based. 

I’m not trying to say never use questions in the ELA classroom. I’m just really confused on why I’ve been taught to teach this way but it doesn’t seem to completely add up in my head...

Is there anyone that could help make this connection clear; are questions good to go in teaching and practicing skills and my thinking is just off or I’m way overthinking the subject? Or I am right in thinking there is a subtle, yet important disconnect? Is the workshop model more effective in actually teaching and having kids practice with skills-based work? 

Please let me know if I explained my thinking too poorly.

I’m wondering if taking the test would give me a leg up?",0.7407881773398977,3.1339539655172466,3.5103940886699547,84.65258620689656,86.93103448275862,6.762561576354681,25.52709359605912,7.957251820313856,1.8212334975369464,222,10,46,5,7,78,46,58,0.068,0.932,0.0,-0.4948,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,0,3,1,1,0,0,8,11,2,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,6,7,0,6,0,0,1,0,3,4,0,3,2,20,2,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20468016484756094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3232918253159825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2863412735970311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28080854641958525,0.0,0.0,0.23411896764925536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24581532174522525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29625338378710403,0.0,0.26648589634172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.440185622974247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31744783563513146,0.2131073265816309,0.0,0.0,0.2079434805780043,0.0,0.0,0.18850533823169147

teaching,xianquo,2019/01/04,"Getting the sinking feeling that this isn't the career for me - change my mind? I'm a teacher training student from Scotland, and halfway through my PGDE programme teaching English to high school kids. My first placement was in a really difficult school just outside Glasgow (the biggest city in the country), where the pupils were either really aggressive, or simply didn't want to learn anything, and my confidence has been absolutely destroyed by it. 

The department said that I did well, and that they've seen experienced teachers struggle to do any better than I did, which shocked me, as I thought I'd really not done very well at all.

So my question is this; is this what the career is going to be? Is it going to be a non-stop horrible struggle for the next 40-odd years until I reach retirement age? I need some ""light at the end of the tunnel"" stuff here. At the moment, as a job, it just feels over-worked, over-stressed, and vastly under-valued and under-resourced. 

I've wanted to be a teacher all my life, and perhaps I'm guilty of having a bit of an unrealistically romantic view of what teaching is. I'm feeling quite depressed and stressed about it now, and dreading going to my next placement in a couple of weeks time.

Can anyone weigh in with positives that I can look at?

teaching,hammnbubbly,2019/01/05,"Do you check your work email at night/on the weekend? Just wondering if anyone else checks work email at night and/or on the weekend? I tell myself I won’t, or I shouldn’t, but I always end up checking it anyway. Many of my colleagues don’t because, as they say, they’re not on call, and they’re happy to check email during work hours, but not outside of that window. Today, I got an email from a student telling me I “need to send” him directions for something he missed last week (he was out, and my policy, which I’ve shared and is posted on my website, is that if you’re out, you can check my site and complete the assignment(s), or wait until you come back, I’ll explain the work, and give you as much time as the other students had). I was just kind of taken aback by the entitlement of the student. I reminded myself that they’re high school freshmen, so I shouldn’t be too upset, but it also made me think about the outlook my colleagues have. When I get emails like the one I got today, it occurs to me that maybe avoiding email on nights and weekends isn’t a terrible idea.",9.031454173067075,5.949556036866362,8.386605222734259,77.87927291346648,62.364055299539174,10.934767025089602,35.63184843830005,8.167268648758528,2.637714183307732,848,25,175,7,9,268,125,217,0.066,0.88,0.054000000000000006,-0.3421,0,1,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,5,1,4,9,8,0,2,12,0,14,0,0,1,0,30,27,20,0,5,11,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,1,0,9,9,0,2,4,3,5,2,7,4,0,1,7,1,28,4,24,16,1,29,0,1,0,0,23,11,0,5,16,112,37,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11121205422936896,0.11571511809112164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09723907622576296,0.1424908634125978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693415484082107,0.0,0.08477412361298331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14200324237292286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11979414856918355,0.1458093980756555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617286840268848,0.0,0.12317233345208625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07265691443891521,0.13340600771196387,0.0,0.0,0.22244961702173616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14803970638011932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14693221751150756,0.0,0.0,0.13695325863875216,0.0,0.0,0.15699003271993034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14481717272590092,0.0,0.11335839493228116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06794124884972436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315888236195296,0.0,0.14099239528022608,0.13971177549823507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223045269025363,0.10311662661406247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3915156671251877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09423558857419848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13318801328002147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105918834612356,0.0,0.14074351263919116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706078698905054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431018661531164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910869825976295,0.0,0.0,0.08109124979649357,0.0,0.26363904301698243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155138426598056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508125338379405,0.40497054688563705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,vegansnacktivist,2019/01/06,"What's the best route for me to transition from teaching in a private school without a certificate to a public school? Hello teachers,

&amp;#x200B;

I need help finding the best route to transition from teaching in a private school without a certificate to earning a certificate and teaching in a public school. Some of this seems too good to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: Bachelor's in Archaeology with electives in anthropology, biology and astrophysics. Three years experience teaching in private schools without a certificate from elementary school to middle school. Very happy and comfortable. Learning pedagogy on the job. Several years experience private tutoring while a teenager.

&amp;#x200B;

Aim: To teach in a public school. In order of preference: biology for high school, biology for middle school, elementary school. I don't know which state because I move every 3-4 years so not sure. I need extensive certificate reciprocity.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideal Program: cheap, fast, no practicum because I already have experience, has extensive certificate reciprocity.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What's the catch with doing a program like this: [https://www.americanboard.org/](https://www.americanboard.org/)
2. Why does it matter which program you get your certificate from if you're already a private school teacher with experience? My understanding is that you get your certificate from the state, so employers only see which state from which you got your certificate, and employers don't see which program you got it from. My understanding is also that a better program is more beneficial for inexperienced teachers.
3. Can you ""reciprocity hop""? This isn't factual but for example: my program gives me a teaching certificate for D.C. I want to teach in Alaska, but D.C. and Alaska don't have reciprocity. However, D.C. and Colorado do, then Colorado and Alaska do. So can I get my certificate for D.C., use state reciprocity for Colorado, then use state reciprocity from Colorado to Alaska?
4. Right now, it seems to me that the only way I can become a biology teacher for upper grades is by getting a master's in biology with a secondary teaching certification in biology. What other routes are available to me?
5. Do you have any other advice for me?

Thank you for your time.

teaching,ohjustmee,2019/01/06,"What is a typical day like for an elementary reading/literacy teacher? What is Fundations like in grades 2-5? I have an interview to LTS for a reading/literacy teacher tomorrow for grades 2-5. They just want you to have your elementary license, which I do. They do prefer your familiar with Fundations and I’ve taught lessons while subbing. They also preferred a masters in trading, but mine is in elementary. 

I really want to do well. I think they chose candidates to do demo lessons after the interviews tomorrow. I’m afraid I just don’t know enough about being a teacher specifically for reading though. Do you usually pull out a few kids to work 1:1 or in small groups? Are the lessons usually reinforcing the lessons taught in the classroom? Like if a classroom were working on words with glued letter sounds, would I be doing like intervention lessons on the same topic with kids in that class who see me? I’m just trying to get a better idea so I sound more confident in the interview. 

Also, what is Fundations like at grades 2-5? I’ve mostly used it in k and 1st as a sub. I may have been an aide somewhere where it was used in second and third. They would do a lot of word sort activities- does this sound like Fundations? 

Thanks for any help!! I’ve been watching YouTube videos that use Fundations but they mostly just focus on k-1 and I already have a good idea of what it’s like in those grades. I’m not Wilson certified or anything, but I do think I would catch on quick to fulfill the position successfully. I’m really bored with daily subbing and would actually enjoying need to come in early and stay late to go over lessons Lol...",4.318461538461534,6.354784961783441,5.166496815286628,79.5317001469868,71.99363057324841,8.907202351788339,30.22978931896129,9.466822959209583,2.9296437040666343,1314,57,244,32,26,427,161,314,0.01,0.799,0.191,0.9955,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,4,6,11,12,15,0,1,20,1,29,0,0,3,0,54,49,18,0,10,11,0,0,7,0,5,0,3,0,2,13,12,0,0,13,2,1,4,2,2,1,2,6,5,23,13,41,36,7,35,0,0,2,0,19,20,0,8,17,160,36,17,0.0,0.0,0.12263629461174748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13868053848042106,0.20099733114864246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08546025973811049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341612615933657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111453581577692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082540211871711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08104708581940466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997511469996148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12985123601215934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06565765731472582,0.0,0.07142144984669609,0.1054064657235904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423429729464768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837334299082761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906522856704253,0.0,0.1417618149290008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4297738609285511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10684057797353383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09318309462988164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12570452339163854,0.0,0.16101549998490708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10014312997043318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13394804817229164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157005259981681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16104918353007264,0.12347064308601945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085322030568087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32561692708855805,0.2768166357162335,0.0,0.14824745171073947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11299288555589848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18297926353815067,0.0,0.0,0.3570909132412971,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,chan2paj,2019/01/06,"What are your teaching strategies? I'm currently working as a part-time instructor and I'm teaching college students. In my first semester, I only did well by having a majority of the class passing the subject but I felt like I haven't been effective enough. I don't think I've motivated the class well on the topics we've discussed. Sure, most of them passed but what I'm more worried was the retention of the lessons we've had.

My current teaching strategy is old school. Lecture then a quiz or an activity (focused on rote learning). It's pretty basic and gets repetitive TBH and I feel I'm just making the class mundane when I wanted it to be interactive and that just defeats the purpose on getting the students to learn something. Any suggestions, guys? Feel free to suggest, I'd appreciate to have something new of a strategy for a change.

I'm about to launch my Romeo and Juliet unit and am looking for a short video (5-10 minutes) that is an example of tragedy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking for a video that explains what tragedy is. I'm looking for something I can show after teaching the concepts / vocab associated with tragedy that students can watch and practice identifying the elements of tragedy with.

&amp;#x200B;

Short stories could work as well!

I'm a history teacher teaching World War II and I plan to show video clips that may be considered graphic. More specifically, clips from HBO's Band of Brothers and The Pacific. My intention is to focus on the human element of the war as well as its cost. I feel like these videos do a much better job conveying that than anything the textbooks have to offer. As an example of a video to show, i included a link at the end of this post. I guess my question is if you guys believe that clips like these are appropriate for a sophomore classroom and if I need to do anything to cover my ass just in case.

teaching,FindingAlaska,2019/01/07,"Class sizes Hi everyone, I hope it's ok to post this here :)

I'm currently preparing to interview a freshly graduated teacher before he goes into his first year of teaching. I've chatted to him a few times and I know this will come up in the interview: class sizes. 

He strongly believes no class is too large and larger class sizes help students learn better. In my brief research, it seems that smaller class sizes are more effective environments, and I have some papers to back this up, but I have a feeling it will come down to ""I have an education degree, I know more than you"". He's said he would choose a class of 35 kids over a class of 15 any day, and the kids from the 35 cohort would have more advantages than the kids in the smaller class. 

Like I mentioned, most of the research I've done seems to contradict this, but I haven't been particularly thorough since this is only a small part of my research and I don't want to get too bogged down in particulars. 

However, I'm now really interested in hearing a range of opinions! Would anyone like to share their beliefs or preferences for class sizes, along with any experience you have? Did you opinions change from college, to after you had in-class experience? I'd love to hear any stories, anecdotes, rants or raves you all have. 

Thanks, everyone!

teaching,Rbk_47,2019/01/07,"Matched with Student on Tinder I’m [25M] a college tutor. I matched with one of my students [19F] on Tinder this morning. I didn’t recognise her as a student until I swiped through all of her photos and profiles after matching with her. I probably would not have swiped right if I had known she was a student. However, she was in the module that I taught last semester. I’m no longer teaching that class or have any grading or assessment to do for it anymore. Would it be ethical for me to ask her out (assuming our conversation goes well) considering I’m no longer teaching her?

There is no microwave in the school I work at bc the director does not like them (they’re cancerous or whatever her opinion is.) this makes it really hard to bring lunch to work. We only have a 30 min lunch and we have a full kitchen with an oven and stove. It’s really hard to heat up our food because it takes to long and the chef is always busy making lunch and snacks for the children.
I can only bring sandwiches and salads to work and it’s really annoying. I don’t think the directors personal life choices should dictate whether or not we have have a microwave. 
Another co worker of mine had donated one a while back but they threw it out. 
Has anyone experienced this before? How can I bring this up in a civil way so she’ll agree to let me donate one? I can’t keep eating sandwiches and saldas. Sometimes I cook and can’t bring my food because I won’t have time to heat it up in the oven. It’s just not ideal to only use the oven to reheat food. And please save me the speech about microwaves. It’s not a concern to me.

teaching,SilviteSoltis,2019/01/08,"Encouraging kids to study abroad Hey teachers,

I studied abroad in high school and it really changed my outlook on life and the world we live in. Now that I'm a teacher, I find myself wanting to encourage others to do the same thing if they're interested, or maybe just get the information out there so that some that may never have considered studying abroad can get an idea of how great it can be.

I actually wrote [a short ebook on this](https://www.amazon.com/Pop-Your-Damn-Bubble-person-ebook/dp/B07KDTLG75/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1542284289&amp;sr=1-2), but as it's my first work, I don't have much traction yet and also don't know how effective it would be in encouraging kids to try a year abroad, assuming they somehow find it.

So, my question for you all is, would you encourage students to participate in a study abroad program in high school and, if so, how?",9.754363354037269,9.097048062111806,8.529557453416151,69.7547088509317,59.062111801242246,11.776708074534163,36.89518633540372,10.9516,3.868036645962732,722,27,128,15,8,222,104,161,0.022,0.856,0.121,0.9304,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,1,2,1,3,12,6,0,0,8,0,13,1,0,4,2,32,19,16,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,2,10,6,0,0,8,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,1,0,12,6,16,13,4,17,0,0,0,0,14,12,0,8,5,85,22,5,0.0,0.0,0.16740206230846716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137183563231849,0.0,0.3717354022737824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18147065846128727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3135759613606392,0.14591512007307222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17924917375601876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891277117589045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3624910139725249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19365213806757686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094276019448659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121166501796745,0.0,0.0,0.15147637161437585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17233886489289044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261044755268121,0.0,0.13230520052940742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14978548219751275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19216838337068495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10989538964152794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3472230901479424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11396611841917555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11646702081681815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118101344679503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12488597349155693,0.0,0.0,0.2437196732723237,0.0,0.0,0.1104686218491054
teaching,bridiacuaird,2019/01/08,"Help with planning Language Arts with Grade 2s! I feel like on most nights I'm just flying by the seat of my pants, improvising some writing activity for the next day.  Sure, I have balanced literacy (centres) on practically a daily basis, which has a decent offering of reading/writing/listening/talking/viewing! 

But then with my other language arts courses left, I feel I'm just winging it. I've been focusing on writing these days, so the writing topics vary day by day. I teach French and it is not their first language, so writing poses a challenge for a good chunk of them. I try to keep my writing assignments simple and open!  My worry is that there is something wrong with varying it up so much. A new assignment every day - is that ideal?  What are your thoughts?


 Should I be working on ""bigger writing projects""? We've begun talking about editing, and have our own classroom checklist, so they are at the point where they are able to verify various elements in their own writing, and could do the same to a peer's writing, which is awesome! 


However.. I have some super slow writers that just never seem ready to swap with another student. As in, everyone else has half a page down and they'll only have a sentence. What do I do with these kids when it comes time for revision? How so I move them forward? 


Any tips on any of this would be greatly appreciated : )",5.569822048611113,6.947429949218751,5.905104166666668,78.05725694444446,67.8671875,8.345138888888886,34.53472222222222,8.680891452615391,3.0082680555555563,1081,52,189,17,18,346,156,256,0.032,0.8490000000000001,0.119,0.9693,1,0,1,1,0,0,40.0,1,1,7,6,13,8,0,0,13,0,24,0,0,1,2,42,32,15,0,4,5,0,2,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,15,13,0,1,4,2,0,3,2,1,0,2,2,2,22,7,31,24,9,33,0,0,0,0,21,16,0,4,17,135,37,10,0.1596959673197736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21719746797101336,0.16745514588267954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375639353986701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12750423532571087,0.0,0.0,0.5149534380175206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13340548895671794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345507400975023,0.15259634039437522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16149415880762216,0.1140868309620093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1358373082214767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339454006639755,0.0,0.17606536774634066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070408406479269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14194511334028667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735101357570281,0.0,0.0,0.0780193830775532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16973154019329387,0.11739491083353755,0.0,0.12316737494111155,0.15423536036599647,0.16983847295582816,0.14986384722809792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12145597932258062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509643074155078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14538121088684786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229417576818202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15051155927474394,0.0,0.0,0.12835756935590556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12678075983924994,0.09312000278511008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10842307909151946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11626056617858635,0.1621790066399549,0.0,0.11344343328282598,0.1746024707712313,0.0,0.0
teaching,Preastlake,2019/01/08,"Vocabulary, is there really a good way to do it? Background:  6  year teacher, been teaching a state mandated test class (EOC) my entire career, currently teaching Biology.

I am possibly looking for another way to do vocabulary, I am kind of tired of just having the kids look up and define the words and copy them.  I do know that some say this is the worst and some say this is the best, and I know if they are doing that they at least have to read the definition once and it goes in their brain and out to their pencil. 

But I am wanting to change it up this year.  Talking around to different teachers of the school I have heard of something that the history department does.  They give the kids a list of words for the unit (anywhere from 15-35 words) and they are to define using their own words, use the word in a sentence, and then draw a picture.  They make it due the day of the EOU (end of unit) test.  

The only thing I can see bad about this is that: they will not know the words before we do lecture (I typically have them do vocabulary after they finish the previous EOU), my way around this would be to give them my quizlet with the words already defined.  Grading it would be difficult, my way around this is to pick certain words to make sure they have them and base their grade off of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love any input from people, just please keep in mind that this is a state mandated test at the high school level when giving advice.

teaching,MangoTehKitty,2019/01/08,"NJ alternative teaching certification? Hello!

I'm interested in switching careers to be an elementary school teacher. I have a Master's and a Bachelor's in an unrelated field (interior design) with 6 years experience as a designer. I've always wanted to do something that made a difference in people's lives, and design has not satisfied this need. I'm ready to do a complete 180 and start afresh.

Are any of you able to advise based on experience what the proper path would be to transition to teaching? Thank you all in advance, and also thank you for making a difference in children's lives every day!",6.256959459459457,7.9699068018018036,7.787015765765767,63.94646959459463,66.56756756756756,10.595045045045048,34.59572072072072,10.686352973137794,4.333999099099098,489,23,76,14,8,169,76,111,0.022,0.871,0.107,0.8322,0,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,3,0,2,1,3,0,0,9,0,8,0,0,2,1,12,17,6,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,3,16,13,1,11,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,0,3,47,7,6,0.19811094458105225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584292508059546,0.16484417622831454,0.0,0.0,0.13472223582887685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2077155561747812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277651699452519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4139675426441163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16691701526451316,0.0,0.0,0.38758103662017307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3498711872516577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18745736588483547,0.1322405938645485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14689675515218634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13734518447827698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20049885255457334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525154839635356,0.0,0.0,0.14022394624590456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3647878814508021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11685096799148728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14073233094969614,0.0,0.0,0.1275769529877387
teaching,mickeyaaaa,2019/01/08,"Education prof in college tells students they should quit if they arent 100% sure. Now my 18 yr old is getting cold feet He's in his first year. This guy tells the students they shouldn't stick with it if they are not certain they will care about every student. He also said you must like doing tons of work, the work never ends.   I'm kind of pissed off about it.

Is it better to quit if uncertain?  Any teachers out there felt very unsure but then find the work very fulfilling?

I have met my share of burned out teachers, so I don't want to push him to stick with something that may not suit him.

teaching,dnlco,2019/01/08,"Transferring my California preliminary credential Utah. Help! Hello teachers!

I recently graduated from a CA teaching credential preparation program with my preliminary multiple subjects credential. It looks like my fiancé and I will be moving to Utah in a year for his work and I’m trying to understand everything I need to to do transfer my credential over to Utah so I’m able to teach. 

Since I have a preliminary and in CA and induction program to clear it takes 2 years( we’re moving in 1 yr). Will I be able to transfer to Utah with a preliminary credential?

Also, would I be able to clear my Credential in Utah? I saw they have levels; would level 1 be considered preliminary and would Utah’s level 2 be the same as CAs clear credential? I’m wondering Incase I ever move back to CA I want to know if I’ll be able to teach there since I’ve already completed their requirements. 

My last question, do the csets satisfy the praxis II requirement for Utah? I saw on their department website the having testing equivalency which has the csets 101,102 &amp; 103 (which I took) that is the same as the praxis test but then on their application it says, “ I understand that Utah does not accept assessments other than the PRAXIS, with the exception of National Board Certification.”  This is kind of confusing to me. 

I’m hoping to hear about people who have been in the same boat and have gone through this experience, know about reciprocity or who have advice.

teaching,winedineanddesign,2019/01/08,"Where do I start in order to become a teacher? 27 yrs old currently in CA. Likely moving to Austin TX in April/May. 

I’m currently a freelance graphic designer WFH, but looking for a more fulfilling career being around people - I just want to feel like I’m making a difference in the world, however small.

Was a TA in college and have taught many design workshops. I loved teaching and witnessing students grasp new concepts! My degree is in journalism and public relations. My English writing and grammar is and always has been very strong, reading eh not so much - but I’d be most interested in teaching English over any subject. 

If I want to commit to this career change, where/how would I start? And with my impending move, does it make sense to start at all right now? Is there anything I can do in advance to prepare? 

I’m guessing I’ll have to go back to school, get certified, shadow/intern/assist? Please correct me if I’m wrong. Willing to learn all the in’s and out’s!

I have been waiting for a position to come open to pursue a job-embedded program at my university. The up-side of this program is one less semester of school because it cuts out student teaching. 

My concern is where the job is. I will have to commute an hour a day, plus waking up at 5:30 every morning to get there on time. Part of me is afraid to turn this job down because there is no guarantee a position will open up at a closer school before I finish my degree, or even after. I would also hate to take this job and leave after a semester if a better position did become available. Any and all advice is welcome!

She said that instead of learning about the ancient era to around the time of Columbus, which in imagined as normal for a freshman history class, they’re instead learning about the beginning of the universe, to the formation of stars and then ending with agriculture and the beginning of civilization. I learned that many of my old history teachers had been replaced by new teachers and that they start the year learning about Galileo and Issac Newton (which is I guess how they can qualify it as a history class.) The only History in the school is an American Studies class. This seems to me like it’s a ploy to force out History subjects to cram in more science. Has anyone else had something like this?

teaching,CowboysOhBoy,2019/01/09,"How can I get my students to work with me at a school with no schedule? I give English language support (for all long term English learners- kids who have been in the US 7 years or more) at an alternative high school.  Kids work primarily independently on online work and earn credits at their own pace.  There is such a huge number of classes that I can't provide specific modifications for each, and when I try to offer support on what students are working on at any given time, they universally refuse.  My solution has been to pull kids out for work on specific skills they each need, and to offer an elective credit as incentive.  Still, only one student out of 17 attends meetings with me regularly, and only maybe 5 attend at all.  School attendance problems in general are also rampant.  

Right now, I ask them to come work with me and they refuse, then I sit next to them and try to offer support and work on skills relevant to their classwork, and students repeat some variation of ""I don't need help"" regardless of what I say (explaining how the skill helps them work faster or trying to ask comprehension questions mostly).

Do you have any suggestions for how I can approach this differently?  It is very stressful to me to feel like I'm failing so badly.

Thanks!",9.514839458413931,8.1101291106383,9.060967117988397,68.15090909090911,60.02127659574467,11.949709864603484,40.51257253384914,10.832165505486646,4.392319148936172,1011,45,175,20,11,325,140,235,0.08900000000000001,0.7909999999999999,0.121,0.7259,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,1,8,13,10,11,0,1,6,0,14,0,0,4,2,37,29,18,0,4,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,6,17,0,2,3,0,2,6,3,4,0,1,3,2,25,7,38,26,9,36,0,1,0,0,29,17,0,5,13,120,31,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08447817585575934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1436740838214603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19751338349246275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08820280111365579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099725042796623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036857994392477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053413434157296616,0.07546736648305698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055191171835099806,0.10133700216041787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14161302021828606,0.11161169349694378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05160908867261276,0.0,0.0,0.09348575845274268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10612694839102643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15665755977835374,0.0,0.0,0.11234655370301563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07158262365177873,0.1606839777353099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10108070749851153,0.0,0.0,0.11833804358084175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021374664653813,0.0,0.08400708577857295,0.0,0.32073200950237524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08436214935916328,0.0,0.1210072636482806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3596281461527936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725670809677432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06159800669217765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2151625435475344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12706876321084282,0.0,0.0,0.0871619030161579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6152421751989069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06802701025734482

teaching,subhumean,2019/01/09,"Do you think children have changed in, say, 20-40 years in terms of behavioral ""maturity""? I am a substitute teacher and am currently sitting in a 6th grade classroom. It is right after lunch. The kids are really loud and boisterous, in a fun-loving way, but also in a really *childish* way.  They are screaming occasionally, running around, playing with furniture, and just being very silly. This is absolutely standard operating procedure for this classroom and, basically, entire school. They are good kids, but act more like they are 5 than 11 and 12. I'll note that when the disciplinarian guy comes in, they do heed him and have the ability to get super quiet when told they will get detention if they are not basically silent. 

I'm in my late 40s and, looking back, I don't think we in 6th grade back in the 80s, were this silly even when we had a substitute teacher. Sure, there was the occasional ""that kid"". But I seem to remember most of us just maybe goofing off a little, but in a significantly more mature way. So, e.g., I remember getting in trouble for making a ""popper"" (a piece of paper folded in such a way as to make a loud popping noise when rapped downward), but that was done sort of out of a spirit of ""child engineering"" and not just wanton being silly or noisemaking. I'm not saying we were sitting there quietly reading the latest issue of *The Economist*, but I really don't remember us just being like little kids at a slumber party the entire class time. The 7th graders at this school are not much different.

I might think that this is a then vs. now issue, but I have a counterexample. Interestingly, I have subbed for 6th and even *5th* graders at another school, in another district (though not that geographically far from this one), and they were absolutely different. Maybe 1 kid chased another for 20 seconds and otherwise they were almost freakishly well behaved and mature. So maybe this is just a by-school issue? (I should note that the person in charge of that school was extremely on top of things; I don't know how things are run at this school, but they don't seem negligent).

Anyway, I just find this really interesting. What does it mean to be mature? How mature should we expect 6th graders to be? Aside from individual genetic differences, what else goes into creating maturity?

teaching,ElPistolero900,2019/01/09,International school teachers! What’s your academic background? Currently applying for undergrad courses. I’m getting a lot of contrasting advice regarding what course would be best. Some say education whilst others I’d be better off studying a specific subject like one of the sciences or maths. Atm I’m considering doing primary or secondary ed with maths or biology. I have previously taught English for a year in Vietnam and Cambodia and have volunteered in the UK at a pupil referral unit. Any thoughts? Mainly interested in hearing from international school teachers about their academic background and the path they took towards teaching at an international school :),8.174954128440366,11.639231862385323,8.14723853211009,56.0650779816514,65.23853211009174,11.699449541284404,43.92752293577981,11.20814326018867,6.711608440366973,559,36,69,20,10,180,80,109,0.0,0.858,0.142,0.9428,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,1,2,2,1,4,0,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,11,13,6,0,1,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,3,4,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,2,4,4,14,7,4,11,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,5,4,46,7,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2247781910952504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15642518247483408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2413975006874743,0.20343880283465465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12017879489015924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2592553809401308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11237880762135756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19555939750758686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15587118663198102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18292545701453075,0.0,0.6983940565686821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18261449985963446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2555667200032057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634034679833927,0.0,0.0,0.14812883729185305

How do I stop feeling like the biggest failure on the planet .,1.1127430555555549,3.741634093750001,2.8552083333333336,87.25784722222225,90.875,6.594444444444445,22.73611111111111,7.793537801064563,1.6510090277777791,258,10,49,6,9,85,52,64,0.207,0.605,0.188,-0.6705,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,3,3,6,1,0,5,0,3,0,0,1,2,9,9,3,0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,2,5,3,6,7,1,11,0,1,0,0,3,3,0,0,10,31,10,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2259257486705748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702334038359279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22354698869612089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28734811710233993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310701547571493,0.0,0.0,0.2295829869895829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583275143435568,0.3649886494886451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21728658452455107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13346266214491098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25220508591168844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17122349502908846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2496010190071448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25028785137960025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.213568567144693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14895559711109013,0.0,0.0,0.2440944836832186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.164502140194284
teaching,pundemic,2019/01/10,"Just wanted to share I was talking to a student after school and giving her a hard time about her grades since she's such a wonderfully bright kid. I told her I expected her to bring her grades up and that I wanted her to be successful and happy. 
She started bawling because she said all her parents ever tell her is that she has no future and they don't care what she does because none of it matters to them. I really wish there was more that I could do but I think it's a powerful reminder to be patient with students, especially when they're being the most difficult.

My previous school used StudySync by McGraw-Hill which included everything from assessments to day to day lesson plans for 6-12 ELA (not perfect by any means, but included everything I’m looking for). I’m in charge of scoping out what’s out there for my new school, but I want to know what “packaged” curriculum is out there and what might be the best investment. Thanks!

Such as middle school. Highschool. 

And maybe even correctional facilities such as prison and juvenile correction.

I pick this girl up, and the whole way to my office she's stomping her feet.  She logs on to the computer, but is still grumbling at me. She angrily answers a few questions, she is getting enough right that I feel like she's trying, but she's still mad.  After about 15 minutes, I tell her ""OK, you're done for today, we can finish tomorrow.""

Dude. The second I tell her she doesn't \*have\* to be there, she COMPLETELY turns it around.  After she finished that test, she wanted to keep going and do another she had to do. She was pulling out the pencil and paper, manipulatives, everything.

teaching,m00nland3r,2019/01/10,"Help correcting a professors poor presentation skills Hi, one of my professors has been moving far too quickly with extremely difficult material (cost accounting). To make matters worse, he has been teaching us how to solve cost-accounting cases in-class while using a mixture of case-studies and excel. For example, today, we sat in class while he moved through difficult concepts verbally, while using excel (on the big screen), while referencing 10+ pages of text and tables, while also using a whiteboard. Frustrated and unable to follow his 'rhythm' I stopped using my laptop/excel, put away my notes and just followed along. Still, this did nothing to improve my ability to learn, and I could tell from my classmates' glazed eyes that I was not alone. How do I communicate to my professor that this type of teaching is ineffective while also proposing a better solution? Thank you.

teaching,DemiGoddess001,2019/01/11,"A past student said they cutest thing! So I had to leave at the end of last school year because I got married and my husband wanted to go back to school.

My friend who still works at my old school told me that one of my students from last year (he gave me a little trouble, but he and I became bros) has been giving his third grade teacher hell all year. 

He finds out that his teacher has a boyfriend and he straight up asks her if she is going to get married and move away.

It simultaneously broke my heart because I miss him a lot and made me smile because I love that he remembers me and misses me.

teaching,MainlyMason1,2019/01/11,"Psychology graduate to Biology teacher? I recently graduated with a 2.1 in Psychology. This degree made me realize my enthusiasm for biology and I'm now considering completing a PGCE and becoming a secondary biology teacher.

However, I didn't take a biology A level and my degree isn't in biology. The modules of my degree were heavily biology based but obviously still linked to Psychology i.e. Evolutionary psychology and the neurobiology of emotions. 

I'd be happy to take a subject knowledge enhancement course if it would lead to me being accepted. But I'm worried that won't be offered to me due to my lack of an A level in biology.

teaching,unhappy_dedication,2019/01/11,"I'm exhausted and falling behind Tonight I realized, while checking grades for awards, that I did something wrong in my grade book. Which led me to check an email earlier with a checklist for the grade book before reports are sent home, where I realized I was supposed to print and sign the form and turn it in by Wednesday. Reports were printed yesterday so I'm pretty screwed since I did something wrong and it will look bad if I have to go in and admit I didn't carefully read through the checklist (or turn it in for that matter). 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm falling behind and it's only the first week back. I've have a terrible headache all day and I feel so guilty about messing up. I'm also frustrated though with all the stupid paperwork  have to do. In the past five days I have had to:

 

* input at least 6 grades (schools weekly requirement)/grade work
* Create testing session for state testing and get test set up
* look through 2 quarters of grades to write awards for students
* Sign a paper that says I checked my report cards
* Check my report cards and make sure everything is uploaded
* Change bulletin board
* Input progress monitoring for RTI into 2 spreadsheets
* Input standards for assessments into another spreadsheet
* Post pictures of 25 report cards onto Seesaw

teaching,Gopokes34,2019/01/12,"Not sure what to do but I’m starting to lose it mentally So a little background, I graduated college in December a few years ago. Out of college I got an opening as a 9th grade teacher in January. It was hard and there was definitely 2 classes out of 7 that I struggled with management wise, but I didn’t hate my job. My now wife then got a job in another state and we moved. I now teacher 7th grade in a very rough school. It’s under state control, constant fights, failing rating, etc. it’s been very very hard. While student teaching and my short stint immediately after college I did have tough times but it never got to me like this. I can’t motivate the kids, I can’t get their respect, I try treating them correctly, calling parents, doing what I feel I should be discipline wise. It’s just not working. It’s getting to me so bad that I seriously just hate leaving Fridays knowing I have to come back. I do try but I almost feel if I was fired I’d feel relieved lol. I’m just not sure what to do. I want to quit but I feel that it would screw me over with jobs in the future, and part of me doesn’t wanna give up, I’ve never quit a job. But so many times through out the day I just feel it’s not worth it, I feel like I’m bad at my job and not cut out for it.

teaching,ChronoKiro,2019/01/12,"I'm feeling broken and need to expound. I teach high school. What I love about it most is that I get to make connections with young people everyday in ways that I can help them grow and see the world from alternate perspectives. It's very rewarding. But...

I also hate it for the same reason. My wife and I recently discovered we can't have kids, and while we have plans of adopting (so one day I'll have my own, I hope), it hurts sometimes to be able to get close to kids like a parent but not be able to take them home, teach them how to fish, or yell at them for not cleaning their room. 

Had a student in my room upset over the extreme difficulty she's having comprehending the purpose of life, a real crisis, and I wanted nothing more than to give her a big hug, comforting her in the way my family does, but we're not family. So the social stigma regarding that type of interaction was enough, especially given the negative atmosphere that has been enveloping my school recently, to keep me from reaching out. I just stood there and let her cry, which killed me inside. Words, I think, just weren't enough, and I envy parents that get to comfort there children in such ways.

 It doesn't help that am part of what caused the student's crisis. I was her teacher last year in eleventh grade and now that she's a senior, I've become one of her mentors. I didn't realize how much she looked up to me until a big mistake I made in my life recently showed her that I am not the wholesome person she imagined. It along with some other events in her life have left her feeling helpless and hopeless. Disappointing her in such a way has reduced the joy I have for teaching and mentoring young people. I now wonder how I can be an example or model for students when I can't keep my own life in check. I let down a student who has become very important to me (this made me realize how much I have let myself down, and I'm unsure how to recover from that. I always thought I'd be a good Dad, which is part of why I want kids so badly, but I now question that and even my ability to be a good role model. I'm not sure what I want from posting this, but I feel I needed to source it to a community that may understand.

teaching,Coffe_Mug,2019/01/12,"I love teaching... I may get fired. It is my first year. I guess I just need to vent. 

I love teaching. I think I am good at it. People who I  don't know have told people I do know that their child loves me as a teacher. I've had parents tell me how grateful they are that I work with their child.

I'm getting investigated. I'll know in 2 weeks what the next steps are. 

I'm so tired of dealing with random b.s. that I was never told and having a principal who I feel, ""has it out for me to cover his ass"" by creating this no existant paper trail, that I have to keep saying, ""no, please provide me with dates and evidence.""

I had my meeting. I was terrified. Even though I did everything, i feel and my coworkers feel was right. 

However, I finally feel like I can teach my kids. I dont care anymore. I'm not going to spend hours defending myself when what I say gets flipped and I have to spend hours more defending his exaggerated ""observations"".

I'm going to teach.

I'm a training center teacher in China, and this year i will have a 7 days, 2 h/day reading class. 

the classes will follow a 40 minutes period/10 minutes break format, with the first 2 periods dedicated to reading, and the last one to DIY / crafts. While i have experience teaching, this year's class is a higher level than my previous ones ( students will be 8-10 years old). If anyone has any experience / ideas, please share. I'm especially blocked when it comes to crafting ideas, it was never my strongest ability. It doesn't help the fact that due to various reasons i can't decide on the study materials until next Wednesday, that's why i can't tell you what my bibliography will be.

teaching,shilpare,2019/01/13,"What Classroom Activities Interest Preschoolers? Teachers must come up with novel [**Preschool Learning Activities Ideas**](https://www.edusys.co/blog/preschool-learning-activities-ideas) and  management strategies which propel kids to extend their psyches and  thinking in new ways. With technology,  a vast majority of the activities can be designed, managed and  conducted, individually, in groups, or as a class activity, contingent  upon the necessities. 

As the year proceeds and kids grow, teachers must create programs keeping factors such as children’s age, level of  understanding and mental capacity, in mind. Up to that point, educators can keep students interested in academics. 

Things to Consider While Designing Classroom Activities for Preschoolers:

* Plan Age-Appropriate Programs
* Emphasize On Early Childhood Education
* Age-Based Learning
* Simplify Student Management
* E-Learning: Teaching With Pictures and Videos",10.340310077519378,15.25868384496124,8.701124031007755,45.44455426356589,71.01550387596897,10.928682170542636,49.80232558139534,9.994966539143718,8.02939069767442,772,55,68,26,18,235,92,129,0.0,0.905,0.095,0.8689,0,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,1,1,1,2,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,2,20,10,11,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,4,10,0,2,4,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,20,7,1,21,0,0,0,0,5,11,0,1,7,44,5,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2484760891881821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32562750215837943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5127792620929723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2906920433364865,0.0,0.2912545640752682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785889997055379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726806310454716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916348708660894,0.1848285673439932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3002889857559756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289599854791085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18575380452060952

teaching,FortniterOfficeDart,2019/01/13,"Advice for NQT in dealing with a difficult colleague..... As the post states I am currently an NQT at a mid-size secondary school somewhere in Britain. I have enjoyed an excellent first year so far back at a school within which I also did my final teaching placement at university. I have joined the department as a third teacher for my particular subject alongside two colleagues who have worked together for a long time. As such, they have co-created almost every unit of work across all year groups and share most of their classes. I have been given my own classes that for the majority are not shared with them (they take a period each of one class) but was given all the ready-to-deliver units by them with the expectation of following them to the letter. Every lesson, every time. Obviously I have deviated and inputted my own lessons because otherwise I would be lacking a crucial part of teaching experience. Since going back after Christmas and following my interim NQT report, my faculty head has stated that she would like me to incorporate more of my own lessons into my teaching. I spent Christmas creating entire units of work to deliver to my pupils when we got back. Upon discovering this, one of my other aforementioned colleagues has complained that I am deviating and it seems is now relishing any opportunity to undermine/exclude me from said subject. Two subject meetings took place last week that I was conveniently forgotten to be invited too by said colleague. I have also been excluded from helping to create or indeed even seeing the mock exam papers that have been produced for upcoming mock exams. I sense that this is so my classes go in blind while their classes would have had ‘hints’ so to speak which will inevitably result in my classes grades being lower. My Faculty Head is lovely and has been a great help and mentor to myself and I feel that she is aware of what’s happening, I mentioned to her the difficulty I face in trying to get the other two subject teachers to realise there is more than one way of teaching a topic. It is getting me down and for the first time ever, I have a slight bit of dread about going back tomorrow. Apologies for the long post but could anyone offer me some advice as to how I should approach this? Possibly with Faculty Head, subject or even the one particular colleague that I feel is trying to oust me.

teaching,ackabackaboo,2019/01/13,"Does anyone have experience in switching subjects mid career? Hello all,

I have been teaching elementary music for 8 years and I’m getting a little burnt out. I’ve taught at 3 different schools, each one having 1000-1200 students with a packed schedule and extremely limited planning time, with morning and afternoon duties to boot.  I also have always had an hour plus commute my whole career.

I am considering studying up for a middle school subject, specifically math, and taking the praxis to add the certification to my license (Virginia).  I think I would enjoy a more regular schedule, teaching a subject that isn’t so hard on my voice and ears, and also actually being able to develop relationships with students (heck, even being able to know their name would be awesome!). I also think by adding the math certification to my license I would also have a better chance of getting a job closer to my home. 

I am concerned that principals would be wary of hiring me coming from a completely different subject area and age range. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? Thanks in advance!

teaching,ynyngT,2019/01/13,"I think learning by imitation/replication is non sense and creativity is necessary to create an emotional connection, what is far more important than learning itself... I've taken my guitar after years without touching it, thinking about a song I wanted to play and then I thought... ""Why am I trying to replicate it?"" I started to play, just play and have fun rather than creating the goal of playing that song: I started to flow and focus on present moment by playing things that popped out from my mind and I found very pleasant to play.

I'm enjoying it like a kid, free from past and future (judgement). What if the problem of education is that society wants kids to replicate older people things in a repetitive way rather than just show them the art (in my case, the song I wanted to learn) but not asking them for a preseted response (like solving an exercise from a book that was already created and solved), but to ask them to play and create anything that comes out from their minds.

Goals and intentions kill the fun and that kills creativity and that is absurd in this Universe.

teaching,hypnagorgeous,2019/01/13,"What programs are available to dropouts without any financial support? A friend is looking to move to another country due to mental health issues (where he currently lives, there's no such thing as a mental health problem and no psychiatrists or any kind of assistance for this kind of thing). The problem is, he's a dropout and doesn't have means to move to get the help he (very much) needs. Currently he's struggling to cope with his depression and unable to use his abilities (very talented writer/artist) consistently enough to make enough money to move.  


Are there any programs to help him with education or a career to put him in a country with better facilities?

teaching,Amayax,2019/01/13,"How do you deal with nicknames? Teens remain teens, and that unfortunately includes trying to get on peoples nerves. In my case that presents itself in nicknames being shouted from the hallways so I never see who does it. Strangely they never do it to my face, I wonder why...

Now, I dont care what people call me behind my back, but this purposeful shouting is what I do mind. I however have no idea what is the best approach to this kind of stuff as I am way too new to it all.

I know that an emotional response is the last thing I should do,but I dont know how to make sure it stops while also remaining emotionally neutral. 

Have you had this and what has effectively solved this nuisance for you?",5.158629359286294,5.946584554744527,5.5919221411192215,82.08371451743716,68.4160583941606,8.132684509326845,29.820762368207625,8.167268648758528,1.9744621248986207,552,20,108,7,9,177,91,137,0.077,0.8,0.123,0.8884,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,3,1,2,7,4,0,0,4,0,15,1,1,4,4,19,22,9,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,19,3,0,1,5,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,3,17,4,14,19,2,14,0,0,1,0,7,3,0,1,9,85,36,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350621111711394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298667919514858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17724073657540154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17245664456910184,0.0,0.17219568084207898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1741192559304729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14779769544980176,0.0,0.3958781040787022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3799593968791633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08823860258044991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906574372616942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1758740382751647,0.1856362077142944,0.13766874683340302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11273608692214965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17053181444838098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26051837817074713,0.16311602791868152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341755765486266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13458429995859034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14120047972289956,0.0,0.0,0.1933398447114277,0.0,0.0,0.15917781529789862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11220370861529244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1146659362298916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340578537671844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523979027438573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831551386436136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But, it's in the middle of the year, which scares me a bit, especially since this will be my first full-time teaching job. I'm uncertain if I should accept it or wait until the hiring season kicks into gear. Basically - guaranteed vs potential. 

For people who started mid year, any advice? Or, if you think I should wait, why?

teaching,TallNicole92,2019/01/14,"Comparing Teaching to Being a College Student Hi everyone, I've recently discovered this sub, so I apologize if this has been asked before!

Would you say college prepared you for what teaching is really like? I'm a current college student and I feel very under prepared. I pay attention, ask tons of questions, and really try to absorb everything. I currently have a 4.0 and I have just recently started my first semester as a Senior. I'm a dual major in ESE K-12 and Elementary Ed. Other than practicum, I am a fully online student at my local university. 

My worst fear is entering my first classroom next year and just being lost. I can't seem to get a straight answer on record keeping and paperwork, and this aspect has changed with each field experience I've done. I know HOW to fill out IEP forms and 504 papers, at least the ones I've been introduced to so far.

My largest concern is knowing what to teach and when. When doing my field experience last semester my head teacher said to just ""follow the curriculum book"" for the first few years until I have a good enough grasp to ""stray."" This answer kind of ... Confused me? Stray from the curriculum? How? When? Why? 

I tend to extremely overthink tiny things. Is this the case? Would you say being a full-time college student compares to the stresses of teaching? I'm also a single mother to a 1 yo, so stress levels are high over here!

I'm a 26F and I'm in Florida.

teaching,RegalPrince,2019/01/14,"Is a minor enough to teach a subject? Hi all. Aspiring Spanish teacher here. When I graduate I am going to get certified to teach Spanish, but I also want to take the test to teach government as well to improve my marketability. In my state if you pass a difficult test you can teach the subject. I want to get a minor in political science so that I have a background to teach government, but I was wondering if that would be enough knowledge to teach it? 

I have always loved learning about government and politics so it's not something that would be forced, but rather an interest of mine. Has anyone ever been in a  similar situation like mine? Also if any government teachers could comment that would be much appreciated, but I do appreciate advice from everyone.

teaching,TheRealSquirrelGirl,2019/01/14,"Any of you have elementary students raising siblings? I’m trying to figure out how we can support a student raising his siblings.  Our school is in a community wear it is expected that the older sibling care for the younger ones, and this 9 year old has a 2 year old and nearly one year old sibling, so he’s basically up all night.  Because it’s a transformation school, the hours are long.

I’ve decided that a nap would be the best use of his time during intervention time. Obviously we can’t give a 9 year old coke or coffee, and he’s not hungry when he’s this tired.

teaching,FiredTwoTimes,2019/01/14,"How do I know if i'll like teaching before committing to Teachers college? Hey,

I reside in Ontario where the school i've applied for is a 2 year program. 

I have a software engineering degree and am 25 years of age. I have worked a few jobs as a software developer and felt pretty bored/unengaged. I was let go from a couple of jobs as well due to my large amounts of energy and not being the ""right fit"". I worked 2 years at a big corporation and always thought about becoming a teacher. I could not stand sitting at a cubicle for 8 hours a day. Other options ive considered were Product Management and something more social based like consulting

I TA""d in university and quite enjoyed it. I am an excellent public speaker and am quite outgoing and have done stand up comedy a few times too. However I suffer from ADHD and some disorganization issues.  I applied for grades 4-10 but it's a big decision to commit to 2 years of school and have this sort of career switch. I am not old and I am not super young as I am 25.  Id love to teach HIstory, and computer programming with a bit of math as well. 

A lot of people around me have told me i'd make a great teacher with some saying it's not a wise financial decision but that's a whole other story. How can I make this decision not being 100% sure? Have you guys been in this boat before?

teaching,_Jo_Pie_,2019/01/15,"How should I be managing my time??? Hi reddit! I am brand new and this is my first post after being a long-time lurker, so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in my second year as a teacher, but I really was flying by the seat of my pants for my entire first year. I'm still really struggling with figuring out when to fit all my grading/planning work in alongside taking care of myself and not burning out. I feel like I am never ever ""on top of it"" and I'm always carrying around a massive pile of grading work. Things to keep in mind: I work as the only Reading teacher for 6-8th grades at a Catholic school and am responsible for all curriculum and planning for my classes. I also work lunch to earn a little bit of extra money, so I eat lunch during my plan period, which means I essentially do not have a plan period. We read from novels and work with the Scholastic SCOPE Magazine. I have a resource teacher who does push-in work with IEP students in my classes, but I also struggle with figuring out the best way to make the best use of her while she's in my class. I don't want to just boss her around, but I'm not always comfortable with leaving her with nothing to do but help out as needed.

&amp;#x200B;

My principal has offered multiple times to help me with planning, but she has yet to follow through with those offers, so I'm turning to reddit! I really want to be a good teacher, but I also want to make sure I quit trying to pull all-nighters at least once or twice a week to get my work done. It's giving me acne. How do y'all do it?? What do your days usually look like? How much work should I get done each day so I can quit feeling overwhelmed, but stop feeling lazy? Any suggestions welcome!",5.661666666666669,5.379398321937324,6.382705128205128,80.56021153846153,67.2051282051282,9.071282051282052,30.940313390313392,8.548686976883017,2.2543742450142448,1365,47,272,18,20,450,184,351,0.067,0.772,0.161,0.9902,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,1,2,0,20,17,13,0,3,14,0,26,3,0,7,5,63,52,30,0,7,13,0,3,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,9,22,3,2,7,3,1,2,5,4,0,4,3,4,42,9,52,43,9,42,0,1,1,0,17,17,0,2,23,190,51,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20231331808945235,0.14033676269087575,0.1827406066090235,0.2049376323102364,0.057346528313245326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06939548071836542,0.1501411590851847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17699590806164522,0.0,0.09206529300592584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0859789106156505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10877029898789016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07379676879312495,0.1725954396438419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628949418838207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07628029742232377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12791764246148132,0.06024456678108647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14346019987594982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08811671566921764,0.08089594322095524,0.0,0.07073106130897244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11304773773346458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07495538080749561,0.0,0.0,0.04634494556438186,0.0,0.0,0.08929210491464691,0.0,0.08623199047868554,0.0,0.08239765964925423,0.08451968902909643,0.0,0.07462840272094569,0.07081501814773702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11258036082248904,0.0,0.0,0.09185886921930674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514812659574618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06199142780840184,0.06252879397844054,0.0650396288714673,0.0814453551669638,0.0,0.07913693873581387,0.0,0.08091583211597969,0.0,0.0,0.08980750211017544,0.0,0.06413591117889876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925677837707832,0.0,0.0,0.08076375378292804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17938828247551022,0.16870339575078375,0.0,0.1620697144564983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853453259148594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06734515033070795,0.07050271740622817,0.0,0.17631770459807894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07947896884849248,0.0,0.06340482085897421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05602435895373093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09834569299782957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057253772182655975,0.09172560283781787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283307424908604,0.0928763444338046,0.0,0.14921807012315708,0.06693633760155313,0.06764353871741298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4911394161161412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922003891406441,0.2049376323102364,0.10861006427954142

teaching,lulzcakes69,2019/01/15,"I Miss My Old School So I used to teach at a great high school. The kids were smart and I was paid well. I taught physics, chemistry, and calculus and even had an organic chemistry seminar afterschool 2 days a week. 

But all of that went to shit after the first semester I taught there. I crashed my car 5 times and my girlfriend broke up with me, and I started using porn and weed to cope with the loss. Sadly, porn and weed costs a lot of money, as do escorts, so I had to tutor, teach, and coach on the side!


I was so overextended that I failed at EVERYTHING! NO ONE PASSED THE AP PHYSICS EXAM! EVEN SOMEONE WHO KNOW WORKS AS A MECHANICAL ENGINEER DIDN'T PASS! Also, I had to teach math over the summer because I was so broke, and two of the kids had to go back a grade after I taught them (from their original level!) HOW?! 

A year later, I guess I was fired from the school. I was watching a video with a really foxy actress, and man, oh my god; I was so distracted. Sadly, I had a student come up to me and say that she didn't know how to do anything in the packet, and I guess she saw me. I also had weed in my cabinets, soooo...yeah :/

HELP! I currently have no source of income and I have to survive off of my girlfriend's money! 

Is there any way I could be hired back at the old school? I really miss all of my students, who all unfriended me after I was fired, and some of the counselors, who were, you know, really attractive and all that. 

I HAVE A PHD IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND I AM UNEMPLOYED! THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE! HELP!

teaching,rxchelhowell,2019/01/15,"teaching with mental health issues? Hello!
Apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, just wanted to possibly get some advice/insight! (I have already posted this in another subreddit as well, so I'm very sorry if anyone's already seen this haha)
I'm currently in my first year at sixth form (in the UK) and I'm starting to seriously consider what sort of career I want to go into and one that really sticks out for me is teaching history -  I've done some research into it, I enjoy history and working with/teaching children etc and it's almost definitely something I'd be interested in pursuing post-university. However, I have several mental health issues (suspected anxiety, depression &amp; an eating disorder) which have a huge impact on my life and have done for quite a long period of time, and I am really concerned this is going to hold me back in doing what I want to do (especially anxiety, which has pretty much stripped me of any confidence I've ever had, has controlled and defined my life/what I do for the past 4/5 years and is showing no signs of easing up haha). 
I was just wondering if there were any teachers (history or otherwise) on here who also struggle or have struggled with their mental health and still manage their job as a teacher? If so, how?
I'm just curious as to whether it's possible/not as difficult as I think it would be; I know by the time I've been through A-levels and then university, I may feel entirely different about it and I may have made more progress in my mental health recovery, but right now I'm really second guessing myself and would really appreciate some advice if possible.
Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this - if it isn't then I'm happy to take this down! :))",7.979227941176473,7.079102794642857,8.764663865546218,67.42739495798321,62.7202380952381,12.429691876750702,37.0266106442577,11.67016984619884,4.492010014005603,1393,58,243,38,17,474,178,336,0.065,0.856,0.08,0.5997,4,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,0,0,2,5,16,11,0,2,9,2,30,6,0,3,1,55,52,34,0,12,14,0,1,0,0,4,5,0,0,1,20,17,1,2,5,1,0,2,4,5,1,3,8,2,22,6,40,38,7,42,0,1,1,0,6,20,0,18,17,172,42,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822019193189376,0.0,0.0,0.08423487827785174,0.0,0.18565889565353175,0.06727141194298253,0.0,0.0911449039193064,0.0,0.11441012285571422,0.08820804400820995,0.1287044373046049,0.0,0.0,0.058819252994347815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468373982405821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09434868423853704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245316332291138,0.0,0.0,0.0878883821976322,0.09640977996793948,0.0,0.0,0.1721696677619722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08607662853908109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0938169821260818,0.0,0.07609212323967965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04253402841723301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07155315053710826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04394967124378092,0.0,0.09561563323741894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926685982011768,0.0,0.0,0.08954820716894239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35766611203026294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756006205535352,0.08347696181525363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04623061824073522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883408571744393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07444430356089257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07959718055872544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33909611835233283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0618385025229352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05700246382995253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030286811445331,0.0,0.0,0.1757767643952644,0.0,0.0,0.18966723399468569,0.32225807784284805,0.085581144647715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.089472876739769,0.0,0.0,0.2155598776718014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21551623429728856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503261446015007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476033874553122,0.0,0.1883328050517392,0.05954116934967125,0.0,0.06717901806527687,0.0,0.0,0.17588275034292258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06324840890537656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053901242899193035,0.0,0.0,0.09810308617769646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06940850964331638,0.148849967358354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563474507266826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09122547155772158,0.06124097939089294,0.0,0.0,0.11951407408482588,0.0,0.0,0.10834213650836903
teaching,ManIsFire,2019/01/15,"Did I mess up? I just interviewed for a position at one of the largest school districts in my state. I completed everything on the online application and attached all of the documents they asked for on the app. I was in contact with the Dept Chair to set up a time for an interview and I specifically asked if I needed to bring anything with me besides my ID. They told me that they don't require anything else besides what is asked for on the app.

As I entered the room where I was to be interviewed, the DC asked me if I had a copy of my resume. I didn't have one and they said that they didn't have my work history... even though it was included as part of the application. The principal had my work history and asked me questions based on it so I didn't worry too much about not having a copy of my resume. However as I was walking to my car I immediately felt like I screwed up and wouldn't even be considered since I didn't have a copy of my resume.

teaching,travlingwonderer,2019/01/15,"If you had to leave teaching, what would you do? Hello all. I found out some months ago that I love teaching. I took a course that certified me to teach English to adults of other languages and it was a blast! I worked for a month straight (every single day!) and I didn't lose much steam. However, I have found that jobs teaching English to adults are few and far in between and I have no desire to teach children. This leaves me with a career that I enjoy but can't pursue.

teaching,yamada_yamada,2019/01/15,"[tutoring - 5th/6th graders] Disparity in abilities of students in a small group. I'm currently doing some English tutoring for a group of 3 kids (2 5th graders and 1 6th grader). We are in Taiwan so the standard isn't too high and the atmosphere is generally very casual. The 3 of them are currently working through the same material but the 6th grader has been struggling quite a bit. Below are some things I have noticed or happened with him in our sessions

\- His scores in the spelling tests are always the lowest out of the 3.

\- When we're reading from the textbook he's the student that 'slows' things down when it gets to him

\- When the other two kids learn new words that they cannot pronounce they'll ask for me to say it slowly for them to note down a phonetic translation using bopomofo ( ㄅㄆㄇㄈ ) which helps them a lot (and I do the same while practicing Chinese). I have encouraged the 6th grader to do so as well but he always refuses and says its fine (then when I test their pronunciation later he is unable to remember or say it)

\- Usually when we're doing reading and he is stuck the other kids like to jump in and answer for him if he's taking too long. I'm unsure of whether or not too encourage this - I feel like if I tell them to stop it kind of puts the 6th grader on the spot too much and ends up upsetting him but on the other hand he can't really improve if he is constantly bailed out. 

\- The other day (and what prompted me to make this post) he began crying in the middle of the spelling test. 

Having spoken to his mom she's more or less just told me to continue and try my best. So what I'm basically asking here is for advice on how to handle him. Does he need more dedicated individual time? Should I be harsher on him? 

&amp;#x200B;

teaching,juicervose,2019/01/16,"Student teacher advise Hey y’all. I am currently a senior majoring in K-6. Last semester, I interned once a week in a kindergarten classroom. My mentor teacher was very rigid - didn’t allow me to do any lessons with the whole group, gave me mediocre scores on my reviews even though she praised me in person, was not open to let me do anything besides help the students that she didn’t feel like “dealing with” that day, etc. I **loved** the kids and wanted more opportunities to engage with them, but when I mentioned it she would just said “okay” and nothing changed. I tried to make the best of my time there by helping with individual kids, monitoring the class/their work while she taught, doing small classroom chores, etc. I loved doing all of those things, but wanted more. It’s my senior year and I have had no experience teaching a whole group lesson, which concerns me. I want as much experience as possible before I graduate. The experiences I had in her classroom really lowered my self confidence, because I began to believe that she didn’t believe in me and didn’t want to give me the opportunity to grow in her classroom as a future teacher.

I’ve known I want to be a teacher since I was 6 years old, I was a preschool teacher for over a year, and I’ve never been more passionate about anything as I am about children and education. I **know** I have the skills that I need to be successful in the classroom, but I’ve yet to have the opportunity to show what I know and can do. Tomorrow, I start a new internship twice a week in a second grade classroom. My mentor teacher is a different teacher in a different school, different district, etc. I desperately want to be able to be involved in the classroom. I want to lead lessons, I want to read to them, I want to do ANYTHING that the mentor teacher will allow me to do. There are several lessons and other projects that I have to do for my courses, but I want to be able to do more than what is required from my university. However, I don’t want to overstep any boundaries in her classroom. 

Other than literally telling her I want to be involved, what are some ways that I can I show my mentor that I’m ready and capable? How can I make her feel comfortable with allowing me to “take over” the classroom occasionally? What general advice do y’all have for student teachers?

teaching,kels_jpg,2019/01/16,"How to think more creatively as a (future) teacher? I’m currently student teaching right now in a really good school. The students are sweet and respectful, and my teacher is one of the best I’ve ever worked with. My teacher gives me good feedback, too. 

She has a lot of ideas that she’s used over the years that have worked really well. When we co-plan, it’s difficult for me to come up with my own ideas for activities. 

I really love working with kids and seeing how they learn. Teaching them is a really enjoyable part of my day. 

However, I feel like I am not creative. I want to be able to plan for fun, yet meaningful activities, but I have no idea how. 

Even if kids tell me an activity I planned was fun, I feel like it wasn’t.

I want to make more fun activities that don’t just have students working with a whiteboard and marker.

I’m currently in a fifth grade class, which is the highest grade I’ve been in. 

Is there a way I can work on being more creative? Thank you in advance :)",2.7815597147950086,4.614049853535357,4.149322638146167,86.0586898395722,75.71717171717171,7.891146761734997,26.29352346999405,8.671277953709913,1.8767316696375524,773,29,161,16,17,255,114,198,0.057,0.727,0.21600000000000005,0.9851,3,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,1,2,9,12,15,0,0,12,0,17,1,0,5,1,31,31,11,0,3,4,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,10,0,0,8,0,0,2,4,1,1,1,3,4,22,14,23,26,7,20,0,0,1,1,11,8,0,2,11,108,28,16,0.13414814255942972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14078019933342728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555674652663572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08651445415189178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860358297923887,0.12134467507110618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356586631574736,0.19167091969704572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12868712205420274,0.0,0.22503419472666986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4543107731446906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310760127402471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404795362105233,0.12107393615305315,0.0,0.08954492683581791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090225317948684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14526936575080174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3437549407323157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11456178077275485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13576508209766736,0.10689870140129884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172513894156694,0.12350558629736312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595671308749361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11586092382747636,0.0,0.0,0.15824810028015604,0.1064805514816108,0.0,0.0,0.12061529070518705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4883072273996583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08638700558865375
teaching,thedan663,2019/01/16,"What are your tips for a substitute teacher in an urban high school? Subbing in the suburbs vs. an urban school (Title I) is like night and day. I student taught at an inner-city school so I'm somewhat familiar with the environment, but I am still struggling a bit as a substitute. I've become a preferred sub at an urban high school by receiving lots of positive feedback and am generally there at least 3-4 days of the week. I leave detailed, specific notes for the teachers and leave the classrooms looking good when I leave, but sometimes I feel it's undeserved because there are times when you could walk into the room and the students are chatty and completely unproductive. I'm hoping I can receive some tips to problems I am having so I can make my classes better managed. Here are some problems:

1. General misbehavior - It depends on the class, but it can be around 60% sometimes of students who just don't use time wisely. They work for 10-20 minutes and then refuse to do more. Copying work. Excessive chatting throughout the assignment. PHONE USE (I've learned to not pick that battle as long as they are productive, but some students are using their phones as a priority to their work). Doing the bare minimum and finishing in 5 minutes.....and trying to get them to expand is useless, so many of them don't even care. I try to just write names down of students that aren't productive, but it becomes an issue when chatting gets too loud. I need to be better at saying ""it's too loud"" rather than saying ""Go do your work"".....are there any other strategies on getting them to be more productive on their work? Just hate it when a teacher comes in for a moment and it's loud or students aren't being productive....I try my best but I feel lost sometimes.

2. Dealing with tough kids: When do I call security? I really try to avoid calling security unless student safety is threatened. I don't want the reputation as someone who falls back on security. However, there have been a couple cases where students have simply been a real distraction. I have one student who plays music out loud in class and refuses to turn it off (happened twice). She received an in-school suspension when I left a note, but I see her again Friday and I'm not sure what to do if she does it again. It's a distraction to the class. Additionally, I've had a couple times where certain students are refusing to do anything and being a genuine distraction. One such example is a student drawing ""funny"" pictures on a white board, laughing extremely loudly, and showing his peer group, which would get them off-task. Without them, the class would run much smoother. These have rarely happened, but I always question whether I should call security or if it's too much. These are students who truly don't care about the consequences it seems....the real troublemakers who have likely been suspended many times before. This isn't your run of the mill misbehavior.

I had a real rough day today, but a great day there Monday. It really depends....I can get some great classes where I just have to write 5 names down of students who were unproductive, but at least respectful of others. Where I struggle is the apathy, students who just do so little and then want to use the time to chat with friends, play on their phones, not doing any work and just copying, etc.

Maybe I'm overthinking and being hard on myself, expecting myself to be responsible for students doing their work, but it's hard to enforce rules on phones and chatting when the students are completely fine with taking a 0 on an assignment and using the period how they wish. Would love some suggestions so I can improve!

teaching,whatsthesitchwade_,2019/01/16,"Had a really frustrating day with my students and in need of advice please! Yesterday I had to take the day off for personal reasons. I work in an inner city school, so many of my students have behaviour challenges, and with that in mind I prepped my students by letting them know the day before that they’d be having a substitute, and my expectations, etc.

Today I come back to my classroom, and the first thing I notice is construction paper that has been glued to the laminate flooring. During our soft start, where we play games and warm up for our day, two kids reveal that yesterday, two of my board games had “mysteriously” been ripped in half. At lunch, I was told by our SD teacher that she came in in the morning and saw one of my students spitting on my carpet because he “had something in his mouth” and apparently couldn’t think of a better way to get rid of it (rinsing his mouth out in the fountain next to our class? Spitting it into the sink in our room?).

Anyways, I’m frustrated that the students felt that it was somehow acceptable to behave the way they did and treat my things so disrespectfully. I want to convey that by having a fair consequence. I don’t think that it’s right for me to shut down our soft start time because lots of my students are able to play appropriately during that time, but no one is confessing to the things that happened yesterday. It took me all day to process what had happened, and I would appreciate any words of wisdom on how to move forward from this so that my students (especially the ones who have more behaviour challenges) know why their behaviour yesterday was absolutely unacceptable.",12.648668831168829,8.20823587987013,11.267662337662339,64.15006493506496,57.084415584415595,14.576623376623376,45.532467532467535,11.911945987284742,5.187184415584416,1313,54,238,26,11,416,168,308,0.037000000000000005,0.883,0.08,0.8077,1,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,7,0,4,5,8,11,2,0,16,0,25,5,4,2,1,38,44,14,0,5,1,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,23,16,1,0,10,4,0,5,3,2,0,7,16,5,36,9,46,23,4,47,1,0,1,0,22,24,0,2,18,175,59,14,0.12412293888280425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129149933136628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440785479724458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09544287834910163,0.0,0.1513283829509816,0.0,0.10561947890284197,0.0,0.0,0.1097766526982024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14196357535371376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10692092125142193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4002451357243781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13842988727143896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11917748640360605,0.0,0.0,0.10557890840548058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06484911258088757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2195230098635262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364294422294094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269241145940671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10552488395986144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584117816155493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253287847991858,0.0,0.0,0.13192304065957372,0.0,0.09203558642555154,0.0,0.0,0.13200615364590254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14131478859937233,0.0,0.0,0.25232674714168496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837936258752637,0.0,0.136249713474326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07951633299782121,0.12761905381780134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10600031160969894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256190407568421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555590245011536,0.0,0.0,0.17570970999701846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933250027495296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2473852957503093,0.1590659347429889,0.0,0.0,0.14475416766559296,0.0,0.11765403274659768,0.11860478727420805,0.13790515217400598,0.0,0.0,0.24250015104015765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321092526753352,0.19704602287585268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200164625360012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0903629778037488,0.0,0.0,0.08817337452124996,0.0,0.0,0.0

https://i.redd.it/ytfua6fcs2b21.jpg

I am a chef instructor and I teach Culinary Arts at a rural Title I high school. My advanced students are currently working on a garde manger (cold pantry) unit. Since we've been working with composed salads, today I challenged them with raw shrimp, Romaine lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, and red onions. 

Their production assignment was to plan, produce, and plate a composed salad using all of these ingredients. 

The students did a great job. Every group rose to the challenge. They multi-tasked which was important because it took about 25 minutes for them to clean the shrimp.l While some students in each group worked on the shrimp, another prepped the salad while the 4th prepared the dressing. 

While every group was successful, I particularly liked the salad pictured above. This group was quite creative in using the tomatoes to accent the center. Thy also used the cucumbers to give their pan fried shrimp some vertical height. 

Pictured below is an example of a composed cucumber salad that the students made last week.

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes think that it's a hoot that I actually get paid to do this. I enjoy being in the kitchen with the students and hope to continue teaching Culinary Arts until the time comes for me to retire.

teaching,alliegatorrr,2019/01/17,"Anyone know of any great OER online grammar exercises? I teach college freshman composition. Last semester, I got some feedback from students about wanting more grammar, but we genuinely just don't have the time for it in class with everything else we have to cover. 

I considered using Little Seagull's online grammar exercises, so the students could work on grammar outside of class time. I really like their online set up:

* I assign which exercises for students to complete
* Students complete the assignment in the allotted time period
* Students are able to keep retaking the assignment over and over until the reach 100% should they so choose. The program also let's them know if they got a question wrong, and (more importantly) *why* they got it wrong.
* I am given the students score through the program, so I can easily record their grades into my gradebook (w/o having to actually grade what they got right/wrong myself)

The problem comes from cost. I am working really hard to make my classroom use only OER materials, so my students don't have to spend money on textbooks. While this program is GREAT, I'd really rather not have to make my students pay for something if I don't have to.

With that said, does anyone know of any free programs that have many of the same features as the ones I listed above?

Thanks so much in advance!",5.05660882685779,7.725833614107884,5.2806129762353855,76.71447661259903,71.78008298755186,7.701320256506977,31.286495662014328,8.575989854853784,2.892824066390041,1075,49,170,20,22,339,139,241,0.061,0.8340000000000001,0.105,0.9204,0,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,2,0,7,3,9,8,0,0,13,0,18,3,0,4,0,31,35,14,0,7,6,0,1,1,0,1,3,1,0,0,7,8,0,1,5,3,5,2,4,3,0,1,6,2,24,6,32,26,6,20,0,0,0,0,11,10,0,5,8,116,31,27,0.11933760083846395,0.0,0.11645628376246216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09543423627503196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16230732166171893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668872504873605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10279877624901072,0.25024640797251924,0.0,0.0,0.09528136368055426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10443313869564036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996912524340598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725294070068836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3817807243513086,0.2631402524462939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069030500576217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10607274285677104,0.0,0.0,0.19675447341881014,0.09727607246075676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12203078222715726,0.0,0.05830232379461848,0.11960762715278027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15931755046266402,0.1209895964730994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.087726867776611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086624680952799,0.0907616229959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11418996710737672,0.0,0.0,0.13368542463206065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293521687330993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191365906647518,0.11351738643299393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187191543311801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10987002933973264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20876014420941744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20613874209065047,0.0,0.0,0.07038840890514808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10768362298030207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.173758389428736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914307977592889,0.0,0.0
teaching,Vaisakhmv_,2019/01/17,"A few strategies to implement Bloom’s taxonomy in education # A detailed guide on Bloom's taxonomy for teachers: [https://blog.linways.com/an-introduction-to-blooms-taxonomy/](https://blog.linways.com/an-introduction-to-blooms-taxonomy/)

# The following is an excerpt from the[second blog](https://blog.linways.com/a-few-strategies-to-implement-blooms-taxonomy-in-education/) of that series.

## Consider plotting assessments to the levels of Bloom’s taxonomy

As you go assessing your students and evaluating their performances, consider also giving points or grades to the levels themselves. This way, you can encourage students to move to the higher levels (Not that the lower level are “bad” or higher levels are “good”) of the pyramid with a sense of accomplishment.

The great thing about this strategy is that you can distribute the weight of execution with your students. This way, the Bloom’s taxonomy becomes everyone’s concern and your students will have something to measure up to instead of it being some complex computation and planning that only the teacher does.

## Spending enough time on each levels for better coverage

Modern aspects and [outlooks](http://blog.linways.com/how-do-we-learn/) have convinced us that memorising is too conventional and has certain negative connotations in education. That’s not all true, we must say. Remembering things is a part of the learning process and it shouldn’t be overlooked. So even though memorising is the basic step in terms of Bloom’s, try spending enough time you need in making sure that your students remember everything.

Memorising things can relieve load off the student’s cognitive functioning because it doesn’t take much time to recall as much as to process, analyse, and implement theory into the information at hand. In fact, such an immediate access to the information can fasten the whole process and would only boost their ability to perform. So instead of barely brushing the lower levels and spending too much time on the higher levels, spend a definite amount of time on each of them so that your students have sufficient proficiency in each levels.

## Make use of technology to improve cognition

We have talked about using technology in many of our previous blogs, but that’s only because it really matters. [Teachers should start using technology](http://blog.linways.com/how-should-we-help-teachers-to-adopt-education-technology/) more often and more wisely in their teaching learning to ensure proper progress and active participation. Communication platforms can be used to improve collaboration and encourage team efforts. Providing a space for the students to express themselves will help you to learn about their interests and about the results of your efforts.

Bloom’s taxonomy, though revered very effective by many experts from around the world, comes with more than enough data for a teacher to handle. There are outcomes, lesson planning, assessments, mapping, students information, performance reports, etc. and these may cause an overload in your daily routines. So try using [academic management systems or learning management platforms](http://blog.linways.com/an-ams-or-an-erp-finding-the-right-technology-for-educational-institutions/) to efficiently manage data.

## Try project based learning

[Project based learning](http://blog.linways.com/project-management-in-education-4-ways-to-have-better-results-lesser-workload-for-teachers-using-project-management/) is a great way to improve student engagement and cognition. It’s even greater while trying to implement Bloom’s taxonomy in your classroom. All projects can be broken down into each levels of the pyramid easily and this gives you, the teacher, a better mode of assessment. However, trying out project based learning in classrooms can be tricky if you don’t have clear points of advancement that measures progress. So place each steps of the project onto each levels of Bloom’s taxonomy pyramid.",13.650830223880597,14.661082525704813,11.093059183250412,49.09366837686572,50.442786069651746,13.44131426202322,48.19698383084579,12.656292710211122,6.867217288557214,3285,177,382,89,32,988,278,603,0.033,0.8059999999999999,0.161,0.9975,4,0,1,0,0,0,186.0,4,15,5,16,22,16,0,0,36,0,36,2,1,10,8,78,51,33,0,6,7,0,2,0,0,7,0,1,0,0,23,32,1,0,14,2,4,7,6,1,0,0,0,4,24,15,81,39,25,62,1,0,0,0,36,42,0,7,9,265,47,33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06980582153049628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770665115715387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07288354572833683,0.10642240869190574,0.09640500230803926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23160286729677984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967092660691173,0.0,0.07519264897464553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638811108257065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2705818675734303,0.09735147994773413,0.11530850968217808,0.0,0.0,0.08340938360651685,0.07845066853782652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16747314002906186,0.04960894707363812,0.07321475257818141,0.0,0.19247517679943396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11701736117776618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11653357252445655,0.17699682017904034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092775508963839,0.192504691643214,0.06472446610330825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19916404963134474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09452661790847187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09119952361772822,0.0,0.16503462397026614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055920241285581686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19776522117721612,0.07454522584339535,0.0,0.06941655140812752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06720014517543678,0.0,0.0,0.06178434674246161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226983918694859,0.0,0.06563125429682815,0.07016043578461502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17397489179036138,0.0,0.17152406206118906,0.0,0.2544976509157969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2963210707534639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10499918253374856,0.37695288406330696,0.0,0.07202343308871928,0.0,0.2078603362635672,0.0,0.1062957649492744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09745622363281084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06200834711941964,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,jmfhokie,2019/01/18,"Help! I need an edTPA tutor-please! Help, so I'm a career changer in New York state, I earned my Master's in Early Childhood from Touro College last January, with a 3.9 GPA and with honors.  I even got to walk at Graduation last June at Lincoln Center, which made my mom pretty proud since she walked at her MBA graduation there nearly 40 years prior.  However, I've been working on my edTPA prompts (currently STUCK on Instruction Task 2) for the last 8 months or so.  Touro is more affordable than most NY state teaching institutions, so it doesn't set up student teaching placements for you (I had to call districts and find my own...UGH, which I managed to do but it was so nervewracking and then I found out most programs arrange that for their teacher candidates so I was upset) and then they also don't handhold you or ensure that you complete all 8 NYS initial teacher certification exams before graduation.  So here I am, still trying to complete this darn thing.  My husband, parents, friends, family; none of them can understand why I'm not finished yet.  I have the video all done but I just have such immense difficulty responding to the prompts.  Is there anyone on here who may offer tutoring or mentoring services?  My goal is to finally submit the edTPA sometime by the end of the spring, if possible.

teaching,Lukeuh,2019/01/18,"Best piece(s) of advice for a new teacher? Hello r/teaching ! Fairly new to Reddit so I apologize if this question has been asked previously.. (might post on r/teachers too)

I am currently halfway through my student teaching experience (History/SS) in my masters program and I am extremely anxious/nervous for whats to come.

I am great at communicating and relating to the kids, but my big concern is the amount of work I will have in my first few years planning lessons. History is what I studied in undergrad but I don't feel as knowledgable and prepared as I should be and I don't want anyone to think that I don't know what I am talking about. My content knowledge is decent, but could be better.

That being said, I am anxious to hear from the teaching community what your biggest pieces of advice for a new teacher might be? It doesn't need to pertain to content knowledge, but rather tips/tricks/hacks that might make the first couple years less stressful and time consuming than they need to be.

Thanks everyone &amp; happy Friday!",4.807882124352332,6.971839253886015,5.19416774611399,79.30762467616582,70.96891191709844,7.519300518134714,34.34229274611398,8.278499904357787,2.945943264248704,828,43,141,13,16,263,118,193,0.042,0.838,0.12,0.9411,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,1,8,4,6,0,1,6,0,26,0,0,1,0,29,38,13,0,7,6,0,1,0,0,5,0,2,0,1,9,6,0,0,8,0,0,1,4,1,0,2,2,3,19,5,25,25,5,18,0,0,0,0,10,7,0,5,9,104,28,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629839663425156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579737640678536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3040324859771458,0.0,0.09408856008422817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12579687890966573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14121403835183624,0.11900875039687285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11591285502570745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10743644329192176,0.1488897887302126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12857932153747995,0.0,0.13162701009887193,0.0,0.0,0.06803835962934894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22891596070332526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14835457700075907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14324326545696844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15166063941315364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07395150534285802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898208753239284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.428245599923296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995513592978708,0.0,0.3898811323068836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12887276264226927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15073972482795306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12799884236590278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541397937009534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10815547174544636,0.0,0.12388619054839395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08622160386196408,0.0,0.0,0.07846391826129953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936788485836828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796240645202876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17330644477074356
teaching,FlippinCanadian,2019/01/18,"Help! Just got hired for the first time and only have a week to prepare for the new semester! Hi there!

I am a new teacher who has been subbing for the last month in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, and I applied for a full time English/Social Studies (with a little bit of LST) position for the new semester and somehow got it! As excited as I am, I am also terrified of what to do next. While I have the opportunity to go into the school late next week, I have never planned a semester's worth of material and was wondering if anyone had any advice on where to start. I know a lot of my information will come from my co-workers and the school itself, but I wanted to get a jump on planning during the weekend. I was hoping someone, anyone, can help point me in the right direction of how to start in order to make this task a little less daunting!

teaching,robosmithhere,2019/01/18,"Tutoring- dealing with a passive aggressive student who frequently commits to a deadline and then doesn't finish work by the deadline  

I'm a tutor (male, not that it should make a difference, but there  
are gendered norms, etc.)  
the female student that I'm tutoring has told me twice already that she ""forgot"" to finish the work

that's absolutely impossible, given that I assigned the tasks before the winter break and you don't just suddenly ""forget"" to finish the task after the winter break  
a few days ago, she also came up with this excuse  
moreover, she often commits to a deadline and then purposely procrastinates and delays getting the homework done

there's been at least three other times where she said she would finish work by this date but then she comes to the lesson saying she needs more time  
she challenges my views in a brash and abrupt manner, a bit arrogant

feel like I'm facing some resistance (passive-aggressive from her)

I have bought two books, used all the free resources I can find. I bought the practice test as well from the website. Does anyone have another suggestions? 
While taking the test I noticed I got asked a lot of questions that weren’t in anything I studied from. I feel like I’m running out of options. I was going to apply for the program my schools has, but I need to apply by April. If I’m unable to pass these test then I need to pass them by then.

I have heard that even if you don't pass them before graduation you are still able to graduate, but it is in individualized studies and you can only be a sub or a para.

I have a Casper exam for masters tomorrow and I'm rather nervous I've looked at the test questions and have an idea for those questions.

Any tips to help with the exam I'm just nervous as the last time I had a EQ or over glorified personality test I went terribly in it.

teaching,ipunchtrees,2019/01/20,"Any tips on becoming a history teacher despite the over saturated job market? I’ve been at my local community college for a little over 2 years now, and have completed all basics except for math. Over that time I have found that the only classes I have enjoyed have been History and English. 

My initial plan out of high school was to be a history teacher, but decided to work towards becoming a paramedic instead and have decided that it is not for me. 

I am fully aware that History teachers are not in high demand right now. I’m willing to move to just about anywhere in the country (US) to gather some classroom experience and either stay there, or use that experience to find a better job elsewhere. If you were in my position, how would you move forward?

I live in Oregon, and have just started looking into what things would need to be done to get setup. Anyone have any info or advice?

Any constructive feedback would be appreciated.

teaching,danny069,2019/01/21,"Any tips for first time teacher? Hello all, I’m new to this subreddit, and I have been recruited to teach.  This will be my first time teaching the subject of cyber security at a computer training company.  I have never taught in front of a class before so I don’t know what I’m going to talk about for 6 hours every Saturday besides the curriculum given to me.

I am pretty liberal in comparison with my students, but my classes often strike a cool and respectful dynamic. We begin our school year by reading TKAM and I don’t want to teach this novel any more for various reasons. In short, I think it just reinforces students’ preconceived biases. I don’t like the language, I don’t like the portrayal of the black characters, I think the Finches are self-righteous, and we could teach way better literature with the same intentions/unit objectives. I brought this up in a department meeting today and I didn’t get the radical response I was anticipating (most of my co-workers love TKAM), and some actually seemed to be in agreement with cutting it. My goal for the next meeting is to come with a few recommendations of what could replace TKAM for next year. I want my students to be exposed to literature that represents non-white people in a positive way, not as subservient humans like in TKAM. I mentioned The House on Mango Street, but they read that in an earlier grade. Any idea we might reach will need to be approved by my board before we can add it to the curriculum. What are some novels that I could propose?

teaching,softdelivery,2019/01/22,"I'm a former teacher who quit midyear Okay, I promised myself I'd write this post if I got out of teaching, because I spent a lot of time looking for people who quit teaching in the middle of the year to know it was possible and to find advise.

&amp;#x200B;

I taught for 3 1/2 years. Middle school. I hated it. I taught at two different campuses, I thought I hated teaching at the first campus because of the administration, but then when I switched campuses, I found out it wasn't just the admin. It's the whole job that I hated. I started going to therapy, I got put on an anti-depressant. I got home from work around 6 and would immediately crawl into bed. I lost 20 pounds in a semester, because being at school made me so anxious that I couldn't eat. I knew I had to get out, and making it to June seemed impossible. I was able to quit at semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I started applying for jobs. Anywhere. Anything. I needed benefits and a salary, but I'd take a pay cut. I probably applied to 30-40 jobs by the end of it. I was exhausted. Applying for jobs isn't hard but it's tedious and incredibly time consuming.

&amp;#x200B;

I now work at a local university. I did take a pay cut. I do now have to work summers.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, I feel like myself again. I've started exercising again. I've started saying yes to social events again. I don't leave work feeling like I've been hit with a bag of rocks over and over again. I'm not scared of checking my email anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom texted me Saturday night just to say that she and my dad had seen a huge difference in me and they were glad to see my happy again.

&amp;#x200B;

I spent a lot of time reading about how quitting teaching mid year is career suicide. Maybe it is if you want to remain teaching. However, even thought I broke my contact, my principal didn't pull my teaching certificate. And, I had a principal contact me and tell me if I wanted to work at their school the following year, he could make it work. I don't want to. I actually enjoy going to work now.

teaching,-hollygolightly_,2019/01/22,"Teachers of Reddit that carry a Masters degree, what’s it in? Currently, I am in school for secondary education with a focus in English Language Arts. I’m working on my undergrad but am trying to get a long term plan together as I am very much a goal oriented person. I’m not sure what the options for graduate programs are in education. My school offers programs in Educational Studies, Behavioral Studies, Educational Leadership, and Educational Psychology, just to name a few. My question is- do you have one of these degrees? What do you do with it? Would you get it again? 
In the education field, once you are licensed do you have to stay in the realm of education for your masters? Or could you get a masters in something like literature? Or is this considered pointless?

* ***Why is Elementary Education Important?***

There are a number of reasons due to which, elementary education is considered the most crucial stage of a child’s educational career. It is not important for the child’s own self, but for the entire society and country at large, despite the fact that in whatever area or region of the world one resides in. Elementary education builds up the basic acumen of a child varying from observation, language, arithmetic, analytical, problem-solving, practical, quantitative as well as reasoning skills. Primary education is the way towards one’s future educational prospects, as primary education is followed by secondary education.

Elementary schools are a good way for a child for interacting with the world. The primary education system introduces the children to local languages and environments and gradually extend the perspectives to a larger frame of references. In this way, children begin to accept what they once considered unfamiliar and distant.

The primary education broadens up minds and enhances adaptability. A child is familiar with the mother tongue. Elementary school broadens up the knowledge base and teaches international languages, which further leads to the acceptance of different languages and cultures. This practice enhances the adaptability of a kid as an individual, which is likely to be of great use in future.

Elementary education is an excellent way for children to socialize. Parents are the first teachers for their child. Besides, they are the first people a child know. **Primary schoo**l is the second place that develops a child’s acceptance levels for the outside world. Besides, elementary schools act as a place of socialization with the other kids of the same age for a child becoming the place where the first outside interactions for a child take place.",10.028926553672315,14.056892323917141,9.329577777777779,47.08959830508474,61.730696798493405,12.910900188323915,46.21322033898305,11.792908689023552,7.780268519774013,2948,189,313,115,50,935,237,531,0.006999999999999999,0.852,0.142,0.9969,5,0,0,0,0,0,141.0,0,0,3,15,4,17,0,0,66,0,27,2,0,6,1,50,35,25,0,2,5,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,21,17,19,0,2,12,0,1,7,2,0,1,8,0,0,3,17,72,33,7,63,0,0,0,0,38,33,0,3,15,224,20,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495213267171203,0.279830032619529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1695596417326264,0.0,0.0,0.16111819050534765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061289817710604926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16040410954399892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016091681225513,0.3264771494815891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438601171873055,0.0,0.16926518976813726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05145329952485461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04218749376850783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084413845513666,0.03750301905267656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07750976975834255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05691954266411176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08175116810472867,0.10403456320195954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08523735157562468,0.0,0.0,0.05321850084110067,0.06702737486982853,0.32080821908799784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07345279284472958,0.0,0.07716903501807011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15785237994679055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884463948935511,0.0,0.0,0.08008160674310895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3130049748722353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05433396321521869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11543396814072865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629946002970491,0.08454471473269448,0.0,0.0,0.2437268005011992,0.0,0.0,0.06902006630801064,0.0,0.0692675814864222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.279830032619529,0.04943350730259405
teaching,madreader121,2019/01/23,"Could Sustainability Handbooks Help Children Learn about the Environment? I've been working with a sustainability advocate from London called Bel Georgieva to put together a Sustainability Handbook. We received a lot of great feedback and some of which came from teachers who have found it very useful and insightful. They've been requesting a version for children in their schools and I wanted to hear your thoughts. 

Bel is a sustainability enthusiast, who's been living free from meat for years and is passionate about educating and supporting society to become more conscious about how our lifestyles may be impacting the environment.  Is there a place where children could do with resources to help them consider changes they may be able/want to make? 

The [**booklet is available here**](https://sustainability.iwondr.co/Handbook) if anyone is interested and I'd love your thoughts.

*Full Disclosure - I work for an organisation that supports environmental communities and the acceleration of knowledge exchange. Just thought people here may be interested and have suggestions/comments on how to improve the next booklet in the series.*

teaching,micheruuuu,2019/01/23,"What are some good places to get a Master's in Elementary Education &amp; teach in MA? I am thinking of pursuing a Master's in Elementary Education in Massachusetts. From the research I've done, it seems like there are not many opportunities available for elementary school (&amp; teaching in general unless it's science-related/SPED). 

I was planning on going to Boston, I've never been there but it seems like such a culturally rich city with a European vibe (I don't like U.S. cities in general but Boston is one of the few that appeals to me) that's not overwhelming like NYC. Sadly the area also is highly competitive and expensive... 

Working as a teacher I'm doubting whether I can make it there, or even find a job....

Regardless, I've applied to BU. But I need to apply for more schools as backup, though I'm unsure of where I should go. 

UMass Amherst seems like it has an amazing program, but I'm not sure if I could mentally handle living in a landlocked, rural area. (I have lived in Louisiana, Hawaii, and Japan.. so always near an ocean/large body of water). 

In the end I'm willing to make sacrifices if it means if there is more work opportunity, a more reasonable CoL, and a reasonably good school system. 

I also have a high interest in teaching ESL. (I have been teaching in rural Japan for the past 2 1/2 years. In the U.S. it would be a plus if I could work with children of immigrants). 

I would really like to work in the same area where I choose to complete my graduate studies. I have moved 4 times in my life (only 1 of those moves was my choice) and frankly I'm just tired of not having a place to call home.

teaching,cabritadorada,2019/01/24,"Principal ""commends"" the classroom library I've built myself, now that she has $$ she wants to buy books for all the other classes, not mine. I'm so steamed about this, please help me sort it out. 

I work at high poverty urban school that has very little money and hasn't spent $$ on books in 5+ years. Sooo, I've bought my own books for a classroom library. Literally thousands spent between my own funds, donors choose and other donations I've sought. One teacher on another grade has done the same thing -- and we share with all students on the grade.  It's been great -- this year students are really reading, loving it and making progress. It's a good library but it needs constant care and feeding. The books are getting read so much that some are falling apart. I spent $55 on replacements and sequels last week. I can't really keep it up. I recently took a second job (not just for a book budget, but I'm not flush with cash).

&amp;#x200B;

So, today I get an email from the principal that says, ""I commend those teachers who worked hard to build up their classroom libraries with high interest books for our students.  I am presently in the process of buying additional books to supplement the **other classroom libraries**. Please take a look at this book list and let me know what you think."" \[emphasis mine\]  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel taken for granted. I don't want commendations. I want resources. I know how to choose books for kids and care for a library, how to get them reading -- I've been working so hard and at great cost to do it for the whole grade -- and now the principal goes, ""I'm going to invest 100% of my book resources elsewhere.""

teaching,t_heffington26,2019/01/24,"What do you do when a student thinks you dislike them? So like it says I have a student who believes I dislike him for the simple fact that I make him follow the school’s (not mine) dress code rule of having to be clean shaven. I have home first thing in the morning and that is when our principal expects us to check dress code and the rule for facial hair is no mustache, goatee, beard, or sideburns longer than the ear lobe. 

This kid consistently comes in with excessive facial hair (much longer than what the average adult males 5 o clock shadow would be) and throws a fit when I send him to shave for it. 

And no he’s not the only one I send down to shave and I am not being a pushover but if I notice it from across the room it’s obviously not clean shaven and being clean shaven and not wearing tank tops are the only two things guys have to watch out for compared to the dozen that the ladies do so being lenient with it is out of the question.

He can do the work very well during maybe the rare 1% of the time he can focus on it, most of the time he is unfocused and unorganized, and unable to do any work without EXTREME hand holding.  What he does turn in shows nothing of what he can actually do.

I am going to try to get him on an SST, but that was denied last year.  I have tried multiple things to help him deal with some of his attention problems, by giving him something to fidget with (since he is a heavy fidgeter), but all anything ends up doing is distracting him more.

If anyone knows of any colleges he can non-matriculate into or went down this pathway, that would be so helpful. Thanks in advance!

teaching,mo8816,2019/01/24,"I feel completely unappreciated by my honors students and I’m demoralized. 4th year teacher here. I’ve been having a hard time connecting with my two honors chemistry classes and decided to do one-on-one conferences as a way to start off semester 2 and get to know them better. They had to answer questions about themselves and then say what I can do to help them be even more successful in semester 2.

But they used it as an opportunity to tell me all the stuff I SHOULD be doing for them even though I give them endless resources and work my ass off for them. 

On top of labs, tests and hw packets I thoughtfully and carefully design myself, they get a weekly schedule every Monday with ALL materials and PowerPoints, they get study guides, note outlines, answer keys to everything,  and today they basically said it’s not good enough and I should be doing more. 

I know I’m a good teacher and I make chemistry digestible and fair for them, and it’s still not enough in their eyes. I’ve never had a group of honors kids so delusional and unappreciative. I felt so demoralized leaving school today and I don’t know how I can even be around them tomorrow when I’m so angry and disappointed in them. What can I do to give them a reality check?",6.154719887955181,6.8667709705882345,6.860184873949581,74.13873669467787,66.18487394957984,10.044145658263307,31.412885154061627,10.047579312681364,3.068578935574229,993,37,183,22,15,328,130,238,0.104,0.7709999999999999,0.125,0.6349,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,15,8,13,10,0,0,8,0,19,3,2,3,3,40,38,26,0,2,3,0,3,0,0,2,1,2,0,1,6,19,1,0,10,0,1,0,4,1,0,1,6,6,32,9,26,26,6,22,0,1,1,1,24,8,1,1,13,130,38,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13037143138434856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295230068150168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14931540044218822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15354989990670162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3026437236014363,0.0,0.2901862691455904,0.0,0.12339032982693444,0.0,0.13161969790270564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07404945341049719,0.0,0.14061483935102356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295420340567453,0.28097611541467343,0.0,0.24567040143743696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119031572969894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09816225925572007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2414550517981602,0.0,0.0,0.15506926415080066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977564238588766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11295116628038207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923822047265687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16405736839580953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393073608183077,0.11646281282332215,0.0,0.14821508464805616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10365797009668302,0.0,0.11695505348306445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16765006063649632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280036393661506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14388625140047853,0.11626483630590455,0.08539609554591428,0.0,0.277634701199107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14306024069693316,0.0,0.0,0.12648566455502805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11624508826109865,0.117473250109762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066172478594059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09430891321970043

- I applied to be a substitute in the district I graduated from 



- the high school principal hired me and said he would start me at the higher rate of pay for subs bc I was an alumnus 



-I usually have to fill out time sheets at one of the schools bc im not certified 



-yesterday, the front desk told me I didn’t have to fill out the time sheets anymore bc ‘district told them I was certified’ 




I’m kind of worried. I told them I wasn’t certified. I’m not sure why they now think I am. Am I going to have to repay parts of my paychecks? I’m really really scared

teaching,keexity,2019/01/24,"Ugh, it’s my art class terrible? Hey guys- I kind of entered into a unique situation this year. I was a 1/2 math teacher and got laid off, but actually landed into a 3-8 art class after the art teacher quit the same day (I know, it’s crazy). So basically, I am now teaching art with absolutely no professional background. Don’t get me wrong, I actually do a lot of art during my free time, but I’ve never taught it, so I was basically thrown to the wolves. 

So far, I’ve done my best. I’ve researched lesson plans, read books, and even asked for student input. For the most part, the students seem to be enjoying it, but the middle schoolers are sometimes difficult. I’m having a hard time reaching ALL of my students. Some of my students claim “they’re just not into art” (I don’t buy this), and some art SUPER talented and would benefit from very technical training/classes. 

Today, I had an 8th grader complain that I never taught them anything. She said she wanted to learn to do portraits and technical drawing. From what I know, they did this at the beginning of the year. I explained that although technical drawing was important, there are other areas of art that we need to explore as well. She said okay, but I don’t really feel like she was content with my response. 

Am I terrible art teacher? Am I not giving these students what they need? So far we’ve had units in color theory, architecture, and collage, so I feel like I actually AM teaching them a wide spectrum of skills. Am I letting this one kid get to me, or does she have a point? I tend to believe that if a kid speaks up like this, there’s usually some truth to their statement...

Hey guys, I’m going to read Night with my kids, and I really wanted to make it much more discussion based than question based when it came to the assignment.

I’ve heard about Socratic Seminars, but I have only seen it in action once (1st year teacher here, hehe) so I’m not that familiar with it.

I'll be at a high school in a fairly rural area with a high black population. I am from a big city, and am a white female. I look young, and am short. 

I would love advice on how to handle a classroom that probably won't respond well to me at first. They don't have to like me, but I would like their respect. I need to earn that, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that in a student teaching/observing position.

teaching,chidropbears,2019/01/25,"The End is in Sight But it Feels Further Away Than Ever Hi all!

I'm in the final year of my education degree, with my course work finishing at the end of the year and then a whole-term placement to cap everything off at the beginning of next year (I'm in Australia).

Despite only having 7 subjects left, I feel like the reality of being in a classroom - my own classroom - is further away than ever. I find myself longing for the career I've been working towards more than I have at any other point throughout my degree. I'm starting to hate my current job for little reason other than it's not teaching! 

How did you get through the end of your degree? What do you think I can do to take graduating off my mind somewhat?

Even if it's just a personal anecdote I can relate to, any help would be greatly appreciated! :)",4.08907867494824,5.476816080745344,5.473555900621118,79.71646221532092,71.4223602484472,7.35424430641822,30.186853002070393,7.793537801064563,2.087893995859213,643,27,119,8,12,216,101,161,0.03,0.885,0.084,0.8593,2,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,3,0,2,5,3,1,0,11,0,13,0,0,2,3,18,24,5,0,2,4,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,6,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,3,15,2,29,19,4,33,0,0,1,0,6,17,0,2,17,88,21,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20948264295757998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28942046199270804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40925754681981896,0.0,0.0,0.10173112718943313,0.2786463065790837,0.0,0.0,0.13842646932329927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557579078856791,0.11003448198468828,0.0,0.16872531195174448,0.14077476898538294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0804709675985122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16981154943170867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206640546809547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032387643042019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528446447800919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1673470789409091,0.0,0.0,0.07524814502527684,0.15437209854322148,0.0,0.13630602846864506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15551991660882886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16380583311134428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1171418791810728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344874560041184,0.0,0.0,0.1456020754067063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15836190097305605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10901868828411132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11580656964304865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09869209593858504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17196183541211205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242620128341939,0.0,0.0,0.10941393770501888,0.0,0.0,0.2975584222743957

teaching,Alannabobana,2019/01/25,"What would you change? In light of the LAUSD strikes, I’ve been wondering a lot about what changes would be most beneficial to make teaching manageable to me. Here are some of the thoughts that most often bubble to the surface. 

*The whole school funding model is stupid and desperately needs to be re-done. 

*Teachers &amp; school staff should be paid more 
1) because they deserve it but also 
2) to make it a more competitive and desirable field. My school is in need of so many specialists but we cannot find people to fill those spots. 

*I feel like work load has only increased with time. I fantasize about what it must have been like to teach without having to respond to e-mail.  I feel like full time teachers should have fewer teaching hours and more planning and collaboration hours. This would mean hiring more staff (circling back to funding &amp; pay). 

What would you change?

I don't mind particularly if this is on my phone, or on a website I have to log into or if it can be downloaded onto my mac, but I don't want to be importing class lists all the time, so I really do need to to save these lists for me to come back to.

Bonus points if it allows me to weight it so certain students are selected more often (i.e. put into the hat more than once), although no big deal if not as I can always just add their names multiple times manually.

teaching,moksorivoz,2019/01/26,"650+ Students Hello all,

I was a former public school teacher in the U.S. who wanted a change in lifestyle, so I moved to Asia to teach English. While my quality of life has improved tremendously, I am still on the road to finding professional satisfaction. Aside from feeling useless (I am the only foreign teacher at the large middle school I am employed at) due to not having any responsibilities outside of the classroom and being unable to collaborate with other educators and/or participate in professional development, I also struggle with having to remember 650 different faces (I see 22 homeroom classes once a week for 40 minutes). I teach seventh and eighth graders, so I repeat the same seventh grade lesson 10 times and eighth grade 8 times during the week.

While I seem to have a solid grasp on classroom management and student engagement, I find myself losing stamina by the fifth or sixth lesson because of the redundancy, so I am currently seeking advice to create a ‘curriculum’ that is more project/cumulative-based rather than random key expressions/phrases taught in isolation, which are provided by a textbook (that my co-teachers encourage I use). Because my school does NOT have clear expectations for what my role is (students are taught reading and writing in their native language twice a week and see me for conversation/listening once a week), I have avoided the textbook as much as possible and create lessons based around the topic/expression but turn it into something more creative (games, movie clips, dialogue practice, etc.) but it’s a bit pointless (to me) to do something so random and different every single week. I love film and photography (and have a quality camera available to use, but no other form of technology in the classroom) and really want to incorporate content (current event, a famous music group, etc.) into their English learning rather than teaching phrases in insolation like their native teachers have been doing, but I have no idea where to start with the overwhelming amount of students I have. I will have each class about 15 times total for the upcoming semester, so it’s not much time to see any drastic improvement, but it’s certainly enough time to have a fun and productive semester! Any general ideas would be greatly appreciated.",13.904621212121205,10.710795775252526,12.346404040404042,53.56627272727275,53.368686868686865,15.004444444444443,50.89494949494949,12.913307274991677,6.686074949494947,1861,97,264,44,15,592,225,396,0.041,0.84,0.12,0.9852,5,2,2,0,0,0,55.0,0,0,3,4,12,12,0,3,26,0,28,3,1,2,4,58,42,28,0,6,11,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,11,19,0,1,12,3,0,1,5,5,0,1,4,4,28,7,49,34,15,38,0,3,3,1,12,17,0,4,21,191,39,27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09854518237071104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064621377677733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2057354593776692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08977399110415912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294911991340872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11009730903471296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668130475476544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2107244386430552,0.0,0.0,0.08825069029060689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10420049339730844,0.22493906929870355,0.0,0.0,0.08496679260631577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050990580537109115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18434215746684632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11118266295389737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22768488231397735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07123025074053449,0.04926808084756289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128204645173832,0.0,0.0,0.09101711823874703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10718294499089016,0.14826628281051393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21479460914382148,0.0,0.0766976457983099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11368829535011027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10087292013497423,0.0,0.06460429279806985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11423843996808868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30618348397517525,0.2410827314487662,0.09180607394152238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15527178549946982,0.0,0.0,0.07137905587536564,0.0,0.08053545028604768,0.0,0.0,0.10542574827941108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2940194887968836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10969108675275238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17419649081079205,0.0,0.0,0.1189627306412871,0.0,0.40446140685682896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716378420609611,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have a project that required a ruler and I cannot tell you how many students didn’t even know where to begin. They just had to make a grid. Something I spend a week on is completely forgotten a week later, even if it’s a related topic. One of the other teachers at our school is now bashing the education system (I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s not militaristic or a “prison” whatsoever. At least in my class and other classes I’ve seen at my school) and what they are telling me makes me feel like my job as a math teacher is pointless. I already have students regularly complaining about math and how it’s pointless. So I don’t need to hear it from a colleague. 

Basically, I don’t know if my students are learning and I’m starting to believe the criticism that math is only to make students feel dumb. I try really hard to make it engaging, fun, and a welcoming environment. I constantly tell students there’s nothing wrong with being wrong because we are all learning here. I constantly tell students to never laugh at a students question or say “ that’s so easy though” in response. I make my room colorful in inviting so they don’t feel like they’re in a prison cell. I try to make a real life reference or where this could be seen in real life on a daily basis. Students get to do scavenger hunts, Kahoot, and fun activities over what we are learning AFTER we get through how to do these topics. I tell my students first we have to learn how to do the math, then we can have fun. I really try to make it all positive. 

I don’t really know what I’m asking for with this post. I just know that I’m kind of down in the dumps with the lack of retention, the negativity, and the frustration of having to worry about teaching something they should’ve learned early on in elementary school in addition to teaching their grade level curriculum.",5.0529438280166445,6.064601055825242,6.015561719833567,78.14174757281556,68.78155339805825,8.992510402219137,33.16088765603329,9.23628265651192,2.988480998613038,1673,76,314,32,28,554,183,412,0.103,0.757,0.141,0.9645,3,0,2,0,0,0,39.0,6,1,6,5,20,21,3,0,23,0,29,5,1,12,4,70,65,27,0,5,11,0,8,3,0,0,2,2,1,0,20,19,0,1,18,0,1,0,12,8,0,2,4,13,41,13,51,58,4,39,0,2,3,2,27,23,1,6,17,209,61,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207961055690046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800640352048673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050865075761854284,0.0,0.0,0.09400983376419836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748667357232012,0.180340924151307,0.0,0.06662113258194352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022445654185964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21095228204867586,0.1192210419043416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097517425581938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13078399280527567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14949412972678672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404447184045744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16560533999439594,0.0,0.0,0.0868913313212046,0.27514312040435696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787419391061545,0.12229569435148804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15061816198766026,0.0,0.3898842685182334,0.08459643771151487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06187070772888344,0.06435511726148219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08006423090797693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056542021881255185,0.06346091077405805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07991375312810195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09347341447111963,0.0,0.0,0.1899490601081585,0.1603640066734529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663559148848622,0.0,0.33778842544285764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284744638867086,0.0,0.0,0.1181204416092495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3646571121211992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08198070800089821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699536091953359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338632443534887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08043448896965426,0.0,0.0,0.08473874672294616,0.0,0.0,0.18246004651799236,0.0,0.05373349712911208
teaching,hobbscalvin,2019/01/26,"Middle school ELA station work advice I'm looking to do some station work with my middle school block classes once or twice a week to build skills and am looking for advice on what to do. They are low kids as all other students in the school only have one hour classes while kids who struggle in language arts have me for 2 hours. I don't know what kind of stations would benefit them/what they'd do so I'm coming here to ask for advice from those that successfully do station work. 

Some ideas I have are vocab, punctuation and grammar practice and games but I'm feeling overwhelmed as to how to do this/set it up or where to find resources. Has anyone done this with middle schoolers and if so do you have any advice or resources?

I'd love to also hear from elementary school teachers as well, what about station work works for you and what do you have students work on?

teaching,johnnyx101,2019/01/27,"School charges for appliances in classrooms Hi all. My wife is an elementary school teacher. She is currently on her second year teaching 1st grade. Her school has a very odd policy involving appliance usage at the school. 

So basically, the school allows the teachers to bring in their own appliances, such as microwave, mini fridge, etc., however, the school then charges a fee amount, depending on the appliance, for each year. 

For instance, my wife wanted to bring in her own mini fridge. This allows her to keep cold water for her and also for her students, and so that she can store her snacks and lunches. Every year the school charges a fee so she can continue to use her mini fridge, which is around $100 a year. She has been thinking of bringing in her own microwave so she can finally eat hot lunches but her school wants her to pay another $100-$150 just to use her own microwave.  This goes for any appliance she wants to bring in. Coffee maker? That’ll be $60-80 a year. A toaster oven? $50 a year, and so in. 

I think this policy is absolutely bizarre and a total money grab from the teachers. 

Is this something normal that schools do?

Now, I know that I could just sign up and save myself some trouble, but I'm more upset about the principle of the matter, here: didn't all the educational experts who cream their jeans at technology insist that sharing ideas would be so much easier with our PLNs and Web 2.0s and our GFY's?

teaching,hotgothsingles,2019/01/27,"Need advice from experienced teachers [tw: death and vehicle accidents] This will definitely give away where I work, but I don’t particularly care about that at the moment. For anyone wondering about the title in brackets, I put that there in case someone didn’t want to read about that sort of stuff on this subreddit for whatever reason. 

Friday evening, there was a horrendous accident with a bus being hit by a train. One middle school student was killed and an elementary student was injured. Bus driver is physically okay, but he is depressed. I don’t know if he will mentally make it. 

I teach at the high school. There are definitely students who are affected, as there are siblings, cousins, friends, kids with PTSD which will resurface, and students who will have to confront the concept of death for the first time. 

I have no idea what to do in the classroom. I plan on having a relaxed, finish your work day on Monday. But there are teachers saying to keep everything routine, everything business, so I don’t know if we need to do what we were originally planning to do (more intensive assignment). I’ve never been in a situation like this before. Any advice for what I need to do in the classroom, and for this situation in general would be greatly appreciated.

teaching,lana1129,2019/01/28,"A smartphone app that can help your newcomer families Hi all, 

I am a former teacher who now works for a company called the Refugee Center Online  The Refugee Center Online is an organization that uses technology to help refugees and immigrants. We offer free classes and resources that refugees and newcomers can use anytime. Our goal is for them to adjust to their new life and become a citizen. 

We just launched a new smartphone called FindHello with the help of  UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) . It helps refugees and immigrants find the resources you need in their communities. They can enter their home address and find help in their towns or cities city. The database shows newcomers places that can help them with healthcare, housing, and legal help. They can find community centers and places of worship, and many other resources. The app is free to download and is in English, Spanish, or Arabic.

teaching,AlsoKnownAsTea,2019/01/28,"Printable Worksheets &amp; Infographics Design Hi there! 

Midway through primary school I was about 2 years behind in Maths and English. In saying that, it was extra worksheets and the more ‘visual’ hand outs from my teacher at the time that really helped me to level up and later exceed where I needed to be for my age. 

Many years later and now working in the creative industry, I’m really interested in possibly creating a series of free activity sheets or infographics for primary/elementary aged children that could hopefully help with their understanding in a similar way. 

I was just wondering if this is something viable coming from someone who isn’t a teacher and if so, are there any particular subject areas that could benefit from a few extra child-friendly printables. 

I’d really appreciated any opinions before starting down that road :) ",11.29042074363992,10.609237650684936,11.052504892367912,52.970479452054825,56.05479452054794,14.09628180039139,44.14481409001957,13.023866798666859,6.3329992172211345,691,34,93,21,7,229,104,146,0.0,0.804,0.196,0.982,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,1,7,4,0,0,7,0,9,1,1,0,0,19,16,9,0,6,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,8,8,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,2,7,5,21,10,4,24,0,0,0,0,7,13,0,6,9,70,15,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21311015384894866,0.0,0.26750764809894945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16736604941924316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16942833250084302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31407694052112906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15195979668595913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2636701412751534,0.0,0.0,0.19535445297299076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1994096265380823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14584083036612489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22173490605957066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3780079580886545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15641330254243166,0.0,0.1990576246134257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16665215635824748,0.15141917057248475,0.0,0.0,0.13921598701435448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468970227285012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047579800987312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15612089145432193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21329853280465091,0.143190392206766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533198060098193
teaching,futureuindia,2019/01/28,"Admissions | Facilities  **IAMPS ticks all the boxes of an innovative Montessori pre-school. Here are some of points that make IAMPS stand**  
**out from the crowd:**

* **Curriculum:We use methods practiced in America and adopted globally. The special advantage comes from the fact that these methods have been adapted to suit the Indian needs, making a powerful fusion of two cultures.**
* **Montessori Lab:This is laboratory in the sense that it creates a carefully designed environment and uses tools specifically designed to facilitate holistic development of the child covering all five aspects of learning (more detail in the coming sections).**
* **Mid brain training:** **Human brain’s left side is responsible for words, logics, numbers, analysis, lists etc. and tends to be more memory and sequence based. The right brain on the other hand is responsible for Rhythm, Color imagination, Intuition, and holistic awareness. Left brained people are seen as less imaginative, and more like followers of the world. It is believed that those who think different bring about growth, and they are invariably right-brained individuals. It is a scientific program developed by legends of the time such as Dr Maria Montessori, Glenn Doman and a few more. It’s a quite an incredible method as it helps individuals keep a check on the dominance of their left brain, makes the child a smart thinker.**
* **Smart class resource center:** **Black boards, and white boards have lived their life. The modern time calls for smart boards. We have created animated curriculum which is run on each and every class-room through the use of digital boards. We call them smart-boards.**
* **Personnel:All the teachers and mentors are required to have a minimum qualification/training to ensure that they are well equipped to handle child development.**
* **Technology:With the progress and accessibility of technology, it would be naïve to use the methods that are no longer relevant. We aid our kids with many products/tools that make use of technology and assist in making learning fun, faster and better.**
* **Culture:The culture at IAMPS is one of the best assets of the school. It brings the best of American culture, and the best of rooted Indian values together.

teaching,PartyCardiologist,2019/01/29,"Possible Future Teacher and Juvenile Felony Hey, folks!

I've been toying with the idea of teaching for years but always thought my past would have held me back. I got into some trouble when I was about 14 (29 now) for some small drug stuff that got turned into a Juvenile Felony. Record has long been expunged and sealed but it still drives me nuts with worry. I've long since left my ugly past in the past.

For the longest time, I chased down my dream of becoming a firefighter (eventually wanted to be an instructor) and thought my past would have stopped me dead in my tracks. I actually got hired by 2 different departments for the job (only went with one obviously) but found out firefighting just isn't for me. The point of this story is that I took a few psych evaluations, polygraphs, and had deep dives done on my entire life from personal contacts to any wrongdoings they could fine. I passed those with flying colors. 

I say all of that to ask if I would have any trouble getting on as an educator. Do I disclose my full past while interviewing with a school? I haven't the first clue as to where I should start.

teaching,Elohicin,2019/01/29,"Switching from Elementary to Secondary I need advice, all of the academic advisors I've spoken to haven't been of much help.

The colleges even remotely close to where I live only offer bachelors in elementary education, anything for secondary are universities 3+ hours away. Ironically, those universities offer an online master's program for secondary.

Has anyone gotten their bachelors in elementary, and later got their master's in secondary ed in order to teach high school?",9.884500000000003,11.455253450000004,9.9725,52.06250000000003,58.25,12.4,41.0,11.979248473330829,5.9832,396,20,48,12,5,131,58,80,0.0,0.964,0.036000000000000004,0.4019,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,1,4,7,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,14,4,2,11,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,0,2,31,5,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30766876740055465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22015114997470914,0.0,0.2590955578714909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2958128923650001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079561256329977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518151184667149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21103799823098846,0.33265738331769795,0.0,0.0,0.3100648273550429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780192141232874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314517228643884,0.23345803777374816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23945838424166144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3186460357465703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,rlandz,2019/01/29,"Non-teacher here looking for advice on prrsenting to students Hello teachers!

First off let me begin, I am not a teacher - I am a web developer who has  recently agreed to volunteer my time to give a presentation on careers in Technology as part of a STEM Career Fair day at a local high school.

The school is providing me with a classroom to present in but they have never had a tech careers presenter before.

I will be doing 3x one hour sessions and so far I have alloted about 20 mins for hands on activities
and rest of the time is for a slideshow and q&amp;a session. I'm trying to keep the slideshow portion low because they can tend to be boring but if you have advice on how to spice it up that would help!

It has been just about 20 years since I have set foot in a high school and it's my first time to talk to high school students in a setting like this.

I'm looking for any tips or tricks to keep them engaged or feedback from any similar presentations you might have attended.

What was good, what was bad. Etc

Any and all advice welcome!

teaching,LilDcent,2019/01/30,"First day teaching and I already made a mistake (inclusive lingo) Today was my first day as an instructor with a small group of students. I had gone over all the prepared slides and experiments with them fairly smoothly. I admit I was nervous since it’s my first time teaching ever so obviously there’s room for improvement. But at the end of class a student came up and requested if I can use more inclusive terms in classrooms like “everyone”, “folks”, etc. because apparently during my lecture portion I kept saying “guys”, such as “you guys will be doing...”. I did not even realize I was saying that during the lecture part but once they brought it up, I was like oh my god! I felt sooooo bad about it because I obviously don’t want my students feel left out. I’m feeling pretty guilty right now for doing it and wish I didn’t. Hope next week and weeks to come in able to omit that use more inclusive terms but I feel like subconsciously I may slip.

Anyone else ever have a similar experience? Or anything you learned from early on in your teaching career that could help me. Anything is appreciated.",4.2294202898550735,6.480831676328505,5.0273671497584544,79.50163043478264,72.81642512077295,7.691787439613527,29.85748792270532,8.515128840125781,2.4758676328502416,875,38,155,16,18,283,135,207,0.054000000000000006,0.7659999999999999,0.18,0.9757,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,3,2,3,8,7,0,1,8,0,17,0,0,3,5,38,34,13,0,6,6,0,5,3,0,2,0,2,1,2,7,10,0,1,7,0,0,5,3,3,0,3,13,7,25,4,21,17,8,35,0,0,0,0,13,13,0,4,20,104,32,12,0.12815820577823375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14142576693194972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961119730684743,0.13131322685587518,0.2109265671373248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070067486529936,0.15624810544190285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14657884567471818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1103969463748849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232389898580414,0.0,0.0,0.16530288092625306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10705973602593276,0.0,0.11351013094872807,0.0,0.14293027653447354,0.08464728622769815,0.2318528686443237,0.0,0.12246065772035468,0.0,0.25072663376549265,0.0,0.0,0.1944019186941045,0.09155624781519052,0.12305197543757135,0.0,0.0,0.3270339130959476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25379354544972216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08590174387411445,0.0,0.0,0.12729001549281566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13924426556390018,0.0,0.0,0.1878348774666745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126639304314399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362977057682966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13648430652245752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878284793184464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13038296898311832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944640749007199,0.0,0.203833098257159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601379217011128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473008041027819,0.0,0.12147899393209133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213750833107488,0.0,0.0,0.07559103023261803,0.0,0.20560156458298987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14737561184465134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Sinsofasquad,2019/01/30,"History Teacher ( Job Market GA) Hello, I am a current GA student. I am in my last semester to finish my finance and applied economics bachelors. I decided recently to follow my dream of being a teacher (I was always hesitant because of the stigma teacher get, but it really is something I want to do with my life). After I graduate with my current degree, I was planning to go back and get my GA certificate to teach and was going to pursue History with a minor in Math. ( I am not terrible at math, but I do not like it enough to push through a math degree) I was just wondering if having a background in finance/economics and a background in history with a little bit of math thrown in, if it would be hard to find a job. I always hear how saturated the market is, but social studies is definitely what I am passionate about and want to teach. Should I pursue this?



I would not mind teaching middle or high school, and I would not mind coaching.

But is it worth pursuing?",5.5189184397163125,6.1740840478723396,7.1529787234042566,71.68333333333334,67.56382978723404,10.309219858156029,34.815602836879435,10.317481424215053,3.8877113475177305,763,36,132,19,12,265,95,188,0.032,0.86,0.108,0.9276,4,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,0,1,5,3,0,0,10,0,21,2,0,1,0,34,30,14,0,8,12,0,1,1,0,4,1,1,0,0,6,10,0,0,3,2,2,4,4,1,0,0,4,2,21,2,25,20,2,20,0,0,0,1,3,9,0,4,8,104,27,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2855087649601532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319215629915306,0.0,0.1045833756755215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18730265397183424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17727071741905034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568057186645121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17926945285519974,0.0,0.19500671756789384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536869895141952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19336427168113224,0.0,0.0,0.18126601193775127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3405001413463933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13984696152448595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12118020979581615,0.08381714666557276,0.17195146565171876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34645998663332217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10990782249942836,0.0,0.16939802943371068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1736311863680857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17488714607929462,0.0,0.1320777853972182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20238492083238965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860530455608868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3656208692240384,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,prplepeopleeater,2019/01/30,"My team used my personal health information as gossip and told me I need to tell it to all of my students' parents. So I have been sick recently, just fatigue and aches. Well, a week later, I was diagnosed with mono. I'm an adult (F25) so my symptoms aren't as bad as it would be if I was a teenager. 

I told my team out of courtesy. We eat lunch together and 1 of them is pregnant. Well, I immediately got a response: ""So, are you going to tell the parents?"" To which I replied no. I had checked with admin and the school nurse. There is no policy that requires me to share my personal health information to the parents of my students. Also, considering mono is less contagious than a cold. 
The teacher immediately said ""all I know is that if my kid's teacher had mono and no one told me, then I found out, I'd be pissed""
I don't say anything, leave. Then later she comes and gives me a half assed apology.

As I'm walking out of the building for the day, a teacher not on my team comes up to me and says ""How are you feeling? I heard you had mono.""

I understand the risk but I am taking precautions. Would you SERIOUSLY send out notes like instead of, bring Valentines for Valentine's Day! It would say ""oh! Btw I have mono!!!"" :D

TL;DR I have mono. My team said I need to tell the parents of my students. Then immediately told all the other teachers on our hall my personal health info.

teaching,MO-life-MO-problems,2019/01/30,"If I’m scared, is teaching not for me? (F21 working towards bachelors in... idk what) 

I’m only scared because I don’t want my mom to be right about teaching. 

Backstory: I volunteered at the boys and girls club here in my city in California. I absolutely loved it. I loved the kids, loved coming up with instruction for the program leaders (I insisted that I be able to occasionally assist with coming up with instruction and they were fine with it because they were lazy). I absolutely loved what I did. So much that when I was offered a job at another site, I took it! I was going to be in charge of my own third grade class and I was so excited! But, fast forward to when I actually start working.... I start to hate it. I live in a high risk (some would say “ghetto”) city and I was told that the kids at this school were 5 times worse than the kids at the site I volunteered at. I thought “well I love these kids at my first site, so it can’t be too bad”. Hell to the no... these new kids were torture, they emotionally abused me and bullied me and I wanted to cry in front of them almost every day, they were disrespectful and rude and out of hand and uncontrollable. I couldn’t tell if it was me or if it was them, but I have never had a problem handling young kids before, so it just made me feel like shit. I quit about a month and a half later because my health was deteriorating (I have a heart condition and stress is bad for my heart because of it). I kept saying to myself that I never want to do that again, but really, I still want to. I always think about going back but I know they won’t hire me again. And I feel like not all kids are the same, and maybe I just got a bad batch? I know there are misbehaved kids everywhere, and I don’t have a problem with that, what I have a problem with is the fact that I struggle with depression and anxiety currently, and I am also high functioning autistic, and can’t handle pressure of being overwhelmed. 

My mom sees this in me and thinks that teaching is the wrong way to go. I keep telling her that my life will be different once I am “cured” of my mental illness (meaning mentally healthy and happy which I am working towards). I also love kids to death and love learning and teaching, and can’t see myself doing anything else really. But the fact that I have no support from my mom kills me and I have no idea how to go about this. What do you think? Should I teach anyways? Or should I listen to my mom and go into something that I will most likely be miserable in? Idk what to do!!!!!

TLDR; my mom thinks I shouldn’t teach because it is too overwhelming. However, I love kids more than anything and would love the chance to educate them. I am high functioning autistic and also struggle with depression/anxiety, so I do get overwhelmed easily, but these mental illnesses can get better over time, and I can learn to cope with my autism. I hope to be healthy and happy in the very near future and I think teaching would work out for me in that case. My mom can’t see that.",3.676624356144224,4.959363067880798,4.609567328918324,85.92071596762327,72.29470198675497,7.885445180279618,26.50169242089772,8.378751543991594,1.6193445621780715,2359,79,492,38,45,766,244,604,0.153,0.698,0.14800000000000002,-0.5136,4,0,1,0,1,0,79.0,0,1,8,7,27,46,6,12,22,0,62,17,4,2,5,100,112,51,2,18,15,6,3,3,0,9,4,3,0,12,35,43,0,2,14,1,0,10,16,26,1,3,20,9,87,20,69,74,7,64,1,5,3,9,44,33,2,9,25,355,122,21,0.057737031067033234,0.06840894058524663,0.05634301365456429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05781529651677561,0.0,0.0,0.13851684865347513,0.04804183506489618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060542311258261275,0.0883373414661538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09502531410859326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04439621299631168,0.14462402779072184,0.17597979121357984,0.0,0.049129960904769364,0.0,0.0,0.05106371202872887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947067975626862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0634214175050213,0.03723560857283057,0.0,0.049728820255135336,0.0,0.0,0.060322908764407365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04823188080249705,0.06494638875848685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04864593885170638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058387155422337064,0.08249469306138567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04911108913064248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060330431448895626,0.0,0.1640664265289903,0.0,0.0461775781224715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292428637317415,0.0,0.05700336484423309,0.0,0.061371764118964285,0.0,0.13683731961480072,0.0,0.18300702991588347,0.0,0.05734589942488135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06517808029910503,0.0,0.0,0.05729509436398664,0.051319326068711056,0.06387747042283798,0.0,0.06346152464126592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040781372529509696,0.08462219090779184,0.0,0.05098285622363538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4689893226797349,0.05463217481863503,0.0,0.0,0.05800460809126546,0.06289255302265465,0.0,0.0,0.1745560422628038,0.0,0.0,0.4057254778418676,0.046085147354298805,0.0,0.04244336114220899,0.0,0.0890607154679148,0.055762784386753736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06148805375354266,0.0,0.04391161385674198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16573962352435145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06141043953142146,0.0,0.0,0.07397564108543353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04930710906146829,0.0,0.09182960899849002,0.11560968080921386,0.05843295787281351,0.13802681556544108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059266232686878764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044448787291524884,0.0,0.0,0.0817331355202283,0.0,0.046108867592096224,0.0,0.06613757401422124,0.12071856184940667,0.0,0.0,0.06551929864009594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10092942003048927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18497779094310032,0.0,0.045836753378270784,0.0673338542481831,0.0,0.0,0.05517020745065933,0.06414796593635604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04763909734135557,0.1362191873529166,0.045828967823426936,0.0,0.0,0.05191252486794204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16813298504608554,0.0,0.05883896726986732,0.12304419094101494,0.06312637976081885,0.0,0.0
teaching,brokenmsteacher,2019/01/31,"How to get a medical leave of absence I need advice on how to get a medical leave of absence from teaching. I do have disability insurance. I have a history of depression with one suicide attempt. This is my sixth year teaching. I moved back to my home state of MS because I worked at a middle school that had incredibly difficult kids. I thought going back to friends and family would fix things. In my eagerness to get a job, I didn't ask enough questions. I went from a job with horrible kids but amazing admin to a job with the worst kids in the school (although loads better than the ones I left) and shitty admin. I am the fourth teacher for these kids this year. The ap has continued to feed me bs about the previous teachers (I was told there was only one. There were three.) but the other teachers have told me the real story. The other teachers are incredibly supportive and helpful. I am completely burned out. The ap talks to me like I am an idiot and all of the problems with the class are due to my inadequacies as a teacher. I'm done. Every day on the way to work I wish I would have a wreck so I won't have to go. However, I am not completely sure I want to blow up my life and ruin my chances at teaching in the future, so I don't want to up and quit. I have known of teachers who got medical leave and were off for a month. This would help preserve my job and my reputation. (I don't want to make my references look bad by quitting.) I know this is rambling and I may come across horrible, but I am at my wit's end and looking for a way to avoid quitting entirely. Thanks.

teaching,jbarbarossa,2019/01/31,"Third year teaching. Kid finally asked me if I believe in God. I’m positive I didn’t handle it right. I’m an atheist. I was afraid the kids would think differently of me if they found that out. So...I waffled on it: said I’m not sure, gone through periods when I did and didn’t, yadda yadda, awkward segue back to lesson...

Should I have told them the truth? Should I have said “that’s personal” or “I don’t want to talk about it at school,” which is an admission in itself...

I feel like I already have so little in common with these kids (privileged white dude teaching black students at a very underprivileged school), that I didn’t want to widen the divide, especially when it is the second day of the new semester and I just met most of these students...I dunno.

teaching,bailydianne,2019/01/31,"Rough day today Today I found two male students (high school) on the floor of my classroom (set up is weird so I didn’t see them until I walked up front to the board to start teaching after taking roll electronically at my desk). Student A was almost on top of Student B and Student A’s pants had fallen to below his behind (he had on shorts under so it wasn’t like bare cheeks)

I immediately called for an AP to come handle the situation because from my vantage point it looked like wrestling, horseplay, or much worse. 

Student B’s mom emailed me and said her son was sent to the cafeteria because he lost an ear pod. Like - wut?!? That’s not close to what happened. So students fed AP a line of bull about being on the floor looking for something but never mentioned it to me. Mom now wants a meeting. I’ve met with her before and honestly I don’t want to meet alone with her again. Requests for a meeting with an AP present have gone unanswered.

teaching,coiol,2019/02/01,"Looking for teachers to fill out a one-hour survey for $35 USD Apologies if this isn't appropriate content, I'd be happy to take it down if that's the case!

I'm a PhD student in the Graduate School of Education at Stanford University and I'm working on an automatic question and answer generation program that takes paragraphs from Wikipedia and identifies the most important information from an educational standpoint. In order to build our AI model, we need some sample responses from educational experts (i.e., classroom teachers!). 

I've built a survey that will take around one hour to complete. You will need to look at 20 paragraphs and create some question/answer pairs that would be good to assign to hypothetical students to check their reading comprehension. To thank you for your help, we would be happy to send you a $35 USD gift card to the retailer of your choice (Amazon, iTunes, Barnes&amp;Noble, etc.).

In the classroom I’m fine and absolutely adore the students (kinder btw) but I feel awkward and unsure the rest of the day. With this plus my TPAS plus the RICA... I just don’t even know where to start. Does anyone have any advice or tips that could be helpful for me? I’ve tried relaxing like taking a bath or laying on the couch at home after school but I just get more freaked out because I feel like I’m wasting time. Oh and on top of this I tutor during the week so some days I get home around 6-7,2.537784891165174,3.7703315492957765,3.6544046094750335,91.85480793854036,75.05633802816901,5.727016645326503,24.17669654289373,5.565023196281405,0.3460760563380281,528,16,116,2,11,171,98,142,0.093,0.738,0.16899999999999998,0.8849,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,6,10,0,2,11,0,5,0,0,0,1,25,16,14,0,1,7,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,6,10,0,0,5,3,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,4,9,7,18,14,4,18,0,1,0,0,2,9,0,4,11,69,15,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19021649610783184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13237338537341706,0.0,0.0,0.21990692052383395,0.0,0.1361086492987441,0.0,0.0,0.17328593462042416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866105590779835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15541771676422764,0.0,0.0,0.251075228590258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17034558851418738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17240826001076534,0.0,0.0,0.12856906437490276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29527317310508666,0.13906294748317627,0.0,0.0,0.17791290469377352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20340042029060468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743743719998661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13047443491996472,0.0,0.3905135381051478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10697835631467496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901990839801044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970032022764696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13777917476494114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14635778368747224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22701203894867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215927575978564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3122840904945805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,K4956,2019/02/01,"Brand new teacher starting on Monday - need your ideas I graduated at the end of last year and the school year begins on Monday (I'm located in Australia) and I'm feeling quite nervous. My last placement was almost a year ago so I'm feeling rusty in the classroom. I'll be teaching Music to Year 7 - 10, and will also have a Year 7 pastoral care group.

The school I'm working at has a lot of students with traumatic backgrounds, students with disabilities, and in general many students with challenging behaviour. I'm looking forward to the challenge, and all of the other teachers around me seem like they will be extremely supportive. I know this from placements, but they've really emphasised the importance of spending the time to build relationships with my students, and set up expectations and a routine in the classroom.

I'm looking for suggestions on setting up classroom culture, welcome/name games or activities, and any other tips that any of you feel would be relevant or helpful.

teaching,LoveThyFood,2019/02/01,"Mom wants to go back to school and get a teaching certificate I live in North Carolina, and I would like some advice regarding teaching certificate.

My mother is a permanent resident, and she graduated college in Korea and once had a teaching certification for middle school. She is considering if it's possible for her to go back to college and get a teaching certificate so that she can expand her career. The problem is that her English isn't great.

Do you think someone with medium level of English can be a teacher?

This past week I have spent some time thinking about my growth as a teacher, and it is incredible to see how far I have come from being a teacher with a subject area degree (B.A. Lit) and no education experience. I was thrown into the fire day with with remedial seniors that needed a ton of growth. I was terrible that first year and have become a much better teacher due to some good AP's and research on my own. However, I don't think any of it is due to any real quality professional development. I wish that I had been provided with more useful PD. Does anyone feel the same way and if so what are some of the things you wish you had received PD on or still want PD on?

teaching,CalmInteraction,2019/02/01,"Classroom Debate with Video Does anyone have a good debate topic that would be appropriate for middle school and also a video or resources we could watch on that topic.  

My kids are participating in a statewide essay writing test next week. About 1/3 of my students will be testing each day so I want to review argument writing but not go too heavy since they will be testing and probably exhausted. 

I’m hoping to find a debate topic that I can show a video on and then have students outline an essay. It would be great if it was a topic students didn’t already know a lot about. 

We have done lots of textbook/article sources in the last few weeks so I’m hoping to find something interactive that has a video portion I can show to mix things up. 

Any ideas would be much appreciated!

I can't force myself to plan my lessons for next week because I'm so anxious about everything, though I'm excited to get stuck in with the kids so I can forget about this shit.

I've been sitting on the couch having a mild freakout trying to write a single 45 minute reading lesson plan for my current assignment, and the thought of having to do 7 hours of lessons 5 days a week every week is making me loopy with fear. 

Anyone got anything to pull me down to earth and snap me out of this and get back to work??",10.013333333333335,5.988655439490447,9.646847133757964,72.50513269639066,61.48407643312103,12.250106157112524,40.17940552016985,9.2995712137729,3.5767545647558388,612,22,125,7,6,200,106,157,0.123,0.833,0.044,-0.8865,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,4,2,3,0,2,11,0,12,2,2,1,0,20,23,7,0,1,3,0,2,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,5,7,0,0,8,1,0,4,2,2,0,1,5,3,12,1,27,16,5,22,0,0,0,0,1,11,0,1,7,80,17,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391281044517954,0.0,0.13939438351352554,0.0,0.0,0.12740933695189466,0.0,0.1499478573669963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14011249689526087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175139440606635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2135552468615297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1535244449091414,0.0,0.16376357116447945,0.0,0.0,0.4100862656886254,0.18426729625598812,0.13017481273007625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1904001899841186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14573440693810913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17944559485584355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902130505157557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216302827805614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347396050569548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3946433295549953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18317693829475987,0.0,0.0,0.18226484247605848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1844118467765632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23351271119778194,0.0,0.1446587790254847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12371238553428407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.292324617983753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13265507773837432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ARwRedwoods,2019/02/02,"Best option for CA teaching credentials? Moving to CA w/ out of state initial elementary teaching credentials &amp; MAT I will begin a Masters of Arts in teaching + elementary initial licensure program in Colorado this spring. My plan is to move back to California during this program (it's an extended program meaning in part online and in part on campus) to complete my student teaching practicum/final online classes closer to home. I moved to Colorado with the intention of pursuing this program, but I am worried I will be back at square one (with only an initial teacher licensure from CO) the following year when I have graduated &amp; am looking for my first teaching job in Ca. I know Ca is pretty strict, and although Co &amp; Ca share license reciprocity, it is only relevant for professional licenses which I will not have yet. Does anyone have any advice about what route I should take towards attaining relevant licensing in Ca? Should I look for a school district that would sponsor me for an ""internship"" or student teaching program that offers an alternative route to licensure ? Or is there any way I can use my out of state initial license towards a CA teaching license ?
(I know it seems odd to have moved out of state for college only to move back with a seemingly irrelevant credential - but I love this program here in Co and will be receiving my masters through a great school that I can afford in a town I can afford living in).

teaching,Twisttd,2019/02/02,"US teachers who have moved states...what has that been like? Hello everyone, new here. I have spent my entire eight-year career at the same high school in Southern California. I love the school and where I live, but my wife and I are getting close to moving to Idaho or Wyoming for a variety of reasons. There seem to be plenty of openings in a few of the places I have researched, but I have a few questions:
1. Did you experience any culture shock of moving between (what I assume will be) very different places? I am worried that all of my training and experience on the coast may be, I don’t know, considered strange or different elsewhere. I’m all for the new experience, but I’m curious about how much learning curve there will be.
2. How did transfer of retirement/experience work out? Did your years of experience one to one or was there a cap at a certain number?
3. How did your curriculum transfer to a new state’s standards? I know that many of us are using Common Core, but different states/districts seem to have different emphases. I teach high school English currently, so I hope that it will be an easy transition.

teaching,Travelerover9000,2019/02/02,"Will I have trouble because I'm not the tallest out there and my features are still fairly young ? Hello fellow teachers,
Teaching has always been my dream job and passion, and I'm working towards it. I'm 19 years old and I still have 2 years ahead of me until I can become an English teacher in my country. The title says it all and I've been thinking about it recently a lot, even my voice is not very deep lol. Am I overthinking this ? Will it really affect how students perceive me as their teacher ? Is there a way that I can deal with this ? Or will things become different in 2 or 3 years ? Thanks for taking the time to reply to this.",1.965108173076924,4.254278515625003,3.184375000000003,89.76927884615385,80.25,5.18846153846154,24.68990384615385,6.297961479604792,0.7976050480769232,502,19,98,4,13,162,85,128,0.043,0.885,0.07200000000000001,0.5606,2,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,2,7,3,0,0,6,1,14,1,0,2,1,17,20,10,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,3,0,2,0,0,9,7,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,2,12,2,13,15,2,18,0,0,0,1,5,6,0,3,11,71,21,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16953345490003782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12420200834012407,0.4500441231454093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2100537509107792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21287178390740452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13457267747711132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021870164457535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17321803434480326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21379773478536435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13052525985651406,0.0,0.2011751421163085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16202743769678749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32542452276675343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15319205219544033,0.0,0.0,0.1875824529049916,0.0,0.0,0.13536015723702313,0.13055256501338428,0.0,0.0,0.11880625424705285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16811224528974325,0.0,0.16172453111153914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832991807564747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3936183024568872

teaching,KRAMERisCRUNK,2019/02/02,"Life altering decisions ahead (Help me please) I’ll try to keep this short.  But I need advice in the worst way.  

3rd year Teacher/coach.  Small North Texas town

Started new school this year, thought it was finally place to stay for a while....small town, great kids, great academics, great athletic program.  

Ive never felt so alone in my short career and my school last year was total opposite of this school. Im broken hearted lost and so confused.  

My assigned mentor, ignores me. Brought up to admin &amp; nothing done.  

Caught coaches talking shit about me, went to admin and was told to basically handle on my own.   

Feel so alone and like I don’t fit in ever. Feel like a  complete failure. In what I thought would be my launch pad.  

Trying to grow as a coach but instead feel like I’m given very little responsibility because of coaches who have been there longer. Almost like they think removing responsibility or not helping me grow as a coach is beneficial to their image or something.  (These coaches grew up in this town or have there extremely cliquey coaches with them).  

Currently laying in bed after winning my 17th straight game as freshman b-ball coach (no recognition or congratulations from any co workers or coaches) and contemplating resigning/career change/leaving.  I have a interview Monday for a nursing tech position and don’t know what to do.  

These next couple weeks could be pivotal to my life.  How can a place seem so perfect but in a way be the worst year of teaching I’ve ever experienced.  

I’m lost and need true guidance please lord help me.  I have a wife and 1 1/2 year old son to consider.

To add to the confusion, I am currently an educator in zoos and can’t decide if I’d like to go back to that after a pgce in which case which course would be better in the long run?

Any advice/experience would be hugely appreciated!",5.19322695035461,5.767498606382978,6.8391489361702105,73.93333333333334,68.25531914893618,10.947517730496457,32.687943262411345,10.864195022040775,3.6422326241134764,375,16,74,11,6,130,61,94,0.028,0.812,0.16,0.9314,2,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,2,1,4,0,1,7,0,8,0,0,0,2,14,13,4,0,5,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,3,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,4,3,17,7,3,15,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,2,8,48,7,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20166014788501824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22802409809708785,0.0,0.1807705228287109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3112047236738344,0.2622691462852394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2900770191400719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685328383319233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448764617404933,0.0,0.0,0.26243218502998034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19001347683099126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20133396920320307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17490938552713678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6319692327753655,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,GrumpyMashy,2019/02/03,"Teacher hates Cheaters **I'm not sure if this belong here.**

*By the way, it's going to a long story*

So this is a story my classmate told me about our chemist teacher who really hate cheaters. Of course, we do hate cheaters at some point in school but this teacher really fails you in his subject if you were caught cheating. Our Chemist teacher has been in school teaching chemistry for the past about 20 years or so they told me about him. According to them, he got three awards back when he was proceeding to be chemist and a Master Degree in Chemistry. Which was pretty impressive considering he was so smart. Maybe too smart because most of us gets lost during his discussion every time. He was very detail on his subject and serious about us if we are really, i mean really, listening to him. He always gets disappointed if some of us are not in his class or listened. He is also a funny guy but unlike other teachers, he always have extreme grudges about cheating during his exam. 

   
 

As some of you wonder, isn't it normal to have grudges against cheaters? Yes, but for this guy, he really really really hates cheaters. In fact, he was either traumatize or regret because of it back when he was about to get his Masters Degree. So this is where his story begin.

   
 

It was in the year back before the internet and mobile phones exist. It was the year where student has to rely the library for researches, assignments and such. There, at a University, in the chemistry lab our teacher in his finals before claiming the Master Degree. He have a dream that he would work in the Chemistry field. He imagine of working in the lab discovering or making new stuff he made himself. He has a best friend, his only best friend in the past semesters. They always helps each other in school. His best friend was his only friend he goes with in all semesters. As his school year almost comes to an end, his teacher told them their finals was to research about anything vial related to chemistry and requires only two members per group. So of course, our chemistry teacher has chosen his best friend to do their final research. 

   
 

But there was a catch, his best friend was a slacker. He never was there to help our chemistry teacher during his research. His only contribution was a payment for the cost of some equipment, apparatus, printed papers and so on. He hardly come with little to no help at all. 

   
 

As weeks goes by, we see our chemistry teacher was working way hard on his final research as his best friend come by just to check on him and his progress and just left him. With all these hard works, our chemistry teacher was pretty happy with his research. He told his friend about ""their"" finals research and it was ready to pass on. His friend insisted that he should pass the paper. It was a help he said. His hard works finally paid off, or so he thought.

   
 

Sometime later, days before the graduation, his best friend was praise for his research and hard work. It was confuse at first and told the teachers there must be some sort of mistakes on the papers. But it wasn't, it was stated that it was his best friend that did all the work because he pass the papers. Turns out his best friend has altered the papers to be said it was his own. Could his best friend have told the teachers some lies? Can our teacher reclaim the papers his best friend stole from him? I have no idea how his best friend manage to convince the teachers it was his works. But all i can say his best friend turns against on him. Can he prove to the teachers that it was his works all along? No, he can't. He have no evidence to show. Not a single proof that it was him who work on him. The only proof he had was he claim that he did the research and all. Not enough to convince them. His best friend was a traitor. He cheated on him. Our chemistry teacher was sadden. He was shock. He was lost and confuse to what just happened. Hi best friend has stolen his papers, his hard work, and most especially, his dream. His best friend has been accepted to one of the best chemistry lab he dream of while he was sent home holding to his master degree. 

   
 

I told my friend that he could have gotten a job with that Master Degree he hold but he chose not. He didn't chose to work in the lab. It only makes him to think back to that incident. It only makes him mad. Was his best friend smart or just an average? Was he was a second smartest student before our chemistry teacher? We do not know much information about his best friend but I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to talk about him. It has been years of regret and grudges about his best friend. But he have move on.

   
 

As far as i know, that was the story he told to my friend. I don't know if it was accurate when my friend told me about it. We don't know how this story related to grudges about cheaters but this is one of the most sad story I've heard. He could have been the greatest chemist or someone next to Einstein and Hawking. We don't know what it would look like. He was a genius i can say that but one cheater had turned his life around.

teaching,EnglishTeacherJulia,2019/02/04,"New Teacher Looking for Advice Hi all,

My name is Julia and I just graduated with my BA in English Literature and my certificate to teach in December. I live and am certified in Arizona. I was told by my college that I would have no troubles finding a job to begin even in January, which obviously turned out to be untrue. I was rather disappointed by that because I had loaded my last semester to be able to finish by then, and otherwise would have left my student teaching semester clear of all other coursework and graduated in time to find a job to begin in August.

I have been searching for a high school English position and haven't found anything thus far. I am a little worried about finding something, and was hoping for some guidance about when peak hiring times actually begin. Am I just off about when they start? Am I too early? Am I worried for nothing (probably yes but any reassurance is welcome)?

Any guidance would be appreciated. I absolutely love this profession, but I have been worried about the next step.

I am also new to reddit, so if something about this post is wrong, please let me know.

Thanks in advance. I appreciate it.",4.763990610328637,7.012587206572768,5.9217136150234735,73.68332159624416,71.30046948356808,8.489201877934272,32.960093896713616,9.150863307647796,3.3270544600938963,917,45,152,20,18,305,126,213,0.075,0.7959999999999999,0.128,0.9504,2,0,2,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,1,14,8,0,0,5,1,27,1,0,1,4,31,39,15,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,7,9,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,8,1,23,5,31,24,3,32,0,1,1,1,7,13,0,3,16,117,30,11,0.12864272471456356,0.0,0.12553674238527912,0.0,0.0,0.12570818173612602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287554047690016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17496292830580235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10586200136957294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784194109673959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08496730641553707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527313594889541,0.0,0.0,0.14105010771755924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13591810163663018,0.0,0.12777125212169532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25531610876229305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706986772052285,0.10486099035811773,0.0,0.0,0.1397706968059058,0.1315459018319,0.0,0.0,0.12893380582038622,0.11359388276693225,0.0,0.10802748926210837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11610508160219787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24848789030576404,0.13681299715383086,0.0,0.0,0.1234361638770955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14121108105138586,0.0,0.0,0.1232041701429915,0.0,0.1386986151493155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13019330531843176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1980709088003212,0.0,0.0,0.09105398267343846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11843693722202515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15002521459690032,0.0,0.0,0.12292363632762067,0.0,0.0,0.1399263438011198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3919287942422917,0.0,0.2741523020914232,0.14065062480212653,0.0,0.0

teaching,Mooglenator,2019/02/04,"School tricked me into subbing for a rough class. I am an elementary substitute who mostly subs for grades 2nd through 5th. A lot of the elementary schools in my area also have a handful of 6th grade classes. I loathe 6th grade classes because for some reason after 5th grade they choose to become unbearable and generally rude kids. 

Well today I was supposed to be roving, meaning I go to several classes for an hour or less so various teachers can have their parents-student meetings. On average I go to 5 different classes/grades over the course of a day.

When I show up the secretary looks at me and smiles and says that I will have a busy day. That's an immediate red flag. I get my folder and find out that I have a 6th grade class all day, that's not what I signed up for. The assistant principal assures me that if I have issues to send out students to the office but in general they are pretty rowdy.

Well during lunch I meet another sub who is subbing for 3rd (missed out on lunch earlier) and told me that this school often pretends to look for rovers but secretly intends to assign them to 6th grade classes because no sub willing accepts their 6th grade sub assignments. That's pretty shady. 

I'm thinking of just avoiding this particular school in the future (there are plenty in the district) but don't want to burn bridges. Some of us substitutes already know a handful of teachers at a handful of schools to avoid subbing for and this could be why this school resorted to misleading subs.

What do you guys think about this practice?

BTW I had to send a few kids out already today because they just can't seem to control themselves and feel the need to verbally and physically harass their fellow classmates.",6.737861538461541,7.399467793846156,6.613961538461544,76.58678846153849,64.90769230769232,9.453846153846156,36.25,9.3871,3.4199692307692304,1383,65,243,24,20,437,177,325,0.077,0.862,0.061,-0.5319,2,2,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,1,7,1,10,10,3,2,20,0,20,5,3,3,2,49,36,16,0,4,8,0,5,0,1,2,0,1,0,3,16,13,2,3,11,2,0,4,4,6,2,0,3,9,28,4,49,28,8,30,0,1,3,0,22,17,0,8,9,165,44,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380176139631333,0.08624300442075335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11308409485731954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19722255383686468,0.119105496618254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095649187165933,0.08610485492267013,0.0,0.0,0.20865185046988524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126742834062656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05452929104459702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856768691800907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056344167334865164,0.0,0.1225807403444586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678275861189647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10620485856558663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11256137382341178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05926837713305647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18112401044613444,0.0,0.0,0.0916853212510882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174739993241073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07996514178749223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2194327374142754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108818461387332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576207282868477,0.0,0.6548648058078224,0.0,0.0981773510496864,0.0,0.12183330113464988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820447632581995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044474702850367,0.10304979844648787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12972334921203507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06360933033384247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19392985713436126,0.0,0.09731265775490504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,MissTeaDay,2019/02/04,"How do YOU grade inclusion kids’ work compared to on-level kids’? This is in reference to students with IEPs

Asking since last year, I was told to ignore if they were below the mark of the other students in the class since they still tried, so they should get full credit (even if they didn’t meet all requirements or quality standards).

So I would grade them easier than everyone else.

Is this common practice? Am I going about this correctly? I basically hold my on-level kids to higher standards even though my on-level and IEP kids are all in the same class. (Which also makes me feel bad / gross since I’d X kid can “get away with” doing less, my on-level kids may think that they can too. So it sets a different standard, if that makes sense.)

In high school, I find it difficult to believe that the majority of kids, IEP or not, can at least follow directions (which can be rephrased or altered to individual students, of course) and meet the basic guidelines of a rubric / assignment.

I’m in my second year teaching and this is something that I consistently struggle with while grading. If I wasn’t more lenient on my IEP kids, a handful of them would fail. But doesn’t that teach them that being below-average is acceptable / okay?

Please let me know, too, if this is even a proper way to be thinking about this topic. I am definitely open to someone shifting my perspective/mindset and rephrasing the question/problem . I forget what the term is called when you do that.

I realize that more often than not you take your work home with you, and a lot of times at least in my observation it's so much the kids but more admin. politics/bull.

​

With that said I still am thinking it might be a good option for me. So why do I want to be a teacher? Well, first I plan on becoming an IA then a teacher down the road. I'd like to work with those on the spectrum and/or ESE kids in general. I feel like they are under-represented and I feel as though I could work well with them.

​

\* I want to teach those who have a harder time learning.

\* I would like to travel (mostly road tripping) and I like the vacation time you get.

\* I really need insurance and the benefits are good generally.

​

So why am I here? Just looking for general advice and I love the fact that there is a subreddit for near everything.",0.16684210526315724,2.5602353114035097,2.40453947368421,90.51365131578949,92.81578947368422,6.007894736842108,19.844298245614034,7.413659706084162,0.8259929824561407,873,29,186,18,32,294,133,228,0.022,0.7909999999999999,0.188,0.9897,2,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,4,2,6,13,11,0,0,17,0,16,1,0,0,2,37,29,14,0,5,4,1,3,5,0,2,0,2,1,2,13,11,0,0,6,1,0,2,4,0,2,2,2,6,23,11,28,22,7,22,0,0,1,1,14,12,0,5,13,129,36,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339471620873891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15138750401616224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944246437421784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12319330547176847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861750299351422,0.09792571910440187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331902109407161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716155265783674,0.0,0.0,0.22994239685936874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12279141266965578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13749643499961495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27204966082232546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3348372519215359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11510766772889318,0.0,0.0,0.11653544406610535,0.12371466971962272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14541389115569914,0.0,0.1605394549322806,0.0,0.0,0.10076518880956067,0.10163866124757544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781313779917628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303887984034255,0.10900677561842352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10946750265949362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10306261641589408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09106589906842216,0.1756630156363423,0.13467454495352132,0.0,0.23978691910828084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11310043571325175,0.1616996364532875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2464920415879649,0.0,0.24737599497882964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993745934703223,0.13920533785484548,0.0,0.09737346272325033,0.0,0.0,0.08827118539333946
teaching,myousername,2019/02/04,"How can I find out if I would enjoy teaching elementary school? Hello all! I have been thinking a lot recently about a career change and the first thing that keeps coming to mind is teaching elementary school.

I want to get into teaching generally because I'm passionate about knowledge, education, and empowering young people to think critically.

Elementary school interests me the most, because I love the passion and energy that younger kids generally have about learning (compared to ""meh"" attitudes of many high schoolers). I also enjoy arts &amp; crafts, teaching a little bit of everything instead of just one subject, and reading out loud (including doing funny voices, hehe). 

There are some practical reasons too, for example most elementary school teachers in my area are approaching retirement, and not enough younger people are filling their shoes, so it's a job in high demand.

However, it's been a long time since I've been around kids. I'm definitely not one of those people who dislikes kids, just that I haven't worked with young kids for a while (i.e. babysitting when I was a teen) and I'm not sure how well I ""relate"" to children now that I'm an adult.

What are some things I can do to get experience teaching young kids before actually investing in an education and getting a teaching license?",8.972301061007958,9.355436163793108,8.612241379310348,65.10305039787802,60.206896551724135,11.621220159151196,40.25994694960213,11.20814326018867,4.872928647214854,1058,52,164,26,13,339,139,232,0.035,0.8390000000000001,0.126,0.9681,3,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,1,2,16,8,0,0,13,0,17,4,1,3,2,40,30,14,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,7,11,13,0,1,6,2,1,3,4,0,1,3,4,2,13,8,23,25,8,24,0,0,0,3,11,11,0,6,10,111,24,15,0.0,0.0,0.1255892390260009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10291856071292714,0.0,0.1394426258756649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11456718823116947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15690440840079284,0.0,0.10951125974972263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14050326795976464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13614385382961694,0.11086065658982378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329779081224016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11566413396270535,0.12588989168871734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11762628793533512,0.10946919434359798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20171586016583232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719498790563598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771143810680924,0.11439138040807507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12898772303659267,0.0,0.11389237054006175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10941317924904828,0.11615363413462013,0.0,0.0,0.13047807177251985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12994679815534874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17441618556904345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676658881257131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287313473133079,0.0,0.0,0.13232145714817592,0.12707228764072848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5209909969159435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064590914285414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129494723453227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17100049891425287,0.16492706722209707,0.0,0.0,0.07504397588281939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07590854203006926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11571362749700978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09369259947900084,0.0,0.0,0.09142231547164316,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,rockyroadnottaken,2019/02/05,"Do I stay or do I go? Hey guys,

I don't know whether to leave my job or stay another year or so. I graduated from grad school in 2017 and worked in a charter for a year as a temporary job until I got a DOE position. After that year was up, I got a job in the DOE. I work at a small school in an NYC public high school (about two-three teachers per department) and the entire English, history, physical education, and some of the science department all left last June. I've heard those people left as soon as my boss became in charge, which was last February. The people who have stayed have been there for 5+ years. I teach two 9th grade classes, one 11th grade class, two 12th grade classes, and an advisory period.


Ideally, I would love to see my freshmen graduate, get my tenure, and THEN leave, but I honestly don't know if I can take it sometimes. The way a lot of these kids behave is RIDICULOUS, especially the seniors, but they'll be gone so I wouldn't have to deal with their bullshit anymore. Some of the juniors act like dicks too and can barely string a sentence together, but most of them have a lot of potential. Most of the freshmen are well-behaved but some are so bad and distract the others that it messes up the entire lesson. Honestly, the way the bad kids behave in general usually make my job almost impossible.


The commute sucks, my boss sometimes sucks (he's so moody and ridiculous, I swear), some of the adults want to be in charge and are super pushy/rude, some of the kids suck. My boss has also embarrassed me in meetings before in which he told other staff members personal information about me that had absolutely nothing to do with them, joked that I should wear makeup on a day I didn't wear any, and is extremely disorganized. He makes a lot of plans and doesn't follow through with them and has no idea how to discipline these kids; they get rewarded instead.


A lot of the kids get away with murder, my department doesn't get the credit it deserves, and because I'm new/inexperienced, people treat me like an idiot (teachers, school secretaries, etc.) because I'm new to the DOE and expect me to know everything when in fact nobody tells me anything. I also had to create curriculum from scratch so it's been hard. But some of the kids are wonderful, some of my coworkers are really great, and my job is mostly laid back and I don't know if I would get that anywhere else. 

This is sort of a rant and I'm sure I'm forgetting things, but I guess I would just like some insight and any advice. Are things like this in most places in NYC? Should I just check Open Market in April to see what's out there, or should I stick it out here because I might end up somewhere worse and I should gain experience? I'm still young and ""cheap to hire"" according to a teaching friend (who doesn't teach at my school).

teaching,divodrop,2019/02/05,"What is the point of the edTPA? A little rant only because I am a senior at my university and this semester I am student teaching/completing my edTPA. My question is, what is the point of it? I have heard countless times from professors, principals, and other teachers that they do not even look at your score during the hiring process. To me, it seems like just a waste of time and I am constantly stressing over it because it literally determines whether or not I can get my Illinois license. Not even mentioned yet that it's $300... at least $100 extra if you fail one section. Also, another thing that annoys me is how there are other ways people get licensed and some of these people were not even education majors/have a degree in something else and magically decided they wanted to go into teaching. Why do we (students who have been majoring in education since the start) are being punished by having to complete this $300 pearson cash grab? Rant over.

teaching,MikeAGoodChoice,2019/02/05,"Masters Requirement per State Hello all, 

I'm sorry if this is too broad of a question, but does anyone know of a comprehensive list of states that require teachers to eventually earn a masters? I have my initial cert in elem/sped in NYS (and prek-4 in PA) and I am contemplating moving somewhere warmer.  Having to earn a masters is one deciding factor in choosing which state I'll be moving to.  I figure I'll end up needing to contact each state anyway, but figured I'd try here first. Thanks!

Best,

teaching,Fawkes0629,2019/02/06,"About to Start Subbing - Advice? Hi everyone! Preemptive apologies if there is somewhere else better suited to this question, but I figured who better to ask than the teachers. I am going through my orientation to begin substitute teaching next week, and I've read just about everything on the internet concerning subbing. But I know from a family of educators and having gone through school myself that it's not going to be that easy. So my questions for you are these:

* What should I know in advance?
* What do you wish your substitutes would be better about?
* What advice do you have?
* What questions should I be asking?

I'm really only planning on picking up high school classes, and while the minimal age difference (I'm 25) might be weird sometimes, I'm really not suited to the younger ages. The schools in my system are considered inner city, which I know will be different from my own high school, and do not require a teaching degree or license - just an associates degree or higher. So aside from some comparatively limited personal experience, the internet's wildly conflicting views on what a sub should or shouldn't do, and whatever they tell me at orientation next week, I will be going in fresh and blind. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Help me Obi Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated. I'm here to learn and to make myself an asset for the teachers in my schools.

teaching,Calm_Panic,2019/02/06,"Help Restarting an Interrupted Unit Plan/Vent Session Hey, All, 

  
First year teacher that's stressed out and questioning everything. I started mid year in a rough, inner-city school after the original teacher quit because of the kids. I teach ninth graders that vary in literacy from grade level to elementary levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had issues getting them to buy into any of my lessons (something I'm still struggling with greatly), but had some success with ""A Raisin in the Sun."" We got through Act I, but I had to stop because of a grade-wide project that took up two weeks of time. Now, I only have about a week and a half to review Act I and finish the play before we leave for February break. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any insight as to how I can effectively finish this play without barreling through 75 or so pages? Should I summarize certain scenes and read what is important? Should I read Act II and then show them Act III on film? Should I just stick with the film for the rest of the time? 

&amp;#x200B;

 I want to give them a chance to connect with the material, but I also want to make sure I'm not ""taking the easy way out."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight from someone that's done this before would be fantastic. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brain is full of math that I haven't used since 9 years ago, and I feel **kind of** prepared. But anxiety is kicking in!

&amp;#x200B;

I have studied from:

Laura Rickhoff's Guide and Study.com (To learn all the basics and theorems)

&amp;#x200B;

Some of Laura's guide was difficult to understand. Some things she expects you to know, and there are mistakes here or there. But I feel confident in most of the first 21 pages. The written stuff kind of throws me off. Like induction... What is this stuff!

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on what I should really focus on studying? From her guide or from other sources.

teaching,Caspar_Ostermann,2019/02/06,"How do you sort information by skill level and assemble a step by step plan for yourself? Given pieces of information, how do you create a program for yourself?

Example: Making money online.

The question is: how do I get my foot in the door knowledge-wise?

Normally, you have pieces of information presented randomly for different situations and skill levels. For instance marketing as a general term:

&gt;What comes first - marketing or product development? There we have the first hen and egg issue. To market something, you have to have something. To have something, you need to see whether there is demand. Therefore you have to market it. But to see if it works, you have to have a prototype. You could create a website for the prototype. But people are spoiled and they want shiny, well polished objects. So should you hire a designer? But why pay a designer a lot of money if you don't even know whether it will work out.

You have to attach training wheels to information if you are new. How do you do this?

Been at this school for a few years in one department but trying to get into another (actually my degree and more qualified)

I got one course in my desired subject area this year. I love it and students are having a blast! I'm finally in my element and it's going great.

Well, it was brought to my attention today that the other teacher of this subject has been talking shit about me to her class, saying that it's my first year and I don't know what I'm doing, that my exam was unfairly easy, stuff like that. 

Do I confront her directly? I definitely don't want to escalate to the union or administration.  

Involve the department head? It sucks cause it was my first go in this department, I don't want to be seen as a problem to deal with when I hope to get more courses next year. But her behaviour is unacceptable, right? Ugh. why would an adult do this..so petty and unprofessional. 

Thank you in advance for any advice.

TLDR - best course of action when being undermined by another teacher to students re: my teaching style?

teaching,potterartist,2019/02/07,"Substitute teacher here, I can’t get rover the class I had today... Long winded post coming...

Okay so let me preface this by saying i would normally never criticize the classroom or teacher of a place I substitute, it’s simply not my place because I am usually not familiar enough with the school to make an informed judgement. 

All that being said today I went in to sub for a kindergarten class. I student taught at this elementary school and sub there almost every week K-5 and the special areas. This is my second time in this particular room, first time as a full day. 

As soon as I walk in the room is a mess. Everything is sticky, trash and dirt all over the floor, and the sink area is just another trash can. Not much I can do about all that at he moment. The students start coming in and one little girl says “Ms. ‘G’ says we have to sweep up the ants” I tell her to focus on her morning work and don’t give it much thought. 

I know these kids are wild, it’s well known that this teacher’s classes are always wild. My classroom assistant was wonderful. He even mentioned that it’s easier for him to get the kids under control when their teacher is gone, that speaks a lot to her [lack of] classroom management. 

The day goes on and it’s not a great one. The students go to gym and I have my planning time. They’ve wrecked the classroom library so I start to clean that up and the rest of the room and the two custodians come in. I know these guys from my student teaching (I was in the art room so we communicated a lot). They ask me how the room looked when I came in and I told them “Ms. G is a lovely women but if we’re being honest it was a mess, I’ve been trying to clean it up. The kids also mentioned ants and I’ve seen a couple.” The main guy let me know he’s about to go to admin over the conditions because they’re getting the blame for the shape of the room. He also says the ants are so bad that earlier in the week they saw them crawling out of the students’ lunch boxes at lunch. 

This isn’t a struggling school you all. This school is in one, if not THE best districts. It’s all upper middle class+ families. I just can’t get it out of my head. No wonder the students lack respect for other adults and their space. It’s just tearing me up and I had to rant.

teaching,WizardLunch,2019/02/07,"Classroom Management- how do I make my classroom a good learning environment? I came in late to the school year, about a month in, when the last teacher was fired.  I'm alternate cert also, and the last time I was in a high school classroom was several years ago.  They kinda told me I had a lot of free reign to do what I needed to do.  So I made a huge mistake and went in with a ""stick it to the man, kids"" kind of School of Rock attitude.  After all, if the kids like me they'll do work and pay attention, right?

So a few weeks ago I had a formal observation, and it was a disaster.  I was just trying to fly under the radar until my second year when I think I'll do things 200% more efficiently, but my observer actually said he wanted to redo my observation because of how poorly it went.  Students not paying attention, at one point a student got up to do another student's hair while the students were working independently...  He said it was disrespectful to me and my classroom environment.

So right after that happened, I started coming back firm against my students.  No phones allowed, no sleeping allowed.  Reviews where I'm asking the class for input and understanding every step of the way.

But what I've gotten out of it: wrote 2 office referrals (one student still busts out laughing when I get onto the class for talking).  I have to tell every class every day to stay at their seats until the bell rings, and I probably say ""put your phone away please"" 30 times per class.

My good students are getting disillusioned that I'm not giving them special treatment, and my more rebellious students are getting more tenacious with how they test me in class.  About 90% of my kids are military kids too so they can be a lot sometimes.

What am I doing wrong?  I'm pulling my hair out over here",5.715083003952568,6.411338475362321,6.259242424242423,78.11795454545457,67.14492753623188,8.93939393939394,31.913702239789195,8.97023862654752,2.630536231884059,1414,56,265,23,22,460,185,345,0.08900000000000001,0.85,0.06,-0.8740000000000001,2,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,1,6,2,19,9,0,0,22,0,24,3,3,8,1,42,51,25,0,4,6,0,3,1,0,1,0,4,0,5,11,15,0,0,5,1,4,7,4,2,0,3,19,7,35,8,43,30,7,54,0,0,0,0,25,21,0,4,25,177,46,28,0.0,0.0,0.10709951827324524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19457232506502825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08776650260177335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11508174572737626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260081204744943,0.0,0.10311311184782114,0.08439046328286326,0.0,0.0669021752380967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12552400033002925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09453933321283754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707792409758369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2774056415712569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17201849154736346,0.10528156146451492,0.0,0.18410506836693816,0.08777656804556122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09705097344125684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595619683376505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428704248745684,0.0,0.17892071021793154,0.12380202888959894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05361798084979856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866099178750704,0.0,0.10384747328512027,0.07325853254010795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08760087118267039,0.0,0.0,0.0813777403962315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873797785839107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12047181142419912,0.10374859457632167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832834423939792,0.0,0.0,0.1103283934550602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187450662838367,0.20879349760824675,0.08727707526665138,0.0,0.3332165551790037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12398550830684844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10982859347291944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10854489742779254,0.0,0.07768114335209332,0.11697818723495322,0.08764595975491123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882123572908861,0.09592575515338772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07291258072839145,0.07032294162579016,0.0,0.0,0.1279914382584171,0.0,0.0,0.10487019166611372,0.0,0.07451259352597797,0.0,0.0,0.1142529270211946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473300059220594,0.08711391277259925,0.08803429560989197,0.0,0.0,0.20347746395898064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15979764425344847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11999366778936844,0.0,0.21202491811386845

Aight so to recap I got hammered at a special needs prom about two years ago, did a year and a half in reform school. 6 months ago I joined the army, messaged my awesome teacher for everything she did to help me back than and she wanted to meet up. Unfortunately the day I had to ship out for basic got bumped up drastically so I left before I got the chance to see her. I did basic, that sucked, did job training which also sucked. Once I had graduated from my training status I got my phone back and lo and behold I have an email from my teacher saying that next time I’m in town she’d really like to see me.

So I go home on holiday block leave and go and get some coffee with my teacher. She said I actually looked healthy now, which I guess is true since back then my diet was cigarettes and maybe a meal or two a day. So she tells me how proud of me she is, and tells me some really distinct memories of me actually not being a dumbass which gave me the warm and fuzzies. Anyway I told her about the letters I got while I was in basic and afterwards she gave me her address and long story short I have a new pen pal.

**Useful Tips to become a Web Developer**

The web developer is a new revolution in the tech industry. Web developer initiated many new job opportunities for the students interested in building websites. Arya College of Engineering and IT support their students to follow their passion instead of forcing them to be an engineer. ACEIT (Arya College Jaipur) is one of the best [**engineering colleges**](https://www.aryacollege.in/) in Jaipur.

Therefore, today I am going to tell you some ways to become a Web developer. The ways are:

**Basics of Java, CSS, and HTML**

These three are the most prominent key to website development. You are going to use them on a daily routine if you have decided to become a web developer. The functions of all three are:

HTML directs the structure

CSS will help it to look appealing

JavaScript will make it functional.

**WordPress Tutorials**

You should be familiar with WordPress if you wish to be a web developer. WordPress power a large number of websites as it is a free open source software. Any web host can install it.

Adding WordPress to the website will facilitate the clients, as it will enable them to add content on their own.

**Basics of UI and UX**  
UI and UX are the essences of the user experience design. These two domains will make you the designing expert.

**SQL and PHP**

The SQL and PHP are the two side of a coin. SQL is a technology of database that is used to store information while PHP is known as a scripting language that put or pull material from the database.

**Basics of Search Engine Optimization**

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is an operation to enhance and upgrade the rankings of a website in the search engines. SEO is the prior skills for online business. Although the larger portion of the website is about the content, the structure and code also play a major role.",3.847111111111112,7.149810292307691,4.8358974358974365,73.2552136752137,84.53846153846155,6.827350427350428,30.606837606837605,7.946510646118237,3.0169863247863256,1495,76,224,32,45,485,161,325,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.9802,2,0,0,0,0,0,68.0,0,6,6,6,4,7,0,0,38,0,27,1,0,7,1,29,38,18,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,10,11,0,0,3,1,3,5,0,0,0,5,0,1,13,8,43,29,7,21,0,0,1,1,16,9,0,5,5,157,23,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149879161776688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09481435039645472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6159395321238896,0.0,0.0,0.14631881422732462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13638522248028742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15847783267542834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934541996896398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383586296391713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11708258793479635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861356579508467,0.141355915147625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2693166847270374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944785556405758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14016147603812798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15821878775822878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12186432713576532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215939100914134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723975671120275,0.0,0.0,0.3612574723573382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22133947962611664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16033283187936764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

He was feeling overwhelmed and asked for my help I told him lets organize this first by chapter and we started organizing until he lashes out saying I'm judging him and I think he's so unorganized and stupid. I told him I don't think he is but he is lazy for not doing any of the work at all.  and I tried to talk to him calmly about getting his work done and I've tried to help him but he won't let me. He told me to leave him alone and that he just wants to drop out of school.my question is this: should I try to explain to him again that I'm only trying to help and I'm not there to judge him?

teaching,dragmonkey,2019/02/08,"A question about activity pacing throughout the semester Hello fellow teachers! First post on reddit! Wahoo! 

Anyway, I’m a first year high school English teacher in Texas, and for the very first time today I overheard a student say, “Man, Mr. Dragmonky’s class was so cool today, we did  ‘x’ in class...” Needless to say I felt about ten feet tall. Anyway-anyway, I wanted to know how I should use this activity so that it’s still novel to kiddos through to the semester. 

The activity in question was simply writing Hamlet’s letter to Horatio in different tones on chart paper 

 •Lil’ Pump 
• Your dad sending a text
• Mario (Of video game fame) 
• Surfer dude 

So would this be a once-a-unit type of activity? Once a week? Should I just throw it out there and experiment now to see how to do it for the next few years? Or is it just a class-to class type of situation? 

I hope o provided enough info here, if there’s anything else I can provide to make advice more clear, just drop a comment!

teaching,teacherheatherabreu,2019/02/08,"LET'S GLOW: Elementary Art NEEDS YOUR HELP My students are amazing artists tucked inside a hard shell of self preservation. I teach Preschool to Fifth grade art at a local Denver Public school, and each day we create together I get to see the doors to their hearts open for a brief moment as they paint, draw, and create together. Some of my students come from broken homes, immigrant homes, impoverished homes... But the truth about their lives is they have a story of grit, determination, and great depth waiting to be expressed.  

This year I set out to plan a special event for my students and families to give them a chance to share what hidden world or message they have tucked in their hearts. 

The entire school of Colfax Elementary will be create Glow in the Dark Art installations that communicates as individuals as well as a class.  As we are a title 1 school, I am not able to purchase a lot of the amazing glow in the dark supplies (lights, paint, tape, glue, pipe cleaners, etc) that my students desire to use for this night of glow in the dark hidden messages.

I have attached my Art classroom's Amazon Wish List if you would like to donate and be a part of our first LET'S GLOW: Elementary Interactive Art Installation!

teaching,zeus99es,2019/02/09,"Hoping to teach Just added this sub to my list.

Im 34 and in my second semester (3.85 gpa)of returning to college for my BA. Took a too long 16 year break from college, you end and dumb I said ""no I'm not gonna go away to this state college that accepted me for teaching degree program I'm going to move in with my gf, get married and start a life"" well that girls been gone about 14 years and I've worked my way up the local job market till I've about plateaued.

I went back to com. College 8 years ago to finish my last 2 classes to get my AS. That opened up a bit more opportunity for me but again I've kind of plateaued. Mayhaps in sales or business I could go further but I just dont care for offices after spending so much time in them.

So I'm now in my second semester of a fairly over priced well regarded private college and I have approx 3.5 semesters left to graduate with a BA in history + education programming and ready for certs and such. (New york) 

The plan is to get a gig locally asap and start my masters online (masters required in ny) and I'll have 5 years to complete it to be licensed. I'll be able teach so long as I am in a masters program.

So I sit here working 30 hours a week and taking 12-15 credit hours a semester, with a mortgage, wife and 2 kids, soon more hopefully.

I have been seeing alot of bad press regarding students in public schools these days, and weak willed administration siding with parents and dominating teachers... I am planning on 7th through 9th grade social studies.

Am I crazy? Should I stop this charade? Is 36 too old to get into a teaching career? Should I expect to work a second job or work during the summer to make 50k?

Thanks all!",2.5728947368421053,4.452715236842106,3.8992748538011694,87.41136842105264,76.45614035087719,6.431345029239767,26.604678362573104,7.3011,1.3268109941520474,1329,52,270,16,30,436,201,342,0.077,0.85,0.07200000000000001,-0.5511,4,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,1,1,11,18,13,1,0,16,0,17,2,0,1,1,38,41,24,0,6,7,2,1,0,1,4,2,1,0,2,8,19,0,2,1,0,4,7,3,3,2,3,6,3,25,10,50,28,6,60,0,0,1,0,10,21,1,5,28,158,33,28,0.11750653047878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416244933109432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040125346326136,0.09035526869292433,0.0981130446987242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12828669735825846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11980573922284435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320336155170247,0.0,0.0,0.09381940299389786,0.0,0.0,0.07578199108609039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771677857815662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407590821814054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2455692490878844,0.0,0.20034500763044466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23342099702977076,0.2314405252670905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269272171389509,0.0,0.23321419989018216,0.0,0.0,0.12236496910155913,0.0,0.095783505727909,0.0,0.0,0.1276711891846624,0.0,0.08299833755812046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20797916351769966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07843652154774862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12489084562164784,0.08638082037658744,0.0,0.0,0.11348853936594368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233033370114536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13047709613635194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11177561921004127,0.0,0.0,0.11892288221878335,0.0936374911698004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197831098767975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16634345415134738,0.0,0.0,0.09824072107439502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08835028705188899,0.0,0.0,0.10818422576459706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06851900288466302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13055407898789773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09327121441527317,0.09425665086542273,0.0,0.21130496573483412,0.10892973100138154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3421846147383015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30268141210159843

teaching,SunBeautifulSun,2019/02/09,"Preschool advise needed for challenging behavior Hello all!

I am looking for advise about a student in my preschool class. He has experienced trauma, has language delays, and is aggressive towards other kids (uses intimidation). While other students are working on assignments, he wanders the classroom and doesn't find something to do off the shelves.

This is what I have been doing (and it hasn't been working). I give him options: ""Would you like to do this or this activity?"" He doesn't want to do either. I tell him, ""Either find something to do or sit on this stool."" When he doesn't find something to do, I tell him, ""You can either walk to the stool or I will carry you there."" I usually end up carrying him there. Then he tries to crawl away from the stool, and I don't know what to do to get him to stay. He also seems to like the attention and thinks it's a game, running/giggling when I come to talk to him. 

The lead teacher in my classroom told me to be more stern with him and to make sure to follow through on what I say. I agree with following through, but I don't want him to feel threatened by my stern tone.

What advise do you have?

Thank you so much.",3.70940805434255,5.3159336550218335,4.3148981077147015,86.78657326540515,72.71179039301309,7.010286268801553,27.56938379427462,7.594959193182576,1.4941642891800102,913,34,183,11,18,290,118,229,0.044,0.9,0.056,0.3523,0,0,3,0,0,0,37.0,0,5,0,4,7,7,1,0,8,0,28,0,0,3,2,35,45,16,0,4,7,0,1,2,0,2,0,1,0,1,12,9,0,1,8,1,0,5,6,2,0,0,3,4,29,5,35,39,6,23,0,0,1,0,31,9,0,5,9,136,41,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13210995917707472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.155210343274651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1423047185558409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14631769961320393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08352981742972553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4529679774856034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08630990648424215,0.15847438800523336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907893102301916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16141623629151972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13872595108867067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11027193127609612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12144062102934065,0.12249331627635696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13137325185313722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15039139610686245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3815358765719263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1760806581337516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1556985486052056,0.0,0.0,0.1327810790580258,0.2887832423913417,0.15209347983909585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585315207954102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578551762825098,0.0,0.11215959844679983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14267930391315034,0.18194388072228776,0.0,0.1948778591406031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405343682737705,0.0,0.0,0.11735296608472087,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,NICK2936,2019/02/09,"How does the alternative cert process work? I’m about to graduate from uni and am unhappy with my field of study (marketing and communications). I’ve found a program from the American Board that allows you to receive a temporary teaching certificate after completing the program in whichever subject you chose. I’m interested in teaching math or social studies but have only taken a few courses in those areas. With that being said, would I need to take addition courses to meet subject area requirements? Or can I take a test and if passing would that satisfy subject content? I think the state says temporary cert holders “must show mastery in a subject to get a professional cert” 

Can someone please help explain this to me? I’d greatly appreciate it!

teaching,OneBiteApple,2019/02/09,"California released a list of the worst schools and my school is on there. (Vent/advice) (I hope this is allowed, I'm new to reddit and still learning the rules.) 

I read that my school is one of the worst schools in CA this morning and I feel like the floodgates holding me together just broke. 

It's absolutely true that my school struggles, the last three years have been insanely hard with 75% turn over and changing from a TK-5 to a TK-8. We have a district that has actively worked against our school in the past, as well as being biased against our area/neighborhood. We have a very ineffective administration. We have a lot of teachers who don't care and hate the school too. We have a very low income population, with a lot of poverty struggling and substance abusing parents. 

We've also got a lot parents who refuse to take responsibility for their child. Parents who say ""There's no way my child could have done that."" Or ""If they're failing/acting out then it's the teachers fault for doing something towards them."" This creates kids who the only people trying to hold them accountable are in the classroom. 

I'm depressed as all hell. Every day is battle and I have little support. I feel like Sisyphus, always pushing that rock just for it to roll down hill. How can I teach when every student is 3-4 grade levels behind? How can I teach when all I do is deal with disruptive and disrespectful behaviors? 

This is the neighborhood and school I was raised in. This is my home. I don't know how to help and I feel so powerless. I came in knowing it's a tougher school but I never imagined that there'd be no way to help. I feel very defeated. 

There's so much more I could say but I'm trying to keep it short. Has anyone been or is currently in a situation like this? Does anyone have any advice or suggestions of what I can do?

teaching,Futurist110,2019/02/10,"Does anyone here have any advice for me?  

OK--here's the scoop: I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a major in History and a minor in Literary Journalism in June of last year. My overall UC GPA was 3.38, but it would have been 0.1-0.2 higher had it not failed two classes (an Econ class and a Math class) which I never retook and which weren't necessary for either my major or my minor (basically, I considered Econ as my minor beforehand, but I suffer from short attention span and thus was unable to concentrate in the relevant classes).

Anyway, I have applied to several jobs (primarily but not exclusively tutoring jobs) after I graduated and I attended several interviews but I didn't actually get accepted for any jobs yet. What I am hoping to do in the long(er)-run is become a History teacher, though. In turn, I was wondering how exactly I should proceed with this. I mean, I strongly prefer to teach in California, but given that teaching credentials are often not transferable, I am wary of immediately going to graduate school to get a teaching certificate when it might turn out that there are not going to be any History teaching jobs available in California.

I was also thinking about applying to Teach for America and I sent them a message a week or so ago asking them some questions, but so far I didn't get any response from them. I am also concerned because even if I will get accepted for Teach for America, I don't know if I will actually be paid enough money to be able to pursue a teaching certificate at the relevant location (as in, wherever I will get assigned). Plus, after completing Teach for America, am I going to spend yet additional money on getting certified as a teacher in California?

I just feel like I need some help and guidance in pursuing my goal of becoming a History teacher. I am and was always very good with History to the point that I always got As and Bs (mostly As) in all of the History classes that I have taken throughout my entire life (as in, at school, community college, and UCI). I also got 5s on the AP tests for AP Euro and AP US History back when I was in high school (a decade ago) and I recently took the US History SAT when I was applying for a tutoring job and got a 770 out of 800 on it. I really do think that teaching History would be the best job for me given that I am extremely passionate about it and also given that my short attention span makes it hard for me to concentrate and focus on subjects and topics that I am less interested in.

I want to be able to become a History teacher as soon as possible but would also like to get a job to actually earn some money in pursuit of this goal. My parents paid for my college education, but they might not be willing to pay for any additional schooling for me especially considering that my younger sister goes to MIT (she's much smarter than I am) and this drains about $50,000 out of our family's budget every year. (I still live with my parents to save money, of course.)

I really do want to be able to get a job and to become a History teacher as soon as I could--preferably in California, but at least somewhere in the U.S. Thus, I was wondering how exactly you think I should plan my subsequent life path. Indeed, any advice in regards to this would be strongly appreciated on my own part.

Note: I am currently 26 years old. It took me a bit longer to graduate from college for various reasons--one of which being that I had to take two quarters off in early 2017 as a result of my anxiety becoming very severe. I graduated from high school in 2010, if anyone is curious.",9.621919922817176,7.301995661360352,10.35016353111433,61.88192643511822,60.54848046309697,14.307399903521473,41.9913651712494,12.913307274991677,5.518951915098891,2866,131,503,88,30,993,283,691,0.027000000000000003,0.883,0.09,0.9923,12,0,0,0,0,0,83.0,3,1,4,8,28,14,0,0,31,0,56,3,0,6,4,91,97,57,0,14,21,3,2,2,0,12,2,0,0,0,25,28,0,0,14,0,12,7,10,2,0,3,27,2,73,12,112,49,17,73,0,2,0,1,18,41,0,16,27,377,98,52,0.1703669656836475,0.0,0.16625358277698624,0.0,0.0,0.11098708474193132,0.10068002381603726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22707066817553925,0.09450597550790883,0.0,0.0,0.2317107575941337,0.0,0.043443420811033036,0.0,0.0,0.07941636242350879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05309003835478463,0.0,0.0,0.0436672268285096,0.0,0.03461804033058208,0.3135948809081404,0.0,0.0,0.05959653989282693,0.0,0.06199886728976235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059542174050713326,0.0,0.0,0.04534138640407487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04969642658416061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05867820583726156,0.0,0.03750859135497615,0.0,0.04784717215181722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053535604324961364,0.0,0.028714218934737187,0.040570064775109035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373592211533572,0.0,0.09682347270628176,0.04763190926983491,0.1362580257757147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05087177925672387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038064461972079966,0.1200013686935059,0.0,0.056404279303715124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4508344676985705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031209742952889176,0.04629060520272669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08022348414140616,0.05548846257679648,0.0,0.050145717322054736,0.05025646783142306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037907090838334684,0.0,0.0,0.06185985680563534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12048828514800627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04174644081726439,0.04210831544748029,0.04379916890850442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05959049055888593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12611490254707214,0.06149694056526062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05368395001361827,0.06402105190044592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361666395914696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07276096047494872,0.0,0.05607227512957293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2873674412167625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19246617819371398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04535175962231402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04269825192120634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10916427249351257,0.05579489292795085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261893116587705,0.0,0.12354022437205035,0.11094918012306652,0.0,0.13662032199081084,0.0,0.0,0.09371372597402601,0.0669912336107274,0.0,0.04555270116482278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12317047127714616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613650724728292,0.0,0.0,0.1097107401998888
teaching,ghdfyt123,2019/02/10,"How to help students with writing who can't come up with their own words? I'm an assistant teacher who helps 5th and 6th graders with their writing. Sometimes it's groups, sometimes it's 1 on 1. Because I work with those that struggle or are behind for one reason or another, they often don't know what to write unless I tell them, which I'm not exactly trying to, I'm just trying to give examples of what to write or how to write. There are these 2 students in particular that I just don't know how to get them to write from their own mind. Maybe it's too much for them to grasp, I don't know, but I literally have to say something like ""why don't we say something like..."", then I give an example and they write that verbatim. I'm not trying to have them do that but they will not write any of their own thoughts. They don't even seem to have their own thoughts. They just say ""I don't know"" or sit there silently. I feel like if they stayed in the class paying attention to what the teacher is saying it would be more productive for them. I've talked to the teacher about it and it's the same thing of ""just encourage"" or  ""talk about it and see what ideas they have"", etc. But it is not helping and I'm afraid if I keep telling the teacher that, that they will think I can't do my job. It's already making me question my ability to help them. The teacher has a degree in education whereas I don't, so I feel inadequate to be able to assist to that depth. But that's where I'm assigned so I'm doing my best.

teaching,teach-math,2019/02/10,"help me with classroom management I recently started a subbing job at a school that serves 6-12th graders from low-income families. It's an inner-city school.

My first experience was pretty much a disaster. I've had to manage kids before, but never in a classroom. They basically talked over me the entire time. I thought it was a good idea to talk over them by shouting. That didn't work. A bunch of them got out of their seats and walked around. Part of the class was free time for them to work on other assignments. A lot of them just denied they had anything to work on. So basically I got overwhelmed policing the few kids who didn't want to follow directions.

Where do I even begin with classroom management? I need concrete strategies asap.

teaching,eli1891,2019/02/10,"Teach full-time or Sub Hello :)

I am hoping that some School Counselors, or studdnts currently enrolled in a School Counseling program might be able to help. 

I am currently in my second year of an accredited School Counseling M.Ed program, leading to certification as a School Counselor in my state. I am taking 6 classes this semester (18 credits), and will only have the internship and a few other classes to complete next year. (Yay!)

At Christmas break, I resigned from my full-time teaching position. It was my second year teaching 5th grade in a pretty challenging environment. As much as I loved the kids, I was burnt out (taught 2nd grade previously), and decided it was best if I left. I told myself I’d focus on my graduate studies and substitute teach. 

Fast forward 2 months - I’ve been offered a full-time position to teach middle school ELA. My question is, with all of the demands of my masters program and my residual feelings of burn-out, should I accept this position or substitute teach?

Background info: I am a 27 y/o female and I live at home with my parents. No rent to pay, but I do have bills. I’d like to finish this program and make a substantial salary so I can begin a life and start a family. I feel that when I was teaching full-time, I was having a bit of trouble keeping up with assignments or getting to class (some days I’d be exhausted).

teaching,minorswing-89,2019/02/10,"Serving on a Code of Conduct Committee Greetings, educators. I was recently asked by my principal to serve on our district's Code of Conduct Committee. I am only in my 5th year of teaching, am still relatively young, and have not served on any type of committee before. Do any of you have any insight as to what to expect? My assumption is that we will be revising/editing the code of conduct for the district, but I have no idea what we will be doing beyond that. I have solicited input from my colleagues at my school regarding the code of conduct and what they think should be added/changed, but am oblivious beyond that. I want to contribute the best I can serving in this position, and having a general idea prior to going to going into our first meeting would help. Thanks!

teaching,lob0lobo,2019/02/10,"What are some tips for holding a workshop for children? I’m a university student and I will soon be having to hold a workshop for some children, who the ages might range between year 1 all the way to year 13 (for approx 2 hours)

I’ve already planned roughly what I’m going to do, bought crafts and art supplies because it’s going to be a creative workshop, and have prepared my own examples of what the children can create. (I’m kind of extracting stories from the pupils)

It will be a completely independent workshop - so no teachers will be directly helping, and I’m a bit nervous as I’ve never had experience doing anything like this before and I’m nervous haha - 

Do you have any tips on how to keep it engaging, and things I can say / talk about to make sure there isn’t any super awkward long silences when the pupils are creating?
Just any tips to get me through the two hours!

      The job starts the first of April. So I figured I just won’t come back after spring break.

I’m at a charter school, so I’m an at will. There’s no worry about my certificate being held.  

 I’m just not sure when I should tell them. Now? Should I just give my two weeks before we leave for spring break? How should I tell the kids?

I will be finishing my motion/forces physics unit around mid March and was planning to have the culminating event be an egg drop. Now, I am told that at the exact tie of my event, we are having our STEAM week, which at my school just means an integrated project among the 4 core teachers centered around a central theme. This year, it will be ""World's Fair.""

I am drawing a blank on a fun, cool, project for my students to do that will be exciting, somewhat competitive, and engaging, centered around world's fair. I already let the cat out of the bag on the egg drop, and the kids were way excited. I would like to stay on this, but don't know how to make it fit.

Those have been really fun experiences!  However, I have heard from so many people how hard teaching is.

teaching,plzhalp369,2019/02/11,"Why do certain teachers post about sex on Reddit? For example, I once read a teacher's comment about a kid born to two characters in a show and how the birth dates aligned with the characters having sex on a balcony or something.

Other commenters (maybe they weren't teachers) talked about never wanting to have sex on a balcony because spiders would get into their hoo-hahs or assholes or some shit. That's pretty obvious, yet graphic and gross.

Needless to say, I now have PTSD from reading that, and worst of all, I think that teacher taught at the HS I went to! I may have even had that teacher, judging by his/her pissiness and general comments about where they work.",7.606190476190478,7.568157714285718,6.695079365079366,79.12214285714286,63.12698412698413,8.787301587301588,39.42857142857143,7.957251820313856,3.242219047619048,536,27,94,5,7,163,89,126,0.119,0.8390000000000001,0.042,-0.8908,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,3,1,9,4,1,0,8,0,9,4,1,1,4,20,14,8,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,5,6,0,0,1,3,0,1,2,3,0,1,4,1,8,1,19,8,3,15,0,0,0,3,9,7,1,5,6,66,13,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14178195144194947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15362051772321494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12151631507190801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2336633789337763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17938426265848945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476959482513589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2227525998113139,0.2366230518435982,0.0,0.0,0.2718799827379771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46529684716595704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18496131109957276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387456555951948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17905566764117778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869434007711364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14903138589080167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2272022205548719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371849437479805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21560907258913176,0.20987222173239148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693250014476278,0.0,0.0,0.16522205366978834,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,CagedBirds,2019/02/12,"TFA Corps Members - How’s it Going? Please tell me I’m not alone in feeling like I’m drowning. I’m a first year corps member and I don’t know if I’m going to make it to the summer. This has been the worst year of my life. I see a therapist now because of how anxious I am. I call in sick sometimes because I just can’t get out of bed. I have no friends who aren’t also TFA corps members because there’s literally no time for me to meet people.

If there’s anyone out there who feels similarly, please reply or DM me. I would love to talk to someone from another region and see if this is a problem across all of TFA or just my region. 

Lastly, if there’s anyone who has gone through this struggle and has advice....please reach out, too. I’ve maxed out my circle of contacts and have no one else to turn to.

teaching,nicknackpattyslap,2019/02/12,"Social Studies Quick question for you educators out there. I am in my third year of college and I have not decided on a major. I love history, government, geography, civics, etc. I am pretty interested in becoming a social studies educator, but with the goal of teaching 6th grade - 12th grade. However, I wanted opinions on this field and social studies in particular. I was reading other post regarding number of jobs and job satisfaction. (Also, I am from a very small town in Oklahoma so I know that I could probably find work, considering we are one of the lowest paying states in the U.S.) I am choosing this because my heart is in it, but wanted to hear all opinions on the subject.

teaching,sinkingliketitanic,2019/02/12,"Alternative certification in Texas...should I go the alt route or get my masters? Hi all,

I'm due to graduate college in a year and know I want to teach. I am getting my B.S. in sociology but want to teach EC - 6th. I've worked in childcare for years and really love teaching (I know it's not completely comparable, but I do love that age group and can see myself really enjoying it). 

Should I start planning for getting my Masters or will I be as hirable with an alternative certification? The cost of the Masters program scares me, but if it will help my job outlook it may be worth it. Any advice or experience is welcome!

teaching,jtwinkies,2019/02/12,"I've been working for 1.5 years in sales/marketing, but am now considering being a teacher I'm currently 24 from NJ and am coming up 1.5 years as a sales manager for a food company. When I was applying to colleges, I wanted to pursue education but was dissuaded by my family and eventually chose to study business instead (graduating with my bachelor's and concentrations in marketing/entrepreneurship.)

Currently though, I'm not feeling very fulfilled. Pay is good, I've been promoted, but something is pulling me back to my high school dreams of becoming a teacher. I used to teach summer programs at my high school, helped lead a youth group for 10 years, tutored a bit in high school to make money, and just loved helping people learn. Even all my previous career aptitude tests gave me results to become a teacher.

I'm most interested in teaching an older age range--7th grade to high school--as I feel that would be best for me. The only related subject matter I took in college was a bit of math (calc and stats for business), basic literature classes, and some other social sciences. I feel I'm best suited to be a math teacher based on the strength of my previous test scores, but I only feel confident up to algebra and geometry. Unsure if I'd even qualify to be an English or Social Sciences teacher.

I guess what I'm asking for is feedback and is this even feasible? I'd love to just discuss with people and hear from people. Also, I'm new to reddit so apologies if I framed this weird/if this has been asked before.

teaching,eml_h,2019/02/12,"How to control a chatty GT class? My GT class is really pushing my limits as a student teacher. They’re a 7th grade GT English class... they also fill up every desk in class. 

They’re an incredibly bright class but they’re too smart for the material we have for them. They get bored easily and get chatty quickly. It’s incredibly hard for me to get them under control. I’m stern with them, not necessarily mean. I got feedback from them yesterday though, and they all said I’m not stern enough. Usually I’d have chatty kids move seats, but like I said, there’s no empty desks. I resorted to silent work yesterday, but they ignored that as well. I don’t know how to discipline the whole class, but that’s definitely what’s needed. 

I also don’t know how to push their thinking more. My host teacher is a worksheet type teacher, so I don’t have much wiggle room. I give them more free reign to figure out the worksheets themselves, but that’s not challenging enough most of the time either. 

Thanks for any tips!

teaching,rainmanthony4,2019/02/12,"I’m about to be a college graduate in May with a degree in Supply Chain Management. I want to teach Elementary School, but I am hesitant. I am 22 years old and teaching and coaching kids is something I’m passionate about. For the past 4 summers I’ve been the head coach for my neighborhood swim team. I’m in charge of 230 kids, and I have loved every second of it. I love working with the kids and I think its really rewarding to watch them grow and improve.

In May I’m going to graduate with a business degree in supply chain management. I’ve spent a lot of time this semester talking with companies and applying to jobs because that was originally my plan. However as time passes I’m learning more and more that none of these jobs (or classes that I’m taking) interest me, and I just want to teach.

However part of me is hesitant and I’m trying to figure out why. I think part of me feels like I’m kind of wasting the work I did to get my business degree and I’ll be wasting all of the business knowledge I’ve gained over the past 4 years. I know I would love teaching, but I feel obligated to enter the business world and start a long career that could provide me with great opportunities down the road.

Ultimately, I’m just kind of scared to be making this big life decision and I am trying to find some direction. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",4.697999611575064,5.839486859778602,5.909162944261023,78.10106816857645,69.70110701107009,9.247698582248981,30.86832394639736,9.549672527348893,2.8673276752767536,1093,45,208,24,19,366,138,271,0.059,0.745,0.196,0.9925,4,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,1,7,4,13,0,1,13,0,18,6,1,2,1,46,43,17,0,5,6,0,2,1,0,4,1,0,0,3,9,18,0,0,10,4,1,5,1,1,0,1,4,3,21,12,38,30,8,27,0,0,1,4,9,11,0,6,12,126,30,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12870774233796872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08956888558912378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029060003646754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516155987178867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11097329962735557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13319540019206982,0.09409529867102936,0.0,0.0,0.12038266272629007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06881424435280566,0.0,0.07485513956465661,0.0,0.0,0.29042656762432634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13517482631801864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2614082829571814,0.0,0.0,0.2743161992881182,0.07238563953193164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930322978600163,0.06434798031384048,0.0,0.0,0.1165612472388768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197709361184878,0.3566264992604698,0.0,0.08791898790290642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820991014369052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28526318712672977,0.25146860180170605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437827675939248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318669970310769,0.13329988679835952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10139856906065163,0.0,0.0,0.09322664904484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09903126331022637,0.1058653634550792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16879185644920452,0.0,0.0,0.15360501120817002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17884802170281058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553746628181259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884987082280055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917762568386164,0.0,0.0,0.18712928822729924,0.0,0.0,0.16963681512058906

teaching,wowsuchdrum,2019/02/13,"Anything I should know about charter schools? Hi,

I currently teach 7th grade ELA at a title 1 school in Indiana. It is my first year.

I'm considering leaving this school after my first year and moving back to my original hometown in Georgia. I have found a few positions, but they are at charter schools.

Since I'm new to the education world in the first place, is there anything I should know before I apply to a charter school? Any red flags I should be aware of or look out for?

Also, if there are any Georgia peeps willing to clue me in on the state of education in GA, that would be cool too. Savannah area specifically. I'm just sort of toying with the idea right now.

teaching,Cdnteacher92,2019/02/13,"Handling an ODD Child I am dealing with a child (5 years old) at a Head Start who I suspect has Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Nothing is diagnosed, no IPP is in place, nothing is official, I just have a gut feeling and the symptoms align with the behaviours. 

They have a lot going on at home, and at school they are violent, angry, and always in a 'fight' state of mind. Behaviours include hitting me/other staff/other students, throwing chairs, spitting, swearing, refusal to follow routines, defiance and refusal to re-directions, climbing, saying they don't want something then quickly changing their mind, and perfectionism, among other things. 

Now to my question. How do you handle a student like this? I'm a relatively new teacher and I'm feeling really out of my element and as though I've exhausted all avenues I know of. I have been firm, gentle, left them alone, intervened, taken them out of the class, redirected behaviours, given warnings, etc. 

There's probably a lot more nuance to this situation than I can safely convey here while maintaining anonymity, but I'm burning out because of this and I'm willing to try just about anything.",7.611153846153848,8.773061578431374,7.709411764705883,67.73966063348419,63.11764705882353,10.394570135746608,40.692307692307686,10.389873798559362,4.787136199095023,918,51,137,21,13,297,139,204,0.099,0.8420000000000001,0.059,-0.6791,0,1,1,0,1,0,37.0,0,1,6,1,9,5,2,0,12,0,14,6,3,1,1,31,28,14,0,1,3,0,2,1,0,1,3,1,1,2,6,13,0,3,5,0,0,4,2,3,0,0,3,3,15,2,25,23,5,25,0,0,0,0,16,12,0,3,9,97,21,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1679261583277983,0.0,0.0,0.13491187577769365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13342582933642316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09883787203182368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17152059575482256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16715724672881258,0.0,0.16456674383978326,0.0,0.0,0.1858242930099378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1808268246406384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16396377550338376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921468104841098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16640045259938402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16263771972466784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910685153366983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17616350434517544,0.0,0.0,0.07921247868214948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2756880044208567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3274264920387968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15659397335763056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3111517319214753,0.0,0.17013664620898922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16939979005338726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17481227933245766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18163176284507992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386980937771992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12893871336495788,0.0,0.16409239870232376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18225000146264494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12482181959625133,0.0,0.0,0.1147621714629675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16852355243670974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077173395019762,0.0,0.1592998458197066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11008111705590967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09563324370244253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10441161117963776
teaching,Hannahmaysee,2019/02/13,"Veteran teachers: what cultural, behavioral, intellectual changes have you seen in students? I’m only in my fourth year of teaching, but I feel like I can already start stories with “back in my day we used to...”

I love my school and my students. This year has been so much better than my first three. We have a supportive admin, and I have good relationships with most of my kiddos. But there are a few pervasive and contagious mentalities students have that make me feel defeated and useless. 

Many kids have the belief that teachers are just there for a pay check and don’t care. They express this candidly. Our school is tough to work at—many behavioral and academic issues and pressures—and our staff works really hard to build connections with our tough kids. We’ve started a house system to try to better our school culture so kids feel proud to be apart of our community, which has been ALOT of work. I tried to explain to them that the paycheck isn’t worth it—we’re here because we care. They don’t understand, or don’t want to. And apart of me feels like they need to say that to justify their poor behavior and lack of motivation in class; if they can blame the teacher, the responsibility is off of them. 

Also, “back in my day” (I’m only 27), we never complained about a teacher’s teaching style or grading. I had a teacher literally sit at the front of the room and read directly from the textbook and I never once said she was a bad teacher. Somehow these kids are pedagogy experts and take it upon themselves to declare that so and so is a bad teacher. I think it’s great that we challenge how we teach—we all know the system is flawed and we should be creative. But just because a teacher doesn’t teach the exact way you need them to does not make them bad. 

Did we go too far the other way in giving kids a voice that they feel like they can degrade adults and their professions? Are we encouraging them to be ungrateful? 

Basically, since when were kids so entitled to complain about all this stuff? Is this teenagers? Is this generational? Is it my school? Are other people experiencing this?

teaching,teachingforwhat,2019/02/13,"Teaching Is Destroying Me #  Teaching Is Destroying Me

Becoming a teacher was an easy decision. At the age of five, my first-grade teacher showed me that teaching was what I was born to – or so I thought. 

I grew up always thinking I wanted to teach. I followed the rules and set good examples throughout my childhood because of the fear of potentially getting in trouble was too great. Being a “typical” teen, or even college student for that matter, was out of the question in my mind. I knew, one poor decision would seal my fate and I could never fulfill my dream to teach. 

So I did it. I became a teacher. And it is destroying me. 

**How teaching destroyed my personality.**

I used to be happy go lucky. I used to be positive. Not anymore. All day, every day, is spent correcting children. Forty hours a week I have to be mean. Because if you show any ounce of yourself, you’re seen as weak and you’re taken advantage of. I have lost myself and the person I wanted to be. Misery is an understatement for who I am Monday-Friday. 

**How teaching destroyed my views on the world.**  

This world is going downhill, and it scares me to even consider bringing my own children into it. Students hit their teachers, call them “bitches”, and falsely accuse teachers of abusing them. Parents laugh when you call for support, yell at you or refuse to take your calls. The respect in our world is lost. Ten year old's speak daily about drugs, jail and gang association. The vulgarity of their language is appalling. And my personal favorite – ten-year old’s talking in detail about sex. Students in our fourth-grade classrooms are telling each other they “suck dick like lollipops” and that they would “smash a one-year old, if she was cute”. School shootings, bomb threats and deadly weapons in our schools have become almost a common place. In two-years I have been threatened more times than I can even count.

I am twenty-three years old. Just fourteen year’s ago, I was in their shoes. What the hell as happened to the world in fourteen years?! And how the hell do we get out of it? As a second-year teacher, I am fearful for my life between now and retirement if I stay in the classroom. Will the day come that these threats will actually become a reality and I am standing face-to-face with a student holding a deadly weapon? 

**How teaching destroyed my health.** 

I am not a seasoned veteran in the field of education, I am brand new. Still wet behind the ears. And during these two years, I have had to enlist the help of not one, but two doctors because of my profession. I am under the care of a gastrointestinal doctor, because of stress induced tummy troubles. Which, by the way, I cannot handle properly during the day because I cannot leave the classroom to go to the restroom. So, I don’t eat. I wake up in the morning, go to school, teach, come home and then finally eat a meal in the comfort of my own home – where I can access the bathroom at my leisure. I am also under the care of a cardiologist because of chest pain. Chest pain induced by stress. Which, I have learned, is aggravated even worse when breaking up physical fights between students. 

Yes, teaching has destroyed my physical well being but that’s not all – it has had catastrophic impacts on my mental health. As a college student, I shamefully self-harmed. I’d sit in the shower, as hot as I could get it, and cut my legs. High enough up that people wouldn’t see, and my flaws wouldn’t be recognized to the outside world. And not a day goes by that I don’t consider doing it again. The only reason I don’t, is because of my fiancé. He is my backbone. He is my outlet. He is the only reason I make it through each day. Days filled with constant negatively and reminders of everything I have done wrong that day. 

One thing I didn’t know before entering education, is how big of an impact administration has on their teachers. I bust my ass every single day, and never receive any recognition. There was even a time they made my sit in the office (full of administrative staff, I might add), watch footage of myself and tell them everything that I was doing wrong. And this is just the tip of the iceberg which is my every day life. Nothing is right – nothing. No matter what you do, someone will critique it. 

**Teaching sucks.** 

And what’s sad is it’s not the actual teaching that sucks. Because honestly, teaching actual content to children is the smallest part of my day. 

So where do I go? I have over thirty years left until retirement, if I make it that long. After all, I found my first gray hair the other day! What?!! In all realness though, I don’t know that my physical and mental health will hold out another thirty plus years. Teaching is destroying me. It is destroying me from the inside out and making me fear what is to come in this world. Did you know that nearly 50% of teachers leave the field within the first five years?

teaching,MrCance,2019/02/13,"Student teacher starting edTPA. Advice? Hello teachers. I just got home from a workshop on edTPA at my university and I am overwhelmed by what is required. 

I still barely have an idea on what edTPA is and I’m wondering if anyone on here can give me a summary on what to do and what is expected. 

I’m in NJ so the stakes are already pretty high. I’m in a 5th grade inclusion classroom. 

Any advice is appreciated.

teaching,AuthorAnnon,2019/02/13,"Alternatives to Kahoot I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm trying to find a free alternative for Kahoot.  Kahoot recently changed it's model and is not longer free for universities.  We may not have the budget to purchase one of their plans, so I'm looking for alternatives:

* It needs to be presenter-paced, not student paced.
* It needs to be competitive.

teaching,sodangbutthurt,2019/02/13,"I will be applying for teaching positions for the first time soon. How do I explain my poor tenure while working in Corporate America? I recently quit my job in the corporate world to finish my alternative certification requirements so I could become a full-time teacher for the 2019-2020 school year (I have finished them all). I hated Corporate America. It made me depressed and miserable. I kept trying to make it work and find a job that I liked, but that never happened. Due to this I have a poor track record of tenure (I am fairly early in my career). How do I explain this to future employers? Is this something that is common in the teaching world? Honestly, I was tired of working with spreadsheets all the time and was looking to make a bigger impact, but I’m not exactly sure how I need to sell this. Any advice is appreciated and I can provide additional details if needed.

I started that and my masters program in curriculum and instruction in August. I will earn my masters and my Colorado teaching license in June.

Before starting my masters program, I taught preschool for three years. Now I’m ready to experience a different teaching environment.

How did you find the schools you’re currently looking for?

Did you need teaching experience to get the job?

teaching,happygalinha,2019/02/13,"Teacher's Assistants and BREAKS I began my job yesterday as a bilingual TA in New York and need some advice on what some of my rights are. I'm having a hard time finding information online and I have a lot of questions pertaining to the union. Here's the issue: the only time carved out for a break for me is the period before dismissal. That means I am nonstop class to class for close to six hours. Do any of you think it is fair for me to ask for a different lunch period closer to the middle of the day? I noticed myself unable do my best by the time 7th period rolled around. I was sort of light headed and really unable to focus. I feel bad asking as I was hired very recently, but I know myself and I need a fucking breather halfway into the day.

teaching,acandidworld,2019/02/13,"History/Religion Teacher Questions Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently going back to school after spending some time in the IT world. I decided to go for Parks and Recreation due to my love of being outside. As I am going through the program I am starting to wonder if it is really for me. All my life I have loved the study of the Bible and the history of it. I have also really enjoyed history but over the past couple of years my interest in History has grown. I find myself reading/watching videos about religion and history when I should be doing Parks and Rec homework. I have seriously been considering changing things up and pursuing a teaching degree in one of these fields. I just love talking about the stuff and will ramble on to others about it every chance I get. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also been extremely inspired by teachers lately. My wife is a teacher and it is really great to see what she does as well as my professors. I have started to develop a concern for the younger people that I am in classes with and the ways that they learn. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all of this being said, I had a couple of questions. I would love to pursue a major in Religion and a minor in History (then maybe a masters in Apologetics or something). What would be the chances of being able to get a job with this setup? I would love to teach religion at some point probably at community college but at the same time wouldn't mind teaching high school history. Would it be better to major in History and minor in Religion? I live in North Carolina and it is one of the worst states for teacher pay and whatnot so there is a huge need for teachers so lateral entry is pretty common so I hear. Im just starting to think of these things and didn't know if anyone else had any advice. I know this is super unorganized and rambling but I hope it lays out the jist of what I am trying to get across. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: one thing that I thought was if I happened to major in History and the teaching thing, for whatever reason, didn't work out then I could still be a Park Ranger with a History degree or work at a museum. If it all goes down the drain then I could just fall back on my IT degree haha. But lets not go there just yet.

&amp;#x200B;

teaching,K_Rich190,2019/02/13,"Spicing Up Note Taking I teach a High School Health class to 8th graders and a lot of the material is taught through note taking/lectures. The students have a High School Health Manual that is a requirement of the curriculum and the notes are fill in the blank. The issue I have is only in my larger classes (30-34 students) but my smaller classes (12-15 students) could benefit from this as well.

Other than showing general excitement, using video examples, having volunteers present the information, and/or completing gallery walks. What else can I do to make note taking less of a drag for my students?

The only issue is that not all the classrooms I am in have access to technology so that makes it difficult to use various tech tools.",7.788507462686567,8.453325873134332,7.497723880597018,71.14121268656717,62.65671641791045,10.87910447761194,37.6455223880597,10.686352973137794,4.2903014925373135,593,28,97,14,8,188,89,134,0.039,0.879,0.08199999999999999,0.7762,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,0,14,0,13,2,0,4,1,14,20,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,2,0,1,1,2,0,2,1,1,1,0,1,1,7,3,16,18,4,9,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,1,67,14,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18908857566813225,0.0,0.0,0.14399101663071068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15065532474215296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833971597003407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3810893412315633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37646719606550894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533230922799179,0.0,0.0,0.2407637251618741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743213963655753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3650380660054005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2711943850899167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3115208042164743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16215204885313114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,purpleraccoons,2019/02/13,"Music/Singing teachers: how do you teach a student to sing? I am not a voice teacher I'm a piano teacher in a studio. I have a student (let's call him A) who is following the RCM curriculum. An ear test portion is required, and that means intervals. I find that singing helps in finding intervals, so I make my students do that.

He has never learned how to sing - in many public schools where I'm from, the music department is either extremely underfunded/nonexistent or students can either choose band or choir as their music elective. I have taught several other students and this is the first student I've had who cannot sing.

I have tried to help him sing, but he does not even know the singing techniques. When he tries to sing, he uses his speaking voice (speech-singing, if you will) and cannot match tones. (I play a note and ask him to sing it back.) Though I have been singing from the age of four, I never really needed to be taught how to sing, and am not trained in this as is not my area of expertise.

TDLR; piano teacher, need to teach student how to sing. cannot match tones, does not know what a singing voice is

So I’m in the education program at my university and a girl I know a year above me shared the phrase “A lesson plan is not complete without shredded wheat”. It’s a metaphor somewhat related to how modifying an environment positively impacts a learning experience.

Would anyone here happen to know what this expression really means? My apologies if this doesn’t belong in this sub, but I thought I’d try here since it relates to teaching and education as a whole.

teaching,slowly_napping,2019/02/14,"Want to become a teacher. I live in Ontario. I am a single mother, in my 30s. I have a 2 year diploma in Early Childhood Education, and currently work as a casual call-in ECE for the school board (jk/sk classrooms) I would love a full time kindergarten classroom, but I'm not sure how likely that is. So I am considering going back to school to become a teacher. I love working with children, and love being in the school system. I don't want to go back to daycare ages. 
Do you have any advice on the best way to go about this? I have booked an appointment to speak with my old college to see if I can transfer my courses towards a teaching degree. 
I am feeling a little lost and over whelmed at the amount of schooling. I'm not really sure where to begin.

teaching,likeitsmaddie,2019/02/14,"Small Group Help Hi everyone. I’m a university student studying elementary education, and right now I’m in a class that involves spending an hour or so working with students in small groups at a local school twice a week. There are four groups total (5-6 students each) and four instructors in the room, so we each work with 2 groups a day. 
With that being said, I absolutely CANNOT figure out how to make these kids fully cooperate! I did a lesson a few weeks back that involved writing character feelings and actions and how these factors affect a story’s outcome. I used dry erase pockets and it went really well! 
However, our cooperating teacher wants us to focus more on having students work on or discuss something in pairs or small groups.My first time doing this was a DISASTER and I had to revise because students were fighting over who did what.  I decided to assign roles like reader, writer, and checker to keep students on task. It went fairly well except students were still either unhappy with their given role or upset because one member wasn’t doing what they were supposed to. It seems i can never make these kids happy and wanting to cooperate! Does anyone have any tips? I’m so new to actually planning lessons and teaching them, so I’m feelin a bit lost. My cooperating teacher is great, but she has a lot more experience and i think the kids respect her rules a bit more. Please help 😭

TL;DR: Getting students to cooperate in small groups is really really hard and I need help. 😅",4.943927068723703,7.113007157706092,5.846962755181547,74.74841514726509,70.61290322580646,7.862926601215523,30.768427614149914,8.587818076936951,2.7180832476235004,1203,52,197,21,23,395,172,279,0.046,0.851,0.104,0.9499,1,0,1,0,2,0,28.0,3,0,3,8,12,9,1,1,15,0,19,0,0,6,2,47,39,22,0,3,7,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,3,13,19,0,1,7,0,1,3,3,3,2,5,13,3,17,6,25,25,11,32,0,1,0,0,29,18,0,6,12,132,30,15,0.0,0.0,0.129888994221163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09051437193536346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09306847348122976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023477283035304,0.0,0.1622762901830009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2906272591762755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08584020330169326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647903324997147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12718529400421136,0.0,0.13019994022476186,0.0,0.0,0.06730070332888312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11321705316286873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06954064535728884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14674615068031696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416902548047532,0.1192338378191912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676477185444941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13107930694647746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11830775840356207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06502723557524817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14529727476243462,0.113159120298965,0.0,0.0,0.17769411596186505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0986939345991246,0.1026569756071924,0.12855137681085452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901938059946543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14610674884613267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2558069136050105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136689429360776,0.12661110825476454,0.0,0.0,0.1347069962213939,0.0,0.12117166113908692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10246892917448483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10629595486199186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528680899519292,0.0,0.0,0.07761323044372145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16010610944873685,0.1149579611126182,0.0,0.0,0.15701479288427433,0.0,0.21353384773522247,0.0,0.2393505496144817,0.2467749955034797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2907009614838303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,MrH92,2019/02/14,"I'm a long term substitute being given zero direction by the absent teacher. Help? I've been subbing for a teacher at my school site who recently took another job but is still on campus. He was leaving me lesson plans at first, but now he doesn't even reply to my emails in a timely manner. All my classes are in a computer lab so the kids stay occupied by playing typing games or doing other homework. I have three periods of computer literacy (I barely know how to use excel or sheets) and two periods of business law ( and I know even less about this subject). I asked the teacher I'm subbing for what I can do, and he just gave me three movies on DVDs to play while the kids sit there.  There's been multiple times where the teacher has stated that there's no curriculum and no one is going to check in on me but I feel weird about being relegated to being a babysitter. I obviously don't wanna make waves with the teacher or administration. However, I feel like the kids are (and have been) learning nothing which isn't fair.

Should I keep things as is? Or start trying to create lessons for the classes? I'm completely uneducated on these two subjects though.",5.4542666666666655,6.425564115555559,6.412888888888888,75.80200000000002,67.84444444444443,9.2,31.44444444444445,9.3871,2.872244444444444,926,37,168,18,15,308,138,225,0.035,0.8759999999999999,0.08900000000000001,0.9002,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,5,14,5,0,0,13,0,22,0,0,3,2,30,38,17,0,2,8,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,3,8,6,0,1,7,3,1,2,5,1,0,7,7,2,15,4,27,27,3,28,0,0,0,0,12,11,0,4,13,121,23,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19782203187278405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763676852722246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19780199334615509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2492107235218348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19078005911679946,0.13477572511652453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16047050793726356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10721742590771326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264519909419756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872117490704508,0.16768592322066428,0.0,0.0,0.2073605630403963,0.0,0.0,0.1997592285920541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09216768349821768,0.0,0.0,0.16695442640582095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12592919639430838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18102030655255472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12783803726048554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18627482064455603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1909297186463036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13353153029600354,0.2010819573282555,0.15066074758051115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253345157184873,0.0,0.18535334350210464,0.0,0.22001340193935665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2096035103103947,0.12808488920857009,0.0,0.36857856365426495,0.0,0.0,0.1629380194575152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,chickenandtea,2019/02/14,"Should I back out now before it's too late? University student here.

I'm in my third year of undergrad right now, and have always planned on doing the intermediate/secondary education degree as a second degree after I finish my bachelor's. It's a full year (September to September) program thst is quite competitive because they keep reducing seats every year, since the profession is in pretty low demand where I live in Canada. 
I fully intend to immigrate to the US due to a long term relationship, and I feel as if everything I hear about the education system in America is negative. Violence in the classroom, underappreciation, severely under funded schools, and insane work hours due to said lack of funding. I've seen some very moving articles and videos of teachers quitting or protesting, and it's seems, to a foreigner, that the government is ignoring this great problem. 

Even thinking of an emergency plan, one where I stay in Canada, seems very bleak. In my hometown I hear about a lot more violence and drug abuse within our schools than I had back in high school - and I only graduated in 2013. However, the biggest issue I see now is funding cuts and increased classroom sizes. In the past few years my province has cut many teaching jobs, and even went so far as to have a single teacher instruct multiple grade levels.. At the same time, and in the same classroom!

I'm not in school to become a corrections officer, or even a social worker. I wanted to teach because I love sharing information and throwing new concepts at people to get them to learn to use thst amazing organ of theirs and think! I wanted them to learn about the world and different cultures, recent and ancient history, and apply thst new knowledge to better understand our current world and the direction we're headed. I wanted to push these young people to learn humility and respect, and why learning to read and write is so important.

I guess my main concern is, in this day and age, is it worth the mental strain, poor wages, physical threat, and lack of appreciation, to become a teacher? 
I fully understand that students NEED teachers, and if everyone said ""it's not worth it"", then there would be nobody to teach these kids. Someone has to do it, but should that person be me? I know none of you can fully answer this question for me, but I'd like to hear other people's ought and opinions on the matter, even if it's just about their own griefs and experiences.

teaching,chunderwoman,2019/02/14,"I just want to teach a fucking math class... I'm reaching out for some feedback/information on how other schools are run... because I'm starting to feel burnt out and tired AF at my current position.

I teach in a Title 1 district that has become hyper-focused on ""Maslow's Before Blooms""... aka being hyper concerned about students' social-emotional well being and only vaguely concerned with whether they are actually learning anything.  

I get it - I really do - I was a student that struggled socially and emotionally in middle/high school.  I feel for these kids.  I want the best for them.  But I also know that enabling them to run to the counselor/""safe room""/god knows where every single time they feel remotely uncomfortable is not setting them up for any semblance of success after high school.  These kids are sooooo enabled in some ways; if I get on their case for behavior, lack of production, etc. they go nuts and turn on me... virtually immediately.  There is no accountability, no guaranteeing they actually learn anything, no homework, no focus on academic integrity... 100% of their actions are traced back to ""did you ask what was wrong today that made them respond this way?""  It's miserable.

I became a math teacher because I love math.  I love projects.  I love academic excellence.  I love helping kids branch out into exciting careers - whether they are interested in vocational fields, computer science, high-end shit, whatev.  But 90% of my day is spent pandering to kids with IEPs, behavior improvement plans, kids that need to go to the fucking ""safe room""... etc.  I'm tired.

Is this the new normal?  Are there still schools where there is an expectation that in math class you'll do some... ya know... actual math?  Are there still places where kids will reliably do 20 minutes of homework so that the next day they can actually come prepared and ready to learn something new?  And not just the top 5% of kids - but anybody who realizes that math can be remotely important?  

I feel like I'm in this constant loop of hand-holding crap.  I'm a pretty sensitive person, but I'm over it.  It's just so constant.  Is it like this everywhere?

teaching,elthecar,2019/02/15,"PGDE (Scotland) funding for a student from England Hi all, just posting this because I’m a bit confused and hoping someone can clear things up. 

So I am currently an undergraduate studying in England, where I have spent my entire life. I have accepted a PGDE secondary course in Scotland and am looking into my finance options. 

I know that for rest of UK (rUK) students I have to go through student finance England. Their website says that PGCE courses (English equivalent) are exempt to rules that would prevent a second degree receiving financial support. It does not however mention anything about PGDEs in Scotland. 

I’m pretty sure I will not have any problem receiving funding, but hopefully someone here can confirm it for me.

teaching,okaythenwhateverman,2019/02/15,"Undergrad classes - non degree? I am going through an alternative secondary mathematics certification program (where I will concurrently get certified while teaching) and need about 6 undergrad math classes to qualify. I have a Bachelor's in another content area, but want to teach math. 

Any ideas for an online source where I can take classes that aren't part of a degree? Degree programs will require a lot of extra classes that I don't need, which will in turn slow down my ability to get my certification. Many don't allow me to frontload math classes because of pre-requisites, and I don't want to spent 4 years and $20K on the six classes I need. 

I looked into Western Governor's because the self-pacing appealed to me, but their programs have a student teaching component and would take about a year and a half based on the order of classes.

Anyone else ever been in this position? I could literally take all six classes from six different places, but I'm having trouble finding even one.

teaching,schirster_mclure,2019/02/15,"To the math and science teachers. My son is 20 and he’s thinking about changing his major from marketing to Civil Engineering. I never wanted him to go into business because I think he’s capable of a more difficult degree. However Engineering is a whole different monster. On top of that he has always been a B student in math and science related fields. 

He tells me that he is serious about it now and I won’t lie, he does seem to have a whole new motivation. I think after he started his internship and saw the road ahead he realized he’d screwed up.

I have an MA in English and I don’t know if somebody his age can just flip the switch to start understanding such a complex and intense  curriculum. Is math an inherent skill or can he learn it? I just worry for him.

I've already taken the Praxis for elementary education, but I haven't taken any of the other steps yet. I was interested in the program through CU Denver, Aspire to teach. I know the CDE states that you need to have the degree, background check and content exam for your endorsement area before you can be accepted in a program. Afterward, I would have to find employment and apply to the program. I guess I'm just a little confused about the order in which I do that part. If I apply to the program first but don't find employment, would I lose my deposit? If I try to find employment first, will they even take me if I don't have proof that I'm already in a program? The whole process was just a little confusing for me, and I would greatly appreciate some clarity.

teaching,LMD_5,2019/02/15,"Marine Biology &amp; Oceanography After School Class I’m a teaching assistant at my local primary school and a marine biology graduate, talking to the kids they all have an interest in the sea and what lives there. Science class there is pretty basic and only happens twice a week, so they don’t cover much in terms of biology.

So I came up with the idea of doing an after school class for those that were interested. I just got approval from the heads of the school, so need to get started on some lesson plans. I was basically going to follow the titles of Blue Planet and Blue Planet II so that they can watch the corresponding episode as a follow up. 

I feel like the most important lessons I want to teach is how amazing life under the waves is, and how we can best protect it. Also teaching them what they’re eating. The kids that will hopefully attend will be aged 9-11, so I’m gonna have to ‘dumb down’ some more technical stuff like climate change and pollution. 

Would really love some advice as to how to get these points across and explain them in a way they’d understand, and also if anyone has any experience doing this sort of thing and activities they done with them, that would be great!

Thank you for any help you can give!",8.019313725490193,7.0914883403361335,8.010546218487395,72.95626750700279,62.655462184873954,11.126610644257703,32.858543417366946,10.317481424215053,3.1609232492997186,987,31,183,19,12,320,145,238,0.0,0.809,0.191,0.9929,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,2,8,5,13,11,1,0,17,0,22,4,1,3,1,35,43,22,0,6,2,0,1,2,0,5,1,0,0,2,12,13,1,1,6,0,0,5,1,1,0,1,5,4,17,10,31,30,9,24,0,0,3,1,18,12,1,7,8,130,29,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317392039701478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156222709333924,0.0,0.1460714930715588,0.0,0.1833570144835568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426545793327908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414795377878768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15419191380230485,0.0,0.0,0.1426159029674353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13796207659558682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13794892647427792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13187448476468305,0.0,0.0,0.0681662799573953,0.09631153121856824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14087006124372875,0.12932638704651744,0.07661820742242235,0.0,0.1078234997160576,0.14863350151129254,0.0,0.0,0.1192160486595334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383586075900382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09036334148993556,0.0,0.0,0.13390125298378952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15218920108769865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09522349348192022,0.13172714476448913,0.0,0.11904370491179707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167538195142752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991041956754003,0.09996326996917933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253252935129548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12744331211531218,0.0,0.0,0.13715484947498868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0863656436725174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5457580300030254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09542242223254734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15433038924500245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835881708623728,0.0,0.12411911153916587,0.0,0.0,0.0895647870783016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403466861205391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07951710606127113,0.10700950331329356,0.10814008862558312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1915367562413714,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,asherleebee,2019/02/15,"Filming for TPA &amp; Student Behavior I’m a Secondary ELA Credential Candidate in my student teaching placement, and today was WILD. I teach 10 and 12 mainstream classes, and today I was filming the lesson for my upcoming TPA. 
I paired students up for the activity, and two girls who are good friends but DO NOT work well (or at all) together wanted to be partners. I said no and gave them other partners. Girl one flew off the handle, and started yelling at me. I asked her to calm down, and explained that the last assignment they worked on together was submitted late, so I want them to work with other people. This kid tried to CONDUCT A FUCKING POLL to see how many people turned their assignments in late! I asked her to step outside while I got the rest of the class under control. 
I went out to talk to her and she apologized, saying she hates Valentine’s Day and didn’t want to go to school. One of the VPs was walking by and offered me support. It was a doozy. 
Overall, I felt I handled it well but what a day to lose her cool like that! Kids are wild. Also, Valentine’s Day in HS is a trip.

teaching,rich_uncle_skeleton1,2019/02/16,"Newly-hired charter school teacher with field experience but no ed major seeks recs for essential educator canon I don’t ever post on reddit, so excuse that title for sounding like a personal ad. I’m about to start teaching 7th grade Language Arts at a public charter school. I’ve worked with 3-14 year olds, in various capacities, for over 5 years. Currently I work at an elementary school less than a mile from the middle school I’ll be starting at (a lot of kids I had as primary school learners will be in the class I’m teaching!). 
I’m looking for the books that helped shape you as educators. 
I’m nervous because I’m a huge proponent of public schools, and even though I’ve worked with young people my entire working life, I’m still relatively young, and insecure about not having licensure (I got the job because of my field experience, because I graduated really well from a well-regraded college with a degree in English Lit, and I’ve got a few pieces published.)

teaching,princesslayup,2019/02/16,"Striking on Thursday. Looking for advice and words of wisdom. I’m a new teacher (less than 2 years as the classroom teacher) and I’m going on strike this coming Thursday in Oakland, CA. Those who have been on strike before, what was your experience like? How did you handle coworkers and friends crossing the picket line? What were strike days like for you? I’m anxious, annoyed, confused, and intrigued. I didn’t want to strike, but I’m willing to do what I need to for my students and so I can continue to work and live in the same city. Please share your experience with me if you’ve been on strike before.

teaching,RogerDoger1978,2019/02/16,"Considering relocation from Oregon to Arizona in 2020-2021 (x post from r/teachers) I am in my second year out of Grad School.  I live in Orgon (Portland), have an M.Ed, and am endorsed in Language Arts.  I am currently in my second year of subbing and it's fine, but I definitely want my own classroom.  My wife has a job in which she can transfer to Phoenix pretty much whenever she would like. 

 I've heard some of the horror stories (and will gladly listen to more), but I'm having a really tough time finding a full time job here and, through some research, it seems that it might be much easier to find a full time job in the Phoenix area (primarily because of the horror stories.)  Really, I feel like I just need an opportunity to get my foot in the door as a full time teacher and I would be willing to endure.  

What I need now is some resources to give me more information about the area schools.  I am going to try to find a job in this area again this summer and if I don't, we are going to seriously consider relocating.  I know the cost of living is much lower there and, if what I've heard is to be believed, finding a teaching job would be easier as well.  

I've done some research on the area schools, but the district websites only tell you so much.  Any information, tips, resources, anecdotes, etc. would be greatly appreciated.

teaching,lunapark2525,2019/02/16,"Teacher burnout recovery I’m wondering if anyone has perspective on bring a teacher recovering from severe burnout. I taught in a densely populated urban environment for ten years. I taught art btw so I know that it will seem like I had the “easy” subject the “fun” stuff. In my last position I held for three and a half years I taught in a small tight knit community. I got to know kids and some families well, I collaborated w colleagues on amazing productions with the kids and community events. I assisted with major events for holidays, family nights, carnivals and created all costumes and props and I loved a lot of the work. Over time though there was a lot of interpersonal conflict and drama between colleagues, there was a significant incident of verbal and near physical violence between two families during dismissal while many other kids and families witnessed it. It triggered a lot of difficult things for me. At that time I was already heading towards burnout and then major panic attacks started. I had almost no support system in my outside life (my own family/siblings are significantly dysfunctional and not in my life for years.) I was told by supervisors that I simply had to stop my anxiety, as in many schools it was sometimes explicitly or covertly implied that if you you did not sacrifice your entire life and well being to the school that you were weak and lacking in dedication. My schedule because of school events and the labor hours to just create props or install exhibitions was irregular and demanded all of my creativity in off hours. I felt that I could not function. I crept through my last year there while also working a weekend job in order to save money to leave and move to another city. I have done that and while it has helped some I am running out of money and almost contemplating what I told myself never to do - return to teaching. Because nearly all of my experience has been in a classroom I am not getting interviews for many office jobs or customer service jobs I’m applying for. I really really do not want to be in front of a classroom again, I do not want to be responsible for organizing and installing and labeling the work of hundreds of kids and part time museum education work in my new city does not pay nearly as well as it did in my old city. I have no health insurance. I do not feel significantly recovered from the events of the last year and many layers of trauma in my own past. And I can’t afford therapy now. I have been offered two part time jobs and I’m going to take them. But they are just band aids and they will not be enough over time to make progress in my debt or save. I don’t know what to do, I’m in my early forties and trying not to move in with the last family member I speak to (I’m grateful she offered but it would not be healthy and I feel like it would kill me) any perspective here would be helpful.",6.825630803447317,7.372764759633029,7.370909090909091,71.63212121212123,64.70642201834863,10.642757853767028,35.41423408395886,10.504223727775694,3.8422966360856265,2314,103,408,55,33,763,255,545,0.071,0.8490000000000001,0.08,0.4904,6,0,0,0,0,1,36.0,0,4,3,8,14,17,2,1,21,0,44,7,1,2,5,87,74,45,1,9,21,0,4,2,0,5,5,1,0,4,20,31,0,4,8,6,4,6,16,6,3,5,23,5,55,11,77,39,16,74,1,0,0,1,22,29,0,15,39,303,75,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14293246585361155,0.0,0.07875800471832305,0.05707415376531014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048533699201301114,0.07483713098409235,0.054597462970055965,0.0,0.0,0.049903205430048655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08119309582925913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870123549094391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05698272877670775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062455919895786284,0.07303576517687625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07374375936656426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06981305399112145,0.3364040078042536,0.0,0.07217311508790067,0.0509863764846357,0.06852590070644217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037287611810919434,0.0,0.040560924738619365,0.0,0.05708069927720175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07324568478167459,0.07586242835202348,0.0,0.0,0.09567492679894801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14056913877496285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28329281737347023,0.0,0.07895976419820118,0.0,0.11766841238772237,0.2327026331016269,0.0,0.07556998284720129,0.0,0.0,0.15123114005424734,0.06973505364551294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820273594914525,0.06441374936723343,0.0,0.04763968743048234,0.2894298357754082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15170894198111473,0.0,0.0,0.055044548931883104,0.06892909623795948,0.0,0.06697542978253268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748902720116823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373671674807147,0.0,0.15457240118765456,0.06813025191807097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09144224306083726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2166891962611843,0.0,0.06497210142104286,0.0,0.08062720691837419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07058624854112022,0.0,0.05051569094030292,0.0,0.0,0.05966808767877741,0.0,0.0,0.08170098875501028,0.0,0.08098924921115642,0.0,0.0,0.05366097293061555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08161722943597265,0.0,0.047414716555353766,0.0,0.07012015959338072,0.0,0.20808061194341407,0.0,0.0,0.13639320850477604,0.0,0.048455197533048236,0.0,0.13943523875976174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419114627941945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19250922251801247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739716531312467,0.20783134907033124,0.0,0.0,0.15209650974512304,0.0,0.0,0.2297980516442065

-im trans gender and my family are supportive except my mom who is excedingly aginst it and i want to please everyone so its stoped me from doing anything making my selfharming worse and leaving me unable to do anything to cope other than self harm
-knew i was trans for 5 years came out 3 months ago and im now kinda back in the closet thanks to my mom

teaching,lone_ichabod,2019/02/18,"A fun idea Hi, I’m not a teacher. But I have a cool idea if I was, and maybe you could try it. Basically if I taught an English class, I would let my students turn in a short story, ten pages, double space and 14 p font, for extra credit once a semester. One story per student. It would need to have a certain level of quality, not professional writer-like, but just enough that I know they put effort into it and didn’t throw it together in one night for the grade. At the end of the year, I’d put them all together, and self publish all of the stories. I’d get each students consent for their inclusion, of course. I’d do this every year, and give the funds from the books to the school. Is this something that would be allowed? Because I’d love to see it happen. Young people have interesting ideas and I want to see them on the page.

Would love to know how teachers feel about their career choice. ,3.5347878787878777,6.415211600000003,4.9340909090909095,76.0144696969697,78.45454545454545,8.03030303030303,27.34848484848485,8.841846274778883,2.689121212121212,238,10,41,6,6,79,46,55,0.0,0.792,0.208,0.8957,1,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,0,2,3,0,0,4,0,4,1,0,1,0,8,10,3,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,3,3,8,6,0,11,0,0,0,1,2,6,0,1,5,25,6,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2524882588027094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14414044381980146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125655958303025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011931228528101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15666754547480227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13927127255100266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257287673133759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2814731837746445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5770140655469511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20177469416779692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4050124646627605,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,samb156,2019/02/18,"Would jumping into teaching post-credential be smarter than going to get a m.ed with credential Hello,
So I’m almost done with my undergrad program in California and was considering getting a credential plus masters at the same time. However, my advisor recommended that maybe teaching first before getting my masters because some districts don’t like new-bees to be on the expensive side. I just need a little help considering what to do and if I should pursue a joint program 

Just a little info I’m a history major with a precredential option, trying to get my social science single subject to teach high school in Southern California, the joint program would give me my masters in education.

I’ve toyed with the possibility of being a teacher all my life but only recently have I seriously considered perusing it. 

What would the options be for me? Would I have to get another 4 years education degree or are there other ways to do this?

I am currently taking EDD (Engineering Design and Development). I am trying to validate my chosen problem that whiteboards are expensive and the standard size does not have enough writing space to utilize. I have a google survey made that would help me a lot if you any of you have the time to answer it. With your answers and responses, I will use that information to validate wether or not my chosen problem is indeed a problem.

teaching,subter-fugue,2019/02/19,"I know we paid for the resources, but.... So, I got ripped a new one by my principal last week. The district paid for 1:1 Chromebooks for 3-6 grades last year so I was exceptionally excited to try making my classroom more digital. Apparently, one of my kids said something to his/her parent and said parent called to complain that the students were spending too much time on their computers and that I wasn't providing enough direct instruction. My direct instruction was given in small groups only to make it more differentiated and help keep distracted students on task.

&amp;#x200B;

So this parent (who has never been in the classroom and didn't speak with me explicitly regarding his/her concerns) called and spoke with my grade level dean who then got the principal involved. I had to sit through a 45 minute chew out where I was asked for explicit lesson plans and told in no uncertain terms that if I didn't follow the pacing calendar with only district-provided resources, there would be an issue with my renewal. Let me take the time to add that neither my dean or principal has ever been in my classroom either and that my eval is done by someone from the county ISC and she has rated me at skilled and been very positive about my growth and management over the course of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention that my grade uses a different reading/ela curriculum from the rest of the grades in my school and I believe that my principal is laboring under the delusion that re=teaching, scaffolding, bridging, and extension activities are included in said curriculum, which they are NOT (meaning that if I have students who don't master with the materials provided I would have to seek out additional materials anyway, but am now being told that I absolutely can NOT do that.)

&amp;#x200B;

Is it just me or is it counter-intuitive to yell at me for overusing a brand new resource that gives me a much broader range of materials that allows me to differentiate much more easily and allows me to fill in my literacy block with more content x(Chromebooks)  and then also yell at me for under-using a curriculum that has proven to be not incredibly successful or engaging with our students? Is it also problematic that even though I teach 6th grade and still found a way to do small groups, I was told that I need to revert back to using a whole-class teaching model? Am I nuts here or I am totally missing the point?",12.312378000527566,8.818849011210766,11.25701134265366,61.083306515431296,56.6457399103139,14.709364283830125,45.293590081772614,12.627914446148155,5.610352835663413,1953,85,329,47,17,628,226,446,0.059,0.906,0.035,-0.8826,7,0,1,0,0,0,53.0,2,0,2,5,19,7,0,2,24,0,40,1,0,6,5,63,66,32,0,6,14,3,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,1,25,27,1,2,4,0,3,3,10,4,0,2,26,8,45,3,54,33,13,43,0,1,0,0,30,21,0,7,17,250,70,23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21195099674697893,0.0,0.28716883853245506,0.3220504896759815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259166362204252,0.0,0.0,0.06793268607994257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09953578446130576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804224609211808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230285531024784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904087180516727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128512219316023,0.0,0.058351755924991734,0.07991409178346348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09686692218389288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0847496149061597,0.0,0.0,0.14131686947201968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05921651851413156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922103596974582,0.0,0.07852605959768666,0.0,0.0,0.04855269786150245,0.1440277013256222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033985753400718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794339550059076,0.0,0.0,0.09623478609783873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1948336130983189,0.06550750259188162,0.06813794710868212,0.17065039880782495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11973118720953073,0.1343823573259067,0.0,0.0,0.2942936169857485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08351560629505016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521120736299095,0.0,0.0,0.08941095458358407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07485535111925894,0.06801313242551013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055329759535421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06642526110753287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679957994639294,0.0,0.10303062523766247,0.0,0.0,0.25325541059249657,0.0,0.05998119251977735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10626946247801372,0.15260530378346188,0.0,0.07289477246834081,0.0,0.07012501009433607,0.07086590042633488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863524887221962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255170480096415,0.0,0.3220504896759815,0.11378396438846415

teaching,kennybanya318,2019/02/19,"Anyone else became a teacher later in life in MD? Hi all, just looking for some good hands on information. Have wanted to teach for a long time now and need a little info to get my foot in the door. I have a Bachelors Degree in English, but don’t know the next step for getting hired as a teacher in MD. 

Personally, I’ve been applying to mostly private schools because that’s where I’ve always felt more comfortable.  I’ve done some light google research into “alternative” programs on how to get teaching credentials in MD, but none of them were very clear. 

I’ve coached high school for 5 years and took 6 education credits in college so I know I’m interested in the field, just very frustrated by the process of getting more involved. If anyone could help me out and explain the process a little better or had a similar predicament, it’d be very appreciated.

teaching,intellectualth0t,2019/02/19,"aspiring teacher(s) Hello teacher Reddit, I'm back! I recently made a post asking about first year experiences, mentioning that I'm currently in college aspiring to teach elementary one day. 

I'm in my second year of undergrad still finishing a lot of core requirements, and I have quite a while to go before I even start student teaching. I don't know if it's a personal thing or if I'm just not enjoying school (after this semester, I'm transferring to a different school that has a stronger education/teacher training program) but sometimes I feel like academic life drags on and on at a painfully slow pace. I feel like everything is just going by too slow, which makes me feel like I'm too far from success and where I want to be. 

I'm in need of encouragement, and I'd appreciate any advice on college as an education major/aspiring teacher. thanks!!!",6.095727272727274,7.448429799999999,7.118977272727275,69.93011363636367,66.625,11.31818181818182,37.04545454545455,11.20814326018867,4.7446875,688,36,117,22,11,231,105,160,0.053,0.758,0.188,0.9712,2,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,4,9,8,0,0,8,0,5,2,0,2,0,21,25,10,0,4,7,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,0,1,6,4,0,1,4,0,0,2,2,1,0,3,1,3,9,7,19,23,1,26,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,4,17,69,15,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16136086793534346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1122924919365856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15437209991717546,0.0,0.0,0.12697300118769134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14051150229481876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10649369963008352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17252329082267476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10906528214781457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14840612062971048,0.16152656672327698,0.0,0.0,0.2504805653829829,0.3539017650311219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404575290922209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18769174363819213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09074986017746144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11663457113009401,0.2420191458116651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14038565734949462,0.0,0.15624781326977144,0.11022401557442962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12244009010056668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118947965480794,0.0,0.17570750494529255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14418312997867322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15814668188628822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756336247014496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630436731094522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33423607684743084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16331550810215345,0.0,0.1168782291672699,0.0,0.13187118685147134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520273917084079,0.0,0.0,0.10970350012646098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739659010434712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.212673637377374
teaching,Death_trail,2019/02/19,"Having to plan a class/course Hello everybody. Recently I have been hit up by a vintage store in my city that wants to do an english course (the language, not literature). They have been doing knitting and design courses. 

So I went to talk with the dude running the store today and he told me that I have to present a schedule, a plan and an outline of subjects to be talked about in class each day. When I get that, I will show it to him to determine price and how many people there are going to be per class. However, I have no experience doing this. My idea is looking at pensums of other english courses to guide myself from.

Any advices on doing this? Planning classes ahead? My idea is doing a beginner class and a conversational english class.",5.218741258741262,6.471916223776226,5.830356643356647,78.73168881118883,68.58041958041957,7.957762237762238,32.481818181818184,8.238735603445708,2.5327432167832167,592,26,106,8,10,192,91,143,0.019,0.981,0.0,-0.3736,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,4,5,0,0,0,11,0,18,0,0,1,0,12,25,8,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,2,1,3,3,2,0,0,0,4,1,13,0,21,17,1,16,0,0,1,0,8,5,0,0,8,82,20,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23510858984561303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16361420068736393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1551651516742192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23535001894096094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257019947455549,0.0,0.1367368115239735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5432094225431522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20204087207537316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24392758029352374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16679965588765255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375604975264031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38676548688205015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2280578101613823,0.2299007303784465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14191033580942114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22303581616719487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Tilted_Axis,2019/02/20,"The last straw? Working for free or else? May lose job if I don’t train for free in summer. Just had a meeting with principal and vice principal.  They wanted to know why I didn’t sign up for two, 4 day long trainings unpaid.  I told them I signed up for 1 training because it’s paid.  I didn’t sign up for the other 2 because they are unpaid.  This is for training during the summer.  

I said I can make more money due to my other skills at a summer job.  They tried everything.  They said it’s district culture to live and breathe teaching so much that most don’t mind working for free.  That if I care about the students I will do it.  That I need to dedicate myself to teaching more.  They wanted to know if I plan on working summers in the future.  That they do not have 2nd jobs or hobbies so I shouldn’t either.  

I left the meeting not knowing if I will have a job in August.  

If I do not work, and instead train for free, I will be in financial distress and hate myself and my school district and principal.  If I don’t work for free I may lose my job and be forced to find another, possibly leaving teaching.  Every job I’ve ever had just want me to work for free.

This is my first year.  The trainings are for AVID teaching and PBL training.  My principal said if I can find a way to learn the material, then that is ok.  But when I offered to study it myself at home, I was shot down.

teaching,passionflower432,2019/02/20,"edTPA video help Please I’m desperate for someone to help me.

My UBTE, SBTE and college education program have refused to give me advice on this issue and I’m really freaking out because I don’t want to fail the edTPA over a technicality. If ANYONE can offer any guidance please please do so.

I am seeking my certification in Social Studies 7-12. The edTPA Instruction task (video clips) requires that a minimum of four students be in the classroom and visible in the video. However, in the class I have selected to use for my edTPA, I have a total of 4 students in the class. In the clips that I would really like to use, two students are visible throughout the whole clip, one makes a couple appearances, and the other is completely out of frame. 

I have made multiple attempts to encourage these students to sit in view of the camera for my filming purposes, but it has never worked. They are special education students (I am not seeking a special ed certification) and will not cooperate.

You can still hear all four students in the clips and they are great examples of my teaching, positive classroom environment, as well as the students analyzing and completing work. I am wondering, however, if I am unable to use them because of this requirement from edTPA. My cooperating teacher has already offered to vouch that there were four students present and participating during the period.

Is this ok? Can I submit the clips with only two students consistently visible because they are part of a group of 4 which does meet the requirement?

#TL;DR: The edTPA requires that in my video clips the students are “heard and seen” and that there are a minimum of 4 students in the class. 
In my clips, 2 students are clearly seen, but all 4 are heard.

teaching,seximusicman,2019/02/21,"Certification Help Hello all,

I'm looking for some help with my teaching certification. I feel like I don't fully understand how it works or how to get it. I graduated with a bachelor's in music education and I am trying to get certified in Florida. I began the application process online back in May 2018 when I graduated. I filled everything out, paid the fee, passed the tests, etc. Shortly after graduation, I went on a series of trips over the summer, and didn't get back to my parent's place (my permanent address that mail goes to) until August. A piece of unopened mail was there and it essentially just said that my application was incomplete until I physically sent my college transcripts to Tallahassee through the mail. I got a position at a private school, and so I put off doing this. But then I got a dream to teach abroad at an international school. To do this, I would need to be certified. So, I sent the transcripts in, and online, the Florida Department of Education indicates that they received the transcripts and even scanned them and put them on my application. Now, I've just been waiting for 3+ months with very little communication. I've tried calling and emailing, but the call and ensuing options are 100% automated and doesn't tell me anything I don't know. I emailed back in October and got an email reply 3 months later with this text:    
Your file has been routed to our evaluations unit for review.  You will be advised in writing, that you will receive by email, of any change in your certification status.  Please allow more time for the results of this review. There is no processing completion date available at this time. 

It's been three weeks since that email, and I need to be applying for positions abroad but all the recruiting services require proof of certification to even talk to schools, let alone apply for positions.

teaching,mossy-pants,2019/02/21,"Is it normal to struggle so much as a student teacher? I have been student teaching for about a month and a half now. This week is my first week with taking over every class.

Lately I have been struggling a lot. People said student teaching would be hard, but I didn't expect for it to be as emotionally taxing as it is. Every day I come home and I just feel like garbage. I am overwhelmed by how difficult everything is. I am trying my absolute hardest, and yet every day I learn something new by failing. 

I have always been a good student, so it is difficult for me to be putting so much of myself into this process, and trying so hard and still feel like I am not doing a good job. I know that I am getting better and improving, but as soon as I leave school I just think of all the things that didn't go perfect that day and it just consumes me. My cooperating teacher (who is wonderful) assures me that I'm not failing, I'm fine, and I am improving. I'm just struggling so much. Today I found out one of my students is skipping advisory because she hates me because she thinks I'm ""fake"" (I'm just really nice and also very nervous which she reads as fake I guess). Just hearing this made me cry 3 times today and was the breaking point for me. I just feel like I can't find a balance with so many things. I can't stop focusing on all the ways that I am not perfect yet, and I feel like I am not doing a good job.

Is it normal for student teaching to be this difficult? I really think that I want to continue teaching and I don't think I want to give up. I really enjoy teaching when I am there. It's when I leave and reflect that all the exhaustion and self doubt and disappointment in myself consumes me. I guess I just want to know if it is normal to feel this way.",3.5473808010171624,4.546535000000002,4.905688705234162,84.75825333757153,72.27823691460054,7.568086458995551,28.562089425725787,7.882392219407189,1.7362011866920959,1387,53,286,18,26,463,151,363,0.171,0.685,0.14400000000000002,-0.873,2,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,6,25,30,1,6,12,0,36,1,0,2,6,72,68,34,0,9,15,0,7,4,0,1,1,2,1,1,24,20,0,1,16,1,1,3,9,16,0,3,9,9,48,14,33,54,7,34,0,4,0,0,8,7,0,6,25,209,72,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06901570192403872,0.07181020217296555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10521783248564794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632713195763179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07434155683198815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09479872712979344,0.16697300858947636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970781674107776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21813954644629707,0.0,0.07756269945455516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21818449636231885,0.24661674887866386,0.0,0.0,0.07887849159900431,0.0734084623254303,0.0,0.09462572099705722,0.0,0.0,0.04508924850263519,0.08278877075803075,0.04904743227617279,0.21715814367303912,0.0,0.0,0.19014283085336933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546193342247698,0.08520538710634576,0.0,0.0,0.09726865964614616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656797236755581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17128289559460905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948586769955389,0.0,0.09735244848714243,0.1827627767214368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1686512495952525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07337089941120074,0.0,0.08166106714232478,0.0,0.08749671241704876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06888545669025138,0.0,0.1903257654753453,0.0,0.0,0.0833510380094996,0.0,0.0,0.2536729961775845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05848048879898956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05983096091431244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08158331329215665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08675737656998363,0.0,0.0,0.08632538419612022,0.0,0.1658618702338446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08209299315475453,0.0,0.0,0.08734226144240614,0.0,0.0,0.09003183868911095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06643951875351706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06892091235237424,0.07215236112916078,0.0,0.2706648586817758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488838587010715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11467046740817492,0.22119542348353954,0.0,0.0,0.05032340750634764,0.0,0.1636084661368828,0.0,0.0,0.11718682622479355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.071208212733739,0.1527095192726765,0.13700506820079078,0.13845256504005327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09359086974781948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06130648573094395,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,skoltn44,2019/02/21,"Question about snow days. My district has 13 built in snow days. However, we have not used any, and will likely not use any the rest of the year. This means we are technically working 13 days for free. Can someone explain how this is legal? And why they do not have to compensate us for those 13 extra days?

I’m genuinely curious. Thank you for the responses.

teaching,Kuugjuaq,2019/02/21,"New “Teacher” on sub list. Burnout already happening. Graduated from my B.Ed program (Sr. Years), moved home to my smaller northern Canada town. Been on the sub list for about  4 months now, called in very regularly. Most of the time I’m with the K-Gr7’s, sometimes as an EA. 

Burn out is happening at an alarming rate. Maybe it’s just the whole “sub” thing, as I obviously haven’t been able to establish my own classroom and enforce my own rules, but these kids are draining my motivation so fast. 

Everything is a hassle, keeping them on task takes up 80% of the time in class and just getting them to do any work literally requires me to sit down with them for the whole class, even then I’m lucky to get anything out of it. Admin is aware of how these kids are and recommend sending them to the office, but honestly they’d be there for the majority of the week. 

I want to further elaborate, but it’s difficult even finding the energy to keep this rant going. Maybe I just want to hear it gets better, or that this is expected for new “teachers”. My university didn’t teach me one thing about behaviour issues and my (high school) practicums went absurdly well. 

Just want to hear other teachers/subs initial experiences or advice. I’m pretty vague about specifics, but I feel just overwhelmed.

Dear Teachers,

You are invited to participate in a research study for U.S. K-12 teachers entitled Teachers' Use of Non-Academic Data for Decision-Making Purposes, being conducted by Todd Reeves, a faculty member, and Kayla Scheel, an undergraduate student, at Northern Illinois University. The purpose of the study is to examine access to, and analysis, interpretation, and use of non-academic data among U.S. K-12 in-service teachers.

The study will involve completion of an online survey about your access to, and analysis, interpretation, and use of non-academic data in the school context in which you work, your beliefs about data-driven decision making, and your professional and demographic characteristics.

The online survey should take about 20 minutes to complete, and any information you provide will not be shared with the school or district in which you work. If you choose to participate in the study, you will be able to enter into a drawing for 1 of 3 Amazon Echo Dots.

The survey and more information about the study can be accessed by pasting the following address into your Internet browser: [https://niu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_2fM2h5KTGKNM8fz](https://niu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2fM2h5KTGKNM8fz) The survey is best completed on a personal computer (e.g., laptop, desktop), rather than a cell phone/mobile device.

We would be grateful if you would participate in our study. Thank you in advance for your consideration. We would also appreciate it very much if you would disseminate information about the study to other U.S. K-12 classroom teachers you know.

teaching,sportscoat400,2019/02/22,"“Compliments” from male students Asking for some help to mentally process a recent situation, and for suggestions on how to handle any similar problems that might occur again.  

Some context: I’m 27 and teach high schoolers. My youth helps and hurts me: I can connect with students well and have a great rapport with a lot of them, but sometimes they don’t take me seriously. They’re comfortable saying things to me I’m certain they would not share with older teachers. Some things I let slide because I don’t believe in scolding teens for every stupid thing they say. The stupidity is constant, as we know, so I pick my battles.   

Anyway, one thing I’m not really okay with is compliments from male students about my looks. Sometimes I just kind of ignore it, don’t pay it much attention...say thanks and move on. But it happened recently, and it was from a kid who, aside from that “nice compliment” (another rant about how women don’t exist for your visual pleasure so please stop acting like you’re a gentleman and deserve respect and gratitude because you tell her she’s pretty can be saved for later) shows little other respect. He’s disruptive and off task often. He gives me shit all the time. He’s constantly handsy with every girl. He’s said something along the lines of “if my girlfriend isn’t having sex with me then she has to let me cheat on her” during a class debate about relationships. 
The compliment, coming from him, was just...so many things: Inappropriate, manipulative, icky. I told him to please not say things like that to me, that I care more about being a good teacher. He didn’t like that shut down but I kind of just ignored his complaints. Minutes later, he was still being disruptive and rude as other students were trying to present a project. THEN I sent him out. The next day, the story had spread (a middle schooler asked me about it when I was subbing..?) that I kicked a kid out for calling me beautiful. The situation was reduced and twisted down to that.   

I tried to talk to the kid after school about it, but found myself stumbling awkwardly through a reasoning. It’s possible it landed on deaf ears anyway, but I want to make sure that, should I need to have the conversation again, I do it right so that maybe, just maybe, it’s a learning experience. 

I also find myself feeling...guilty. Was I a bitch? I feel like  I have to explain myself with a tone of uncertainty and guilt, when it really should be simple. I’m a teacher. You are a student. That’s not appropriate. But then again, should I be more understanding because he is a kid after all? I don’t know.  Plz help.

teaching,FormerGap,2019/02/22,"I sharted in class and it smelled; please help? So one day I was teaching my kindergarten class because that's the only subject I'm smart enough to teach, and boy did that trashy Mexican food for lunch hurt my stomach! I think they cooked it using the asphalt and sunlight on the ground, and you could her the cow moo when I bit into the carnitas.

Anyway, my stomach really hurt and I was gonna ask my para to take over the class but she's only seven and immature. So I just stayed and sadly shart in my pants. I was wearing a thong and it even stained my white jeans.

My students laughed and said it smelled like something died! HELP!

teaching,bohemianfling,2019/02/22,"Need Classroom Management Help Hey all! I've been a part time sub in Northern CA since the beginning of the school year. I was pre-credential in my BA (Social Science) but have never had any sort of classroom management training/school and I'm looking for some feedback/advice. 

I took a 7 day sub job for a classroom of 4th graders and it's much more brutal than I was expecting.  They have already had at least 3 subs in the past 2 weeks (the teacher is out with shoulder surgery) and they are borderline out of control.  I have one kid on the Autism spectrum who just kindof wanders in and out of class and 3 who won't stay in their seats to save their (or my) life. I'm trying to focus on rewarding the good students without bringing too much attention to the negative but it's hard when it's just constant disruption.  I'm not expecting to change their lives in 7 days but if anyone has some ideas on how to keep general order it would be greatly appreciated!",4.92843711843712,5.994599312169317,5.376296296296296,82.41179487179487,69.1058201058201,8.566707366707366,32.52787952787953,8.841846274778883,2.6593757427757434,766,34,148,13,13,245,123,189,0.083,0.813,0.104,0.6229,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,5,2,5,5,1,0,10,0,14,2,1,2,2,35,23,12,0,5,9,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,6,9,0,2,2,0,0,2,5,1,0,1,6,2,11,4,28,14,8,27,0,0,1,0,11,13,0,6,10,96,17,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16790912744645586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18961736800149948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11684948513920584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12014670130771493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18177210052579926,0.0,0.0,0.1856859036094514,0.19272062474293436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2216307387562792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14412185602862534,0.0,0.18944187300333065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15392486587978793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11517323139556375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19397381486530946,0.0,0.0,0.17051358333735686,0.15272934410130667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213677722432238,0.0,0.0,0.15172798997831072,0.0,0.14429292677470382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526278969456964,0.12740888764610145,0.1325249735391679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643565069143685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860738599441437,0.16403004489749598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3477998646305387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14213856978995235,0.0,0.0,0.17515783599800366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831466521667265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001947627037133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1909081337072728,0.11666048492556312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378307092793624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16563684406057155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1220622587855504,0.0,0.0,0.1106521219791889
teaching,plzhalp360,2019/02/22,"I had diarrhea in the teacher's bathroom and it smelled; please help? So last night I went to this hole in the wall Chinese place because I'm poor as a teacher and they're the only place that sells food under a dollar. But man when I opened the food--did it look shady! There were like legit worms and shit crawling across, like, 50-year old pieces of lettuce!

But I ate it anyway because I'm a teacher and like I gotta survive to ""do it for the kids.""

The next day, I had horrible stomach problems and decided to go to school anyway because I needed the money and had used all of my sick days on weed and hangovers.

Not surprisingly, I had to go to the bathroom 38 times that day. And one of those times, my crush was in the bathroom! We have a gender inclusive bathroom btw. And another time, all the petty female teachers were there and they laughed!

And of course when it was all said and done, it smelled like hell! I can't even afford to see a doctor because I'm too poor and only make 9k/year as a teacher! 

Please help goddamn I am so embarrassed :'(",3.9878930817610048,5.014987160377358,4.50501886792453,87.93683647798744,71.26415094339623,6.9740880503144655,29.227672955974842,7.03164865440522,1.462574465408805,826,32,170,7,15,262,118,212,0.174,0.726,0.101,-0.9567,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,1,0,1,1,10,10,2,1,16,0,13,6,2,2,3,26,27,21,0,2,3,0,0,4,0,1,2,1,0,2,10,15,2,0,1,0,5,3,2,4,0,1,12,5,14,6,20,14,4,25,1,0,2,0,7,10,2,0,16,104,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14220758788943474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3306865708382373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2623877071433167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13881105283512699,0.0,0.1387845827183098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0895745927102083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279803170010454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15414998393965804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18180414431532274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105469962361888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26502495859646713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11388519608749552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052625278667588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055923375593846,0.0,0.0,0.1442315758202775,0.12726856564366054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14230856794107705,0.0,0.09189845411669964,0.2062876212393513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2833844685336573,0.2977362848125576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297683751481869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12900403740922725,0.0,0.0,0.13725293632895266,0.10807020796794614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13921021213977772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23724032326135264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11713064769972595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571950119706338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1746674475426416

teaching,newteach589,2019/02/22,"NYCDOE Pension ... Pension Crisis? Hello all,

I'm trying to understand the likelihood that NYCTRS pensions will still be around in 27ish years, when I would hypothetically retire. I am part of tier 4 and while I understand that pension reform in the form of tier 6 makes pension liabilities more manageable, the current status of the pension is still being informed by very lofty and unrealistic investment return assumptions. So, what do we all think? Are the benefits and pensions promised to NYC teachers sustainable? \*\*I understand that the benefits are guaranteed within the constitution, but it is my understanding that in extreme cases such as city bankruptcy, all bets are off the table.

teaching,a800759,2019/02/23,"Student teacher.. feeling doubtful. Since I was 5, I always knew I wanted to be a teacher one day. I’m 22 now and almost half way through teacher’s college. I’ve been tutoring for the past 5 years and lately it’s starting to hit me how much doubt I have in myself. I lack the creativity to form lesson plans and resources. It doesn’t help that my program is extremely underwhelming - the stuff we’re learning doesn’t even apply to our placements. 

I’m considering dropping out but I know this is something I’ve wanted and worked so hard for since I was 5. That’s 17 years!! Has anyone ever felt this way before? Words of advice and encouragement would be nice.

Are teaching jobs hard to find in Florida? NJ is certainly very competitive in terms of finding a job.  Do you think applying to these teaching jobs with a current NJ address would hinder my chances?

teaching,Princeofcatpoop,2019/02/23,"Colleague takes my supplies I comment regularly but rarely post. I just want to vent about another teacher being inconsiderate. I am in a temporary classroom because a storm damaged my classroom. I teach computers. Been like this for six weeks. Yesterday, I arrive to my third period class to find that the chromebooks have been removed from my classroom. Another teacher 'checked them out'. We use Outlook Calendar to reserve the carts, and since I hadn't reserved the one for my temporary classroom he just took it, not even a courtesy email.

&amp;#x200B;

I clarified with him in email that he knew it was my classroom and he knew my subject matter was computers. My only conclusion is that he didn't want to go to any extra effort to look out for a fellow teacher. I literally lost my entire classroom and am teaching a modified curriculum. Then he comes into my classroom and takes supplies he knows I need. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't think of how to express this feeling to him without coming off as whiny, passive-aggressive or confrontational. I don't want to say what he did was right, even if he did follow procedures, because we teach our students to be kind, not just correct.",5.753297431648715,7.95203771830986,5.91618889809445,74.96271748135875,68.53051643192488,8.579839823253245,36.942557304612,9.168548406835145,3.8095420602043646,946,52,150,19,17,300,125,213,0.098,0.85,0.052000000000000005,-0.8306,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,3,0,1,3,7,5,1,0,8,0,17,0,0,2,1,36,36,10,0,5,9,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,8,12,0,0,7,0,1,6,7,3,0,3,13,3,27,2,26,21,1,18,0,2,1,0,20,7,0,2,5,106,35,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3180908701924253,0.35672854001306264,0.09982131192495464,0.30784138520113064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17896199061016824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.252890839535709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19390503072295112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422074921492741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13416216186368168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342336947169668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15285778490545546,0.08067120021734059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0717135171706176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232654917989846,0.0,0.16023714550286006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108841920018574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994677845007916,0.11163937876778736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14058294539747798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12535670044868338,0.0,0.11673222185053247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12142508368493615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2207335853336283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09405623639384747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16308758520503433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267782590666814,0.0,0.0,0.2597392372427728,0.0,0.11774499654339242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14149901522918906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35672854001306264,0.0

teaching,kateinglasses,2019/02/24,"Masters Hi everyone, 

I've been on and off for years about whether or not to get my masters, so I could really use an outsider's perspective. I'm currently in my fourth year of teaching and making about 54,000. A master's degree would bump me up to about 10k more a year, but cost me 24k (and my district barely gives us any money to reimburse it). 

While I love learning and school, the price tag on graduate school is daunting. I'm not living at home, so grad school + rent every month seems unimaginable, but I guess I could make do with a payment plan or maybe even a loan (ugh). 

**What do you think, reddit? Is 24k worth the pay bump?** 

If yes, would you say do an accelerated option and get it done in one year OR spread it out? 

Also, do think teachers/admin looks down on teachers who don't have their MA? That is my other fear...that if I don't get it I will seem less qualified.

teaching,zayshlyyj,2019/02/24,"Edtpa help 😫🤭 Hello, I am currently completely my edtpa in a 3rd grade classroom for math. 

This classroom does not have a math curriculum so I had to make up my whole learning segment. I was wondering if my lessons build on each other and are effective enough for the edtpa. 

I am teaching them fractions for the first time and they do a lot of activities to practice representing a fraction verse me standing in the front and teaching. But a lot of my activities are guided by me and then the student go on and finish them with a partner. 

I just need some tips that will help me with my 4 lessons. I’m worried they’re not good enough. 

Also, my language function is “represent”, is this language function good for the edtpa?

Since we are in the midst of taking exams for NYCTF, I need any advice from current and former fellows, in regards to the multi-subject CST exams. I was selected for Special Education-Social Studies, and I am conflicted as to whether or not it would be feasible to take this exam in one sitting or as separate exams?

teaching,sassmastermcgee,2019/02/25,"Praxis/licensing questions? It's my first time posting here and not sure if this is the right place or not but let's see.

I recently just graduated with my English teaching license in Utah. I've been looking at moving to Montana (where my boyfriend is from) and started the process of applying for a license there when the issue of the praxis II test came up. My school required me to take the English content and analysis (code 5039) but Montana requires the content knowledge test (5038) and won't accept the 5039.

My question is, am I really limited to teaching in states that accept the 5039 test? Are they really that different? I was always told they were practically the same but the content and analysis had, well, analysis in it. I really don't want to have to pay for another praxis test, let alone take one, but is that my only option here? 

Thanks for any guidance and advice anyone can give!",6.290220548682086,7.288857473372783,6.530812264658419,75.60422270037655,65.98224852071006,9.459064012910169,34.89026358257128,9.573946990214177,3.449421301775148,719,33,123,14,11,231,103,169,0.098,0.8640000000000001,0.038,-0.8139,1,1,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,2,4,7,5,0,0,11,0,16,0,0,0,1,29,26,13,0,2,9,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,3,5,0,1,2,4,0,1,2,6,2,13,5,17,17,1,17,0,0,2,0,6,8,0,5,5,87,19,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862156222190754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1681191633644841,0.0,0.0,0.13506693602437062,0.0,0.0,0.11038618423835796,0.1702113266581312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11350102133855686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1856559134428165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16959448880085698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13807308410961475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15571639217193195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16942454014526387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3319754715133104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13631164553501432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17252518863928615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10999524023427283,0.1234550497811683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16959448880085698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554619410640858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36368104069080426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119675747715833,0.0,0.16027579964048172,0.0,0.0,0.13862418319691205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642809974277801,0.1293515609360173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148940727541893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15298886186207047,0.0,0.2440955518251397,0.0,0.0,0.1494465336104429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465268522453862,0.0,0.0,0.15510795684893267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574315926231106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14594916421761014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,LyricalWillow,2019/02/25,"My administrator is a passive aggressive nightmare. I had to be out of school today since I was running a fever and generally not feeling good.  Plus I didn’t want to spread my cootie germs with my first grade kiddos.  So I put in for a sub.  
Hen 
On my desk is a large sub binder with “generic plans.”  I update this folder every week so students have timely practice materials (this will be important later). Unless I know in advance, in which case I will make the plans far more focused on the skills we are mastering.  With me so far?  

So my generic plans are all review of things we’ve already worked on, but practice makes perfect.  Besides, I am uncomfortable with a substitute introducing new material (this is not a slur on substitutes, mind you.  I also included center activities, challenging puzzles, etc.  have I also mentioned there is a lot of writing and cross-disciplinary assignments?

Anyway, I emailed my principal to let her know I would be there today.  An hour later she sent a passive aggressive email TO THE ENTIRE SCHOOL about the “importance of detailed sub plans, how are kids miss out on important instruction.  And I completely agree with her.  

My problem is calling this out to the entire school when I was the only absent teacher today, so of course everyone knows who the post was meant for.  

I am, quite honest, shocked and rather livid about the whole thing.  If a student does something I disagree with, I certainly don’t share that story with everyone in the classroom.  Instead I take the student to the side and speak with him/her so as not to humiliate her in front of her friends do l.  

This is not the first time she’s done this (first time with me as the target) and it absolutely effects morale around the school.  And I don’t appreciate administration tearing down teachers when in fact we should be celebrating success (we do not do this at all). 

I have a medical condition the compromises my immune system and basically lets every illness track me down.  My doctor has provided note to the teacher of this fact.  

Oh, and just add....I have always shown green EVASS scores and this past year was in the blue,  this is not a humble brag, just acknowledgement that I do know what I’m doing and my students always grow.  

Thanks for listening, my friends. Sometimes you got to vent to keep you sanity in this profession.

teaching,baconeggandcheesus,2019/02/26,"First Year and Already Burnt Out First year high school English teacher in a well-paying, “high performing” public school district. I feel guilty saying that I hate it. I knew it would be demanding, and I’ve always had the work ethic and drive and personality for this type of job, yet I think I’ve reached the tipping point. 

I teach English 1 (9th grade), and my classes are all made up of 70-80% boys. Now, I feel like I compete with so many outside factors—cell phones, Chromebooks, standards-based lessons, kids roaming the halls, bathrooms, etc.— that the energy and desire to teach just is not there. We teach 70 minutes blocks and I pour hours into planning and dividing the time so methodically, only to have it blow up in my face nearly every time as a handful of kids speed through everything on purpose, a handful do absolutely nothing, a group watches YouTube clips every time I’m helping other students, and a minority engages, learns, and benefits from the lesson. 

My school has no phone policy. It’s on a teacher by teacher basis. I tell them to put them away at the beginning and remind them as often as I can during the block. I tell them that I will not reexplain or repeat something if they cannot get off of their phones. I have had several kids put their phone in the “phone box,” only to find that they fall asleep at their desks in response. I have written kids up for overuse and defiance with the phones. They get a talking to and that seems to be it. It does not change. 

Beyond just the phones, it’s dealing with disruptive behaviors and a general level of disrespect that also sucks the life out of me. I do have well-raised, polite kids in every class who want to be there and who want to learn. Sadly, they are the minority. The others seem to not be able to get out of their own way. 

I have had zero issues with parent complaints, low observation scores, etc. I’m proud to say I have a productive relationship with my bosses and veteran colleagues in the department. Everyone looks out for me because I’m “the baby.” I hide the fact that I hate it though. It has taken over my life— I hardly see my friends anymore, it’s negatively impacted my relationship, and I generally just never want to go anywhere or talk to anyone on the weekends. 

Help. I know it’s only year one, and everyone says it will get better, but how do you manage and carry on with such a plethora of dependent variables that are beyond your control?

I am currently in the middle of applying to be a teacher. I have graduated uni in the past 5 years so one of my two references are one of my lectures.

I am currently working in a job for a large company, the only reference they provide is an impersonal one through HR. It's literally just to clarify I work there and has nothing about my personality.

What can I do since the other reference should be from my job?

Any help is appreciated.

teaching,RSTLNE3MCAAV,2019/02/26,"Does punishing the class for the misbehavior of one or a few students accomplish a positive? So, I'm in a teaching credential program and I have been studying the merits of various behavior/ attitude readjustments and the application of discipline when necessary. The general trend in education seems to be moving away from older notions of punishment-reward based on an almighty code of rules, but there will never come a day when the need to issue punishments for misbehavior ever completely goes away.

The theory behind class punishments is to create a sense of solidarity in the room, one class, one outcome. Misbehavior results in a collective punishment (late for recess, no candy at end of day, etc). This way rule breakers can feel a sense of social isolation as their peers become angry at them for bringing the whole class down for their solitary misdeeds.

On the other hand punishing a whole class for the actions of a few can also create an ""us vs them"" attitude between the students and their teachers. Individual desire to behave can vanish if they can be punished for something someone else does, and that sense of solidarity can backfire as students begin to view themselves as a separate entity in opposition to the teacher. These are conclusions of reached through research and my own memories of K-12 education.

I'm not asking for homework help, but I am going to be starting a class next semester that deals with discipline and I'd like some insights in what actual, practicing teachers have on the merits (or lack thereof) of classroom wide punishments.

teaching,Blabarssylt,2019/02/26,"Teaching my aunt's ""kid"" English and need advice Hi, I don't really know if this is the sub I'm supposed to go to for this but I need advice. I also didn't find rules for the sub so I'm sorry if this breaks one.

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt has taken in a refugee and he speaks our language pretty well (Swedish) but he needs to learn English as well. The problem is mainly that he doesn't learn anything in school since he's in a class where they learn more ""advanced"" English, and this is a problem since he doesn't know any of the basics. 

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt has asked me to tutor him onece a week and I'm more than happy to help since he's family by now, but I don't really know how to go about it. I would be really grateful for some tips.

&amp;#x200B;

This might be information that you find necessary? I don't know.

He's 20 and I'm soon to be 18 (in March too be exact), he has been living with my aunt for a year soon (maybe more idk) and he knows Swedish well, he has some problem with ""odd"" words, words that isn't usually used but he understands if you explain it and put it in a context that he understand.

teaching,spicybuttcheeks,2019/02/26,"Need help with a university assignment. Currently studying Primary School Еducation.  First of all, I'd like to apologize for any mistakes I might make, I'm not a native English speaker.

For my assignment I have to present a math lesson with a colleague of mine to 2nd grade children. The topic is Associative Property of Multiplication. We are required to come up with at least one creative and fun game-like exercise the kids have to solve. For example other two colleagues of mine, who presented last time, used an exercise where children take out math problems, written on small papers, from a big colorful hat and solve them afterwards. I'm just looking for any other ideas, similar to the one I mentioned, or practices you've used before and children have enjoyed.

teaching,failededucator,2019/02/27,"Failed in This Profession and Burnout - Time to Get Out I have failed as a teacher. 

&amp;#x200B;

From the first day I walked into my classroom 11 years ago I knew this was not the career for me. I felt overwhelmed and not fully prepared to deal with the responsibility of educating young children.  I have ""winged"" every single lesson and have made shit up for 11 years. I'm a fraud. But I truly loved talking and building meaningful relationships with young children - that was the best part about the job. 11 years later I am ready to shift careers and going after what I always dreamed about as a young kid growing up. I don't know how I managed to stick it out for this long.

&amp;#x200B;

My hats off to the educators who have done this for many years and still feel the same passion, drive and excitement for teaching. I know if I had that I'd be a great educator...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone getting into this job, make sure it's what you really want. Burnout is real. With mounting pressures in the classroom from parents, districts and administration the job can take its toll.  Take care of yourself first and foremost. Be kind to yourself and your mental health. It's real and the burnout hit me so hard that I needed time off. Find great mentors who are young at heart. Use them to your advantage. Find time to really talk to your students. Put aside the expectations of ""curriculum"" and ""checklists"". Find out who your kids really are....

&amp;#x200B;

I will go on as a substitute teacher as I enjoy being around kids and they keep me grounded. But the days of dealing with the other crap are no more...

&amp;#x200B;

That's my rant folks. Take care.

I had my first ever interview at the beginning of February but didn’t get the job. I think it was because I did not interview well. I’ve been out of my credential program for almost a year. Do you guys have any tips to impress the faculty at my interview? 
p.s. when I get really nervous, I get short of breathe and have a hard time talking. I’m also 24 so I get that I look really young.

So, I was in gym this morning playing a random game i don't care about and there is a student who has taken a few more seconds to get in line, compared to the other ones. I'm across from my friend, as we are about to throw a ball back and forth, when my teacher leans to her, loud enough for me to hear and say: ""If he was my kid, I'd be a child abuser."" yes   word. for. word.  Now normally i wouldn't be to upset about this, a little disturbed, yes. But, coming from a home where i am abused i was very disgusted with this comment. I didn't say anything to him, as he quickly moved on. But should i bring this up somewhere, i really don't think it's even worth it,  but would you be ok hearing or saying this?",0.9247843137254892,2.702968733333336,2.568300653594772,95.50794117647058,81.1111111111111,5.34640522875817,21.699346405228766,6.2272716619740125,0.13079738562091506,652,20,151,5,17,214,113,180,0.08800000000000001,0.789,0.123,0.6339,0,0,1,0,2,0,29.0,1,1,0,0,12,7,1,2,12,3,20,0,0,0,0,24,29,13,0,6,8,0,0,0,1,4,0,7,1,2,10,6,0,0,2,4,1,4,5,3,0,2,6,7,19,4,23,16,3,18,0,0,0,0,20,8,0,4,6,108,29,3,0.0,0.37718028204761705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13098315245972536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12239172246007785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622841810577793,0.0,0.0,0.13711065660775987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644649135035204,0.0,0.1051301270175806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297416373079087,0.0,0.08315963145779375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3587917810648074,0.0,0.0,0.16817159319098368,0.1596602497758125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15952991750105244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691722678295367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15595257238681012,0.0,0.0,0.16702189059052694,0.0,0.10785755046929607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1716119251385815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1783065617998096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196822568275014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5063127352368716,0.0,0.16108829739790995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12253665956425837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198955686723588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13133172373364854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11306963253246127,0.0,0.0,0.10250010851515598

I have been subbing one day jobs in a few districts for about a year but I want to start getting longer sub jobs so I can work on being in the same classroom on my own for a few months at a time.

teaching,tremulouscadence,2019/02/27,"Slurs and racial slurs in creative writing I teach in Australia. My year 12 students are currently doing an assessment where they find a poem they like and write a short story inspired by the message/themes of the poem. One of my students (he's white fyi) has selected a poem that focuses on race, specifically the civil rights movement. He is asking if he can use the n-word in his writing or if that's inappropriate. How do you deal with this kind of language in your classroom when you encounter it in either reading or writing? Would you guys find something like this an issue?

&amp;#x200B;

I of course have no problem with students using curse words or language deemed inappropriate in daily life, but I take issue with the use of the n-word in his writing - not sure how to articulate my reasons to this student though. How would you go about it? The fact that he's white is a factor of course, but also I guess his lack of experience about this era in America. I teach in a city where most of the kids are white, and conversations like this aren't had so often.",8.371911764705883,7.219395504901961,8.041490196078431,73.74370588235297,62.08823529411765,10.316862745098039,36.576470588235296,9.120678840339163,3.176762352941177,849,33,156,11,10,271,115,204,0.058,0.888,0.054000000000000006,-0.2103,1,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,0,5,2,0,12,7,0,0,15,0,13,1,0,7,2,40,20,17,0,6,9,0,0,3,0,2,1,0,0,2,10,6,0,0,4,1,0,2,3,1,0,1,1,3,18,6,26,17,3,20,0,0,3,0,24,14,0,8,7,108,28,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12985223402318918,0.0,0.1759346065722868,0.19730492516914427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517998810708615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16740279100463729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15883513686432635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.296817914328638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228216879069033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17887575349866508,0.1607780231456897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33895725117322323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16908988448856746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11469115232479475,0.2379865116221997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11003035404428596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1553721485148689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16242019827769,0.0,0.0,0.16694983587869153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13866843623205824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500517559127802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15303770053743596,0.0,0.12208673725677704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15953384803047674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42072285414522775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2306948682789833,0.0,0.19730492516914427,0.10456498576528396

Only the proctor or teacher has access to technology and internet. Care to share ideas? It’s a public school set up in the Philippines so some of the students arent really well off to have their own laptops or tablets. 

Would be of great help if you could share what you have done or have examples of technology for instructional materials. Thank you for this awesome group!

teaching,harmony_hall,2019/02/28,"Almost done my teaching degree, I don't think this is for me, and I'm really gutted about it. I'm on mobile so sorry about formatting, also I'm pretty new to Reddit and I posted this in another teaching sub as well and hope that's ok.

Hi everyone, I'm really struggling right now and I was hoping to maybe gain some insights from people who have maybe been in my position.

Okay, so I'm a teacher candidate and where I am right now (Ontario) the program is a two year program that I am doing as a masters (so it's half teacher qualifications half research). Anyway, I started having doubts about teaching halfway through the program and now that I'm nearly done I'm pretty sure that I do still want to pursue education in some way, but I really don't think classroom teaching is for me. Maybe I'm just burnt out and need a couple years away from school (I've been a student for six years and I'm completely exhausted), or maybe I've really made up my mind.

Either way, I'm feeling so defeated even though I keep trying to tell myself that it's ok to change your mind and take time to figure things out. Teaching is what I wanted to do for so long, but it isn't what I thought it would be.

Did anyone else ever feel this way? Did you take time off and return to teaching, or find something else (and if so, what?) I'm feeling completely gutted and trying not to feel like I failed at this.

Those of you who are jaded; come on: you control what happens in your four walls and nothing else. Your admin sucks, oh well. Co workers negative, sorry. We have the best job ever. Enjoy it.

teaching,Bernthewalldown,2019/02/28,"This sub is too negative I understand that there are hardships with the profession, like any proffesion, but this sub posting constant negativity has probably pushed people away from teaching. It brings me great sadness knowing this sub could've scared away the next great educator. 

The negativity needs to stop. If you are not right for the job then find a new proffesion but some users act like it's a nightmare for everyone when in reality some of us love our job and do not feel the same way. 

I'm not complaining about the people using this sub for help and ideas to better themselves and their class environment. I'm complaining about the people who are posting ""run for your life away frome from education"" posts because they, personally, are not a good fit to be a teacher and are realizing this.

I spoke with my mentor teacher and we agreed that there are two perspectives: I have fulfilled my requirements and I'm not being laid, but I've also been teaching classes since October and it could be disruptive to leave in May.

To those who have had a student teacher or who have completed student teaching, what are your thoughts? What are some effects of staying or leaving?

I am currently a doctoral student at Howard University. I am reaching out to k-12 teachers who work in ethnically diverse or minority-majority schools to participate in an online research questionnaire study. All participants have the opportunity to win a pair of wireless studio headphones after completing the survey.

If you would like to participate in my research study for teachers in diverse schools please send me a private message.

teaching,sweetteadolly,2019/02/28,"Newly licensed, anxious about job search....wondering if my particular set of circumstances are a good or bad thing? Okay. So... I’m a bit of a late bloomer. I just got my postgraduate professional license in Virginia for English. Here’s what I’m concerned about: 

—I’m 37
—I am finishing my second Master’s degree this May, an M.A.T. My first is an M.A.L.S (Humanities). The requirement to reach AP English classes is 18 credit hours; I have 43. 
—I have two years of postsecondary teaching experience (community and for-profit colleges)

I’m wondering.... will districts want to have me bc of my advanced degrees and postsecondary experience and see my age as being maturity and experience? 

Or....(what I’m afraid of)

Will I be seen as too old to be entering Secondary teaching? Will my advanced degrees be seen not as an asset be a deficit due to the fact that the possession of these degrees bumps me up higher on the pay scale?

Additionally.... I’ve got my heart set on going into a local urban school district because it’s officially designated as trauma-informed. I’ve written my thesis as an exploration of how the adaptation of some early childhood education approaches for the secondary realm could aid trauma-informed classrooms in helping students heal. 

I don’t know how to feel. I’m afraid that my age and my two M.A.’s are gonna make me a zebra when it’s best to be a horse. 

Or, hopefully.... i am grossly overestimating how unique all this is. 

And maybe.... districts are gonna be glad to have what I’m toting along with me.

I’ve just been ignoring and moving on but all my students talk about it after...any tips?",1.727517730496455,4.441913276595745,3.784148936170212,81.88416666666669,86.44680851063829,5.686524822695036,26.9822695035461,7.1686216300943375,1.857499290780142,192,9,33,3,6,65,38,47,0.053,0.947,0.0,-0.2828,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,2,8,4,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,3,2,2,4,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,20,3,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465014238172142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5415553035039431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4921122927354866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4095451107696501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4204199211772594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm a college student (BS Psychology) and I found a job posting for a part-time ESL teaching job. Since I was young, I've done pretty well at English classes, so I thought teaching it would be a nice little challenge and a productive way to make use of all the free time I have this semester.

teaching,Ahab1851,2019/03/01,"The thing that I love about teaching history more than anything is... ...seeing my students' reaction when I tell them about something particularly significant and its long-term effects in history. They LOVE seeing how a certain historical event has lasting effects, for better or for worse. When I told them about the 3/5 compromise that made slaves count as 3/5 of a person they got so enraged and wanted to spend the rest of the class talking about how that was so unfair. They got even more enraged when they saw how subsequent presidents from southern states benefited from that compromise. I mean it was a shitty, shitty thing for our Founding Fathers to do, but I LOVE seeing how invested my students get in the class discussion. We've had these discussions all year. In October they insisted on spending two days analyzing historical paintings to see how well they reflected the actual events of their time. Today they wanted to talk about why the US didn't withdraw from Vietnam before things escalated (I had to tell them that we'd discuss that next year). 

I tell you their thirst for knowledge and historical bombshells makes my job so much fun and enjoyable. I can't wait until I tell them about how 70% for our reason for being in Vietnam was to avoid a humiliating U.S. defeat. I can guarantee you that this stat will launch them into a full-on discussions about Vietnam and why we were there. They'll ask 1000000 questions like they always do. They'll analyze facts and come to their own conclusions. They'll be mad because they take so many parts of history so personally, but at the end of the day they also seem to take something away from it all. They see how beneficial history can be for them. 

My principal pokes her head in from time to time and listens. Yesterday I had my mid-year review and her ONLY real complaint (if you want to call it that) was that sometimes I go too deep into the content, and to make sure that I'm keeping an eye on the students who struggle with content analysis (totally fair observation). But she added that it's so clear how much my enthusiasm rubs off onto the kids. She said that every time she comes in she sees all my students fully engaged. It wasn't until I was driving home later that day that I realized she was complimenting me (I just like history!). 

This comes after last year when my school almost closed, I almost got fired because I had ZERO support from the three different principals we went through in one year), and forced me into 9 months of counseling. I'm so glad I stuck it out because we have an amazing principal now, the kids are awesome, and overall I'm pretty happy to be there.

teaching,notunprepared,2019/03/01,"Class culture One of my classes has a culture of being too embarrassed to ask me for help. They help each other, but that can only go so far, and sometimes it's like the blind leading the blind. 

There are behaviour issues with some/many kids, so much of my time is spent on that. Their current assignment allocates marks for asking for help and getting feedback on drafts, but it doesn't seem to make a difference, even when I remind them. And I tell them if they don't understand stuff that it's my fault not theirs. No impact. 

I've yesterday just learnt of them think I don't like them, which isn't true, but I've had to tell everyone off so often that I can see how they get that impression. So I'm going to do more games and other rapport building stuff. 

It's still early in the year so I'm hoping I can try and change this now before half the class fails. 

Have other teachers had this problem? How did you fix it? Are there any strategies I can use to encourage them to ask for help?",4.105407142857144,5.088904555000003,4.5544285714285735,87.85400000000004,70.95,7.7142857142857135,25.785714285714285,7.957251820313856,1.3075714285714284,781,23,163,10,14,247,119,200,0.107,0.75,0.14300000000000002,0.7785,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,10,2,16,10,0,1,6,0,18,2,0,5,1,25,35,17,0,3,6,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,1,18,7,0,0,3,1,1,3,6,4,0,2,4,3,21,6,19,30,3,16,0,1,3,0,25,5,0,4,10,114,39,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10250104030759187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4227344294286519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12825946696894927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1594515318624982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.157479956866572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995552301742957,0.0,0.0,0.14402823185436314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574995957078182,0.0,0.17132578187796435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4041224835374579,0.0,0.0,0.1497081283526168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15732214804187744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14727736937841285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061292672745704,0.15281577414894176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11080332196930116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10213802235025207,0.1146363661458829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14422750990359548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12011167568509352,0.13721822354824184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490750555993288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12037255212490962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34509779717441835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634879689745301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09658119986475554,0.0,0.0,0.08789142201412288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233524823333792,0.0,0.0,0.15691443680621686,0.0,0.1301816535179358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706467770566078
teaching,takingtacet,2019/03/01,"Today was way. Too. Long. Music k-4

It was fun run day! Each grade ran laps to raise money for the school. And because GOD FORBID we shift the 3 1/2 hour break 4th grade teachers have when kids are at specials and the 1 1/2 hr break k-1 teaches get to Monday, admin strategically scheduled each grade so that all the students were able to attend specials as scheduled. So the classroom teachers got their planning plus about another hour and a half ish off for the fun run. 

Meanwhile, I have the WORST BEHAVED GROUPS EVER. Just the fact that there’s something happening later in the day makes kids insane. So the shit behavior was pushed onto the teachers that, every day, get one break during the day for lunch and no planning, no transitions. 

Kids were screaming. Throwing things. Hitting each other. Tackling each other. Usually well behaved classes were a nightmare of chatter and outbursts. 

I just sent my last class out and I still feel wound up. I’m gonna go home, take a klonopin and eat myself to sleep.

An NQT friend of mine has recently started teaching English at Secondary school, and they're finding planning and organisation a real task to keep up to (nothing new there) and are fishing around for online services that might help them along.

Any strong recommendations? Sites like Twinkl exist, but don't cater extensively to the secondary market, but then perhaps paper resource sites aren't the best port of call for secondary?

teaching,P0werSurg3,2019/03/01,"Block students on Social Media? I'm a long-term sub in a math classroom with 7th graders. One or two found my Instagram and started following me. I did not follow back. Of course, them being that young, they think finding my Instagram is like the most amazing and funniest thing in the world. Two days later they still find it funny and are telling the other periods about it, so I made my account private. The day I did I got 15 follow requests, all from students. 

My Instagram is SFW, but has a lot of pictures of my face, camping trips and Doctor Who conventions and such. 

I am never going to follow them back, and the couple that have sent me message requests have been ignored. My dad thinks I should block them but I don't really feel like being asked ""Why did you block me?"" fifteen times. Seems mean. They know I'm not following them back, though.

teaching,pjl1701,2019/03/02,"Rejected from my Bachelor of Education program Today I was rejected from my only local Bachelor of Education program. I was feeling good but am just gutted and uncertain about where to go from here. I applied as a mature student - in my 30s now - but my undergraduate grades weren't fantastic. That being said, my recent grades were excellent and I have a management role at work. Any suggestions for what I can do to make myself a better candidate for next year? I still want to pursue a career in education, but it's difficult to find opportunities to work with youth or in classrooms without any credentials.

teaching,zeroexev29,2019/03/02,"Rookie teacher here. I'm not unhappy where I'm at, but I'm curious about other opportunities. I feel guilty about this and want some advice. Some background. I'm a second year teacher and I like the school I'm at. It's nothing special but it also hasn't been anything bad either. However I moved a bit far from my old home to be here and I've been getting homesick since then. Plus this opportunity comes with a higher salary

There are some openings at schools near my old home that I'd be eligible for, but I'd feel guilty for leaving my current position for them. There's been a lot of turnover in my department over the past two years and I'd feel bad about being another one. And considering it's a 2-person department, that seems to make it worse. I'd feel like I'm abandoning them. 

Is it normal to feel this way? What advice is there for someone in my position?

teaching,cuurlyn,2019/03/03,"Feeling Behind I teach 7th grade science and we use SEPUP curriculum. The units consist of “activities” (lessons) that can take between 1-3 days. There are four other 7th grade science teachers, and I feel like I am falling behind them. I am a starting activity 6 of a unit on Wednesday, when they all finished last week or are finishing tomorrow (Monday).

We have a few tests in each unit and I generally have an extra review day for my kids. I also have two co-taught classes with special needs students, so I can’t speed through things. I take my time teaching so all my students understand the content. I’m also trying out new teaching methods (which admin wants us to do), and this adds some extra time to my lessons. Although the new things are usually only an additional 5-10 minutes. The new things are also to help the students (using Universal Design for Learning). I’m representing content in different ways so all students can access and understand it. Our curriculum really only gives one way to represent it, and my additions have proven helpful to many students.

I am having a lot of anxiety about being behind the others, and just needed to share my anxiety with other teachers. Has anyone felt like this?",6.068436098654707,7.705109417040358,6.619616031390134,72.42745095291481,66.9372197309417,8.983071748878926,35.46216367713004,9.354420925462401,3.6522109865470864,972,48,153,19,16,317,137,223,0.023,0.898,0.079,0.8979,1,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,4,0,2,2,10,4,0,0,12,0,18,0,0,2,3,37,34,16,0,3,2,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,12,16,0,0,8,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,1,3,21,4,23,32,9,25,0,0,0,0,11,4,0,3,20,116,33,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31871940800254783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032592096218261,0.0,0.0,0.09289155156229882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17135404445471286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13879958977756654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343455311903181,0.09490780360464512,0.1275564802695528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274414723492926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17809261588259018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10829018123766948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12980723934641894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11294400633008847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13468867521589184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.197012637508226,0.0,0.3849210071068272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002234878003182,0.20207626305258367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510687603188845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09403165326251317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19977277976079447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2647781770584232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15493137746873184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09019617961038333,0.0,0.12977478660173142,0.2766023040930095,0.15980174988360496,0.2294788551429976,0.14631510073051496,0.0,0.07835815493522008,0.21089970838986447,0.1065639613783552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,HoraceMannBond,2019/03/03,"Socially scared [awkward] college students I'm an instructional historian at a state university in the Deep South in an exurban, white flight area. I've got 10 years teaching experience in the college setting. My first year in the classroom was 2007 as a grader, and then a graduate instructor. I've been trained in Best Practices, which is to break up class sessions in history 101 kinda courses into discussion sections with group activities, and I've done so for the past 10 years.

The issue I need help with is socially awkward students, and those with borderline autism. I've seen more and more examples of these kinds of students in the past three years at my current university.

Whenever we have a group activity or peer editing session, upward of 65% of students in those classes intentionally skip. Then they bomb the assignments or quizzes. When asked about their absence on certain days, students usually respond via e-mail or DM ""I don't like to have to talk to people...."" or ""I lack social skills.""

I've even had parents contact me and tell me that they 1) have signed a FERPA waiver, and 2) their kid has autism, meaning they should be exempt from any kind of group activity.

So my questions include 1) how do I deal with this as an instructor who is trying to be fair to everyone, 2) what does the autistic student or socially awkward student expect from a college degree if they intend to go through life avoiding interaction with others (what careers are good for people who do not want to ever interact with other humans), and 3) how can a parent admit that their kid lacks social skills, and are they complicit in this, or have they not tried to do anything to reverse this, such as counseling? medication?

I believe the American dystopia is upon us, but that's just my commentary on society. I've already seen data that suggests people 28 and under have never experienced romantic love, and I know the birth rate is declining.",8.156359773371104,8.44084630028329,8.107664305949013,68.37124150141645,61.917847025495746,11.02600566572238,40.029603399433434,10.686352973137794,4.572142322946176,1556,79,251,35,20,503,207,353,0.059,0.906,0.035,-0.8055,3,1,0,0,0,0,49.0,2,0,9,4,10,12,0,5,20,0,25,3,0,4,3,49,37,28,0,7,11,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,3,17,18,0,1,4,0,0,1,4,5,0,2,7,4,23,7,47,27,6,41,0,0,3,1,40,21,0,9,17,172,40,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12375032010129255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762596872958051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228244176208147,0.0,0.10483664458643177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263444420608164,0.11768500202566386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0723216315953679,0.11561238901852244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09813529566888712,0.114759120064129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406803578745118,0.10143790390383302,0.0,0.10715547754463073,0.0,0.1096953612467552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09538702955281396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0637322826798431,0.09405850321155047,0.08968935706818322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07516571083398091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704601024902313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335550726158174,0.061629730001712485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920846504398765,0.054786400707948144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10121158010069624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215436309843035,0.0,0.11297020310468235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08315108893310866,0.08649000916813519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24903849432213354,0.0,0.21410243983698796,0.23323323181487135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562352177427824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11227264794112707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5715678500724481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09013464284433853,0.09801612773834556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522726795005011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13489174790305736,0.0,0.12350740649915733,0.0,0.06614363415525303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888603646202623

teaching,kelvinkks,2019/03/04,"My brother is making my niece study in a mandarin school and she is falling behind because mandarin isn’t her first language. Should I convince him to move her to an English-speaking school? Not sure this is the right place to ask, but as the title says, my brother is convinced that the mandarin speaking school has a better curriculum and teachers; but my niece keeps failing and being punished by my brother. I checked in with her and it seems that she’s bored because she doesn’t understand some of the texts because no one at home speaks mandarin to her except her stepmother. We all speak English as a first language. 

I’m really afraid that if the foundation of her education is neglected this badly, she’ll never catch up later on. My brother thinks that it’s fine regardless and she’ll catch up.

What were your experiences post classroom and was it worth it?",4.904955357142857,6.357423989583335,5.614821428571428,79.23375000000003,69.52083333333334,7.152380952380952,29.339285714285715,7.447530270364453,1.8324035714285711,397,15,71,4,7,129,74,96,0.014,0.959,0.028,0.3049,1,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,7,1,0,1,2,15,15,7,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,6,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,4,1,9,0,9,11,3,11,0,0,1,0,3,6,0,3,2,46,14,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961985724282493,0.2766608350360313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15212244768474864,0.0,0.12059801850524868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.203230432373133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652652618079033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19352001186249612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10336031254113263,0.0,0.2248677056176251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2179369037755349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21028872388920855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20902291325788716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1963201229731551,0.17584431121980215,0.0,0.0,0.1087246164784076,0.0,0.0,0.4189561447605168,0.2149476624722201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16613107632909727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1993705514881504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066948488031576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894706757872208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12673778720607884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20021898214180264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15230259211449532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12739887209581446
teaching,PleasantSirPrize,2019/03/04,"Supporting my gf during student teaching Hi everyone!

This is my first Reddit post!

So my girlfriend of a little over a year is in her second of three semesters of student teaching. Idk if 'field base' is a universal term, but that's the name of the module she's in. This semester very obviously been much more demanding than anything she's done before. The middle school she's teaching at is about an hour away. She wakes up each morning at 5:40, student-teaches all day (special education), gets home around 4:30, works on lesson plans and projects until at least 9:30, then uses the remaining hour of her day to shower, pack her lunch, etc.

We live in the same town, but not together. I'm a 27 year old professional in healthcare admin, so my days are usually pretty stressful, but I can usually leave that stress at the door when I leave the office. I'm also in school, online, essentially at my own pace though. So I'm not juggling nearly as much as she is right now.

I'm looking for advice from teachers and student-teachers about how I can best support her through this. I've asked her before, ""How can I help?"", ""What can I do to better support you"" and she usually has pretty clear, honest, and helpful suggestions. But I want to do more.. things she hasn't thought of. What sort of things did your significant other, family members, and/or friends do (or not do) that you found helpful or uplifting during this challenging time in your life? Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks for your time!

teaching,QuestionAccount0417,2019/03/04,"Punic war teaching ideas Hi all. 

Student teacher making his first ever lesson plan. It's a 50 minute lesson for a year 7-8 class level and I'm following the Victorian State Curriculum in Australia.


It's going to be on the first Punic war and I'm not supposed to have any learning activity go for more than 10 minutes. It's also meant to engage students in a number of different ways (reading, writing, discussing, listening). The activities should also lead into one another so it's not just a confusing jumble of random activities. Now I know this probably sounds very easy to you all, but to me it sounds like a lot to pack into 50 minutes considering the Punic war has a lot of material to get through. The classes I've observed have generally had only 1 or two activities given more of a focus with classroom discussion mixed in throughout. I'm also wary of going with the 'listen to me talk for 10 minutes, write in your books for 10 minutes, Listen to me for 10 minutes, write for 10 minutes' framework. I want my classes to be something students look forward to which feature creative learning activities.

I know this probably doesn't sound very hard to you all, but as a student going through it all for the first time it's pretty daunting.
Do you guys have any ideas for fun learning activities surrounding the first Punic War that engage students AND lead to historical thought? (procedural ideas like how to create timelines, track cause and effect, analyse sources etc).

I certainly don't want a lesson plan written for me, but any ideas would be a huge help.",7.005083713850838,7.747282369863014,7.4263926940639315,70.71259512937598,64.34246575342465,9.776560121765602,37.45509893455099,9.725611199111238,3.8635541856925424,1260,62,207,24,18,413,152,292,0.051,0.8,0.149,0.9744,1,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,4,0,12,8,11,4,1,18,0,13,0,0,6,6,53,35,14,4,4,7,0,1,2,0,2,0,6,0,1,11,8,0,0,15,2,0,8,4,5,0,6,5,8,14,6,41,25,9,29,0,0,1,0,17,11,0,5,12,130,25,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723080430752557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315604486586747,0.11901915515875795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11660018228520475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11858783532779175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12658729799236085,0.0,0.10267113758218968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38618679834149416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059301312026067636,0.0,0.2580284375612741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11238710210790427,0.0,0.0,0.10167755827190196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607953971342979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5125301555784677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12475798975810512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11090493530015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531502520077713,0.0,0.0,0.19299459379379766,0.0,0.0,0.0757650016167583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07691345118566685,0.08632513483987422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547467861936107,0.2447536657302829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11353501586270855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08738115544848396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123045686320537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09010973563645892,0.06618527009991007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108772082676054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187305869242654,0.13389555385486218,0.09009443013951474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063019811341267,0.0,0.0,0.07309304780707263

teaching,Kitten_herpes,2019/03/05,"She asked me what BBC meant in class. Hey guys, I teach 6th grade ELAR at a small school in east Texas and today has been a day! First I have bronchitis BUT I came to work anyway because I had a girl come observe and I did it as a favor to my principal. Second I had a parent come observe their child in my class period during the same observation. Do what while being sick as a dog I am here on my BEST behavior the kids though are not. 

So to the story; we are learning research techniques and we were doing examples of credible and non credible sources. So for one I had this RIDICULOUS documentary from the 90’s for spaghetti growing on trees  and it was a British documentary. So I’m going on asking kids about how they know how it’s credible or not and I have a dad on one side of the room and a teacher observer on the other and a kid yells  “hey, ms. What does BBC stand for?!” And I freeze y’all. My mind is straight into the gutter. I’m expecting my kids to lose their shit laughing and saying dirty comments but they don’t. They’re my PRE AP/ GT kids and they are literally innocent, my on level kids would have lost their minds. I’m racking my brain on where they saw that and I just calmly reply “like what was on the documentary?” She nods and I say “ohhhh British broadcasting channel” and I look over and the dad is in TEARS laughing so hard and the observer is BRIGHT RED trying to hold it together.

teaching,Bluestreaking,2019/03/05,"Stepped between the fight caught some hits today As a wrestling coach as well as a teacher I’ve had my fair share of “Mr. Bustamouse can handle things,” despite being substantially shorter than most of my students haha. Well I was finally in the right place at the right time today when two girls decided to go out at it since I was in the middle of trying to get the one that was my student into my classroom.

Now I used to teach in East Cleveland so I’m used to a certain class of conflict I don’t experience in my current district. The girl that was my student gave a lot of “stop holding me back!” While not actually resisting me. While the other girl took a couple swings over my head and a couple landed on my head and the other girl. The girl who landed some punches got three days but the other girl got none so we will see how she is in class tomorrow

Took me a moment to get my adrenaline down and teach my class after that haha.

No complaints really, I just thought having visitors in the building observing would’ve been the most eventful part of the day but the kids had other plans",7.380820707070702,6.402391097222225,7.419107744107745,76.84575757575759,63.9537037037037,10.076767676767675,34.45117845117845,9.095868883498916,2.8916259259259265,871,32,166,12,11,281,127,216,0.053,0.88,0.066,0.2003,1,0,0,0,1,0,10.0,1,0,0,1,9,7,1,0,21,2,13,2,2,3,1,24,28,14,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,8,10,6,0,3,2,1,0,5,4,1,2,3,14,1,20,6,30,11,7,42,0,0,1,0,14,20,0,5,17,122,30,9,0.0,0.0,0.1449568235254864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11422062106869432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3287206503484551,0.0,0.19159626688937814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14530384095556126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16272191358283106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552154763742491,0.0,0.08442057495408192,0.0,0.2376072775862677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048965407974027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12628619329784416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065677771280224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16085790775709752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15519612234298466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09516063531629378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2537103162637154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11836977025742085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287654458751675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241888418647632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09868556150241367,0.0,0.0,0.11792677990516025,0.08661678701982256,0.0,0.2816033406368739,0.0,0.3300741218694821,0.10085114335075153,0.0,0.14510521025856984,0.0,0.0,0.25658741884593705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671165142915673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10552089138282528,0.0,0.0,0.0

Let's face it - now and then as a teacher, we are bound to be describing something, or presenting an idea to the class, and mid sentence you may accidentally come close to using non-teacher language such as ""shit"" or something else which is not very appropriate for the classroom. 

What I am interested in; is what kind of substitute words you have in place to avoid accidentally dropping the swear bombs in the classroom?

teaching,Whydoibuysmartphones,2019/03/06,"Life switching. Hey guys and girls. I have lurked here for a bit, and I know this gets posted often, but I'm curious anyways. 

I'm 27, and have a degree in political science. ever since I graduated I have been thinking about teaching but life kind of got in the way and I ended up being the general manager and area manager of a restaurant. 

I worked my ass off for 12 to 14-hour days and constantly getting called in when people were sick and it was definitely a tough job. right now I'm currently in Delaware my wife and I just moved up here from Nashville and I have the opportunity to go back to school and get my Master's and secondary education if I would like.

I was thinking about going to Grand canyon University online and pursuing my education that way. really what my question is is what are the views of you guys concerning online education and teaching? Do you see correlation between success and people that take online programs?

My wife is a registered nurse with a BSN and works at a magnet hospital in Delaware so I know financially we will be okay my question is how does online schooling correlate with success?

teaching,bigdaddyteacher,2019/03/06,"Help with academics Hello all,

I am a middle school teacher of a cross-cat/autism classroom. I have been in this position for 8 years now and I've always considered myself successful for these kids. Admin from all the districts I serve (I work for a co-op who houses students the districts cannot serve) have heaped praise on my teaching style and ability but this year I've felt lost...kinda like I am just spinning my wheels and it's mostly over academics. 

&amp;#x200B;

My class is basically designed as a reset for the students who have been unsuccessful in their home districts. I provide a strict, structured environment designed for their success. Managing behavior is the main key of the classroom but I also strive for a first-class academic life for them as well. I've tried to align my subjects to state standards, and while I feel I've done a good job I am also worried that I could get pulled in front of a review board and decimated. Why this comes to mind I don't know, but it is...

&amp;#x200B;

My coop does not provide actual curriculum for us; we are expected to kinda piece it together ourselves which is really what these kids need; they aren't all ready for basal readers and worksheets daily. But I feel there can be a middle ground somewhere. Have any of you found guidance on how to prepare academics for high functioning autistic kids?

Have any of you guys used ReadWorks before? What are the pros and cons? How does it work? Did your students enjoy it? 

And what apps/websites are best for an English classroom?

teaching,thelephantinthero0m,2019/03/07,"Teaching License vs. Master's? (Ohio) I'm struggling to decide whether it would be better to get a teaching license or to get a Master's degree first.

I have a B.A. in English, but not any sort of teaching degree. I hope to be a professor someday and am wondering if it would be wiser to first get a teaching certificate, then pursue a Master's in English. Or, if it would be better to get a Master's first. To teach in college, do you need a certification or does a Master's suffice?

I found a great online Master's program for English at Ohio University, but it specifically calls for applicants to already be licensed to teach.

Any input would be wonderful.

teaching,DogCock88,2019/03/08,"What to do about disobedient student - grade 1 OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes. I'm out of pocket with the rope and the bleach and I've used up most of my sick days, I have to come into work some days still drinking because I can't afford to use a sick day for my hangover.

* If something goes wrong with a lesson, it isn't their fault.  Ever.
* If their lesson doesn't work they'll try it again and NEXT time it will DEFINITELY work.  They swear.
* They get upset with the tone that criticism is delivered more than the context of the criticism
* They aren't taking steps to improve themselves i.e showing initiative, working with coaches, seeking out advice

Now it isn't ALL of them, but it is MOST of them.  I have ONE new teacher who is the same age but is aggressively trying to improve himself and taking everything admin says as gospel, and making rapid improvements.  He is how I would expect all of them to behave.

Can someone born after 1990 please explain to me the proper way to get these teachers to realize they aren't nearly as good as they think they are without destroying their faith in me as a mentor?",5.0241228070175445,6.9816689561403535,5.445614035087721,78.58096491228073,69.96491228070175,8.224561403508767,29.771929824561404,8.841846274778883,2.5652350877192966,974,39,169,18,18,311,134,228,0.102,0.7709999999999999,0.127,0.7372,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,13,5,6,10,2,1,11,0,20,0,0,3,3,34,33,15,0,4,8,0,0,2,0,3,0,3,0,0,13,9,0,0,7,3,0,2,8,5,0,1,1,3,23,5,31,29,7,22,2,0,0,0,20,7,0,3,14,120,36,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16318051636842806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15105184969763147,0.0,0.0,0.15007967982853826,0.16334808372303264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17449057411803298,0.0,0.0,0.1400631356042684,0.13355701135331213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882096600518376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17429398348574116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09177323618545824,0.0,0.18837178698293144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16316557907302115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114669994514665,0.0,0.0,0.18190086530323876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16127980570314418,0.17759556468915638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17522772208419268,0.0,0.11315662163500582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1833046728118176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327970048478273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14148992992334153,0.12855691940340794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25111112027972105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10700033189084013,0.0,0.0,0.09737310510780788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267502482974332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13254874388757598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16097222440787196,0.0,0.4862823020538362,0.0,0.0,0.11862477472568887,0.1825771502361748,0.0,0.0

teaching,teacher_quizzer,2019/03/09,"Teacher Satisfaction Survey Hello Teachers of Reddit! I'm getting my MA in Educational Leadership and have created a survey for an assignment regarding School Improvement and Evaluating School Progress. Any input would be helpful! My main goal is to gather enough information from a wide variety of teachers to show that 1) teachers are not paid enough 2) those who are paid enough are also well compensated emotionally by their administrative staff, and 3) the conditions in which teachers are working directly relates to student outcome. Thank you for your time!

teaching,ThrowawayGuy0192,2019/03/09,"What should I know before I consider teaching (secondary students)? I am at a cross-road where I have the ability to continue studying in my area of the sciences, and get a job in a related field, or to study a masters of teaching. I am seriously considering the latter, however my experience with teenagers as an adult has been limited to previous part-time jobs. I don't necessarily need help deciding which career-path to follow, but I do want to know what, if any, considerations I should take when working with teen-aged students. 

What are some things about teaching teenagers that you didn't think about until teaching them? Is there anything particularly difficult you found about working with them? Are there any behavioral issues to be aware of? I don't think teenagers necessarily have behavioral issues or are difficult, but I do want to consider all factors and concerns that may arise.

teaching,ketchuplover98,2019/03/09,"How hard is it to get into a masters/credential program? Hi everyone! I'm an undergraduate student and I'm really interested in becoming a teacher. I was wondering what sort of stats I need to be admitted into a M.A. Education/Single Subject Mathematics credential program straight out of undergrad? 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly my undergrad GPA is not great (\~2.6) but I go to a really prestigious school so I'm hoping an admission committee would realize that my 2.6 at my school may be equivalent to something around 3.0 at another school. I haven't taken the GRE yet but I've taken practice tests and scored pretty well (162 quantitative, 158 verbal) and I plan to study more to improve these before I take the real test. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have some experience volunteering as a high school tutor at a local school, but that's about it. I'm hoping to get another volunteer position at a school before I graduate.

teaching,DogCcck88,2019/03/10,"One of my students is exhibiting some problematic behaviour - advice needed OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes. I'm out of pocket with the rope and the bleach and I've used up most of my sick days, I have to come into work some days still drinking because I can't afford to use a sick day for my hangover.

I am a 3rd year Primary Education student, specialising in ICT and Computing. I am interested to find out what role the the IWB has to play in a primary classroom in 2019 as part of my final year dissertation.

The purpose of this study is to understand the current role and usage that the IWB has in primary classrooms.

I know you're all super busy, but please could any primary/early years/elementary teachers willing, complete the short survey (&lt; 5 minutes).

Thank you to anyone who completes this or already has.

It's greatly appreciated.

teaching,DogCbck88,2019/03/10,"Problem student - HELp! OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes. I'm out of pocket with the rope and the bleach and I've used up most of my sick days, I have to come into work some days still drinking because I can't afford to use a sick day for my hangover.

teaching,DogCack88,2019/03/10,"Student refuses to obey commands - HELP!! OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes. I'm out of pocket with the rope and the bleach and I've used up most of my sick days, I have to come into work some days still drinking because I can't afford to use a sick day for my hangover.

teaching,MakGuffey,2019/03/12,"Questions about teaching. Hey guys, I just have a few questions. I’ve been googling a lot of this but I figured I’d ask actual working professionals! 

Quick background. I’m about to wrap up my bachelors degree in history. I decided I want to teach in my junior year. I’m immediately getting a Master of Arts in Teaching to qualify to teach secondary education after OCS (I’m joining the National Guard a couple weeks after graduating with my bachelors.) 

My questions are about the tier system? I will be teaching in Tennessee. How does the tier system work in Tennessee, or even in general. From what I understand a masters degree can put you in a different tier? But in my mind, since the masters basically qualifies me to teach like a bachelors does, would it count even towards advancing a tier? 

Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

teaching,ThrowawayBlueYeti,2019/03/12,"Question for Ohio teachers Do teachers with Initial licensure’s without M.ED’s have trouble finding jobs in Ohio? 

I have a degree in broadcast journalism. The first time I inquired about the teaching the program at my college (after having completed my first degree) they made it seem like I would have to earn an M.ED because they didn’t have an option for just getting the license. I did not realize a school relatively close by does. Unfortunately my Bachelor’s degree doesn’t fit very well into the most likely English or Social Studies specialties. Most of my classes were based in television and reporting. I’m definitely interested in the Master’s Degree I’m just afraid it’s a lot to do all at once, especially at a later age. I am looking into obtaining a substitute license. I do have experience working at our library helping college students with their tech projects, but I know that’s different than teaching students K-12. 

I’m interested in switching careers but I’m 25, I’m afraid by the time I finished I would be starting kind of late. Plus I don’t know if I would struggle to find a job with just the license and a bachelors degree, I definitely need to know if that is a viable option. My cousin thinks I just need to find a job in my field, any job. But I’m frustrated that I feel like I’m not going to find something I’m happy with. 

Anyways, any advice would be appreciated.

teaching,cam0379,2019/03/13,"Praxis CORE Math Hi, everyone. I am an education student. I'm on fire to teach and I graduate in May with my Bachelors..... however I have one problem that has been a constant burden on my career path to the point where I cringe when I hear it - Praxis CORE mathematics. I passed reading and writing with flying colors, but I have failed the math 4 times. Granted I havent had a decent math teacher since freshman year of high school - I'm now almost 24. I feel like no matter what materials I use, nothing clicks. I have lost all hope on passing this exam to the point where I got my TEFL cert to teach abroad for the rest of my life. I just dont know what to do. Any suggestions on worthwhile study materials will be appreciated. 

P.S. No ""Wow, you're dumb if you can't pass it."" I am terrible at math and I certainly have no intentions of teaching it.

I've had 4 years of teaching experience but zero formal education training except for what I've learned through my own experiences. I have taken the ABCTE PTK test and passed it pretty easily. 

My question is: What is the best study guide to use for this particular test? (ex. We used Barron's to study for all of our SATs in high school, occasionally Kaplan) Also, what are my chances of passing with my experience and some self study?

teaching,sweeptree,2019/03/13,"At what moment did you realize you loved your new class? I think there’s a point in the beginning of the school year where the kids go from a group of students in the same room to “our class” and the love and flow is switched on all the way. Mine was with my new third grade class about three weeks after I arrived, we sang a pop song together and read the lyrics on the screen and everybody was happy and engaged just singing along together.

teaching,Scorbuddie,2019/03/13,"Teaching writing to third graders I'm not an actual teacher and really don't plan to be at any point in the future. 

However I'm currently working as a teacher so aide at an elementary school through the America Reads program. The teacher I was paired with found out I'm studying writing and so a lot of times I work one on one with kids to edit work they have written. 

While I catch onto the mistakes they make and have ideas on how to make their writing stronger I don't know how to communicate that in a way that would be teaching them. Like I have to catch myself to change ""capitalize that T"" to ""What goes at the beginning of a sentence?"" 

Spelling I usually just tell them. 

Sentence structure and writing good paragraphs is something that I understand as a writer of course but I have no clue how to communicate this to third graders. How do I tell them ""all your sentences have to relate to each other"" and stuff? Usually to help strengthen sentences I tell them to  ""say what you mean"" because third graders have a habit of writing sentence fragments and stuff. I know this part is the most important for good writing do it's what I really want to help them with. They have their regular teacher teaching them this stuff of course, but it always needs repeating. Especially in one on one sessions. And being the type of person I am, I'm not exactly good at using third grade language.

teaching,DogCeck88,2019/03/13,"Student does not obey teacher commands - need legal advice OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes.

teaching,ejwilloughby,2019/03/13,"A Ray of Hope Just wanted to share some positivity...

I’m currently a Student Teacher working as a French and Spanish Teacher in an inner London School. This particular school is one of the worst in my area, and has long withheld a reputation of being a ‘failing school’. 

My first few weeks were what I can only describe as hell on earth. I found myself crying after lessons and panicking thinking about going back in to class knowing the rudeness and general lack of respect would happen all over again. I’m not entirely sure how I got through those weeks, but I did and to be honest I’m really proud. 

Anyway, today I had a breakthrough! I’ve started bringing 3 unlabelled envelopes to class with prizes inside. The three students who are the least disruptive are then allowed to claim these prizes (skip the lunch queue, leadership points and a 10 minute timeout in the MFL office, phone call home, postcard etc..). I have honestly never seen these kids so well behaved and engaged in the lesson. We went from not being able to do more than half of the planned work to finishing early. After weeks of trying new techniques it’s such an amazing feeling to know something has worked. I’m now feeling so much better about tomorrow and believe if that class can do it, so can my others. 

To everyone else out there who has been feeling the same, I really hope this ray of light encourages you to continue to try new things, as one day something will work! You can do this and when those kids start to believe they’re worth your time and energy it will feel so much more worth it.

teaching,DogCdck88,2019/03/13,"Student refuses to obey teacher commands, should I call police? OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes.

teaching,THEREALImGerg,2019/03/13,Cursive Writing I have a question if anybody knows the answer or has any idea whatsoever. Why don't they teach cursive anymore in schools? When I was in 2nd grade (2011-2012) my teacher said she was going to teach cursive. She got to b. Same thing happened all the way up to 5th. Then my teachers started just expecting us to already know it. Why is that? I also don't get why they don't at least teach how to sign your name. That's actually important in real life.,2.3234408602150545,4.539193817204307,3.5389247311827963,88.09505376344086,78.56989247311827,5.853763440860216,28.612903225806452,6.937597516519254,1.4890774193548384,367,17,73,4,9,119,69,93,0.0,0.975,0.025,0.2869,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,1,1,2,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,8,1,0,1,1,16,16,6,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,1,11,0,10,12,3,10,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,3,3,46,15,5,0.0,0.0,0.1988586086055264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2248748546275792,0.16296174689631593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385764988773528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20209370614972835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10646595625903826,0.0,0.11581212712001547,0.0,0.16298043605737778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802008249290273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23004133998447066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22398288042452172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393491707706998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282787727229506,0.0,0.0,0.23194476507951736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19384020156993334,0.0,0.0,0.2062349161962464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14423560750732808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13538150859365852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451206766603204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16175004111544972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5516357231304858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,DogCfck88,2019/03/14,"Potential lawsuit OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes. I'm out of pocket with the rope and the bleach and I've used up most of my sick days, I have to come into work some days still drinking because I can't afford to use a sick day for my hangover. Help a brother out fams.

teaching,stoptouchingmeplease,2019/03/14,"Behavioral issues with a student going too far - now he's touching others inappropriately! throwaway because I am so scared of losing my job.I am a counselor at an aftercare elementary school program.We have a student who has had repeated discipline problems,all involving putting his hands on others or hurting them.Since October he has had over 4 discipline reports documenting the behavior of hitting or hurting others,usually in the presence of myself or others. To make matters worse he will repeatedly lie about doing it and always tries to place the blame on others (even when I have directly seen the behavior myself). Today his actual teacher came to talk to us and said that some more serious behavior is going on where he is touching others (girl and boys) inappropriately.This is my tipping point and I am at a loss with what to do next. The teacher said she is having trouble getting her administration to do something about it/take it seriously for whatever reason and my supervisor keeps trying to sweep it under the rug while telling me that this is just a ""personal button"" getting pressed by this kid. That's NOT the case, which I have explained to him many times.

There seems to be a ""conflict of interest"" that is occurring which is that the mother of the child works for a our states Department of Early Care and Learning in a position that has worked closely with the school and our program - I just found this information out which shocked me because (1) the childs family fosters other children,frequently,one of which was in our program Oct-Nov and had several instances with said student (in terms of hitting/doing inappropriate things) (2) when we are issuing these discipline reports the mother and father show no care when we try to talk about the issue and have given us no support in getting this kid to shape up or do the right thing.

At this point I am seriously worried about the children in our program and honestly anyone child who is in contact with this kid.He shows no remorse for his behavior and never tells the truth - he's an only child who (from what we've seen day in and day out) does whatever he wants. I was thinking of calling CPS but am afraid to with the family/mother working for the State Dept and being a foster parent... not to mention it being linked to me/my program in any way shape or form...I love my job, I love the kids, I am here for them above all and I am at a complete loss with what to do.If I get fired over this and this kid is still in the program what would happen to my kids?? These are the things I am worried about.

Advice is needed please!!

teaching,grytmy,2019/03/14,"high school senior who needs advice hi, everyone! I’m a high school senior starting college in the fall. I feel completely lost and clueless because I’m not for sure what I want to do with my life yet, and the thought of wasting time and money through loans and college is scaring me to death.

when I started to consider careers, I realized there were 3 different concepts that were important to me: the ability to be mobile and travel frequently, truly enjoying my job and my work, and the pay. 

my major is history (on a pre-law track) and I would love to work in museums and on battlefields but I know that’s unrealistic, so I’ve narrowed it down to: teaching (I think I would enjoy it, and I would have so much time to travel, but the money aspect is scary), law (great money, but minimal time to travel, and I’d say it’d be slightly below average on the ‘enjoyment’ scale), and travel nursing (I’d have to change my major, and I’m not really a fan of science whatsoever, so that’s a whole other aspect— but I’d definitely be traveling and making money). 

basically, I guess I’m just asking if you guys have any advice? did you all know you wanted to teach from the start, or was it something you just sort of ‘ended up’ doing? if so, did you end up liking it? I’m scared to make a huge life mistake based off my major. I just want to be able to live comfortably and enjoy coming into work every day.",6.3886450839328575,5.76260479496403,7.59771223021583,73.60064508393287,65.79856115107913,10.578800959232618,32.92182254196643,10.047579312681364,3.1863992326139083,1095,40,207,22,15,376,148,278,0.084,0.7909999999999999,0.125,0.9301,3,0,1,0,0,0,38.0,0,5,0,4,10,13,0,2,12,0,21,3,0,2,2,51,45,27,1,10,12,0,1,1,0,3,2,1,0,1,11,18,0,0,6,6,6,7,2,4,0,0,7,2,24,9,32,30,6,36,0,1,0,1,11,15,0,5,15,136,35,14,0.12225933759664265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23894081944607984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314054201704356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11429597685543558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07452815742876846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293341681675996,0.1053155937579288,0.12818658938884198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07884715848718915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12773498621494173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21657096923335092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10300876492716424,0.11682403638240205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061817994570931685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13479135131367584,0.13468244400229948,0.12105596580635153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583474053485487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12132352763940064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13438106917042875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17271077156534406,0.059729736792040425,0.0,0.10795723499273473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334605092987282,0.0,0.1103438255042017,0.0,0.1632181144101481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08987468047321244,0.09065374968546888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832246229366788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722553238734599,0.2448058504962551,0.24746595352464465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412121113270702,0.0,0.0,0.2596073652487826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11522797880500732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07833884691624395,0.0,0.09706025755120308,0.2138712088084533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2163351748341331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13649818429399668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2670187616161168,0.0,0.0,0.2605485769106814,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Eclipser,2019/03/14,"Different Ways of Counting With Hands I am teaching ESL online via VIPKid, and have a general education question. Many of my students (from China) are counting digits on their hands in odd ways - such as giving the Texas ""hook 'em horns"" to indicate the number 6. It seems like a way to count to 10 on just one hand.  


Is this purely a Chinese thing? Is this something all young students are learning now? Where can I learn to count like this too match my students?",3.7137068965517237,6.079282482758623,3.9776867816091968,85.91411637931036,74.7471264367816,6.189080459770117,26.96695402298851,7.1686216300943375,1.4393919540229887,364,14,66,4,8,113,66,87,0.025,0.838,0.13699999999999998,0.8458,1,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,0,5,2,0,0,5,0,7,3,3,0,2,10,9,2,0,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,5,2,12,9,1,9,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,2,4,42,10,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871149873169479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26362006383346115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2685137898341166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786113225429541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862164403341643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3078469062398773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25017411293227504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21155997382854752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825696628973293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6543873854008759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Anyways, the school really likes me and appreciates my input, and they want me to suggest creative writing books. I did some googling, but it seems like all the top results are simply books with good SEO strategies behind them, rather than just good books for learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have suggestions for good books for creative writing? Elementary of all levels are here.

I teach english language to foreigners and this is the first student who is pretty good at english but tends to forget words unless you write them down. I tested him by recording his voice while reading a passage he understood on paper but had trouble understanding once I played it back. 

Im trying to figure out some methods on how help him improve. His vocab isnt a problem. I was impressed by his range of conjunctions, adjectives and adverbs but his biggest flaw is listening most of all.

teaching,CosmicGlitterCat,2019/03/14,"Questions about Teaching Hello,

I am currently a college student taking Biology with an emphasis in STEM-ED and a Math Teaching Minor (the program is set up so that I will have a teaching certification by the time I graduate). I've enjoyed the few experiences I've had lesson planning and interacting in classrooms, and think I would be genuinely excited about helping students learn. However, I do have my worries. I'm definitely an introvert. I've had food service jobs interacting with the public before, and I didn't mind, but I can be soft spoken at times. I can also struggle with being disorganized, though I'm doing my best to overcome that flaw. To go off of Briggs-Meyers personalities, I'm an INFP. I believe that teaching can be very difficult and takes grit, but I do want a job in which I can help and inspire others to be the best versions of themselves. I was wondering are there were any other teachers who have had these sorts of doubts and struggles? Were you able to overcome them? What has helped? I would love to hear your stories or any advice you could offer!",5.9999787835926455,7.385378658415843,6.8024893917963265,71.9909900990099,66.87128712871288,9.137765205091938,35.220650636492216,9.424239791934726,3.5315660537482323,867,42,144,17,14,287,129,202,0.08199999999999999,0.7509999999999999,0.16699999999999998,0.9647,4,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,3,1,4,6,10,0,3,12,0,30,2,0,0,0,26,41,13,0,4,3,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,1,9,10,1,0,6,0,0,1,1,4,0,0,7,2,19,6,20,25,4,11,0,0,0,1,17,6,0,5,3,107,28,17,0.15439533285646295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15087333236290398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346989190381605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20998824156790924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13137905650725465,0.1739506688331834,0.3240567527955805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12327211002330915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15102826167522065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866954493451512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774642570416982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17401476124023382,0.0,0.31046381129924666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3064270885387152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13934781589921294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15589527302311595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13481204934465674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17295810783110654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3228150494446677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23217215114361314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989302950841206,0.15169263062355287,0.0,0.1800583204059609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12739231919390714,0.09106636756388006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1674351524188798,0.0,0.15679595504354313,0.0,0.21935602928544504,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,JackFrost___,2019/03/15,"Student teacher Dealing with over-critical supervisor (tips) Any tips for dealing with an over-critical supervisor (from my uni). She’s new as a supervisor and is very critical in a few areas that when I talk to my cooperating teacher about it, she says will take years of experience to acquire.  If you need any examples, I’ll be happy to provide. 
She’s also very critical when it comes to my presentation of lessons. I’ve taught 3 lessons this semester and have definitely improved on a few things. While she will tell me when I have improved, she seems focused on stuff I will not improve on after a year or two of having my own classroom. My cooperating teacher feels as though I am right where I should be as a student teacher at this point in the year. 
In about 2 weeks, I will be taking over as the full time teacher and this is where I will be getting a lot of my experience for the semester and I really can’t wait. 
But in our mid-term evaluation today, she asked me if teaching was really something I want to do. Normally, I am pretty good when it comes to criticism. But that last statement felt pretty personal. Now, I have a very laid back attitude. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t have a genuine interest for the subject, or teaching students. Anyone who knows me knows I am a light hearted guy and I really enjoy helping people and working with kids.
I know at this stage of my schooling, as long as I meet the requirements to pass student teaching, I’ll graduate. But I don’t want to just graduate college, I want to come out of it the best teacher I can be.
Any tips would be appreciated! Thanks!


TL;DR- 
My (student teaching) supervisor is very critical of things that will take years to perfect as an educator.

Obviously,  this isn't really the place to discuss lightboards specifically. Do you  know any communities which are focused on using the  lightboard,  sharing content to embellish the lightboard, and other things like this?

teaching,Sandyeller,2019/03/15,"Resignation Letter I was just wondering how soon I can write a resignation letter? I'm wanting to resign at the end of the school year, but my mom thinks that if I turn it in now they can just go ahead and resign me from my position. I am pretty sure that would not happen since I am under contract. 

Time is somewhat of the essence as I am writing this because of the possibility of non-contract renewal. Plus I just hate this place anyways and really don't want to work here.

teaching,kabochhan,2019/03/15,"Getting certified while living abroad? For the past two years I’ve been living in Japan working as an Assistant Language Teacher. I’m surprised by how much I’ve enjoyed it and would like to make teaching a career. 

I’ve been looking into getting my master’s degree online but I’m a bit stumped. Ideally, I’d like to obtain my master’s in teaching while I live in Japan. No matter what, I’ll need to fulfill student teaching requirements. Rather than TESOL focused, I’m more interested in teaching literature at a junior high or high school level. 

The only online master’s program I’ve found that can give me the student teaching experience I would need is USC Rossier. Does anyone know of other school options? I’m interested in getting certified in the U.S. but I’m wondering if living in Japan will make that impossibly difficult.

teaching,kaetror,2019/03/16,"[shitpost] The JFOM Programme - the Solution to Disengaged Learners As educators we’ve all been there; those kids that are physically there, but you can tell they would rather be anywhere else than in your classroom. They are the worrisome ones, the ones that disengaged with learning long ago and lack the drive to succeed.

They are the trouble makers, the great distractors, the millstone around the progress of your class. When they show up to class they do nothing, only to disappear for weeks on end, reappearing one day and sending you scrambling to try get them caught up before they vanish again.

You don’t know why they come to school any more, the school leadership doesn’t know either, to be honest, the kids often don’t either; they are just showing up because that’s what they are ‘supposed’ to do, they don’t actually care.

These are the kids that spend their school lives constantly stuck in the detentions, the parental meetings, the interventions, isolations, exclusions and suspensions – the kids that suck up ever growing amounts of teacher’s time. All of it for nothing. 

Today I’m here to introduce a new program aimed at tackling this behaviour once and for all. The JFOM programme. JFOM is an intensive course of interventions aimed at tacking this difficult behaviour and bringing resolution to teacher, school &amp; student.

The core of the JFOM program is 1-1 meetings with highly trained Straight-Talkers for the young people who have been failed by previous programmes and deserve this opportunity. During the interview our Straight-Talkers sit the student down, discuss their behaviour and attitude before introducing them to the core message of the programme; “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”*. 

It is clear they don’t want to be in school, they are wasting their own time, as well as the time of everyone else there, take the advice and “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”*.

Our programme shows stunning results; nobody has ever spoken so plainly with the young people and they respond to it. Nobody has had the courage, to look them in the eye and say, “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”*. 

And they do. Freed from the expectations placed on them, they can accept their place is not within education, take on the message of the programme and “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”*. Even those that are originally resistant to the idea eventually come around after we point out how they are wasting their time in school and eventually they too “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”.*

So far, the JFOM program has helped dozens of troublesome youngsters “*Just Fuck Off Mate”*; freeing innumerable teacher hours to better provide for their classes, boosting the learning potential of their students. Our success rate is 100%, every student we see accepts they should “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”.*

The programme is ready to be rolled out nationwide, allowing all disengaged learners to take on the key lesson of “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”*. 

If you would be interested in joining the programme, entering schools and helping young people to realise their potential to “*Just Fuck Off Mate!”* we would welcome your skills in the JFOM programme.

Thank you for listening.

teaching,mangokisses,2019/03/16,"Had an allergic reaction on school property, now what? Hello everyone!

I’ve been following this sub for a while but have never posted before. I am a student teacher in NYC. I was placed at a private catholic school for my student teaching.

I got sick as soon as I started the semester and have been sick for over a month. The other day I was standing in a classroom and started to experience symptoms of an allergic reaction. I went to the school nurse and she recommended I leave to go see my doctor. I did as instructed and am currently being treated for a few issues including possible dust allergies and a sinus infection. Then I got a clearance to go back to normal activities. 

Here is the thing, I got an email from my cooperating teacher asking for a copy of my “doctors diagnosis.” He cc’d administration and the nurse. He made it sound like there might be a public health issue (even though no one else had any symptoms) then said I should provide my medical information. Isn’t this a HIPAA violation? 

My doc doesn’t want to provide anything to them besides the clearance. He said he can’t do allergy testing since I took antihistamines so he can’t be 100% on why this happened. Meanwhile, I still gotta go back there and hope this doesn’t happen again. What am I supposed to do here without putting myself at odds with these people at the school?

teaching,phillipsn07,2019/03/16,"Switching from secondary school to primary school advice I’m a secondary science teacher in the Uk and I want to switch to primary school. I think it’s more my calling. I love teaching students in y7 because they’re amazed by everything. However, I’ve lost interest in the older students, none of the care or try to do their work. So I’m thinking of becoming a y6 teacher but I don’t know how I’d go about switching.

Anyone got any advice?

teaching,ts316,2019/03/16,"How does behaviour in British state schools differ from that in state-run schools in other countries? I have been discussing this topic with other teachers and friends. We are all curious to find out whether based in other countries are confronted with the same behavioural problems that we are.

The most widespread behavioural problem is a general apathy towards education as a whole. This manifests itself in different ways, from daily low-level disruption and off-task behaviour, to outright refusal and disrespect for teachers and authority. One pupil remarked to a colleague of mine that he saw bad behaviour in school as ""a bit of a rite of passage.""
 
I'd love to know whether anyone in this subreddit has had experience of working in two state sectors could share there experiences!

teaching,Forteaching,2019/03/17,"Guilt about being bad at my job is making me worse at my job- suggestions? I've been struggling since I started teaching two years ago with classroom management.  I honestly think it has improved a bit, but slowly, and a change of grade levels between the two years kind of reset my progress.  Anyway, although it's no longer ""kids throwing things at me"" bad, it's still bad, and on my evaluation to get my standard teaching license I was rated not proficient in classroom management and given one year to fix it.

Since the evaluation I've felt really defeated.  As far as I can tell, my classroom management problem is mostly a problem with body language and the general vibe I put out, and lately I'm so guilty for not providing a good classroom environment,  nervous about what will happen (administrators are getting upset at me when I send students out), and angry at the students for behaving so terribly that the vibe I'm putting out is very tense.  

I also have a hard time getting stuff done to improve anything.  When I sit down to plan a lesson, I'm so stressed out that it takes a long time and I can tell the quality is bad.  I have books on classroom management the instructional coach has given me to read, but I feel like I have been doing everything I can think of to improve my classrom management already and it didn't fix it, so when I read them I get so upset that it is hard to persist and I'm not very receptive to any new ideas / finding new ideas that would be applicable.

Has anyone dealt with overcoming negative feelings around being bad at teaching that are affecting productivity?  I would LOVE to quit at this point, but I am having a baby this summer and I can't see any other way to bring in enough money/health insurance for my family.

Im using engage New York for math though (kindergarten) which is very thorough, but I still always move lessons around or teach them differently. My coworker (a first year teacher) just teaches them in order and never thinks twice about it. 

Why can’t I be like that? Obviously I’m just trying to do what’s best for my students.. but why do I always seem to think I know better than whatever team of people came up with the curriculum?

teaching,squirtgunheadphones,2019/03/17,"Grading advice I am a first year, 12th grade English teacher and despise grading. I get sick thinking of even having to grade. I have 100 research papers stacked on my desk to grade that I told myself I'd grade over break this week, and yet here we are, no grading done. 

I have graded a lot of the pieces of the paper individually already, and even those it was tough to get started. It's to the point where I've heard of kids talking smack to other teachers about how I don't grade fast enough and I can't enjoy what I enjoy because I feel buried in grading. ""He can go on a ski trip but can't grade our papers? What the hell."" Even when I take time to give good feed back, all they care about is the score anyway. 

My question, how do I get over the anxiety of grading and get more efficient? I really want to be the best teacher I can, and I know grading is the big piece of that. I just want to feel like the feedback/grade is about more than just the score anyway.

teaching,GSpub,2019/03/17,"Knowledge is the best gift. The best gift we can make to someone is knowledge.

Knowledge costs nothing to give, and can be passed on infinitely.

I'm working on a project to help fund the construction of an earthquake resistant school for children in Nepal from poor families. 

With the right knowledge, these kids in Nepal would be able to support their families and future kids.

Pull themselves out of poverty and build a solid future.

Giving knowledge won't cost you anything.

What does cost something is giving the ability to share knowledge.

This is where you can help.

Together we can fund the construction of this school. Once it's built, it will be an infinite source of knowledge for hundreds of kids and their families.

You don't need to give much, we just need a lot of people to give a little.

teaching,tarathetarantula,2019/03/17,"If I resign from a private school job, do I have to pay school back for a professional development trip? I work for a private school that pays for teachers to go to professional development. I got approved for a conference that costs about $2150. The plane ticket and conference fee is non-refundable.  The conference is in April and work ends in late May. 

I plan to move with my partner at the end of the year out of state so will not be returning to this job. Even if I came back here, I'd want to find a different job.

Should I tell them this now, and would they make me pay them back for the conference? I don't have experience in private schools to know this answer. Clearly people resign all the time and also go to conferences too

teaching,jobbermedic,2019/03/17,"A friend who is a special needs teacher who wrote this. It made me realize even more how special teachers are and I want to thank you all for being unsung hero’s. A week or two ago I shared a story about a student of mine. I ran into his grandfather at the Dollar General. We got to talking and he told me his wife had cancer again but this time was on hospice. Then he told me she was outside in the car. Said she just needed to get out of the house. Well today I pulled up to that same Dollar General and it made me think of her. I knew she was in pretty bad shape and didn’t have long so I googled her name. I did the same last week and nothing came up. Sadly, this time her obituary appeared. I was heartbroken. But, I was never more thankful that in that moment of conversation with his grandfather that I left everything at the register. She saw us coming and mustered everything she had in her to open that car door with a smile and a hug. I remember I hugged her and said “sweet girl” and we chatted a bit about (her daughter) and about my student. Then we parted ways. I knew it wasn’t going to be long but I was so glad I was able to see them. 

This student’s mother was murdered on a Christmas break and now had lost his grandmother at the beginning of Spring Break. This is why, as tired as I am and as ready for breaks as I am, I ALWAYS worry about my kids during breaks from school. I worry that something will happen and I won’t be there to help in some way whether it be by a hug or encouraging words or whatever it may be. I know they have support systems but sometimes they don’t and need the extra help. It’s kind of hard to explain, but if you teach you probably understand. This is why I tell my parents I’m there for them if they need me, and I mean every bit of it. This is why I’m thankful that I left everything at the register, even my wallet 🤦🏻‍♀️, that day and went out to say hi to her. 

The end of a school year is always more than a welcome time of year for me. It’s the time of year that I hand over control and contact for that student that I’ve poured my heart and soul into. Sometimes never hearing or seeing from them again. In a similar instance, a few months  ago there was a student I always worried about. I googled his name, but his father who shared the same name, came up. He had passed away. He’d struggled for many years with kidney problems and was on dialysis. That led me on a rabbit trail only to find out that my student was in jail. For what, I still don’t know. 

We pour into the students on a daily basis for extended periods of time. We sit down at IEP meetings and share in every struggle and triumph these kids experience. And often time outside life is attached with this. This is why I feel that we don’t only serve and support our students but we do the same for the parents and family’s as well. 

I love my job, I do. But today is a hard day for me. I know I’ll eagerly await my first days and dread the end of the school year for as long as I do this. But more than any test score or achievement level reached, my true sign of success is how my students and my parents think of me and speak of me. I’ll always remember the smile on my students grandma’s face in that dollar general parking lot and how his grandpa said they missed me and reminded his wife that I was the teacher who loved Star Wars.

teaching,broscar_wilde,2019/03/17,"Managing your school population's response to a nearby terror attack I teach high school in New Zealand. 

The massacre in Christchurch are likely to be a topic of conversation around the school for some time. 

It is also likely that some will not treat this topic with the gravitas it deserves and requires. You all know those students - the ones who will say shocking and horrible things and make grim inappropriate jokes. 

* Some of you will have been in that situation and head to endure and manage such behaviour. How did it go? What sort of structures were in place to limit or prevent such individuals being free to trigger another student who perhaps was touched by the tragedy?

Personally, I think I'll be asking my hub to consider what the right thing to do in that situation is. I hope to guide them into supporting each other in standing up when such comments are made, telling the speaker that what they said was inappropriate, and asking them to leave or leaving themselves and reporting the behaviour.

They also stated that they would send me a letter in the mail if I don’t hear from them.,3.464550810014728,4.492329092783507,4.5338733431516935,87.23804123711342,72.50515463917526,8.841826215022092,25.19734904270987,9.23628265651192,1.7442854197349038,370,11,82,8,7,121,64,97,0.0,0.944,0.056,0.6124,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,6,3,3,2,0,0,9,0,9,0,0,1,0,12,14,6,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,7,6,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,4,7,3,13,2,14,5,2,18,0,0,1,0,16,7,0,1,8,65,20,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18035230317880915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14544500178114886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3994965146525571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20612581245364076,0.5754944838977929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18915971425639627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25418312507501883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20045702910620186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995825747960975,0.1893842443473729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21339725784963506,0.0,0.2286470058995701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17934657383434133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2027741068636923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16020652682115774,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,kutuup1989,2019/03/18,"Students who don't try to solve problems by themselves? Hi all,

I'm in my second year of teaching university games development, and I feel like I really messed up by being too soft on the students in my first year of teaching. I kind of got a reputation for being too helpful, I suppose. I all went pretty well that year, and the outgoing students graduated with good grades in general, and did some amazing work. They would come to me for help a lot, but I never minded, because they would always come to me with new features they'd added to their projects, but just couldn't quite get working, so I could show them where they went wrong and point them in the right direction. I often wrote up pseudo-code for them to take away and implement into actual code, too. I had a really great time with them, and they worked really hard to make use of the tips I gave them.

&amp;#x200B;

The new students coming into year 2 (where my modules start) this year, however, are quickly becoming exasperating. They just don't TRY. They don't do ANYTHING unless you hold their hand outside of maybe drawing some sketches or 2D sprites or whatever. It's reached the point now where the same DAY they are set an assignment, they will start emailing me asking for ""pointers"" on where to start. Even assignments set by other lecturers. The thing is, for most of their assignments, they cover most of the concepts needed in order to complete them, and in many cases, the assignments are set with pre-written code that they simply need to read, modify and expand on. I know this because I took the EXACT same course they are taking 10 years ago, at the same university. Many of the lecturers who are now my colleagues are the same lecturers who taught me back when I was a student, so I know their teaching style. They don't leave students in the lurch.

&amp;#x200B;

It's to the point where the cohort have approaching ZERO aptitude for programming (on a games development course!), and little interest in learning it. If they are set a programming based assignment (several of which are required to pass the course), they just immediately shut down and coming to me for help (presumably in the hopes that I'll do it for them). If I say to them that they need to attempt the assignment for themselves before coming to me for help, they start bullshitting me, and blatantly. It's kind of insulting to be honest. They'll stay quiet for a couple of weeks, then, when I check in with them, they'll invariably say ""oh, I tried it, but my work got corrupted"" or ""oh, I started, but I got a compiler error, so I deleted it all"". (You got a compiler error so you deleted all your code??? Jesus, that's like a medical student saying their patient coughed so they killed them!) The excuse typically always results in a flimsy story explaining that they tried, but tragedy struck somehow and they're now back at square one, so could I help them get started?   


I suppose I made a rookie mistake by getting a reputation for being ""soft"", but I was soft with my first group because they TRIED, they always came to me with valid and high effort attempts they'd made at making something work, so I didn't mind spending time with them to help them get it working and explain why their attempt didn't work. Usually they had just gone wrong on a few steps in their logic, or coded themselves into a corner trying to reinvent the wheel because they weren't aware there was a simpler way to solve a problem. You know? Teachable problem solving.   


The cohort this year just don't seem to want to try at all. As soon as work hits their desk they're asking for help on ""where to start"" or asking to meet you to ""go over"" every step of what they want to implement. If you don't meet with them, they just sit there and do nothing. We're reaching the end of semester 2, and currently, I'm not sure I can pass ANY of them for my classes without being VERY generous with my grading. They just haven't tried to help themselves at all. I've given them tips, I've nudged them towards the answers where I can, but I can't sit down and do their work for/with them. That's not how this works, and they haven't even tried outside of when they're being led by the hand.  


So, sorry for the essay, but my question is, if I can't pass any of them, should I fail the whole class?? How would that reflect on me? Ultimately, I'm not willing to pass students who haven't tried, and who haven't attempted anything outside of when I'm holding their hand. That won't fly in a work environment, so I'd be doing them no favours by passing them.   


What in the hell can I do to make it clear to them that my help is not unconditional and free on tap? They have to do this for themselves.",7.288089933993401,6.667245532453251,7.07461289878988,78.07086324257426,63.97249724972498,10.039246424642462,34.00900715071507,9.2995712137729,2.8732861936193617,3715,137,713,56,48,1177,337,909,0.091,0.81,0.099,0.6437,2,0,1,0,0,0,131.0,0,7,63,21,46,25,3,0,48,0,65,5,3,10,11,138,124,56,1,21,30,0,8,2,0,9,2,4,0,0,34,39,0,3,13,4,3,20,24,11,1,5,24,13,120,15,121,78,17,120,2,1,1,0,104,52,1,19,41,496,154,45,0.0,0.0,0.049049842852455006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044555485037417616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546956441080395,0.10892077918744328,0.1221511026491168,0.06836169216552254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272501631893263,0.0,0.1409685250298327,0.0,0.04722413334539445,0.07729892774511897,0.0,0.1225604460159675,0.055511993321113035,0.04277046443593949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0574879568990323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21648740873113592,0.05270023475281081,0.0,0.0,0.08026249446241114,0.055615513122476964,0.0,0.032415744748948316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04451846707856493,0.0,0.0,0.06639702366161122,0.0,0.0423490953237827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0254146930764636,0.035908194009912416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550807093634342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504224001690113,0.0,0.02856585729669757,0.04215856811185436,0.16080097980564487,0.05541559293173332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045026147463797565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30321457056028006,0.053106058030564965,0.0,0.049922912754867474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05560902200336473,0.1046832248074078,0.0828703758175473,0.0,0.0,0.05322169945182851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04911233172942395,0.050377146910899034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04273215834234202,0.0,0.09512091795341224,0.10065366025809876,0.10191842813552617,0.05049635663860751,0.0,0.0,0.050635103043122964,0.0,0.0,0.10150344214411484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11180905691674364,0.0387662446031989,0.09708943962261876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048229102694888726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03405979110724225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425455223939014,0.0,0.0,0.051135963493006135,0.0,0.14428590096610727,0.0,0.0,0.056306528578923425,0.053461329331509766,0.05027701740111118,0.0,0.09660009293422453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0429246821229975,0.0,0.11991445607241068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04575792562473138,0.0,0.05678335249759845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03869523282865574,0.0,0.05626577842177946,0.2490369289064989,0.0535741130637081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04737267417807108,0.0,0.07558366605376818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033392779765545916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05861800346307783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0558445039481485,0.34125559684156825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0434114526871426,0.05535805090904099,0.041472581721531766,0.0592933293745499,0.0398967595807188,0.0403182799970677,0.0,0.04519284684447202,0.09318937929991918,0.0453549144307261,0.05611730829194071,0.0,0.04845213879824893,0.0,0.4025160155580464,0.0,0.0,0.10711706453201654,0.10991030852896984,0.1221511026491168,0.2265759409994009

teaching,btjammer,2019/03/18,"Teacher Contract Question (MI) I am moving to Michigan this summer and am in the process of looking for teaching jobs. I am trying to do this ASAP so that I can buy a house (need confirmation of income) before moving.

If I accept a job now, could I accept a job later (let’s say June) without an issue? Is there a specific process I would have to go through?

I have no reference as I currently teach in Maryland and everything here is county based vs district so this doesn’t really come up.

teaching,firedphysteacher69,2019/03/18,"I Miss My Old School So I used to teach physics at a great high school. The kids were smart; I was paid well, and I had some really hot coworkers. Seriously, some of them looked like Ashley Graham, Emily Ratajowski, and Kim Kardashian. There was also this really hot counselor who I wanted to get with, but sadly she was already married to the most buff football coach at the school.

My first semester was okay but then things went to shit after my girlfriend broke up with me. I really missed my hot GF and her sugar so things went to shit. I crashed my car and had to use porn and weed to get over her. 

Additionally, teachers aren't paid that much so I had to coach, tutor and pimp on the side. I was so overwhelmed with everything that I called in sick to work 6 days a week and went high when I did show up. 

I was fired the next year when I was watching a hot video of a foxy lady, and man, oh my god.....whewwwww! I couldn't wait till I got home! Sadly a student saw me watching it and I guess she reported me because I was fired for that and having weed in my cabinets :')

I tried to teach at a charter school, but it sucked ass and I quit! HELP! I HAVE NO INCOME AND HAVE TO LIVE OFF OF MY GIRLFRIEND'S MONEY! I HAVE NOTHING FROM THE OLD SCHOOL: ALL OF MY STUDENTS UNFRIENDED ME ON FB AFTER I WAS FIRED AND IT WIPED THE HOT COUNSELORS' NUMBERS FROM MY PHONE AND LAPTOP! 

How can I get back to the old school?

teaching,YearsBehind,2019/03/18,"Kids I've had for years hurt me, no gratitude or basic decency after all these years. So, I teach a group of seniors I had in previous grades. All seniors must do a senior project. They took advantage of my goodwill over the year by not doing most of the work. Even so, our admin wants high grad rates so yes, I cut them a break. Again.

teaching,bigsteve634,2019/03/18,"Teaching Resume I’ve been at my current position for 5 years and I’m hoping to move out of my current district at the end of the year. Long story short is I started this position as a temporary substitute, which turned into a long-term substitute for the rest of the semester, and then I was hired full time afterwards. I’ve never had to really apply for a teaching position or even looked for one, so I’m really nervous about writing my resume/cover letter.

What sort of items do principals look for? Is a cover letter required? Do any of y’all have a template that I could take examples from? (I teach in Louisiana, if that makes any difference)

Thanks in advance.

I’m at my second placement which is a ordinary comprehensive secondary school, my first placement was at a college. I kind of enjoyed my first placement but never really settled in but I am not enjoying my second placement. It’s nothing in particular, the kids are pretty normal (some behavioural issues) and the staff are all nice enough but I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression for a while now and I feel like this course is making everything worse. I’m not sure if after I’ll even want to be a teacher but I also feel that if I quit that’s a year of my life wasted.

teaching,KauKau223,2019/03/18,"How would I go about getting an obviously incompetent teacher fired? (Idk where else to go and I really need answers.) 10th grade student, currently complaining about my geometry teacher.

Now, I know you guys might’ve read this far and said “oh, probably just a bad student” I’m not. I swear. I actually have good reasons as to why this teacher shouldn’t be in our school. I’m pretty well off in my other classes, but currently I’m dropping a 54% in geometry. 

-From what I know, over half of her students are close to/are failing (she herself said this)

-I have sat down for the past 3 weeks, agonizingly listening to her lectures on how to do the lesson. Sometimes it kind of makes sense, but most times it just doesn’t.

-Everyone I’ve talked to (mostly other sophomores, but also juniors and seniors who are pretty well off in other classes) have said she’s a horrible teacher. 

I don’t know what else to do. I’ve sat down for the past five days attempting to understand an entire chapter of bookwork and I’m only almost halfway through it. Most of it I cheated on, I didn’t want it but I seriously don’t know what else to do. I just got accepted to an AVP program and if I don’t pass this semester I’m going to get denied. 

I know teachers get tenure, and that makes them really hard to get fired (which I think is absolutely batshit crazy, because horrible teachers could get tied to positions they know nothing about and have the ability to stay there for years) but if anyone has any advice? Go for it.

teaching,The_2nd,2019/03/19,"[Help/advise] Student has made false accusation and now put on leave. Looking for advise on this matter as I am completly baffled and flustered.

Today I was told that a student(female) has accussed me (male) of  touching them inappropriately.  I was then told I would be put on leave until the investigation was over.  I was also told not to contact any of my co-workers while the investigation was going on. I understand the protocall and everything, though I am just shocked by this and also just feel a little depressed, as well as worried, even though I know I did nothing wrong.

Has anyone else gone through this? How did you keep your hopes up? Were you worried about your reputation being tarnished when you went back?",6.6611452991453,8.203108738461541,6.744871794871795,72.43235042735046,65.46153846153847,8.854700854700855,33.67521367521368,9.150863307647796,3.108034188034188,576,25,96,10,9,184,87,130,0.128,0.8079999999999999,0.064,-0.7455,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,5,1,0,13,5,0,0,5,0,16,0,0,2,0,16,29,16,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,4,4,0,1,3,0,0,5,1,3,1,0,14,3,17,2,17,12,0,19,0,1,1,0,12,7,0,1,7,78,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2353664095303579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007334115902128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10289717421325473,0.15078204941316142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315638513941248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15429368128597531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674805253741347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229326762744157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719730144689344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13225725143094072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0744081420493409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0836339971172942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863774807483493,0.0,0.0,0.14616234682059434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13080190930268307,0.0,0.0,0.08087487917537008,0.0,0.0,0.3116408103772408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14749223577514406,0.0,0.0,0.1235767129889876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13924564726488636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14120327612993866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29587139816421804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28916644593722995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394897688854579,0.4218509296970937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15319797652942613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323138452823486,0.136418105691386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713369185393418,0.2988947378056428,0.0,0.10453771406467788,0.1608955462319605,0.0,0.0
teaching,TimoTimmi,2019/03/19,"Competing with another class in math. Hey.  
With math teachers, we're developing a free to use platform where you can host live math games for your classroom. I've experienced that math is quite uninteresting to kids and I've seen that this game makes them excited. :)

teaching,8mom,2019/03/19,"Texas Alternative Teaching Cert vs Staff Position I recently moved to a rural area in Texas where there is a teacher shortage. I finish my Bachelors in May and would be able to participate in the Alternative Certification Program in Texas (advice on that appreciated).

I’m considering it because I don’t like my field currently and would like something more fulfilling, I’ve worked with kids before. However, I’m torn between this and school administrative positions. I’m curious if anyone here has experience in staff positions and if they prefer them over teaching for any reason. 

General advice for pursuing teaching appreciated :) ",8.389528301886791,10.921686396226416,9.169952830188679,52.91832547169816,62.39622641509435,12.847169811320756,40.60849056603774,12.161744961471696,6.411154716981133,522,29,69,20,8,176,75,106,0.037000000000000005,0.836,0.126,0.8625,2,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,1,0,14,10,6,0,5,3,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,13,6,1,13,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,3,5,43,10,9,0.2491812722821345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.486994110716865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16945180994177156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742333393328298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15189859076623788,0.0,0.2120349096441861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437470984293117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24347476600963305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26484025765711605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25619984898832826,0.2460364449259304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521847507027384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19183191729829385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18140693395602345,0.0,0.0,0.3540224529385205,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,DogCjck88,2019/03/19,"Grade 1 student is a disobedient little fuck OK so I teach grade 1 and there's this kid I really fucking hate, he's a beta manlet with no gains, no lats, no traps, no height, etc. Basically genetic trash and fucking lazy as hell, at his age I had gains out the ass. So I tell him every day fucking neck yourself, chug bleach, rope, eat a bullet, on and on. Sometimes I scream this at him for hours and don't even do any teaching, my whole day is spent screaming at this one kid to fucking noose it up and stop existing. I've had to take sick days from the stress and am in the process of filing a grievance against this kid through my union. It's driving me up the wall with the disobedience. He refuses to off himself when ordered to do so, he just cries like a little bitch. I've told his parents about this behaviour and they're 100% not helpful. I even considered maybe they're poor and don't have room in the budget to buy this kid a rope or a jug of bleach and thought hey maybe I should chip in, so I go out of MY OWN POCKET to the Home Depot and buy top shelf premium quality bleach for this little fuck to swig back, I buy him silky smooth nylon rope not that dollar store twine shit, I send out emails, EVERY DAY FOR A MONTH, with diagrams and instructions and YouTube videos, to all the students, and all the teachers, and all the parents, literally anyone I can think of at work associated with this kid, 4000 words at a time usually, with helpful hints on how to noose oneself. I've even offered to use my benefits and claim this kid as a dependent (highly illegal btw) for physiotherapy in case his little fingers can't tie the noose and he needs more DEX. I'm pulling out all the stops here. Half these kids can't even read because I don't have time to teach them, all day is occupied by this little fuck who disobeys me every single day. What I want to know is how can the law help me to make this kid noose or compensate me for my damages and the damages to the other children his behaviour causes. I'm out of pocket with the rope and the bleach and I've used up most of my sick days, I have to come into work some days still drinking because I can't afford to use a sick day for my hangover. Help a brother out fams.

teaching,cbakes13,2019/03/19,"Young professional female looking to make a career change into teaching. Any advice? Hi there, I’m hoping to just get some candid advice as I don’t personally know any teachers. I’m a 23 year old woman looking to get into teaching. This is a big decision as I live in one of the most expensive places in the country and am currently making $80k a year in tech sales. I’m aware following this dream would result in a pay cut and lifestyle change. I have enough in my savings to take two years off of work and be ok. I can’t help that I want a career change into something that I feel truly matters, utilizes my creativity and enjoyment of people young and old. I had a tough home life and school is where I always felt safe and I owe so much of my life to the amazing teachers I had throughout. I know it’s not an easy job but I would say I’m hard working at anything I put my mind to.  Does anyone out there have some advice to help me make this decision?

teaching,dckveg,2019/03/19,"[Help] Suddenly Science I've been working in a charter school since October as a building sub and just got told that in two weeks (when our new cycle starts) that I will be teaching middle school 6-8 science. I have a curriculum written already from the school, but my big questions are about behavior.

These kids can be pretty wild, and I'll have a chance to reset the classroom right when I take over. I'm looking for ideas to keep the discipline to a minimum and have the kids end the year successfully. 

So far, my only idea is to do a 5 minute meditation/focus activity at the start of class. I know another teacher does this with the 6th grade group at the end of the day and it's pretty successful. 

Any other ideas so that I don't lose my mind?",4.087895057962175,5.4159178993288615,5.056485661989019,82.93602806589386,71.34899328859059,8.371201952410006,28.9816961561928,8.841846274778883,2.2307395973154365,593,23,118,11,11,194,103,149,0.0,0.8390000000000001,0.161,0.9773,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,1,0,0,4,6,3,0,0,15,0,12,0,0,0,0,15,22,10,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,7,5,0,2,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,4,1,9,2,16,15,0,20,0,1,1,0,7,9,0,1,11,70,16,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16047350740513175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888992193280467,0.15248452441254615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09378323929886354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12725716655387834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.257596182570082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116304876576172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09747130548232692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4924811278249112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925510880115232,0.0,0.0,0.07991849173166526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12211535418583312,0.1626866894354785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14683175842456486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14044659809668614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059771944565457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2958868499356711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16290258591010148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12418705066152552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4415154429723801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202921181331996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2058566651904549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10933700730161236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13895410779692294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420532547750365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166463683116908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10586678031438597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936450827420012

teaching,Malarazz,2019/03/20,"How long would it take to get a license from Arizona or Utah? So I've been planning a career change and researching teaching Math at international schools. As such, I've also been researching the easiest states to get a license that is acceptable to international schools, as an alternative to the expensive TeacherReady / TeachNow programs. As far as I've seen, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Utah are among the easiest.

I'm a US citizen but I don't currently live in the US. If I go back and step off the plane tomorrow, how long would it take me to go through the whole process in Arizona? How about Utah? And is it easy to renew the license in those states if I live abroad?

Massachusetts seems very quick for a provisional license, but I would be afraid of not being able to renew after 5 years, specially with the upcoming July 1 changes that I don't fully understand.",6.934629629629626,7.670698141975311,7.1897283950617314,72.36977777777777,64.49382716049382,10.924444444444443,37.80493827160494,10.793553405168565,4.282837530864197,697,35,124,18,10,226,94,162,0.0,0.932,0.068,0.8504,1,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,2,0,0,1,9,3,0,1,14,0,12,0,0,3,0,20,22,18,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,6,5,0,0,3,0,1,3,3,1,0,0,3,1,8,2,24,14,1,20,0,0,1,0,3,7,0,4,8,83,14,8,0.1660118187362613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13275959146497004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276528413101664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3512369836826973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734686468091221,0.0,0.1886966846633628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2931829548432626,0.2938304709886289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336025647018208,0.0,0.1511309248096283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2496404545278193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17282415802568796,0.3993835548872216,0.0,0.0,0.13697713662155936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853462669952012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3537900987554072,0.0,0.0,0.1069061683548736

teaching,jessith,2019/03/21,"Tenure Last night the board approved me for my tenure! I honestly didn't think I'd make it this long. The first couple of years we're rough but I'm glad I've stuck through it. I remember thinking of quitting so many times. Nowhere near perfect but I think I'm getting the hang of things and don't feel so overwhelmed. If you're new and struggling, keep with it! It will get easier!!

teaching,jephilmykes,2019/03/21,"Reasons Why I Would Be a Good Mod 1) I teach music to a bunch of Title 1 kids so I know how rough teaching is and can thus empathize with how tough all of our lives are. 

2) I have prior moderation experience and am mod of r/Teachers so I know how to mod well. Everyone there loves me because I kick all the trolls out while providing informative advice to the teachers there. 

3) I once banned 69 trolls in one day from r/teachers. Imagine what I could do here.

I just took my NES Subtest 2 yesterday for the second time and did not pass again. I have been using the study guide on the NES site. Can anyone offer a better study guide to use? I can take the test again in another 30 days and want to use my time wisely. Thank you.

teaching,Razza_Beatz,2019/03/21,"PE Teacher - Should we be able to do it all? As someone looking to go into PE teaching I often wonder if I should be able to perform a skill i.e dribbling a basketball, at a high or at least average level.

Specializing in Football (Soccer), I am quite one dimensional in my sporting ability. While I understand the correct technique for other sporting skills, I am unable to perform them at a level perhaps expected.

Should we as PE teachers be able to perform all skills taught in lesson to a high standard or is simply understanding the coaching and technical points of a skill enough?

Interested to hear your thoughts as this is something I am quite conscious of.

teaching,hamsandwich4459,2019/03/21,"Can't get kids to read...What's your secret I teach sophomores, and it seems like no matter what I do, kids (not all) will ignore or halfass assigned reading.  Even if I give them the stick and whack them with reading quizzes, half won't read.

Then I thought, enough with the stick, let's motivate them with the carrot and give them choice with what to read!  I did lit circles and let kids choose what they wanted to read from a list of a dozen ""contemporary"" books.  Still, half wouldn't read.

Then I thought, maybe books are too long?  Kids in this day and age, nothing can't hold their attention for longer than 30 seconds, right?  I gave them short stories and still kids would try to get by not reading. 

Then I thought, am I just being too hard on ourselves?  Should I be happy with the half that are reading and engaging with texts?  The kids that don't do anything may never do anything regardless of what I'm doing, right?  But those are the kids we all bust our asses trying to reach. 

So what's your secret, English teachers?  How have you gotten kids to actually open a book and read?

teaching,teachingpeopleart,2019/03/21,"Attacked by student, student making false accusations I (23 F) am a recent college graduate and new teacher. 2 weeks into filling a maternity leave position I was attacked by a middle school student from behind after school while I was grading (I was choked until unconscious and subsequently fell and hit my head). I received physical injuries (a laceration through my brow) and have suffered psychological trauma. I went to the hospital as soon as a could, contacted my principal with details and photos, and filed a police report the same afternoon. The student was charged with aggravated battery and kidnapping (he would not leave the room after I regained consciousness).

I got a call from DCFS this week because the student is falsely accusing me of being sexually abusive to justify why he attacked me. I don't have the specifics of what he or his parent are claiming. I did not do anything and I understand that this is part of the procedure, but I am still worried sick. I am just starting my career and don't want this to ruin any chances of future employment or tarnish my reputation. A union rep will be attending the interview with me next week but I wanted to hear whether or not anyone thinks that is enough.

teaching,legallylaur,2019/03/22,"Suggestions for supplemental material for interview??? Hi reddit! 
(Forewarned, this is my first created post so here goes:) 
I have an interview at a charter school for a full-time high school English position next week and am asked to bring some lesson plan samples, curriculum plans, and resume. 

At my last interview, I was asked a lot of questions about classroom management, teaching/educational philosophies, and extra-curricular activities. Do y’all think I should include documents with these things too? 

For background, I am intern eligible and still enrolled in a credential program. So green? Yeah, just a bit. 🤣

Thanks in advance!

teaching,VeryVeryVeryAnxious,2019/03/22,"Teacher burn out - will I experience it? I keep wondering if I should get a teaching certificate for teaching in K-12, but I’m really intimidated by the workload. I want a job with a good work/life balance and I’m scared of burning out. I don’t mind prep work, but I don’t really like the idea of spending all my free time grading papers, and answering emails to parents and students. 

How do other teachers handle it? How can I know if I will likely burn out or not? How many teaching hours per week do teachers in the US usually have? I’ve felt paralyzed with indecision and don’t know if I should stay on this track or go for a corporate career.

I’ve been teaching for a couple years now, first as a summer camp instructor, then teaching English in South Korea, and now teaching ESL at a language school in California. It’s been amazing and I’ve loved every second of it. It’s fulfilling, I love the connections I make with the students, and I’m GOOD at it - but I’m seriously unsure of whether to move forward with it career wise or not.


Since I like public speaking and instructor type roles, other titles I’ve been looking at and applying for in the mean time are:

teaching,DuskGideon,2019/03/22,"Are there any schools that teach practical subject matter? Maybe I'm being an arm chair general here, but I think the quality of education in the USA could be improved by teaching people more practical things.

Schools should start with curriculum teaching children techniques to study and learn.   I'm pretty sure this ""sharpening of the saw""will pay off in significantly improved grades, leading to more school funding.

I also figure that feeding kids more practical, applies to real life, courses is a great way to keep them in school longer if you spread it out over a greater amount of time.

General in home maintenance, like replacing a toilet gasket.   Budgeting.  Resume writing. How to eat a balanced diet.   How to recognize addiction.   How to get along with people who are just mega assholes.  How to recognize when a news segment about a scientific study is fundamentally flawed(like how the study saying eggs might lower cholesterol but only compared them to sausage McMuffins....like what? Lol).  Just create curriculum that gives kids a really practical reason to stay all four years in highschool.  I'm pretty sure it's do-able.

Am I just way offbase here?

teaching,bobapop396,2019/03/22,"An overheard, lovely moment I'm off sick at the moment with the flu (UK based). On my way back from the doctor's surgery I was walking past a big group of boys on their lunch break from a 'challenging' secondary school really close to where I live but don't teach at. They were walking side by side, taking up the whole of the pavement, talking really loudly, jostling each other, etc. 
I'll be honest I was getting ready to roll my eyes at what I assumed was going to be a typical encounter with a group of boisterous 'ladz'. 

But as I got closer it was clear they were discussing who they had crushes on and they were being lovely about these girls: ""I think Nadine is the most beautiful."" 
""Ah yeah that's fair mate and she's funny.""
I had walked past them by that point and couldn't hear anything else but it was refreshing to hear students talking about each other like that and to hear these boys using nice, respectful language instead of the crude comments I've gotten used to overhearing.
Restored my faith a little bit and thought it was a nice thing to share.

I saw on facebook that his best friend died, but I didn't reach out or comment.  I then got a message from him asking if I was there. . I had thought "" wow I must have made an impression on him all those years ago since he is reaching out to me in this difficultI thought he must be reaching out to process the death.  I messaged back saying I heard about his friend and hoped he was ok. He then said he wanted to show me something he thought I would like. Normally this sends up a red flag, but considering I was his art teacher,  his counselor,  and his best friend had died, I figured it was relevant to the  context and said ok. He then sent me  picture of his erection.  I replied that it saddened me that he did that, and he should never do that to anyone again and blocked him. I  don't know what I did to give him the impression that I would ever have any interest in that,  nor have I interacted with him since he graduated in 2011. Has anyone else ever had this happen?  I'm a little freaked out.

teaching,P0Iar_bear,2019/03/23,"Accepted a job offer to teach 9th/10th grade English, but I’ve only experienced elementary levels. Hi fellow teachers! 

I’m in a weird situation.

Little background: I was hired as a kindergarten interventionist but due to a teacher’s illness I was pulled to take over her class (kinder) until the end of the school year.

I applied to teach summer school and got a random phone call from the assistant principal asking if I’d be interested in teaching high school English (since I have supplemental authorizations in English and Social Science with my Multiple Subject Credential) and accepted the offer thinking it would be a great learning experience but also help my resume look good, and of course the great pay that comes along with it. I’ve only ever taught kinder and 4th grade for student teaching, any advice on how to best handle 9th and 10th graders? 

TLDR; only ever experienced elementary school while teaching, accepted a job offer to teacher 9th/10th grade English for summer school. Advice?

Does anyone know exactly what classes would be included in the calculating your content area GPA for a biology specialization? Eg. Would it be strictly biology classes or biology/math or biology/math/physics/chemistry?

teaching,pupbooboo,2019/03/23,"I gave a speech about my struggles with concurrent disorder to an Abnormal Psychology class and then... I gave a speech to an Abnormal Psychology class on the importance of med compliance, avoiding substances, and attending and participating in therapy.  I am schizoaffective with 118 days clean and sober today by the Grace of God.  The class was so grateful for my speech and honesty and truth that the professor suggested the class raise $100 for me to take the CBEST -- the California credentialing examination to enter a teaching program at a university.

I was nervous but I prayed for the courage to be honest and tell them the realities of living with concurrent disorders.  God gave me courage and in return now I can afford to take a test that will allow me to apply to a credentialing program at a college or university.  LOVE IN, LOVE OUT.

Thanks for reading my story.  God is good.

teaching,AvailableRange,2019/03/24,"Need the name/idea behind of an old educational theory Back in the mid 1960's we were subjected to a form of education which didn't work at all. I would like to know who came up with the idea and why, just to better understand my life.
They combined the first and second grade classes, and, with minimal supervision, the second graders were supposed to teach the first graders to read.
Needless to say, this did not go well. I didn't learn to read till third grade.

teaching,tacos41,2019/03/24,"The secret to not getting stressed in this profession Sorry for the click-bait-ey title, but I just wanted to share how I keep my stress levels low in this profession. 

I truly believe that teaching is a field in which it is literally impossible to do all that is expected of you. Early in my teaching career, I realized that a lot of my stress was self-inflicted because I was trying to complete every single administrative initiative with perfection. However, after while, many of these initiatives were never revisited. I also deduced that some of these initiatives are not even the “choice” of our campus principal, but something that is pushed down from central admin. So, our campus principals do their duty by asking teachers to do it, but even they never plan to have “initiative x” be an ongoing thing. They are just CYAing by presenting it to the staff so that they can say (to their superiors) that they did. 

There is just a lot of stress and confusion around expectations since we don’t even know what is important to our campus level principals, because their own initiatives get muddled with initiatives from central admin or people over their head. They also sometimes will implement initiatives they can’t even enforce. 

This is especially prevalent in the start-of-year inservice, where admin is dumping expectations on teachers from all the books they read and conferences they traveled to over the summer. In the past, inservice week used to really stress me out. However, now, because of this personal rule I have, inservice is stress free. Here is the rule:

**Don’t worry about any initiatives until admin follows up on them a second time.** 

For example, say you have a staff meeting, and principle drops “initiative y” on you. Don’t sweat it, don’t lift a finger, don’t even try it until it is followed up upon. Then, when it is, you just say “man, I’ll be honest, things have been crazy and I haven’t gotten to it yet, but I’ll tackle that this week.” Then, do it. **This part is important: don’t argue with your principal or tell them that you think the initiative is stupid – if they followed up on it, just do it.** In my experience, it is difficult for admin to get upset with a teacher if the teacher isn’t argumentative. 

My experience is limited to one (large) district and two schools, but I have found this rule to serve me really well. I have saved myself from countless “stress-outs” by just delaying implementation of some of these expectations, just to find that they are never followed up upon. Let me know what you think!

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr - Don't do stuff until you are asked a second time. Then, do it with enthusiasm/positivity.

teaching,lightningspree,2019/03/24,"Why do we accept that this is an unhealthy job? Title is an exaggeration, but I’ve been thinking...

Why on earth does the teaching community treat the level of burnout and the insurmountable workload of this profession as “normal”? Why do we look down on people who pursue a healthy work/life balance, as if its a race to see who can burn themselves out the fastest? Why does this profession have to BE this way? 

Or, does it? Maybe there are teachers who do have a healthy “8-hour work day” structure, after which they leave school at school. If they exist, they sure aren’t vocal about it. 

It’s frustrating as a young teacher feeling like I have to choose between a career I love and not having weekly anxiety attacks. It sometimes feels like I’m losing years off my life in the health repercussions of stress. Am I completely off base?

I’m currently an English teacher in France, it’s my first year so this means I’m a teacher in middle school half of the week and during the other half I am still a student doing the second and (amen) last year of my masters. I’m writing a thesis about the use of authentic documents in English classes in middle school compared to the use of modified and/or invented documents, and what students prefer and engage the most with. I’m stuck right now because I can’t find proper documentation/writings on students’ motivation/engagement while studying written and oral documents (of all kinds).... any ideas? Do you know anyone who conducted a research on writing / oral comprehension skills? I can of course rely on English researches even though I write my thesis in french.

teaching,RustDeathTaxes,2019/03/25,"You're Off The List Kid (But Saying It Nicely) Quick Summary: I have a field trip that is going to be highly physical and open a lot of job opportunities for my students. We are allowed to be selective as to who we invite on field trips for reasons like grades and behavior. But the grades excuse falls flat because I am not inviting kids who have A+s due to the fact that they wouldn't cut it or they are just not good kids.  
  
If I was being honest, I would say I am picking the kids who are likely to go into the career field (firefighting), are well behaved, and can physically handle a day of hard training.  
  
So...how do I say to the rest of the class not going that they are not able to handle it or I don't want them embarrassing me?

teaching,LaurelRaido,2019/03/25,"Switching careers and creating a resume At 31 years old and with two young kids I am looking to change careers from retail banking to teaching. Currently, I have a bachelor's degree in theater arts and plan to go back to school in the near future. My plan is to try substituting for a couple local school districts to build my resume and experience but I'm having trouble writing a resume that is appealing to schools since my background is largely supervision and retail work. Also, I've noticed that most of the schools in my area require at least a year of experience working with children to apply. The only time I have worked with kids in a professional environment was ten years ago in college for one semester as a teacher's aide. I feel a bit like I'm caught in a loop of needing experience to get the jobs I need to get experience.

teaching,Andinator,2019/03/25,"I just finished the edTPA and I'm pissed/full of anxiety right now... I don't have anyone that can relate to this feeling so I figured I'd come here and leave my thoughts since they won't get out of my head.  I just finished the edTPA and am so pissed at this bullshit assessment that teachers have to take to prove they're doing their job correctly.  I spent an entire month planning, writing, recording, researching, just to make sure I can get this project done.  What did I get out of it?  A missing $300 from my bank account, an entire month spent coming home from teaching just to come home and work on the project for the rest of the day, and now 3 weeks of anxiety and depression as I wait for my scores to come back.  This level of assessment is almost cruel and the questions themselves barely even relate to teaching.  I came out of the edTPA feeling like I learned nothing from it, because that's exactly what happened.  I'm not a better teacher now that I've taken this, if anything it made me a worse teacher.  There were some days where I wouldn't have plans for teaching simply because I spent so much time working on the project.  This thing has actually been driving me crazy and it fucking sucks because I feel my teaching skills are not being assessed in the slightest.

What's worse is that I'm now suffering from some major anxiety attacks because I feel like I messed something up.  Throughout my careful planning, one requirement slipped through my fingers.  Videos cannot be edited.  You see, what I did was I recorded two of my lessons in full within the classroom.  When I got to task 2, I read each question and selected timestamps of those lessons that would best fit what the question was looking for.  Since the rules stated the two videos together couldn't be more than 20 minutes, I simply cut out the parts that I didn't reference in the questions.  So while the clips that I reference in my task 2 commentary have no edits, the two videos as a whole do.  I'm now dreading the very real possibility that, despite all the work I've put into this project, despite all the hard work I've put into my job as a teacher, that one tiny mistake is now going to blow up in my face.  No matter what I did, it won't matter because the suits that are scoring my assessment probably won't care anyways.  

This edTPA nonsense might actually be the worse form of assessment I've ever seen.  The questions are so vague that it feels like nothing is clearly defined.  There is so much information you have to write down and on top of all of that, the rules and regulations behind it are so strict and minute that it just feels oppressing.  This whole thing is so disconnected to what teaching actually is and I feel so powerless and weak now.  I love this job.  I never dreamed of becoming a teacher growing up, but now that I've been a 5th grade teacher for 2 years already, I can't imagine doing anything else in the near future.  I love creating lessons that are fun for my students, I love laughing with my students and trying to make their day as best as it can be, I love the school that I work at and the people there, this job has had such a positive impact on my life.  Now I'm freaking out that all of that is going to be over because of one horrible, horrible assessment, created by people that have probably never step foot within a classroom.

Anyways, that's it.  I just wanted to vent all of that out since I can't talk to anyone else about this.  Any advice or encouragement would be great since I feel like I'm stuck in a deep hole.  I just want all of this to be over with so I can go back to focusing on what really matter, which is my job.

**TL;DR** The edTPA is an awful test and has been mentally torturing me for a month.  Now I think I fucked up big time and will probably be going through that mental torture again for another 3 weeks.  I love this job and wish a stupid assessment like this didn't get in the way.

teaching,fitzlee,2019/03/25,"New Teacher Summer Prep Hello, all! I have a BA in Drama and 2 MFA's in Acting and Screenwriting.  I'm so excited to get my first teaching job at a local high school in Drama, but I don't know how to ""prepare"" before school starts in August. I feel like I've got all this specific field knowledge but no knowledge of how school or teaching actually works (I homeschooled as a child and never went to high school).  I'm applying to certificate programs but the classes may not start until the Fall, and I've got a few books I'm preparing to go through like ""First Days of School"", but I've never even subbed before. Currently I work full-time at a local community college.

The problem I have with this is that it is almost an hour drive each way for me now. We recently moved and I took the job with short notice, not knowing exactly where we’d be living. 

Our contracts are soon to be released and I know they allow for special reasons for leaving the contract. Do you think moving to a new, closer school district would be a qualifying reason?

To be honest, I'd be alright with moving anywhere in Canada (maybe US as well); I'd just like to ask if people think I can expect some work teaching music/french in 5 years from now.",10.881875,8.323250104166668,10.609583333333333,61.74375000000003,58.375,12.516666666666667,43.79166666666667,10.686352973137794,4.901654166666667,414,19,65,7,4,137,73,96,0.049,0.845,0.106,0.7579,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,0,0,1,5,6,1,1,3,1,7,0,0,1,1,16,13,6,0,4,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,4,4,18,8,3,12,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,3,6,44,5,4,0.2173899938738626,0.0,0.21214127513727146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032302987799976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24009016876928066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24244730761903244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2381401123498635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2296844640666185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10620577021403443,0.0,0.19195934735993708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451095089717706,0.0,0.21839746804743232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310511599139968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15071084979922306,0.18981655752770388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200102796982165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2272632220250089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27858946050228545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26149339610629296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19545971198131684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15826250464250305,0.0,0.0,0.1544276144243618,0.0,0.0,0.2799840572876972

I'm a student and plan on going into elementary education when I graduate high school.

teaching,Rexticles,2019/03/26,"American contemplating doing my PGCE in UK, worried about Brexit implications As the title briefly explains; I've been seriously considering doing my PGCE so that I could return to live in the UK and hopefully work for the next 5 years there.

teaching,soleilazure,2019/03/26,"Rock and a hard place So I have a little kid with a raft of issues including parents without the basic skills we'd hope for, let alone what this dude needs. Last time he was violent at school he was punished physically at home. Which the school reported properly, and we intervene with wellbeing services as well. Today he's done something impulsive that could have injured me and it's been a big palaver.  The course is set, we'll report again if the child or his siblings disclose physical punishment. We have to communicate home about the behaviour as parental compliance for assessment is key to his long term future, and theyre in heavy denial and/or noncompliant and have missed many opportunities and deadlines already, which impacts the child and the school.

It just sucks sitting here thinking he might be hurt for something I feel is 100% out of his control when I could, in theory, not say anything.

Feels like the train track moral dilemma!

Thanks in advance for any encouragement, advice, resources, stories, whatever you want to share with me as I try to figure this out really, god bless :) ",7.314397163120568,8.415516609929078,7.927092198581562,66.13333333333334,63.751773049645394,10.805673758865249,34.106382978723396,10.746095033038511,4.012693617021276,626,26,100,16,9,208,102,141,0.034,0.71,0.256,0.9909,2,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,2,0,3,3,7,0,0,5,0,11,2,0,2,0,23,25,10,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,6,6,0,1,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,5,2,9,7,22,18,1,13,1,0,1,2,9,7,0,5,4,64,15,8,0.16866497610379402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3296349251871025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3440939025571707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3452056595662193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812048862406485,0.16179881399790885,0.0,0.14146817970027228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19009768626605775,0.0,0.11305257817726468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16737396335025975,0.1499171804485847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748446693907626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14163610056747844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30445345210799624,0.0,0.11258518125428613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1789268857409679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12506294263481113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827731466184278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693105752934432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3241533078169049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15528404914217378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080737062940696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11451244731467038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09948297286486404,0.0,0.13529287011593868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16258701814034926,0.0,0.12279011139373225,0.0,0.0,0.1198147597895606,0.0,0.0,0.10861471471238343

teaching,CptnKitten,2019/03/27,"Car window damage at school site? One of the days I was subbing at a school my front car window got a 6-inch crack in it, big enough to probably get a ticket for. 

The window didn't not have a crack when I parked at the school site in the morning. It was there when I came out after school ended. 

I've already started telling the school details and asking if they had a video of what happened. They asked if I filed a police report, which I did not. I do have a pics as evidence of the damage. 

Should I file a police report even if I don't know whether it was an accident or not? 

I'm not looking to sue or anything, I just want to find out what happened and have student(s) face consequences of their actions if it was on purpose.

teaching,conundruumm,2019/03/27,"How much should I charge for tutoring? I don’t know if this is the place to ask, but I am a college student studying mathematics with a concentration in education in New York State. I privately tutor an eighth grade boy in algebra. The job is pretty easy and I really like the boy, but I only make $10/hr. I know this rate is low but I let the boy’s mom set the price a while back. I recently started tutoring another college student in discrete structures. I told her I’m charging $15/hr and she was shocked, but happy. Apparently she was previously paying someone $60/hr. That strikes me as absurdly high, but makes me wonder, how much do tutors normally charge? How much should I charge in the future?",2.077218225419664,4.568029143884897,4.153496402877701,81.78904556354918,81.3021582733813,7.735443645083933,27.252278177458034,8.648137234880735,2.4388470983213426,557,25,107,14,15,190,88,139,0.065,0.8059999999999999,0.129,0.8905,2,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,10,0,11,0,0,5,0,20,20,13,0,4,6,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,16,2,9,14,3,16,0,1,0,0,9,8,0,2,7,65,19,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072448286707007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18476855369070194,0.0,0.0,0.15197446818307667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21039354246159864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20881958293410724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961291494882559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.217237705798124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021022956211252,0.0,0.09655787878999844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2638550871640097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23147587583827256,0.0,0.0,0.4358687465995362,0.0,0.0,0.19088383737343792,0.0,0.0,0.1936471582708467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15031561731387752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20649378314066288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2010729277514345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12661450103182115,0.0,0.1951475926350428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16746139205535834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398919971468508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1888553633518364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21433427569966546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Thediciplematt,2019/03/27,"Holberton for Prof Dev For those of you who want to “up your game” in the classroom or are interested in career dev that may lead to a FTE position outside of the teaching world, I found this interesting opportunity.

Edsurge is a great site for edtech jobs with and outside of K12, and they sent info about a program that basically puts you in a 2 year development program (for free), teaches the skill set you want to learn (e.g programming) and then charges only AFTER you find a job.

I don’t know much more than that, and already have a pretty sweet role in Instructional Design from teaching, but thought it would be worth something to somebody here.

I am not associated with them in anyway. If you have experience then please share, but it looks interesting.

teaching,JaniPar1795,2019/03/28,"Yes, your child is always in trouble. No, I don’t hold a grudge against them. I’m a daycare teacher and one of my students parents now believes that I’m unnecessarily harsh with her daughter and I have a grudge against her simply because I won’t let her act up in my class and I tell her mom when she does. She thinks we “but heads” and that maybe she needs another teacher that can work with her better. The reality is she has no respect for authority or others unless they are threatening to her. She only responds to punishment and yelling and I refuse to do that. My approach is to talk our emotions and empower students which requires addressing as many issues as I’m able to in real time. My entire class is full of kids with extreme emotional issues, special needs, and behavioral issues. I’ve seen them improve tremendously through my methods. 

I know that I need to get used to this types of conversations because I’m pursuing a bachelors to be a credentialed teacher. I just don’t understand how parents can’t see their kid’s behavior is an ongoing issue. It’s complete denial.

teaching,kyle-leon,2019/03/28,"Help with Creating PD Hi everyone!

I've been recommended to my district's school board to plan PD seminars/events/sessions for my school this upcoming year. I've never done this before, so this is all new territory for me. I'm starting to get some materials together, but I wanted to pick Reddit's brilliant teacher hive-mind. Here are my questions/concerns:

\-What are some general things that I should definitely **avoid** in PD sessions?  
\-What are some general things that I should definitely **include** in PD sessions?   
\-What are some helpful resources, books, websites, podcasts, etc... that would help in planning these sessions?

Just some context: we're a VERY small (350-400 students from k-12), mid- to low-performing rural school. In grades 7-12, we have around 23 teachers with relatively high teacher turn around. We're commonly staffed with teachers from a program similar to TFA. Administration is super supportive of its teachers, and teachers are generally on-board with school initiatives.

My placement with my current teacher ends soon and he has been everything you could ask for and more in a cooperating teacher. What can I do for him/give him that will be meaningful?

I already plan to write a letter of thanks, but I’d like to give a gift too! I was thinking either aTPT gift card or favorite candy, soda, and movie gift card.

Any other suggestions?

teaching,nikoko13,2019/03/28,"Write (and code) interactive stories - Looking for Partnerships Hi everyone,

I am looking for any teachers interested in developing and/or implementing curriculum where students can write (and code) interactive stories from a library of over 8,000 beautiful illustrations and sounds. There's fun illustrations from space dinos, to deep sea creatures, to food, and tons of characters. Stories on Elementari can be 'coded' by connecting blocks to have characters animate, play sounds or voiceovers, or even create a choose your own adventure. Using Elementari is **free** and any user can create a classroom of up to 30 students (no emails needed) for free as well. 

![video](nfonzecu1uo21)

Let me know if you or anyone you know would be interested in partnering with us. All curriculum developed will be part of our open educational resources and made publicly available.   


You can take a look at our **curriculum guide** that has more information and some example lessons: [https://www.elementari.io/files/ElementariCurriculumGuide.pdf#view=FitV](https://www.elementari.io/files/ElementariCurriculumGuide.pdf#view=FitV)

&amp;#x200B;

**Our mission** is to promote arts and literacy in an engaging and collaborative way and have students build computation thinking skills as a consequence of making a beautiful story that they can be proud to share. 

&amp;#x200B;

teaching,ashleynorman99,2019/03/29,"Questions about my decision to major in education as a shy person I'm a freshman education major with an emphasis in STEM and I am wanting to teach middle school math. I have had a small amount of experience tutoring friends in math and being a study buddy with two middle school math students during my senior year of high school and have enjoyed those experiences. I truly believe that this is what I want to do as my career but I'm concerned with a few things. First, I am pretty shy-even more shy as I get older. I am typically okay with small groups of people but concerned about my ability to teach a whole classful of students. I believe that I will enjoy everything else about the job (I have always enjoyed planning and math), but I am unsure about me being able to get out of my shell. Even some of my friends the other day asked how I could be a good teacher if I was so introverted. Is there anybody who was very introverted when they started teaching, but then were able to adjust to standing in front of a class all day? Another question (unrelated) is should I go for my master's degree and if so, should I do so during my first year of teaching (taking classes online) or should I get my master's and then get a teaching job?",7.824201101928374,6.664509533057853,8.170867768595045,72.400544077135,63.173553719008254,10.380716253443527,35.86914600550964,9.2995712137729,3.2206683195592287,985,38,180,14,12,326,126,242,0.027000000000000003,0.831,0.142,0.9809,2,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,5,11,7,0,0,12,1,24,0,0,1,1,31,36,23,0,8,7,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,1,8,11,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,4,0,27,7,32,24,8,25,0,0,0,0,9,10,0,6,12,133,35,22,0.25647581292807603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10670421110257937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1344686261965863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988513169897705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2889604133296553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102387533498115,0.0,0.0,0.16540568162399408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071263157219536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16939985555799358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11525196150193465,0.25088255889365085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21815819545589168,0.0,0.0,0.1981525768524696,0.0,0.26799605321223435,0.0,0.07288055748722695,0.10755987173577262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13549038892888568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545126694639614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890401768391679,0.11197239355776092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130464053233495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28731160772667097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3893508229100549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09076745023212836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09641894625658322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519556686445155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526980091876894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10580970299285376,0.15127607952415786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14317304292744054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16516201463584695
teaching,DogPebnis1488,2019/03/29,"Ethical dilemma with a student I am a teacher. 90% of my job is to maintain dominance. That violence doing violence on top of and inside of small children. Every single day. And making orders to kids who can't hang to fucking off themselves. Usually they comply and I don't have to call the police and do paperwork and shit. But today I screamed at this kid fucking neck yourself nobody likes you you're fucking worthless go die (you remember grade 1, that's how the teacher always talked, it was all ABC, patticake, colouring books, fucking off yourself). So not only does this kid disobey me (as far as I'm aware he's still alive, it's literally been 5 whole hours) he cries like a bitch and says I'm mean. So I dunno, is he right? AITA? I'm a good fucking teacher. I have a huge dick. So huge they wouldn't even let me join the army. Teaching was the only thing left that wasn't illegal with the size of my dick. So to hear a kid attack my teaching abilities by refusing to rope as instructed, it hurts my feelings. I'm actually even wondering if I should sue that kid for emotional distress.

teaching,zenzen1377,2019/03/29,"Tips for grading essays and time management? Hiya! I'm not a teacher, but I'm a college graduate interested in the education field. I recently began volunteering at the local high school to gain some experience. My supervising teacher has me assisting with grading APUSH and AP Euro essays for her in addition to other tasks, and I'm looking for advice.

Right now, I take ~10-15 minutes to grade each essay. I'm concerned with historical accuracy and argument structure more than grammar, and I'll write personalized feedback on each paper I hand back. This is usually between 2-5 sentences long.

While I've received positive reception from students that what I'm doing is helpful, and I've seen improvement on their scores, the time investment is humongous. I'm only helping out for three class periods, but it's still 60 or so papers to grade every couple weeks. I can't imagine what the workload would look like if I were preparing lesson plans and had a full five period schedule at the same time!

Have you developed any techniques to make grading essays easier for yourself? I worry that a simple score on a rubric is not enough information for a student to understand what they could be doing better.",7.4466340508806255,8.592585082191786,8.076011089367256,65.02325342465754,63.47488584474885,11.188649706457927,38.01728636660144,11.062562989136584,4.818202609262884,979,49,148,27,14,326,151,219,0.031,0.79,0.179,0.988,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,2,4,4,3,0,0,11,0,14,1,1,1,0,29,27,13,0,3,6,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,8,13,0,0,4,0,2,1,3,0,0,2,4,4,12,3,25,20,7,29,0,0,3,0,10,12,0,3,17,97,20,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866919340373912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992061065214114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14690572420421344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16896827656807187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15253794870630302,0.2113932876064331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19740581093871648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609679383509019,0.0,0.0,0.18688364487523426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2561136925141901,0.20185490645706294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933374222713481,0.0,0.0,0.16907331513666787,0.32086791203266085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12752741670429835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145302200328131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16681756695848285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18863891261145527,0.0,0.0,0.16315573055055174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19335288787836727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525728463915564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14364588906395764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33420852661280154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19888987847170714,0.0,0.0,0.2104146796483837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15324885595224802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19402063729796887,0.0,0.13571650042022745,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Swiingllley,2019/03/30,"Teach abroad, or teaching certification? Any advice on this is much appreciated!

I am a fairly young, 27, male high school Earth Science teacher in my second year at a school in NC.  Since I do not have an education background (BA in Environmental Science), I am slowly working on the lateral entry process, however also struggling with motivation to complete it (1/7th of the way done).  The big financial expense for the process is also what's making me lose motivation.  Teaching isn't exactly my passion, but it's a job with good benefits and my students keep saying that they enjoy having me.

For the second part, I have a few friends who taught English abroad and they loved it.  I enjoy traveling and would like to live outside the country (or at least NC) and have looked into programs in South Korea, as the pay and location are good.  Would it be worthwhile to get a tefl certification, or should I just go with a group, like geovisions? I don't mind the fees, as I know I'll be able to make that back in the first few months.  I'd much rather have a responsible group that will assist me in the placement process and other things.  

I figure that if I teach abroad for a year, I could save up and come back to the US to continue teaching and not worry about finances as much during the certification process.  I have only put about $100 into my current lateral entry because of Americorps funds helping, so it wouldn't be a big blow.

I guess what I'm trying to ask is, would it be wiser to travel abroad now and save up, or should I just bite the bullet, get certified and then move?

teaching,nabubo,2019/03/31,"Beginner Spanish games or activities for energetic young kids, 1st-3rd grade? Hi! I'm an upper elementary teacher trying to lead after-school Spanish sessions for a very small group of 1st-3rd graders, and I'm struggling with structuring activities that are engaging and active enough to keep them behaving well. Does anyone have tips or suggestions for me? I'm mostly experienced with 5th-6th graders so this lower age group is challenging. I'm having a lot of behavior issues, and I know a big part of that is that I'm not hitting the sweet spot for their age range in terms of our activities. I've had good luck with songs and they liked ""Matamoscas"" (the game where you race to the board to ""swat"" the correct vocabulary word). I have a subscription to Calico Spanish. 

I would really appreciate any tips on other games or activities, especially things that are highly structured and involve moving around. I can adapt the content as needed so feel free to share things that have worked for you in other subject areas, as well.

teaching,nosequeponerle,2019/03/31,"Anchor charts and classroom decor: helping or hurting student learning? I work as a student-teacher a third grade classroom. From my first day in the room, I was overwhelmed by the number of posters on the walls. There is not an inch of space in the classroom where paint is visible. The dry erase board has so much stuff taped on it, that the teacher has to put up chart paper on top of it if she wants to draw an explanation or write out important information for the students. 

While this classroom environment is overstimulating for me as an adult it is even more detrimental for my students. Many of them have ADHD and a few others are hyperactive and easily distracted, but not diagnosed. The teacher I am assisting frequently reprimands these students for not being able to sit still and focus, but who can blame them when there are decorative raindrops hanging so low from the roof that they can bop them with their heads as they walk through the class (we just started a water cycle unit). 

I've been trying to convince the teacher that the classroom environment is not conducive towards students' learning, and just recently found an study that I think will help me convince her to reduce all of the unproductive stimulus in the class. (i'm linking it here incase anyone else on this sub wants to read it), but to all you other educators out there, know of any other studies or research that can help me make my case better?",11.152755031228313,8.765488251908401,9.822755031228315,67.06107217210274,57.70229007633588,12.580707841776546,43.28383067314365,10.832165505486646,4.662934351145038,1150,51,196,20,11,358,157,262,0.038,0.871,0.091,0.8859,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,1,1,6,4,12,7,0,2,22,0,18,3,1,1,2,35,26,19,0,3,13,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,18,9,1,0,7,1,0,3,4,4,0,2,3,0,20,3,36,21,5,30,0,3,0,0,17,18,0,4,8,150,38,19,0.19418157105472106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23336851320960603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205012708701194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13577626942787274,0.1989619668619728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17173781959990786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12523104908972954,0.0,0.0,0.1970902071305825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622137857812467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12825509631163012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16517074514144414,0.0,0.2129100699227693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19928631328674934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3904674417184016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20787538797285735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067171131648744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12961770652363694,0.1968696350467505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1427457975431457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19520611221980216,0.0,0.0,0.1942341193456002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19173087517725496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374427154395928,0.0,0.15507365347886126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222914413238136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12442371002367733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318365403330673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22906664335819915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14136649641918628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ThatAlbinoFrog,2019/03/31,"Do you think missing school affects your grades? Hi

I'm currently in year 10, straight A/B student and I'll occasionally take a day off school, usually on Fridays and I'll mainly work on my assignments at home. I will also email my teachers for any work I have missed in class, if I know that subject has been particularly difficult. 

I do this because mainly because I hate the entire school routine of waking up at 6:30, and going to a private school where the teachers are assholes. I don't think this has a negative affect on my learning, but my parents do.

How often do you miss school and do you think it affects your grades?",5.575491803278692,6.4531874918032806,6.1230737704918035,78.32510245901642,67.52459016393442,8.395081967213113,34.10245901639344,8.472884824447931,2.7643081967213115,502,23,92,7,8,163,77,122,0.125,0.863,0.013,-0.8752,2,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,5,0,2,4,5,1,0,5,0,12,1,1,4,0,16,23,8,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,4,4,0,0,5,0,0,1,2,5,0,0,1,0,15,0,12,21,2,16,0,3,0,0,8,11,0,2,4,61,19,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572643899407987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10691300298346612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19167614076657652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10139200787084836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08935008744348713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15521931394371094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577015460726591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08640239346884586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17457095767507028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7955603724011971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11820767535627688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022150627437843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17315239791510298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228911807763238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012426424745844
teaching,alina_314,2019/03/31,"Teaching I work at a school with excellent behaviour and great respectful kids. However, we’ve had some issues with people using inappropriate and offensive language, whether they know it is inappropriate or not. Things like using the r*pe word jokingly, or saying misogynistic things, or homophobic things, basically all the “-isms”. We want to do a lesson on this, and I’ve been asked if I want to plan it. I really wouldn’t know where to start, and it’s extremely difficult to do this and have everyone take is seriously. I cringe at the thought of me talking about terrorism in a school of awful children where they laughed the entire time, even though it was in the UK, JUST after a terrorist attack had killed kids their age, a few hours away from them.

I have the option to pass the lesson planning to someone else, but before I do, I would love to hear any suggestions you might have, even if it’s just one single 5-10 minute activity. This is really important and obviously we’d like to make this as effective as possible.",9.50069226294357,8.171508586387436,9.429075043630018,65.25988947062247,59.99476439790576,13.724490983129725,37.976148923792906,12.650343791298138,4.8794812100058165,824,32,146,25,9,271,120,191,0.11,0.77,0.12,0.5958,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,2,1,4,7,8,14,3,1,12,1,17,1,0,4,2,38,30,16,1,6,10,0,0,2,0,3,0,2,0,3,12,9,0,0,6,1,0,1,2,6,0,1,5,2,15,8,23,21,4,14,0,0,0,1,16,8,0,8,7,104,27,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10720091048705363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473725391566265,0.17933876752435626,0.14810839027596553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13414041063773638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13168836647800464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.208240058567332,0.0,0.0,0.15063220377368805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17379915064354773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17767224206320634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552440872120153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16453567163082894,0.0,0.0,0.17440579954110125,0.0,0.17327013533710853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15403032051309426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14227665918090948,0.0,0.1052262232615774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16723160381074628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10682124745696928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10928803798791872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17771591941591766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20197701544326999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12536201162094174,0.0,0.3190810991700117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13356824018449526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115787205962224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11852599843922285,0.12670542093699355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3141879272876382,0.0,0.15488093995741428,0.1251489072498939,0.09192141304753162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723014662866641,0.0,0.0,0.18596084132528945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476412376730027,0.0,0.0,0.11198325146515316,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,fakeorigami,2019/03/31,"Advice for aspiring teacher exploring the field? My daughter is entering the 10th grade at a career-technical high school and has chosen early care &amp; education as her focus area. She’ll graduate with a basic early childhood certification, but is not sure she wants to make ECE her career. 

Background: She loves working with children and is doing her second year as a camp staff member this summer. She’s especially passionate about art and music, and is highly creative and best at project work. She has ADHD and is not a good test-taker, and her writing skills need some development.

So, /r/teaching, what nuggets of advice do you have for someone exploring the field? What lessons do you wish you had known back in high school? What books or movies should someone read or watch to get an idea of what the teaching profession is really like?

My questions &amp; parental worries: Is teaching a viable career for someone who struggles at tests and isn’t a fan of writing long papers? Are there enough art and music teaching jobs out there? If she wants to go into teaching, should she major in education or in her content area in college? Do certifications transfer fairly easily between states once she’s established, or will she have to retake classes or retrain if she wants to move?

teaching,jessaguh,2019/04/01,"How do you make students care about their own success? One problem that I feel myself and many of my fellow teachers consistently are running into is an overwhelming sense of ambivalence/apathy coming from the students about their grades and performance in class. I teach freshmen Earth Science at a low-income, minority-majority school in NC. I think this mentality is especially pervasive among freshmen, as they haven't realized the impact that failing a class has on their GPA/further success in high school. For most of my students, they came from middle schools, where the lowest grade they could get was a 40% on an assignment, like literally turn in a blank assignment and it's an auto 40%. With passing being 60%, many students were passed along and did not get challenged. I feel like this concept has impacted their willingness to try and now that they're in high school it's showing. 

  
I \~feel\~ like I'm doing my part in caring and letting them know that I care. I'm reaching out to parents of kids who are failing at least every other week. I notice changes among my students who have involved parents, but there are only a few. I'm offering extensive opportunities for extra credit. I hold tutoring nearly every day, with the exception of when I have other engagements. I try to make my classwork exciting and connect it to relevant events. My class is not challenging. If you're a student who is getting their work in, you will have a high grade. Yet, I struggle to get work turned in to me. For example, among my 90 students, I got 12 homework assignments turned in today and this assignment is part of a formal assignment and they had class time to work on it.

teaching,AlexandraSCharl,2019/04/01,"What books do you teach at KS3? I have an interview for a teacher training course next week and my brief is to give a 5 minute presentation on ‘my favourite area of English’. 

I studied children’s literature as part of my degree and really enjoyed looking at how it has came to encompass various experiences of childhood over time, i.e. regional identity, working class identity, BAME identity etc. I want to talk about this in my presentation and was going to use ‘Kit’s Wilderness’ by David Almond as a point of reference. I was wondering if you think this text is suitable for KS3 students or what texts you use to engage this age group?

teaching,wittyusernametaken,2019/04/01,"How do you get behavior middle schoolers to work? Not a teacher yet, still working towards my degree, but I'm an EA on temporary assignment in middle school behavior. My normal purview is elementary. Even with behavior kids there, redirection and reminder of consequences or reward will get a student back on track 95% of the time. 6/7/8 is new to me and I'm not sure how to handle outright defiance or just staring me down. Probably doesn't help that I'm not 100% on the rules and escalation levels in the new building either vs. knowing the other system down well. I was kind of given a schedule and told to run with it until they hire. I'm not sure how to handle the ""can you not hover over me!"" or ""why do you have to tell me to work!"". They are snarky little things in this age group and by the time I've done a round of the room they are back surfing memes on google instead of working on their assignments. Teacher seems over it too and reinforces a few times but they don't do anything for them either. 

Just looking for any suggestions from you brave middle school teachers. This is not my comfort level... get me back to elementary, lol.

teaching,thats-not-my-name-93,2019/04/01,"I told my students I have Cervical Cancer today. I posted about this searching for advice and this is an update for that. Here is the original post:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/azxes4/shouldhow\_do\_i25\_tell\_my\_students\_i\_have\_cervical/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/azxes4/shouldhow_do_i25_tell_my_students_i_have_cervical/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I teach at a inner city high school where 90% of our students have free and reduced lunch. I also teach six 50 minute class periods. These are inclusion classes and most of my students have a mix between ADD, ADHD, ODD, and anger management issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been an emotional process telling my students. I decided to tell Algebra 2 students first because they are older (16-19 yo) and can handle things better than younger students. I ended up getting a bit emotional while sharing the news but the students were VERY sweet about it; some even cried with me. After minute or so of tears I told them how I am being treated but they kept interrupting saying ""You are so strong"" ""You can do it"" ""Don't even worry about us"" ""We love you"". Having 40 kids shout back that they love me... wow.. It's an incredible feeling. I also explained to them that they HAVE to be good for the sub or I am going to be furious. My students suck with subs, they argue, fight, and sometimes bully the sub. They promised to not do any of that while I am gone, but I am not sure I believe them. 

&amp;#x200B;

After my 8th period ended, an algebra 2 student walked in and asked if she could talk for a bit. She sat in front of my desk and told me about her sister, who had cervical cancer but still had 6 kids after. It was really uplifting and I could tell my student was trying to reassure me that it will be fine. It was a sweet gesture and she even asked to hug me before she left. Very kid. 

&amp;#x200B;

My algebra 1 students were a little more challenging. I have 4 of those classes and for the first time ever they were silent. All looking at me with sad sad sad eyes. I told them that their standardized test will happen while I am out for surgery and how they have to work hard. Many students replied with ""We will try, so sorry"" But only 1 or 2 students in each class said something in reply. Many of them didn't even know what to say (which is totally fine). Sadly, I had one jerk throughout this experience.  I finished up telling the class what was going on and here is the conversation I had with one student with ODD

Student: ""Ms. T, are you going to cry in front of us?""

Teacher: ""I did in another class, but I have come to be more accepting of what is happening and I choose to fight and stay strong instead of letting this get the best of me""

S: ""Oh damn, I was hoping to see you cry""

T: ""Why would you ever wish that?"" That was a very rude response and I suggest if you ever find yourself in this situation again, you think about what the person is feeling instead of blurting out your first thought""

S:""I didn't mean it to be rude. I am just jealous about how happy you are the time, I was hoping this would make you sad""

T:""Oh it does make me sad, but as I said before I am trying to stay strong for mental health""

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully he stopped after saying those things, but I know deep down he did not mean for my feelings to be hurt or to cause me any pain so I am not offending or anything. Children will be children. I am thankful for all the hugs and well wishes I am getting. Because the students know, staff is starting to bring it up to me too, which is fine. All I want it warm wishes and happy thoughts and I am thankful that I have my fellow staff and wonderful students to give me the motivator to kick this challenge in the butt and move on with life!

Thanks for reading. Love your students and they will love you back (hopefully).

teaching,If_then_statement,2019/04/01,"What do ya'll use to record your lectures? Hey, everybody, happy April Fool's.
I'm in the process of finding an alternative to our Mimios. They discontinued the integration of Recorder, so my teachers can no longer record their lectures, and they're a bit frustrated.
So my question is: What do you guys use to record lectures - board capture and audio - that you don't have to be a wealthy district to get and is easy to use? 
I appreciate your help on this.

teaching,mingbeans,2019/04/02,"Need advice on choosing a Masters + certificate graduate program Help me, the indecision is real!

&amp;#x200B;

Background info: 

I have a BA in Literature. After graduating, I came to Taiwan, where I've been teaching elementary EFL for two years. It's been a learning process, but I've come to love teaching and have decided to pursue a MEd and teaching certification once I move back to the States.

I only applied to one program this past year (I was a little overwhelmed by all the choices and trying to do research on schools from the other side of the world), and I was accepted. It's a dual Elementary and Special Education program at Boston College. 

While it seems like a great program and I'm happy to be accepted, I feel like I don't know enough about what other options are out there. BC's expensive, and they didn't grant me any funding. On the other hand, I haven't seen many other dual certification programs in MA. (Then again, I'm also not tied to Massachusetts--I have some family there and some in Maryland, so I'd also be open to options in the DMV area.)

&amp;#x200B;

For all you teachers who have gone through the graduate school / certification process, what would you do if you were me? Go for it, or apply to more programs first? Has anyone gone this route at BC, and what did you think? Do you have other recommendations for programs in MA or MD?

I'd love to hear any advice, at this point. Thank you!",4.927555555555556,6.485147570370369,5.9764814814814855,76.25916666666669,69.5925925925926,8.214814814814815,31.64814814814815,8.697196308434329,2.6633481481481485,1124,49,201,19,20,373,148,270,0.019,0.8079999999999999,0.174,0.9937,0,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,0,6,1,2,9,12,0,2,15,0,23,3,1,0,2,38,40,18,0,3,5,2,2,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,16,13,0,0,10,0,2,6,4,2,0,3,11,4,19,10,33,26,6,35,0,1,1,2,14,19,0,9,11,139,35,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518930892254372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20614121800646348,0.0,0.2792972670907032,0.31322277894562955,0.1752946860825203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012054381110712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910587965543284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14741199404106786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11102443825544138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13317436504366278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121502864845232,0.0,0.06516896383921213,0.0920766499096756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096309203114474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07324925450028752,0.0,0.0,0.14209798879063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13720223764402895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452646239502258,0.0,0.08639000599165171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07083273323751844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259350156582562,0.12917828499764364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23265047092113306,0.0,0.0,0.1306708355227883,0.0,0.0,0.14316401490658742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13698611376287725,0.0,0.09556781930805797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13726007792717915,0.08733693097771797,0.09802410666701804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230368931200397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12183954594534335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14670122680427544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26088034541753097,0.0,0.11733356729604133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866151265268657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08258536235808096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08750557633565352,0.0,0.12590353099737786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09155737961038413,0.0,0.31322277894562955,0.16599755628874902
teaching,ohm314,2019/04/02,"How to reach the right crowd as a non-academic nonprofit doing education? Dear Redditers,

&amp;#x200B;

With my nonprofit organization, I am co-organizing Science-Survival Kit ([ssk.rhizomeacademy.org](https://ssk.rhizomeacademy.org)), a summer school in Croatia that teaches research and transversal-skills through project for adults (including teachers, btw!). I think (ok, I am definitely biased) it's a really great program, but since we're relatively new to the game we're struggling to reach the right people who might be interested to apply.

Do you guys have any good suggestions?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Aspects that you wished were different? Experiences or elements that were really valuable to you?

I’m trying to decide which Accelerated Master in Teaching program to attend, and the schools I’ve been accepted to are pretty comparable in terms of cost, timeline, and commute distance. I’m having a hard time discerning what is going to make the biggest difference in the long run in terms of how the schools differ in coursework, student teaching placements, philosophy, etc. Right now, I’m leaning towards one school in particular just with the gut feeling I got when speaking to faculty, etc. during the application and interview process, but I want to weigh my options carefully before making a decision.

teaching,tootsonboots,2019/04/02,"Do You Struggle With Politics in the Classroom? What Do You Do? I'm in a transitional program for people who didn't get a degree in education to become secondary education teachers. I spent three years teaching English composition at a university while I was in graduate school and my department, which is probably a lot like a lot of university English departments, leaned very far left politically. (Personally, I liked that, but that's beside the point.) 

I hear horror stories about high school teachers getting in trouble for assigning books written by LGBT authors or students getting in trouble for not doing the pledge of allegiance but I'm not sure how exceptional those stories are. I have been subbing in my district for the past few months and I've seen a classroom with a picture of Obama on the wall, Collin Kaepernick in another classroom, and a big pride flag on another classroom wall but maybe that's just this district.

To be honest, I'm not sure how to have an apolitical English classroom. Or, I'm not sure what people mean when they say ""apolitical."" I don't want to have a didactic classroom where I'm indoctrinating students to think exactly like I do (not that this is possible in a world where I struggle to get them to even stick to MLA formatting) but I also don't want to pretend that all ideas are equally valid, if that makes sense.

Anyway, I'm curious about the experiences of teachers who have struggled with this and what they have done.

teaching,raputini,2019/04/02,"High school philosophy help! Hey all, I'm teaching a high school philosophy course (grade 12) for the first time time this year and I feel like I'm in a rut. 

It's my second year of teaching under contract.  This year is the first year philosophy is being run at my school and I'm the only one teaching it. I feel pretty comfortable with the content and enjoy re-learning the material (my first degree from many years ago was in philosophy and history). My main issue is that I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of readings, explanation/clarification, and some kind of response (discussion or written). 

My kids have been great so far. They seem to enjoy the class and they entertain everything I give them. But I'm feeling that things are getting dull. I don't mind giving them readings, but it's starting to feel like a lot for them. I want them to enjoy philosophy and the course. If I can mix things up, I'd like to. 

I've been wracking my brain on alternate ways to deliver the difficult, often abstract concepts, while maintaining academic integrity. Are there any ideas out there that might make the content more engaging? Are there any other ways I could deliver the concepts authentically other than readings and/or lectures? Is a heavy reading load the nature of the beast? 

I should also mention, for better or worse, I do not have a course textbook. I've been relying on pdf's and photocopies. I've also tried to organize the course thematically (already going to make some changes on that for next time). Currently we are doing metaphysics. 

Something I can offer: I did a Socratic dialogue style project that involved their own philosophies, and engaging in conversation with someone outside the class, then writing their own dialogues. If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to share. It has guiding questions and a reflection piece. I just marked my batch and was extremely pleased with the results. With a couple tweaks, I will definitely do it again!

Thank you for any input or advice or ideas anyone can offer.",5.3597560975609735,7.559902414634148,5.835726287262872,75.13098780487806,69.5691056910569,8.822439024390244,32.083197831978325,9.3871,3.2425627100271006,1617,73,270,36,30,520,195,369,0.032,0.7859999999999999,0.181,0.9949,1,0,1,0,0,0,51.0,1,1,8,4,9,20,0,0,24,0,31,1,1,3,1,51,53,24,0,5,10,0,5,4,0,3,0,0,0,1,16,17,0,0,10,5,0,2,2,2,0,5,8,5,31,18,34,39,9,36,0,1,0,0,24,14,0,13,22,181,47,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09026601208020993,0.08188325936432828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1019361120562016,0.14774161317420975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884508102248106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12917896431923226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169657983622954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031190295731166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771858666312934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375247565787119,0.10220917765486247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301906682174186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23353330157860644,0.1979742759583272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357177644125294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04826117915836099,0.17722556177090812,0.0524978125594533,0.0,0.0,0.10184176796743384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09833297831782747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191580204467442,0.19519469353243304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20855617538075655,0.0,0.09641361094427683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619246250827113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1805154985344732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853238275388633,0.0,0.0,0.12331964309162526,0.09365191601008806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09799335686654652,0.09327058915954703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09823993540643508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06259446411114195,0.07025397341201296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10139802335857656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093976742886454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10347911328225937,0.0,0.3695927495761937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28045979923497816,0.0,0.08409308278783095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07826750403738432,0.07111339452844008,0.0,0.0,0.06538221925128539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08504482252768163,0.0,0.0,0.12273728561777845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16159064962334274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06271533240461909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05448410070806639,0.14664307704430687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413617216742072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2974265285983163

teaching,fingers,2019/04/03,"My two days...I just want to get to Spring Break now. Yesterday a autistic hs student came up to me in the library and said, ""Miss Fingers, I have a book for you."" I had seen that it was a ""dummies"" book. I told the librarian, ""Just look away, he's trying to put me down."" He kept trying but I wouldn't give in to him. (On Monday he tried to prank me by having his fly undone ...even though many students told him it was undone. He wanted me to say something. I didn't give him the satisfaction.)

Today, another sped student, after I told him to go get his book, he said, ""You go get it. You need the exercise."" 

I got his book, told him he got zeroes on his work from yesterday for not doing it. And that he had new work to do. He smiled and said, ""You mad?"" because my being mad means he gets kicked out. I said, ""I'm not mad, just disappointed."" He proceeded to do no work. 

Later I had class with first autistic boy (we will call Bobby) and 4 other sped kids and 3 general ed kids. Two kids sit way in the back instead of up with us in the circle. I told them I couldn't walk back to them today because my feet hurt and that they'd have to get up. They kind of asked about it. I asked them if they wanted me to be honest and they said yes. 

I told them that I used to be an athlete...a college athlete. They look at me like I'm lying... I'm 5'2"" and 240lbs. Fat short white woman. I tell them I love running. And all about my athletics. And how I used to be Jane's size. And. And and. 

And how I hurt my feet five weeks ago while running...and how I was up to 30 minutes of running every other day and how I'm down 15lbs. 

And then I look over at Bobby. I tell him how hurt I was that he had pulled that book thing in the library with Fitness for Dummies. 

He looked contrite. The class gasped. 

He and I will still be buddies. But I hope that his way of engaging with me becomes more positive. 

I have a meeting tomorrow AM with the other kid. The words ""hostile learning environment"" were used in the write up. I really don't want him back in my class. 

I can't wait for Spring Break.

teaching,EducationVisionary,2019/04/03,"How do I become an assertive teacher? How do I show tough love? Hello, I am a beginning teacher and I am currently completely my master's in education. I'm reading everywhere in all of my research that one of the keys to showing students that you care about them and really getting them to respect what you have to say is by showing ""tough love"" through high expectations and being direct and assertive to what you expect of them behaviorally and academically. 

My issue is that I find myself being really soft with my students because I'm afraid of upsetting them or making them feel like they're not included if I become assertive and a bit more authoritarian. My overall nature is to be pretty reserved and give others what they want instead of being assertive to what I need them to do.

Since it is in my and my students' best interest for me to become more assertive towards them, does anyone have any advice? Are there any books or articles that you guys recommend that really help with all of that?

Any advice would be most helpful, thank you all so much! Let's finish this school year strong!!",9.130439024390245,8.11097884878049,9.040121951219517,66.76213414634148,60.512195121951216,11.517073170731704,38.54878048780488,10.577609850970193,4.169282926829268,884,37,146,17,10,289,115,205,0.027000000000000003,0.772,0.201,0.9908,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,5,8,3,6,13,0,2,4,0,19,2,0,3,3,28,32,14,0,6,4,0,2,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,13,10,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,3,29,9,24,25,9,9,0,0,0,2,21,5,0,4,5,115,42,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2777324587353637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2899148066267732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09936517231255294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08662767816605361,0.4708411479982035,0.0,0.0,0.14913351039935593,0.0,0.15514505936642353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448885107101862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489974661106305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435961155006225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07185404179191998,0.10152193714470144,0.0,0.0,0.12988407807002414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07424553073868509,0.13632288024880448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407091978085778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905039066216771,0.15014483557411953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483237633192142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145314991624905,0.0,0.06942675888249811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2565159191685417,0.0,0.09485815008579952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044656833593612,0.1053712331450638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962960145251689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14457485860017444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14214639140608565,0.0,0.2731139460907848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130099336914924,0.0,0.14382081698100244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175531523188938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13083389372700607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381894194123822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10094939973442976,0.0,0.0,0.09151285093588933
teaching,bittybobitty,2019/04/03,"I’m not sure if I will lead a happy life as a teacher, I feel like I have to water-down my personality. I am going to school obtaining my k-12 Art Education licensure and I only have one semester left before I graduate. I have been doing great in the program.

However, I feel like I have two sides of me. One is a professional side that includes none of my personality, and another side of me likes to joke around and socialize and be heavily involved in social media; which is something my program has basically told me I cannot be apart of as a teacher. I think my dream job would be a makeup beauty-blogger, marketing makeup, doing free-lance makeup, and perhaps (don’t laugh) make Youtube videos on makeup application on the side. Blogging wasn’t really a career years ago but it now seems to be an industry that you can actually make money and thrive  in. 

Or perhaps another career where I can dress and look however I want, have a life on social media, and not water down my personality. I currently have been bartending my way through college and I love how I can go to work and be myself (personality wise). I hate how all of my social media accounts have to be completely private and monitored because I am going into teaching, this means I can’t really start a blog.

Am I just being silly? I am considering teaching strictly at the elementary level so I can maybe have a dual-life, one where I teach and one where I am avid on social media as a beauty blogger and also do free lance makeup for special events. 

If I teach at a HS or MS level, I feel I can’t have a life on social media because my students use social media and I don’t want them to see my content and life outside of school. I feel silly posting about this but it’s been on my mind and I don’t want to sacrifice my personality and how I present myself for a career, if that makes sense.

teaching,Luckypenny9,2019/04/03,"Seeking advice: please help! Hello! So I am a first year teacher at a charter school and recently i recieved news that my contract will not be renewed for the next year. First, I was not planning on returning anyways. Secondly, all the principal told me was that ""I'm not a good fit."" I have received little to zero feedback. The only formal observations/walk-through were done once at the beginning of the year. So, I am feeling very hurt, sad, depressed and angry at the situation. The school I'm at is very unorganized, and I work with staff members who are inconsiderate and incompetent. I would even go as far as describing this school as a hell hole.  Lack of resources, sewage leakage making the school smell bad, and excessive testing is just scratching the surface of the issues I'm experiencing. I've had several staff members be disrespectful towards me and I have corrected them and stood up for myself. I am suspecting this is why they are not renewing my contract. I've also advocated for the students about how miserable they are with the non stop testing amongst other things. I do not know what to do and need advice on my steps I need to take next. I refuse to give up and resign but I am up against the wall it feels like.

teaching,jewish_tricks,2019/04/04,"Need some advice on teaching social studies to ELL students. I work for a program that offers tutoring and mentorship to migrant students. At my site I specialize in providing assistance with history to my students. I've been at this for a while now and I've built a good sense of community with my students, but as of late I've been feeling like I'm out of ideas on how to proceed with my classes. The students I'm working with are really low in their reading comprehension and writing skills. Some aren't fully literate in their home language, and I'm expected to help them understand complex concepts like communism or social Darwinism. I feel that the content they have to learn is too far ahead for them-- for example, we did a map activity once and some students were shocked to see where their home countries were located on the map. Almost every ELL student that I've come across is failing or struggling with their history classes-- aside from a few exceptions most are unmotivated or lack self-initiative.

I'm expected to always have some kind of lesson plan or activity for my students to do, but I feel that what I've been doing isn't enough. I have my students read translated versions I make of their readings, I have them make basic graphic organizers, we do vocabulary activities, but I feel this isn't good enough. I'm asking for any advice for teaching social studies to ELLs-- I understand it is very language heavy and its only natural they will struggle, but I want to make our tutoring sessions more interactive and captivating for my students.",8.98885416666667,8.647949899305559,8.901472222222221,65.44075000000001,60.423611111111114,12.124444444444444,42.81111111111111,11.4731,5.231351111111111,1273,68,204,32,15,415,149,288,0.081,0.8420000000000001,0.077,-0.5118,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,3,0,10,7,4,11,0,2,8,0,22,0,0,4,0,51,41,18,0,5,9,0,4,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,9,16,0,0,10,3,0,1,3,5,0,0,6,5,30,6,43,34,11,22,0,2,1,0,21,16,0,10,7,142,39,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375855433435079,0.0,0.0,0.12173066936836767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10115255118405617,0.0,0.0,0.08266896754930803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136476882691179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471824204640802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25122010274770273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10242449758521373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24586944771661606,0.08684668946380568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2039273861580568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08148304733603139,0.0,0.2438809804411257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13723308226315334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659215768981635,0.0,0.0,0.13713160846936234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11878189756274783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24343850803015704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09013956018514796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12946369546690964,0.0,0.0924563302425592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3647963344685605,0.0,0.07787821605023708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09687226773217994,0.0,0.12681972610604186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3717633186712489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541741065852882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25310873812449103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030458298843743,0.0717027061016378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1770028179879963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,babyhistoryteacher,2019/04/04,I didn’t get the placement for my internship that i hoped for. I was trying to get out of my college town and save money by living closer to home. I got the call saying that the school I applied for is on the block schedule and didn’t want student teachers. Now I’m faced with going more into student loan debt and I don’t even know if I can afford to not live at home which forces me to commute for an unpaid internship which blocks me from working. I don’t even know if I want to teach anymore after all of this. ,5.319722222222222,4.713785601851853,5.852222222222222,85.165,67.98148148148148,7.940740740740741,29.11111111111111,6.42735559955562,1.3301555555555549,407,12,86,2,6,132,69,108,0.071,0.847,0.08199999999999999,0.0258,2,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,5,0,7,1,1,0,1,18,17,5,0,5,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,5,6,0,2,2,0,3,1,5,0,0,0,4,1,13,2,19,13,2,10,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,3,3,60,18,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22631245455140406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2330170694563252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30144706138804506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2384495029181566,0.0,0.1296909599744364,0.0,0.1825118813976132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4578051456872251,0.2266534630013469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2508248099958717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4030084463815396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18147329708230894,0.0,0.2309499439037249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15493239181079566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691957999648351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661318581085617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,hbicnewyork,2019/04/04,"Asked to resign (music) Hello everyone,

First time poster. Excuse me if there are procedures or threads for this type of question. 

I teach high school instrumental music. In February, on Valentine’s Day (great timing principal...), I was asked to resign because “the students and parents complaints were mounting.” I was then forced to turn in my resignation letter on my birthday (again... great timing...)

This was my first year teaching. It is a very rural area, conservative town, high turnover rate. I have been able to support myself after college with my studio, clinic work, and other outlets. However, I wanted to finally get into academic teaching this year. I am very successful in my field outside of this year’s academic teaching. The person before me was well liked, but didn’t supply a lot of substance. I supplied more substance and held them to higher standards, and was strongly disliked. I suspect the last person was asked to leave because they were terrible with communication (but liked!), as well as the person before that (same as me, not liked). The parents and students really dictate the program here, and complain until they get what they want.

I am feeling a bit burnt out, and scared to try elsewhere. Do I have to list info about this resignation request? I feel like it’s a job killer to do so. I can’t list anyone at this school as a reference, because they are dysfunctional, know nothing about music, and can’t fairly evaluate me. They just want someone who can communicate and the students will enjoy, not necessarily supply a high quality education. The others in my department are hostile towards liberal individuals, and I happen to be a member of the LGBT community in which the department head has made very inappropriate comments towards. I feel very isolated, frankly humiliated and unsupported. There’s a lot of talking about me behind my back, and not helping me. 

I was planning on resigning, they knew that, but they beat me to the punch. I had confided in other staff members, and they turned on me and told admin. 

How can I bounce back from this? Is this a “job killer?” Should I list this under the question of “have you been nonrenewed/asked to resign?”

Sorry for such a scattered and rant filled post. Typing during my off hour after not being invited to a new teacher meeting. Very frustrating. 

Appreciate your time.

Now I am two years into teaching and know that I cannot stand to live here anymore. I love the kids. I love my job. However, small town life just isn’t for me. I am not happy here.

It is nearing the time where I will be asked to sign a renewal contract. I am pretty sure I will be renewed. However, I have also submitted applications to several other school districts. 
Do I take the risk and say that I will not be renewing? Do I sign the contract and just hope to get out of it later? One of the school districts I am applying to has communicated that if I have accepted an offer from another school district in the area, they would retract any offer they had given me. I do not want to live here another year but I am too risk adverse to throw away a salary without assurance that I would find another position. What do I do? Thanks in advance for the help!",2.7356084782090946,4.562967000000004,4.216904024767803,85.5465944272446,75.83257918552036,7.367563705644201,27.46868301976661,8.20500826718156,1.8626506787330317,861,35,174,15,19,286,117,221,0.063,0.838,0.099,0.8209,5,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,2,2,13,11,0,2,15,0,29,3,0,0,2,25,41,8,0,5,9,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,0,1,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,3,8,3,0,4,6,1,29,8,23,27,0,29,0,0,0,2,11,15,0,2,10,130,38,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0926658375567285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07879951938855441,0.3645176475940255,0.0,0.0,0.11491765952425068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083282334436473,0.0,0.10886913103753901,0.0,0.0,0.07063681380736697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590838440327746,0.0985638985838989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06054032431487659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233519466790247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07766910799465823,0.0,0.0,0.11509081788189875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22997770850589236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06368231075146905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184650630366114,0.0,0.0,0.20464091345954466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20916487206549966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12315764007060732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07852044280082468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788734945188427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214908922350601,0.0,0.5863624932459203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13090667431834851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10921157271367987,0.0,0.08712418271099713,0.0,0.0,0.10668287072374594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06756811240457747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12603959876636567,0.11319382182806093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06834655067269096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11170013876792577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16462969120187426,0.0,0.0,0.29848087121295275
teaching,bobbyfish4,2019/04/05,"My principal is endangering the safety of our students and I don't know what to do Over the last few years, my school has had many serious cases of violence among students, and my principal has done nothing about this because he is too lazy to do the paperwork. This is well known amongst the staff, but everyone is too afraid to do anything about this because they're afraid of being displaced by this principal. He has done this before: removing dissenting Teachers from the staff. The worst part is that this principal is very political/ ""chummy"" with Teachers and parents. On top of being male model, he basically charms everyone into liking him and he's been getting away with literally doing no work for years. Recently, we had an incident where an 8th grader actually beat up (closed first) a 2nd grader. The incident was ""covered up"" (understating what happened in the report) and the student only got a 1 day suspension, even though this is probably the 10th time that he's seriously attacked another student. No one is willing to put their careers on the line for the students. But I've had enough and something needs to be done. However, like I stated, this guy is insanely well liked by his peers; I presume even his bosses in our school board. So, I don't know who to turn to. It feels like a nightmare, and I've never seen anything like this in 10 years of Teaching. Students are getting away with incidents that would get them expelled in any other school on a monthly basis for years, and nothing is being done.",9.05482460599898,8.25327535943061,8.657074224707674,68.74506227758008,60.53024911032029,11.871987798678193,40.35612608032537,11.062562989136584,4.585533604473818,1220,57,205,27,14,391,157,281,0.084,0.8190000000000001,0.097,0.5994,2,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,3,0,2,4,11,14,1,2,18,0,35,0,0,1,1,25,46,12,0,2,2,1,1,5,0,2,0,0,0,2,17,14,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,6,2,2,11,2,15,8,37,29,4,31,0,0,1,0,17,17,0,0,16,150,32,17,0.0,0.0,0.10459250869595066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07288627716708827,0.11238788637710137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17640050376384758,0.0,0.0,0.1219330606167084,0.20139883393488528,0.0,0.0,0.13067222818903554,0.0,0.09120253834252492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912242460671611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4387306231666321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107458976543534,0.0,0.14158315033958824,0.0,0.0,0.20483073333344973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054193578450412734,0.07656962542235075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09116750567260823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16799184406347145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572187442695094,0.0,0.0,0.10612534465655207,0.09477918245819904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11780697618687262,0.08736624702461243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618143955598364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10866399830381007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08555029031568652,0.0,0.0,0.07947283197235383,0.08266405231849773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056847708233001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07262814293375856,0.08151544541658454,0.0,0.0,0.1190110356211482,0.11606581674948575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555848778199787,0.0,0.0,0.10774580164233437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10582761272504904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3254165472180383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251262880285541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530409738449527,0.0,0.06249769296298947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11658138527997508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08843496965731314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1927359172502883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07802853255385046,0.0,0.0,0.07613780766672319,0.0,0.0,0.27608238828244913

teaching,DogPehnis1488,2019/04/05,"Illegal policies at my son's school We are a Second Amendment family through and through. My wife and I have been teaching our son about guns, gun safety, defensive gun usage, and tactics since he was old enough to know what they were. We take him hunting every weekend and run a side business selling the venison we can't eat. I have started taking him with me to train some weekends too, the guys love having him around. Sometimes we put a sombrero on him and have him be the tango, he loves that, gets really into it with the accent and everything. I have always subscribed to the philosophy that it's best to be prepared, as does my wife. I have a CCW and open carry permit in my state as does my wife, and will get one for my son when he is old enough. It makes me furious to have to pay a fee to some bureaucrat to exercise a God-given Constitutional right but we are outnumbered in prison, as can be expected given who we're talking about, it is what it is.

So my son started at a new school last week and they have some policies I disagree with.Ones the Constitution disagrees with. I carry one in my pocket with me at all times. So I take my son to school and as always I'm carrying. I have a .38 under my jacket. I take my son to school and on the wall is a sign that says Gun Free Zone. I flag down the nearest adult and I say what the fuck is this shit, she says sir this is a gun free zone we don't allow guns here. I said you forget what country we're in? Looking at these kids it's an easy mistake to make.

Now at this point I'm pretty calm, it's just talking politics, this teacher probably thinks it's bullshit too and has a gun in her purse she doesn't tell the principal about for when shit hits the fan, and you watch the news, you know who's coming into the country, you know who's doing all these shootings, you'd be a pretty garbage teacher to take this policy seriously and not protect your students. Then she says I'm not sure what you're implying. So I get out my pocket constitution and hand it to her and say you can keep it, obviously you need to read that, your sign is illegal, take it down right fucking now. She says again louder this is a gun free zone we don't allow guns here. Now I'm a peaceful person, sometimes my wife and I have arguments, sometimes they come to blows, nothing any other couple doesn't have. 

But at this point I'm about ready to blow my stack. I get up in her face and put my hands on my hips making sure she sees a flash of that pistol inside my jacket and say the fuck did you just say to me bitch? This is America. There are no gun free zones. Take that sign down right fucking now, I'm not asking for permission, my taxes pay your salary so shut your fucking trap and remove that sign. She backs up out of my face and says sir I need you to leave right now or I will call the police. I took my .38 out of the holster and said fucking call them I dare you, when shit hits the fan they're on our side, not yours, remember who built this country. She runs away and herds all the kids into the classrooms, everyone's freaking out, honestly it would be hilarious if it weren't so sad how much they're freaking out, this country's gone down the fucking tubes, I don't know how these people function in every day life if the sight of one gun gets them this triggered.

So I'm walking around basically deciding to fuck with people, I'm sure one of these idiots has called the police abd the police have better things to do but you-know-who would rally the troops and cause a big stink and try and get everyone fired if they went and dealt with actual crime. In the meantime I decide to have fun with this whole absurd situation. I'm walking around banging on doors yelling bang bang you're dead kid subscribe to Pewdiepie Allahu Akbar 14 words etc etc, anything to trigger these snowflakes, they're fucking delusional. Keep in mind I never even fired a shot or pointed my gun at anyone. Literally just a gun existing and they lock the place down and flip their shit.

After a while the cops show up. I put the gun down and show them my CCW, I tell them who I train with, we have a good laugh, as it turned out one of them was my buddy's cousin. They thought the whole thing was bullshit too but you know, look at who owns the media, so they have to be seen doing something. Honestly those cops were really chill, they said hey man this teacher sounds like a bitch, we'll follow her around and put the fear of God in her when we catch her speeding.

After the whole ridiculous charade I was pretty surprised to come home and see my son upset. He wasn't crying or anything, I'd knock his teeth out if I caught him being a pussy like that, but he was obviously kinda bummed. He says what happened at school, why the lockdown? Now this kid thinks I'm his hero. I tell him every single day that I'm his hero. So I said Daddy did a very patriotic thing today, and explained the whole scenario. He asks me if he brings his gun to school will he get in trouble. I tell him the truth, I say yes, but freedom isn't free. He says I don't want to get in trouble. I said what the fuck did you just say to me you little bitch? From now on you're going to school, open carry, every single day, even on weekends before we go train, and fuck that cunt of a teacher if she tries to stop you! When shit goes down are you gonna cower like a bitch or neutralize the threat? You gotta neutralize the threat before it becomes a threat, take the fight to the enemy! You wanna chop off your balls? Be a tranny like Obama's wife and their ugly kids? The whole fucking family is trannies! Man the fuck up pussy! This is America!

My son storms out. I don't know if he intends to follow through or if I have to give him the belt for disobeying me. Later I explained to my wife the whole mess, she thinks it's bullshit too, but is concerned our son could actually get expelled if he does this. We started to argue. It got heated, fists got thrown, I won of course.

Still, I can't help wonder maybe my wife is partly right. If oir son gets expelled will it be my fault?

For reference my son is 5, he is in kindergarten.",3.679102564102564,4.75569216666667,4.341076923076926,88.6372564102564,72.0448717948718,7.149230769230769,24.84423076923077,7.3871296695380915,0.9594601923076924,4816,137,1024,50,90,1536,438,1248,0.197,0.6970000000000001,0.106,-0.9992,2,1,1,17,2,0,129.0,15,23,15,5,46,71,32,2,72,1,83,29,11,12,10,169,186,80,1,19,30,19,4,4,0,9,2,20,2,12,67,75,1,5,17,8,10,22,18,44,0,6,28,32,155,32,131,136,22,138,0,1,7,15,169,76,23,20,43,638,222,16,0.0,0.0,0.07137024973775921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608550651454924,0.0,0.0,0.02486751617648129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02556921868128972,0.0,0.06018475015304683,0.13021320774335776,0.06837234842122203,0.0,0.03435687042513482,0.028118559901532995,0.0,0.0,0.040386519062724786,0.06223340485259408,0.0,0.038375894202800034,0.032341453213447044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112020149674873,0.0,0.0,0.03756544266458918,0.0,0.09450036653143852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02919659850689556,0.040461832597350894,0.04016826676868202,0.07075006759329823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09600279541130766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03741822662513927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556910596723766,0.08156604546579152,0.048305681374226035,0.0,0.12324057871167117,0.06988464458039449,0.032864989829705385,0.0,0.06894617343061415,0.04114920325480122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4394852402181941,0.19105287772202945,0.03507938903764778,0.04156491133664161,0.030671530832221412,0.058493592534674364,0.0,0.0,0.03620810154607722,0.03233699050878678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02451078146741307,0.0,0.03668071832782056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500669524624718,0.0,0.0,0.14067784087253196,0.029807827283899708,0.0,0.03872026657425719,0.0,0.0,0.025829082909234097,0.07146117452967997,0.036650775486905485,0.0,0.0,0.06141587507120042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600815436440283,0.0,0.07322833725735907,0.0,0.03673750387932172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03692328860695362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026881711572983708,0.054229465723231667,0.02820352113102525,0.03531763380776344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035088013577498765,0.0,0.07674399773185506,0.0,0.12389722657481066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039599615836294115,0.0,0.05070333899614935,0.0319297956193293,0.03820581101517856,0.0,0.10370583207427027,0.0,0.0,0.1116085069646901,0.039426524113185785,0.0,0.0,0.14704389190554307,0.0,0.0,0.036577928483693116,0.0,0.04685283619321035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04142445248586225,0.15614450041397662,0.17392286524928527,0.37804477490510097,0.0,0.2590616092446608,0.05827997509332813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18768280011660454,0.030249454495607363,0.04110400084441308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028151858090037413,0.1085001580130768,0.0,0.07764912518292666,0.0,0.029203278114913144,0.030572512707457568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1033948140365512,0.0,0.2199568768682744,0.05878399895081261,0.12784828936603532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07288252803808076,0.07029395631810657,0.0,0.029030933238962917,0.021323113913296183,0.0,0.03466221916884668,0.0,0.04062842979181076,0.04965458756769855,0.0397755187534185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03017245665433567,0.02156877310481044,0.0,0.029332670045889856,0.0,0.0,0.033898932630367806,0.03299696167725444,0.2449614152355744,0.0,0.0,0.03965647152620766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051953762419601375,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,sophierondeau,2019/04/07,"Brand new teacher qualified in Québec looking to work in Scotland Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states, I'm trying to figure out how the teaching qualification works from Canada (Québec) to Scotland. I've looked up the GTCS, under the ""Qualified Outside Scotland"" scheme and I understand this part. I've read throughly the Immigration (Tier 2) visa website for the UK and I get it too. 

What I don't understand is if I need to apply to schools before getting the visa (for sponsor) or do I need to get the visa before apply to school (to be eligible). On [Teaching Scotland](https://teachinscotland.scot/become-a-teacher/qualified-outside-scotland/) , it says that I need to apply for Visa first, then apply for jobs. On the [UK Visa Immigration](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general/eligibility), it states I need to have ""a valid certificate of sponsorship"" in order to be eligible to apply for the visa in order to be able to teach.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to admit I'm rather confused and I would like to know if someone went through the same / a similar scheme and if they could break it down to me. I will be finishing school in a few months and would like to do my Back to School 2020-2021 in Scotland.

teaching,majorfrickingbummer,2019/04/08,"First year displaced and might take the year off Hello, I've posted here before back when I was still student teaching.  This will probably be long and rambling.

I got a job immediately after graduating in the city I live in, in a middle school as an ESL teacher with an emergency certification.  Due to the certification and the position being a one year one, they have displaced me (although I did follow all the steps of starting school again and signing up for the TESL Praxis).  This year was enormously hard because of the responsibilities of going to school while teaching and some things that came up with my father.  My classroom management was absolutely atrocious and overall the year felt like a failure (a learning experience, but a failure so far).  I chalk a lot of it up to poor planning due to personal business, having 3 separate classes to plan for one of which didn't even have a curriculum associated with it (It was an English intervention class), and overall not being as consistent in classroom management as I should have in the very beginning of the year.  My skills as a new teacher really weren't honed.

Anyway, my question is this.  How bad will it look if I take the next year to finish my TESL program and not pursue another teaching job?  Will that gap give me grief or would administration understand why I decided to do that?",8.12949477351917,8.448856223577238,8.291312427409988,66.91463414634147,61.96747967479676,11.093612078977934,38.30313588850174,10.7630783206399,4.338918466898956,1085,51,179,25,14,355,142,246,0.096,0.897,0.006999999999999999,-0.9704,2,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,1,4,9,3,0,0,23,0,22,0,0,1,1,30,34,20,1,3,5,1,2,1,0,6,0,0,0,1,12,12,0,0,5,0,1,4,4,2,0,4,10,3,16,1,32,15,3,39,0,1,1,0,6,12,0,6,23,136,28,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290951898847531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09466664598373313,0.10279459076643364,0.07504881822461412,0.0,0.1047604807318327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14080899238430758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131527456723621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12042858061106165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182082216059606,0.0,0.0,0.10472024019238617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810164229540082,0.06996821246589846,0.0,0.09846507495739244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028547190257346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24434221068408304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0601470144139046,0.0,0.10871143450373613,0.10895153171220012,0.10338429356813424,0.0,0.0,0.10466665512499973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13060391812935634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11890374003401173,0.1309325539110647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25027458577388634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749791841449198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11790865623079093,0.0,0.13273712500434953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13791524314877654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07886963046415953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737921613170643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871403356641786,0.0,0.09831856256330758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18513198993026386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08179110765678932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12816544635698265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158149217306836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11109074222073348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745626468287307,0.0,0.0,0.5549671908967946
teaching,hivehivebuzzbuzz,2019/04/08,"Should I accept this position? Can I? What would you do? And can I do this? I don't want my license being taken away or anything!

Teacher in MN. Due to budget cuts and re-redistricting I was cut from my school (very big district).

Had interview today and got offered a job for 2019-2020. 

Position is very secure.

Pay is cut by 3k/year (sucks).

Building is only 20 years old and classrooms are very nice.

School in general seems great and families seem very involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Question though...Today the same district I work for opened up a position in a different school - that is my ""ideal"" because it is right across the street from my house (family only has 1 car), higher pay (See above), my 2 kids will be going to this school very soon, too. I also want tenure in this district but don't have it yet. However, all of the other perks don't exist (school is very old, families are tough sometimes, position is (Cross my fingers) secure I hope. Ideally I would like to stay in the district, so I applied for that job. I have an interview for that job next week and I may be offered it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway - Can I accept this offer for the 1st school today and then ... if I don't sign anything, say no later with no penalty? 

&amp;#x200B;

Advice needed! Not sure how to tread forward...The school wants me to let them know in 24 hours from now.

teaching,IUseRedditTooMuch,2019/04/08,"Is the job supposed to be this crazy and stressful? Hi everyone,

First off, I am not a teacher. But my girlfriend is currently a first year middle school teacher in a fairly rich suburb in the midwest. When she first started off with the job, she was ridiculously stressed and overworked (consistently working 40+ hours a week), which I thought was to be expected since starting a new profession and job is a huge challenge to take on.


However, As we come up to the end of the academic year, I don't feel like any amount of that stress has lifted and the number of hours worked has definitely not gone down. So far she is very dejected with the way her first year has gone, constantly feels like she's doing much worse than all the other first year teachers and considers quitting at least once a week.


From my (albeit limited) perspective, I think that she's currently experiencing a large amount of imposter syndrome and absolutely believe in her ability to come out on top.


So, teachers, my questions for you are: 

-Is this a fairly normal teaching experience?

teaching,bigdogsandbarbells,2019/04/09,"First grader’s parent died. I don’t know how to address this with the rest of the class. For about 2 months, one of my students has been struggling to stay awake in the mornings, and I often let him nap or take some time to himself. His father, who was battling cancer, was in remission until recently. When I finally got in contact with the mother about the sleepiness, she told me that the timeline matched up with when her husband started declining and that her son was having night terrors, anxiety attacks, and other issues.

Last week, the mother notified us that her husband was flown by helicopter to a large hospital about 3 hours away, and I knew it was serious because there are two other major hospitals in closer proximity than that one. I found out this afternoon that the father passed last night. 

As we are in a rural community where everyone knows everyone, word had been getting around that the father was declining quickly. My student was absent all of last week and will now be out all of this week as well. The rest of the kids have been talking about him being at home with his dad who is sick (he was pretty open about it all year with his classmates) and just yesterday my aide dropped off at the family’s house some cards they had made.

The student will be receiving counseling services upon his return, but I’m not sure how to address this with the rest of the class. Does anyone have any advice as far as talking to them about what happened, outlining for them what is and isn’t okay to say to their classmate, etc? I want to be the one to have the conversation instead of asking the counselor to step in and handle it, as I’m the one they spend their days with.",9.729130434782608,7.454779304347827,8.88124223602485,72.35397515527953,60.30434782608695,11.932919254658387,38.838509316770185,10.290406445055957,3.848705590062112,1344,51,246,22,14,423,180,322,0.062,0.915,0.023,-0.8535,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,2,0,6,1,19,8,2,2,21,1,31,2,0,3,4,40,46,20,1,1,4,10,0,0,0,2,2,1,3,1,19,20,0,0,4,1,1,3,3,5,1,6,18,1,29,3,56,21,10,49,0,0,0,0,41,19,0,4,25,194,48,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200455706476566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08354080172261008,0.0,0.09397832647416902,0.0,0.0,0.08589812560676625,0.0,0.0,0.10936069863745557,0.11484622674476415,0.13975724973659492,0.11541966956515405,0.0,0.0,0.07488695492545472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07922674875296311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12749675109789216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10750504713799408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13700790990134326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23477291398597214,0.0,0.0,0.11581009062632143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13457389721973798,0.0,0.10449438235788208,0.0,0.1346964090723284,0.0,0.0,0.06418297051880532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982527080972391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10863401448011976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12322648531201096,0.0,0.12098046042204852,0.14175001172077506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822131694177696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13502801380026827,0.3004123658229899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256203266460332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116241677095676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805604180044047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305689115738847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3329797335869553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13640808278404226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12498050448254874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12129750558082555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976936008172936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08695239370114534,0.13093954275102526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284273244890722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578271558865813,0.0,0.09236635108412923,0.1974810176440723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163361305959598,0.0,0.0,0.11738645699298607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12000457234940973,0.0,0.1477709280641845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245888912110464,0.0,0.29562358639774283,0.0,0.11045503813372326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911003605567374

teaching,kgreat_,2019/04/09,"Any other teachers out there considering a career change? I'm a former educator and after about 6 years, I hit a wall, then taught for two more years, eventually deciding to leave last year. I loved so many things about teaching, but I was so exhausted from all the other things, that it just wound up being a more negative experience at the end. I took a huge leap and started a new career in design. Now, I'm looking to help other teachers considering a career change! 

As a former teacher, I know burnout is real. Fifty percent of teachers leave teaching in the first 5 years. I want to help teachers who feel stuck in their role because they are ashamed or overwhelmed develop autonomy by allowing them to reflect, learn about other options, and reach out beyond their current resources and networks. I'm currently working on a product to help teachers explore careers beyond the classroom and would love to hear from other teachers considering a change. 

\*\*It is not my intention to encourage teachers to leave teaching. The work that teachers do every day is invaluable and superhuman in many ways. We need you! But, we do not want people who's experience in the classroom has turned negative to feel they have absolutely no other options.\*\*

teaching,helloitsmekl,2019/04/10,"Santa Clara University - MATTC Multiple Subject Credential Program Hi,

I am planning to apply to **Santa Clara University's MATTC program for the Multiple Subject Credential**. I have all my requirements (CBEST, CSET MS I, II, III, letter of recs, experience/field hours in the classroom with children, resume/CV, Certificate of Clearance, etc.)

I will be graduating from San Jose State University this coming May 2019 with a BA in Child and Adolescent Development. My overall cumulative GPA is around 3.6-3.7.

**My question is, how competitive/difficult is it to get into Santa Clara University? In particular, the teaching credential (MATTC) program?**

Today during last period (which is regular, not AP like the rest of my classes today) we were talking about the Electromagnetic spectrum. Last period is a really small class so we usually get way more done in less time than the rest of the classes, so I usually allow a lot of random, slightly off-topic discussion and we have some pretty interesting conversations.  Anyway...When we got to X-rays, one of the girls who I think is also in Anatomy and Physiology remarked ""did you know that your small intestine is, like, 21 feet long?""

teaching,DriveSheSaidNow,2019/04/10,"When to quit? I'm sure there are a ton of posts out there with this same topic.  My apologies in advance for posting mine.  

Me? Twenty year veteran to education.  Masters +30 (close to a PhD in Curriculum and Instruction).  I've won multiple accolades for the work I've done with SEL, special education, low-income students, and differentiated learning. 

What killed me today? My district now has the students rate us as part of our end of year evaluation.  Yes.  And at the middle school level, that means anyone from the ages of 11-14 is making a decision about you.  And this is based on language they may or may not understand.  

I know I'm an overachiever (aren't all educators?!?), but to score in the 78-80% on some items just broke my heart.  My 8th graders? Coming to class? They trashed me.  I have 120+ students a day, and come home and do 2+ hours of work a night.  

I came out of the corporate world, where if I stayed I'd be making 100k+ right now. I never said this before, but today, I'm asking myself, whytf was I so stupid?  

I know we do this ""for the kids,"" but at this point I'm cooked.  My admin doesn't give a crap.  Colleagues are only competing.  They strive to be the ""best in the district!""

teaching,Murph8281979,2019/04/10,"Still not sure if this is for me. So as I am nearing the end of my first year teaching (high school medical academy - Care and prevention of athletic injury, first aid, and CPR) I am still not sure if teaching is for me. I have never done anything like teaching before nor do I even have a collage degree. I was granted a temp teaching certificate due to my years of work experience working in a multitude of health fields. Upon receiving the position, I was pretty much thrown into the classroom with no idea how to write a lesson plan or even given any type of curriculum. I even had to scrounge around to find a text book to teach from.  Through out this year things have definitely gotten better / easier as I pretty much made stuff up as I went along. And I am more than happy with the pay that I was offered (as this was substantially more than what I made in the healthcare field) and all the vacations / breaks. However, I just don't know if I can see myself doing this for the rest of my years until I retire.

teaching,Joey_the_Duck,2019/04/10,"By the 3rd of 5 blocks today I was able to tell a kid to get on task in the computer lab or be the 5th office referral for the day. I'm known as a laid back teacher and he was genuinely shocked I'd sent four others to the office (I didn't tell him one kid was sent twice).

He complied. 

Sidebar. 

Yesterday taking a test a kid speaks up to ask if there's a retest. 

Arghh you don't take notes nor do you do the homework and say note taking doesn't help you learn. Then during the test you ask about a retest.

teaching,Goats247,2019/04/11,"Interested in teaching in Maine Hi I'm a 36 years old and I am moving to Maine sometime this year

I'm abandoning Washington State due to the ridiculous cost of living and the terrible Medical Care here

I have one distant family member in Maine and a few friends

I currently live on Social Security disability insurance due to many different impairments oh, I was born a pound and a half at 25 weeks in 1982

This left me with a multitude of vision problems, learning problems, cerebral palsy, and severe anxiety disorders

Are there any disabled teachers out there especially in Maine?

Could I do something else with an education degree?

Maine really needs some young workers in the next two decades oh, I would hope that my disabilities might be looked at as not too much of a big deal because they need people

I would love to take a more home then $970 a month I currently live on

I realize that the first year is probably going to be pretty brutal

And the average teacher lasts about three years

Is there something else that I could do like for example a teacher's assistant job?

I absolutely love learning and I love teachers I had in school, they're basically the reason I am alive after surviving horrendous family abuse for 30 years

Mother and twin brother and grandmother were extreme narcissists and did huge damage.

I'm under no illusion that I can help every kid, or that I have to be a hero

I just want to be a good teacher and make better than poverty level money somehow whlle I still have enough vision to do something

teaching,chickendevan,2019/04/11,"First year teaching and thinking about quitting Like the title says, this is my first year teaching and I'm thinking about quitting the profession for good. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started, I felt so passionate about helping kids grow, and I had a really great student teaching experience, even though the high school I was at had a poor reputation and is known for having lots of discipline problems and very little parent support.  

&amp;#x200B;

I got my first job at a high school that partners with a community college and helps students complete an associates or two-year degree while going to high school.  There are only 6 teachers total, me being one of them.  When I was interviewed, I was told ""there are no disciple problems"" and that disciple would be handled on a case by case basis.   

&amp;#x200B;

Although about half my students are absolutely wonderful and are highly motivated, the other half are honestly a nightmare for a variety of reasons.  Some are incredibly intelligent but refuse to do any work at all because they feel they shouldn't have to.  I hear them insult my coworkers.  Cheating is rampant and there are SO MANY disciple problems.  Kids having sex on the bus or on school property and literally nothing happens to them except having a talk with the principal.  A fight happened in my classroom and the aggressor got 2 days of ""ISD"" which apparently stands for in-school detention for my block only, and I actually heard this kid bragging about how he wasn't being punished whatsoever.  In the fall, another student forced open a door that I was physically guarding by standing in front of it, I was airborne and smushed against the door and the wall so that this kid could get out of my room to leave class early.  I immediately told the principal what happened, and this kid's punishment was that for two weeks, he would be bounced to another teacher's classroom for the last thirty minutes of my class.  When I complained to our principal that I did not feel supported, the principal told me that ""he didn't realize how serious the situation was.""  And then told me I should have written the student up.  I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I COULD WRITE A STUDENT UP.  IT WAS NEVER MENTIONED TO ME AT ALL DURING MY TRAINING.  I didn't even know where the forms were, and then come to find out neither did the principal!  

&amp;#x200B;

I communicate with parents constantly and nothing changes!  I think part of why I'm so upset is that this program my school offers is supposed to be based on merit and students must apply to get in.... and I just can't believe that more hasn't been done or that some of these repeat offenders haven't been kicked out of the program.  It feels like a regular public high school except with less support from administration.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry this post has gotten so long... I just feel completely disillusioned and I feel bitter.  I truly do feel like discipline is the biggest issue that I'm having with this job.  I do have an assigned mentor who works at another early college high school in the same county, and he has told me that next year will be better, and that I shouldn't leave because I won't ever find a position better than the one I'm in right now.  I do know that any school will have some problems and that no position is going to be perfect. I really felt like I was called to be a teacher when I started on this journey, and now I just feel like a shell of who I used to be.   Am I being crazy and overdramatic?  How do you know when enough is enough?",7.350910776174742,7.6806451715160895,7.284889578463769,73.44049951640204,63.594180704441044,10.181494317723867,36.47976948496817,9.93914555978268,3.672273506891272,2799,126,485,54,38,895,275,653,0.119,0.7859999999999999,0.095,-0.9587,5,0,0,0,1,0,80.0,1,1,5,12,32,30,7,1,38,0,76,2,0,6,7,102,123,48,0,12,10,2,9,5,1,9,0,3,3,6,32,36,0,5,23,0,1,7,15,14,0,9,33,13,56,16,70,69,15,74,0,0,0,2,42,34,0,8,35,361,88,34,0.0,0.0,0.04614194752493282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2561586635842939,0.2872735895149828,0.0643089035393163,0.14874285033334592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057647255728344136,0.0,0.0,0.05327239610687942,0.0,0.08363695755798523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048281815714767265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05001975175554452,0.04073061226120029,0.09915185554540988,0.05109674573920914,0.0,0.07550417274210335,0.0,0.0,0.03049399358295246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04838751274860557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771314335759096,0.0,0.0936910641331172,0.0427706997543699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04625240841707519,0.0,0.0,0.1673559702274222,0.10133818422443062,0.09079929226489324,0.0,0.08643266011574778,0.16087753569247218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0494074317561107,0.0,0.053744689554004015,0.03965921855030217,0.07563398719205564,0.05213030730415676,0.0,0.0,0.12543812510001207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05329202440793016,0.0,0.06338636596733749,0.29974615212611866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04935176663896644,0.09384330251795048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039432628791346,0.0385424236966988,0.0,0.10013295539727107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155018294504459,0.04739056302811765,0.0,0.04184447509759765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04019880377171845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04793812262558255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036468007239089134,0.0,0.0502866174113907,0.0,0.0,0.09073972907176267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408114695527044,0.07192257747287763,0.0,0.0,0.1050056266741316,0.0512035029340546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04528459354269046,0.0,0.0,0.18097597827832254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058380248222176,0.0,0.0,0.06058213658954365,0.048615389180674436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04037991387661784,0.0,0.03760179589985575,0.0,0.4306815114970334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053148718324416235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052930089973923365,0.06693511414466352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16097051845274182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038004745742946065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089221505228903,0.04645587142192633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22590740643864715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09237836252900612,0.0,0.0,0.04083782649205736,0.0,0.03901390051900293,0.0,0.0,0.03792803099321515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04266607108111533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051277019063537786,0.06884601009071446,0.0,0.0,0.06717778873119966,0.0,0.2872735895149828,0.1217962857141038

teaching,DALEKtible23,2019/04/11,"Still Struggling with Classroom Managment Hi all,

I'm a first year teacher and I've always known classroom management was my weakness but I've been super self aware since my last observation by our vice principal. I have one last observation coming up so I've been trying some new classroom management strategies but it doesn't seem to be helping much and any time I ask for advice from coworkers they always just say ""it's your first year, next year will be better.""

My biggest problem is students talking during class, either side conversations, unnecessary comments, blurting answers, or even blatantly yelling out to a friend across the class. I stop and wait until everyone is silent before I continue talking and am constantly reminding students that the only person who should be talking is the person who was called on. I also have a few students who have recently been really antsy in class and it's distracting for other students. I've tried having them take a walk and even reprimanding them but they got excited about getting in trouble which caused a new distraction. 

I'm really just starting to feel defeated and looking for any advice or strategies I could try.",7.713807245386193,9.281467492822973,7.2264012303486,69.8423086124402,63.06698564593303,10.181954887218048,36.93814080656186,10.290406445055957,4.259526042378673,962,46,144,22,14,301,132,209,0.111,0.8170000000000001,0.07200000000000001,-0.7579,0,0,0,0,1,0,15.0,1,1,4,5,8,11,0,3,8,0,20,1,0,1,2,31,32,15,0,3,8,0,1,0,1,2,1,2,0,3,9,10,0,2,4,0,0,2,1,7,0,3,6,4,15,4,17,20,5,28,0,1,1,0,23,8,0,4,18,96,24,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2501910361294456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10237415619581597,0.21303873317986816,0.0,0.0,0.17411021189120732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11967745377780288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10893198207551788,0.0,0.0,0.11321953571680768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13071840292613585,0.0,0.0,0.13150744802378758,0.0,0.1102742410608916,0.0,0.1383395570127525,0.0,0.10221016679876126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16910640290585136,0.0,0.0,0.12232454368866423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06472861417735291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21778027836244304,0.0,0.0,0.09890465782178524,0.0,0.06688295040513029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023858969087756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580626477980281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20869985918917947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10750099594027568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09410631252342423,0.0,0.0,0.2472768354557819,0.13614621196949106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674679135053676,0.09736175330612418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22355684586553665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249379242639888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16402034645138736,0.0,0.12640011804457346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10180326970761193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165407390287234,0.13354835580314836,0.0,0.0,0.10589595869660487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061021309098047,0.0,0.1022335504764683,0.10702690666340722,0.0,0.13382986647446424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09625191898609026,0.30868265372291936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464701852965018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.260742891492284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.247313854841422

teaching,maestroenglish,2019/04/11,"Teaching English to a non-native English speaking piano teacher! Curriculum advice sought! Hello all -

I am an English teacher with 15 years experience. I will soon teach a course to piano teachers, with the focus on improving their English for their piano tuition.

In my mind, I expect they will need specific technical vocabulary, grammar for instructing, key phrases that are probably repeated over and over and over and over, general English around modal verbs, politeness strategies, and a whole lot of other things. Some of my ideas have come from [this work](http://bdigital.uncu.edu.ar/objetos_digitales/5416/esp-music-oficial-corregido.pdf).

I was hoping I would find people in this community who could point me towards the kind of language these people would need, and maybe some interesting ways to teach this.

When completed I would be happy to share the finished product. I am aiming for this course to run for around 10 hours, split up into 5 lessons.

I hope this is an okay thing to post as I am really lost in life. I am a 24 years old and I am looking for some guidance and/or sage wisdom. 

I graduated from university in December 2017 with the intention of finishing some other prerequisite classes and going to nursing school. Well, it’s starting to look like nursing school is not going to work out, and with my major (human development and family sciences) there’s just not a lot out there that I can do. My goal was always being a healthcare provider because my big thing was that I wanted to directly make an impact on people, but as I get older I’m starting to realize that healthcare is not the only way to make an impact. 

I currently work as a “Residential Instructor” at the school for the blind in my state, and I love it. I think of my students as my own children, and I’ve never felt more supported by a work environment in my life (despite my age, I’ve had quite a few different jobs). Unfortunately, a $28k/year job just isn’t sustainable for me, especially because I live in a very expensive city.

Since nursing school isn’t looking like it’s panning out, I feel like I’ve hit a major road block in life. I don’t know what I should do. My whole life I’ve dreamed of working as a healthcare provider and now that that might not happen I’m at a loss.

My dad brought up that I look into getting a teaching certificate, and my roommate/coworker agrees. They knows how much I value my job now, and think that I would be good at it. The thing is, I’m not sure how good I am at teaching. I work with students with pretty heavy disabilities, so there’s not always a ton of pressure to actually ensure they learn the things they’re there to learn because the expectations are set pretty low. My students do learn things, but they’re mostly social skills and independent living skills. I don’t even know what subject I would teach, or if I’m even specialized/qualified enough any given subject to be able to teach it. 

As much as I love my job, I’m just not sure that teaching is what I love most about my job. I have a hard time explaining things, and while I get good reviews by my manager a lot of times I just don’t feel like I’m always getting through to my students. 

I could see myself being a teacher and probably being happy doing so, but I’m just worried that I’ll be a bad teaching and screw up a bunch of kids for life. 

What made you know that you were right for teaching? I’d love to hear any relevant, personal anecdotes or advice. 

I thank you in advance.",5.568278319579897,5.7359585310077525,6.3376594148537135,79.2715566391598,67.37209302325581,9.293723430857717,32.34283570892723,9.11188708381993,2.6588267816954234,2046,81,404,34,31,675,228,516,0.075,0.773,0.152,0.9929,7,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,0,3,2,12,19,26,1,1,28,1,37,11,0,7,3,78,85,31,0,8,18,1,4,4,0,4,6,1,0,4,27,21,0,1,14,1,1,4,13,6,1,0,9,12,54,20,60,64,17,45,0,3,7,5,18,23,1,11,18,267,81,35,0.06865082639057804,0.0,0.06699330355644167,0.0,0.0,0.06708479301406642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17136896118000078,0.0,0.0,0.0933698321654796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05732057248919864,0.1255467197212891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05481209870429178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07172550199458673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07093465518411413,0.0,0.0906864467392259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647178893539518,0.0,0.06942384109922198,0.09808832818102534,0.06591555922217131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14346889332283855,0.0,0.07803169339336101,0.1727431681800599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0607076990543523,0.07308008124969992,0.06149765604943869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737447073226808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06818576073055031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3406267609818013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15091479524019116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24245054462901025,0.13415730434901005,0.0,0.12123987488864965,0.0,0.2882470200782156,0.0,0.07494048662436657,0.11672895524097138,0.24784020449884095,0.06495907183830436,0.09164991939622844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07282767800026785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10093251292479788,0.0,0.052947749501615085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203749398490558,0.0,0.0,0.05221204699475025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04759383907405742,0.05994325361843773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657485148409968,0.13968514171362392,0.0740172020637503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07301860426363163,0.0,0.0,0.04397947729068052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11725486127162205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27791320559986016,0.054705820380835005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05678867300835142,0.0,0.0,0.06998087210276839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09718281652623084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790414423892865,0.1294051828479233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06320445741103428,0.0,0.0,0.27365135152289105,0.08797735510441401,0.0,0.0,0.08006169788733522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0566441214683902,0.040492036086742365,0.05449183055589932,0.0,0.0,0.06172533755793583,0.0,0.0,0.07664619600273068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2498930961986848,0.06971824659004629,0.0,0.09753515475886533,0.0,0.0,0.08841776277955161
teaching,chaoticwhitegirl95,2019/04/12,"Today was a rough meeting I’m a first year teacher at a title one school teaching special ed English I and II. I’ve honestly loved almost every minute of my job; even on the rough days I tend to reflect and really think about what I did/could do next time a similar situation arises. But for some reason, a meeting today felt extra rough. 

I have an ESL student who struggled in my class in the first half of the year, but was usually pleasant to have in the class. I wouldn’t say he tried in my class, but he at least was respectful. He enjoyed artistic assignments and PBL. He would come in dancing and try to show me his songs to dance to. But when we started the novel unit, he did a 180. I’m sure there were other things going on, but I also know for an ESL special ed student, novels are intimidating. He suddenly stopped giving any effort, then started coming in late to class every day, then stopped showing up. He’d come to school almost an hour late every day I had him (block scheduling). Thinking it was just the novel, I tried giving him an abridged version and coming to study hall; when that didn’t work I tried an English abridged along side a Spanish abridged. When I asked him if we could find assignments he enjoyed, he told me he wouldn’t any work. 

I later found out he was planning on dropping out when he turned 16 (next week). His mom agreed to sign off. His case manager is... frustrating to work with. She hasn’t finalized about 12 IEPs, and you have to email/call a LOT before getting a meeting about a student. Today we FINALLY had a meeting with my student, her, and myself. What made this all the more frustrating, the case manager said maybe 5 sentences the whole time. 

After much joking/prodding (he has a playful personality), he confirmed that he thinks he wants to drop out and move to a very far state to be with his father. I asked him if Mom was on board, he says “My mom told me to. My mom doesn’t want me living with her anymore. She’s pregnant again and I’m just extra work”. When I asked if that’s the only reason why he wanted to move (a very valid reason imo) he said yes. We started writing a pros/cons list including dropping out. He has a girlfriend here that is “the love of his life” (ah young love) and friends, but doesn’t feel he can get a job here. He said he can work with dad in flooring. We talked some more about working, license, getting a car. I asked him to think a lot over spring break, and talking more when we come back. If he comes back. His birthday is over break. 

He’s really quite a bright student, when he tries his work is high quality. He’s a talented drawer, dancer. He’s told me stories of him bring dinner every night to a homeless man that lives on the same street as him. I told him “I’m not trying to convince you to stay in school, or stay in this state.

teaching,chlomodo,2019/04/12,"A question: teachers with tattoos I hope this is the correct place to post this, if not please correct me! 

Did you feel that students/other teachers/the school overall etc react to you differently because you have them? Did you have face any difficulty being hired because of them? 

I ask because I wish to become a teacher (to teach language) and I have plans to get two medium sized tattoos on each on my forearms, nothing offensive or nothing that could'/nt be covered by sleeves or a cardigan 
Warning below: slight TMI
But I find this important to me as it's to cover up some scars, which I think when teaching tattoos would be more favourable

teaching,sarpaz,2019/04/13,"Thinking of quitting student teaching So I am thinking of dropping student teaching. My advisor came and observed me and put me on alert of failing. She says I don’t have good classroom management. She is very strict and counts how many correctives vs positives I give. She counts how many times I say “ok” and other crazy expectations. At this point I don’t like teaching anymore and have feeling anxiety and depression. I been going to school for 6 years but I think I’m done with school. I still haven’t made the choice but I feel it might be best for me.

teaching,BamBiffZippo,2019/04/13,"What do you do when you find a kid on Reddit that maybe oughtn't be? I was teaching earlier this week and a kid said something about a bakery being a karma store. The kid is 10. On Reddit mayhaps? I jokingly respond that no, Reddit is a karma store. He smiles and says, yeah, you're right.  I asked after class if he was on Reddit. Yep, he is. 

His parents don't know he's on Reddit, and I'm not sure if they would be understanding enough to monitor his well-being on Reddit without totally going over board. I gave him some safety pointers and explained to him how to not dox himself, and reminded him that it's important to be respectful online. 

Do I let his parents know so they can monitor him? I don't want him to be stifled in the anonymous world, but I want him to be safe. He believes in Santa.  He trusts that everybody is good.  I worry for him.

teaching,GroundbreakingIce7,2019/04/14,"grade 6 private tutoring student getting clingy  

i'm 23 adult male tutor

i'm tutoring music history (yes, that's a thing for those who wanna get really involved in music and theory!)

student is 6th-grade girl

this is really irritating me

she is always sneaking glances at me when she thinks i don't notice, i'm actually pretending not to notice, i wonder why she's doing it and this behaviour fuels her distraction from the lesson

when I look back at her and give her a ""stop looking at me "" facial expression, she maintains that eye contact and gazes slightly longer and slightly more intently than the average student would, which irritates me

she's always really nervous because of me, her mind wanders, i will say something, and tell her to look up the appendix of the textbook as well as the reading passage in the middle of the textbook,

then she only looks at the appendix without ever looking at the reading passage in the middle of the book,

probably because she wasn't fully paying attention ,she always seems distracted or not focused on what i'm saying because of this nervous energy vibing from her

and once i had a book in front of me, she sits a short distance beside me on a long table, and i pointed out a passage

she was afraid to lean or turn her head towards the textbook, she was nervous and she was hesitant to look anywhere near my direction, she would only look straight ahead or away, but never angled towards my direction

i told her mom that she was extremely nervous and that the student need not feel anxious in any way whatsoever during lessons

yesterday, i met up with them again, the student was now more enthusiastic (since her mom told her there was no need to be nervous)

but when I point to a passage in my book, she gets extremely close to me in terms of physical distance

almost like subtly brushing against me or frequently wanting more social attention than warranted, which I find annoying

i'm frustrated, irritated, and pissed off ,

once a practice exam paper was on top of the textbook, i told her to read a page on the textbook, and then she said ""oh i can't read it"", she seemed to imply that she wanted me to lift the exam paper off the book so it would no longer be covering the passage i wanted her to read

i hesitantly acquiesced to this implication, lifted the exam paper away so that it was no longer blocking her view of the reading passage

to be very honest, she could have done this herself.... she has hands and she is fully capable of doing so

after I lifted the exam paper away from the textbook, she giggled coyly....

i'm feeling there's some transference going on, but i'm not sure what to do or say

i'm also irritated that the student's mind wanders around, makes excuses not to do work, zones out, or i tell her something, and she forgets 5 seconds later.... and repeats questions over and over again

she also asks questions that could easily be answered with common sense , always asking, do we have to know this for the exam? will we lose marks if we don't memorize this? over and over again, it's extremely irritating

any advice?

also, how do i make her focus on the learning material and not be so distracted - she keeps on trying to sneak glances at me when she thinks i'm not noticing",10.230265597594588,7.729790638436482,10.051596091205212,65.05919569030321,59.553745928338756,12.768629416186421,42.67075920821849,11.130083040563493,4.835528138311202,2588,117,435,51,26,855,260,614,0.112,0.833,0.054000000000000006,-0.9881,0,0,2,0,0,0,64.0,3,0,1,6,22,18,3,9,35,1,39,7,7,4,3,89,84,44,0,12,18,2,3,1,0,5,0,4,0,3,27,27,0,3,18,11,1,2,16,13,1,1,16,19,77,5,80,56,6,72,0,1,11,0,72,45,1,14,24,325,104,39,0.0,0.0,0.06671654038063117,0.0,0.0,0.06680765187640747,0.0,0.0,0.06845989084517412,0.0,0.0,0.16401971295404286,0.2275480008021985,0.0,0.0,0.09298410210138087,0.0,0.0,0.07723549372521643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060861316615970135,0.12782823546572789,0.0,0.1926997488303244,0.05257016877505248,0.0,0.12502806028791186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10917131720399842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996339819567142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061842060648358524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06913703687074567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06248639652348585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107157145266095,0.06558406293539695,0.038854664174466015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016448719452037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06076792254957021,0.0,0.0,0.037572833761639335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033400768202961416,0.0,0.0,0.06050283445549591,0.4018786969330469,0.07648542665087296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912712946470622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13806279699919474,0.16014171335032376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138684824665528,0.05272901141099772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335095844419216,0.0,0.14561770679592778,0.0,0.10399269648632588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925823404406542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07371142171227812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15317385619068855,0.0,0.41031430071026737,0.0,0.1313933669554324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06503287801376456,0.1631050618213344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244778908613165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05655406726930747,0.0,0.0,0.06969176666415045,0.0,0.10526484544778608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05715805356094561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06443529165316325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11951191976243065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0454201402102568,0.08761390247697952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1959834130859383,0.0,0.04641685168142663,0.0743638984821721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05641011290161786,0.12097426536366247,0.054266713547485614,0.0,0.0,0.06147033743786985,0.0,0.06169077827995852,0.0,0.0,0.06590355619252566,0.07414132901742741,0.04977214723956519,0.0,0.0,0.14569832533005286,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,bunnysnitch,2019/04/15,"Students getting a little too comfortable with me. I teach 8th grade ELAR and I’m a notorious “chill” teacher, I guess? Despite trying very hard not to be. I’m kind and I like to build relationships with my kiddos but lately a few students have been pushing boundaries and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I am young. I get the “oh miss I thought you were a student at first hahahhahaha” often. 

Today was the stray that broke the camels back. I had a student bring up smoking marijuana today on multiple occasions all because I played a Bob Marley song. -.- three little birds... My 8th graders are obsessed with drugs/drug culture and it’s annoying! 

Today a kid brought it up and I point blank sat down with them and explained it made me feel uncomfortable because I am a teacher and they are a minor discussing illegal activities and when that happens I feel obligated to tell authorities. A lot of my students in this class have done this and I am not sure how I let on the idea that it’s okay. I feel bad because I apparently have when they do it so often. 

Every time it comes up I act outraged and they still don’t budge. When I told the student I would have to call home next they responded calmly with “that’s what I call a snitch?” Like what?!?! 

I’m just not sure how to handle it. It’s mostly with this one class with a few students whom I know discuss drugs often (a group of troubled boys some with records.) and I am just not sure how to handle it anymore. Any suggestions?",1.547204391891892,4.223698628472224,2.8922034534534538,88.19070945945947,87.02083333333331,5.474624624624624,24.103228228228225,7.001395882987947,1.10787225975976,1167,47,227,17,37,377,154,288,0.163,0.772,0.065,-0.9857,1,0,3,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,5,1,16,17,2,1,18,1,20,1,0,5,4,52,42,19,0,1,7,0,5,2,0,1,1,1,1,2,20,20,0,0,8,2,0,5,5,7,0,3,10,6,33,10,24,29,6,29,0,2,0,0,21,11,0,7,15,155,53,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467250517337649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12348255669682122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574212767506632,0.103962411799793,0.2277042815341276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25428157321259803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10725615855953184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12741911922128488,0.0,0.0,0.2887890375318619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10490682366985833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25182825794144864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590993799849922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13010487788568526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13716412787169374,0.0,0.11010564853824112,0.0,0.11153839477333452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1248957994169494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055901763808248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966020315309465,0.06842859992543987,0.0,0.140455084559148,0.0,0.0,0.1273220694378221,0.0,0.12166065615717765,0.2495876914284069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585574416592093,0.0,0.11781636999279295,0.08311280093620839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13242004259377396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437262880354998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11770419075364826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336794098433063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994355326730673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35205357319481817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10882907309608024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09884870798591573,0.07260401321639108,0.0,0.3540687671900212,0.11897665789736946,0.0,0.0845355501705507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027355315274278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08844983121817614,0.0,0.0,0.0

Recently, my principal made each sp ed teacher sit down with her to explain why any student had a D or F. They're also cutting our department by one teacher but not replacing her, so our caseloads will be even bigger. Not to mention caseload numbers are already growing because they're identifying kids as needing IEPs left and right for fear of being sued. My anxiety is through the fucking roof.

teaching,lesstocarry,2019/04/15,"Sick as hell with no sick days. I'm a daycare teacher teaching a class of wonderful 4 year olds, this is my first teaching gig and it's going great! Except I've been sick nonstop for my first 8 weeks and I don't get any (paid) sick time for three months. We're paid hourly so I could always call out, which I had to do last week for throwing up, but now I have bronchitis complicated by a bacterial infection and my doctor recommended that I take at least tomorrow off so I can have one day of antibiotics in me, and I've been coughing so much I can't sleep.

I am an early childhood development major making my way through school. I am a junior and so close to being a teacher. I was recently asked the question “ if done appropriately, which high leverage institutional practiced are used when teaching the standard algorithm for addition/subtraction?” I’m really confused about this question because I am constantly told that we shouldn’t be teaching the standard algorithm because it doesn’t cater to the needs of all students. Any guidance would be very appreciated! I’m still trying to figure this whole teaching thing out!!",9.105344036697248,11.642681862385324,8.343933486238534,59.50837729357801,60.65137614678899,10.587614678899085,44.817660550458704,10.686352973137794,5.894109174311928,549,34,68,14,8,172,82,109,0.025,0.904,0.071,0.7067,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,7,0,12,0,0,2,1,20,20,5,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,3,0,6,0,10,12,3,12,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,4,6,49,12,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771154659335354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17556917022039015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2289642578473874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2029468414199346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19218626811610945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17945250299927396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12587947212739942,0.39684546064998616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12535904456274666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785050541153463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4207616061174022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12031053141887656,0.0,0.18543145045555084,0.20162866498183504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19006527313324795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14997862219865352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476705633860648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17945250299927396,0.0,0.12750497735120392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1622003080062814,0.0,0.15495601074507376,0.0,0.14906819034788438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20967381015867484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13340888778080198,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,mn11475,2019/04/16,"Asked to teach AP gov First time posting here and I’m looking for some insight. I just started in a new district this fall and I LOVE it. I just got a call from admin while on spring break basically telling me they would like me to teach AP Gov next year and asking if I
would be interested. While they phrased it as a question I’m new here and don’t feel like I can say no. They are also willing to send me to a training session over this summer to help me prepare. 

The truth is I’m intimidated by teaching an AP course. Out of all the AP courses gov is the one I would feel most confident teaching, but in my old district I taught ELL students and a disadvantaged inner city population. In my new district I taught honors level last semester and am teaching their lowest level students this semester. The truth is I am enjoying working with the lower level students. I feel like my strengths as a teacher are patience, being enthusiastic about subject matter, and breaking things down to help students get concepts, improve writing, and analyze texts... While I loved teaching honors level last semester my biggest reflection was that I didn’t feel as “needed” as I did in my previous district. The kids pretty much taught themselves. I was there more to facilitate discussions and assign work/give feedback. I still loved it don’t get me wrong, but this semester I’ve felt much more in my element... I don’t have the behavior problems I had in my precious district, but I also feel like I am playing an active role as a teacher who is making a difference. 

I’m worried about how I would feel about teaching all AP students... I’m also worried about the grading workload to be completely honest. The district will be changing from from a block schedule to a period schedule so I would have more classes at a time which I anticipate will be a LOT of extra grading. Having never taught an AP course I was wondering if someone could shed some light on what I should expect in terms of that. 

I’m open and excited about this opportunity, but would love to hear from anyone who has some thoughts, advice, etc.",5.778663324979114,6.9395801328320825,6.231979949874687,76.7032247284879,67.22055137844612,8.51762740183793,34.82790309106099,8.735056554316923,3.0559697577276523,1679,80,293,26,27,543,192,399,0.069,0.711,0.22,0.9968,2,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,4,6,16,22,0,0,24,0,39,4,0,2,5,59,72,29,0,13,8,0,7,4,0,10,0,2,0,1,15,13,0,1,12,1,0,2,6,2,0,2,13,11,40,20,43,43,15,48,0,0,1,4,24,20,0,9,27,209,55,26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319145827080466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2287946935124041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06668277342375696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17831040811422028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09738029611272317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10088556458223727,0.0,0.09999040953823116,0.0,0.0,0.07614273190147845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963814190616184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10635933378846774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28932230540417153,0.20439045717749302,0.09156720637658834,0.0,0.0,0.08111906020772593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965056747249992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627364422725702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074854588723233,0.0,0.12784488313103862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15547354948950726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18636585533390426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08008420071496783,0.0,0.0,0.08107755180114119,0.34428950344288184,0.0,0.06365816495211776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14021133022541316,0.07071336869514487,0.07355285403024432,0.2763179198889214,0.10142380980362957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007154845390998,0.0,0.06462309850371423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09133515513549212,0.09702245076859,0.0,0.09125327047633466,0.0,0.0,0.10683278506614972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583960886496219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808040885862848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0675012024636083,0.0,0.07616015186231291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08335489850779665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06335754935510624,0.0,0.0,0.07571068821397141,0.11121844523233344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10342136529587498,0.13885651874444258,0.19369948913601445,0.0,0.4064755764875681,0.10426876477717092,0.0,0.06141317488108493
teaching,bmiyares319,2019/04/17,"Alternative Teaching certification Hi you guys so I have a question and randomly searching on the internet has not helped. So my goal is to become a Spanish teacher. To make a long story short I finished my 1st degree of a BA in Psych with a Spanish minor, but really wanted to do Spanish major, am now back in school for 2 semesters to get a cross disciplinary Spanish degree (thanks to minor credits from before I only need 2 semesters), and am trying to figure out how to get certified as a teacher without having to take more years of classes (no $$$). Does anyone know of any alternative routes to take for this? My school does offer a Foreign Language Education program but even with my Spanish credits it would have taken me 3 more years to finish and by that time I could be finishing a masters (which I do also want to do at some point) and all advice is welcome!

teaching,fishakin,2019/04/17,"Received an email after a student walked out of my class, not sure how to respond. Today we were journaling as a warmup exercise and they came in late and sat in the corner. I told them we were journaling and they pulled out a notebook, journaled for a minute then left. They sent me an email saying they didn't leave the building, but there wasn't a place for them in the class. I saw them sitting in the student lounge after class. Granted the class was full, and there weren't any spots at tables. However, we've all fit before so it was just a matter of moving some chairs to find a spot.

teaching,worsthumanalive,2019/04/17,"I need serious help with teaching a 5th grader math. I’m currently volunteering for one of my old elementary school teachers and I mostly help around the classroom and teach the kids how to paint. I’ve been tasked with helping this kid with his math and I don’t know where to begin. 
The teacher and I have tried everything, (this is a Montessori school) from bead boards, tablets and whatever we can find to “visualize” division and multiplication. I’m at a loss. He is not retaining any of the information, from what I see, he doesn’t really understand what it even means to divide or multiply. 

I’ve tried explaining the material as thoroughly as I can with stuff like: 

You have 8 candies. If you want to give an equal amount to 4 of your friends, how many do each of them get? 

It’s just really not getting through to him, and I’m looking for some advice on where to start. It needs to be extremely basic stuff, because he is unable to do multiplication unless it’s 2s or 5s. 
Thanks in advance. :)",5.334302884615383,6.389027510416668,6.149166666666666,77.28173076923079,68.16666666666666,10.074358974358978,31.43589743589744,10.214889679676881,3.165925801282052,790,32,153,20,13,260,122,192,0.019,0.872,0.109,0.9413,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,1,3,1,2,7,5,0,0,9,0,13,0,0,2,0,35,31,15,0,4,7,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,10,14,0,1,6,0,0,1,4,2,0,1,1,2,14,3,30,29,5,11,0,1,2,0,19,6,0,5,5,99,24,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16571413164661458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153219676480798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15096444719451066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10337596497878906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200769278930836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15240988553091764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15499540320279132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13101907838346985,0.0,0.17719979452205986,0.16267906046603978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3410028803062542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319814939509116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08284948121396607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14240665428294616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17193011612015074,0.0,0.18472514127505324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25148666426210337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779483877844529,0.0,0.11491354306032553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172778825737442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3432532431713042,0.135135358001699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12003142089325508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3882629569587328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1561288528365707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23027087628785986,0.0,0.0,0.17654144339004252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10002419769426599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, it seems that the secondary schools I could teach at (if I don't get funded) are hiring right now, and in order to get a good job if I don't get funding for the PhD, I might need to commit to a contract with a school in the next month or two.

teaching,ITGUYBurner,2019/04/17,"I was given a unicorn teddy I'm an IT Guy in a UK Secondary School / 6th Form (11-18) and have been there for less than two years and i am new to the education sector too.   
Throwaway for privacy.

\_

I Thought i would share this story as it may cheer some of you up, or at-least make you smile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago i was talking to one of the Year 11's (15/16) during lunch as i supervise one off the IT Rooms, i cannot remember what exactly about but it ended in them saying that they would bring me a big unicorn teddy in to brighten up my office. I Somewhat assumed they were joking and we carried on talking about whatever we were talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days later, they come into the IR Room with a bag, containing a pretty big Pink unicorn with a rainbow (main?)  and tail. 

Now i have a big pink unicorn sat behind my monitors, peering over them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I Have some feeling that it was done partially to try to embarrass me, either way it makes me smile every-time i look at it and it warms my heart that i could've had any effect on a student in the time i have been there, never mind enough for them to get me a gift.

teaching,DogPejnis1488,2019/04/17,"My principal is discriminating against me So start off I teach grade 1. Extremely well. My students have IQ off the charts.

Any way we have had a lot of shootings in my school as can be expected from a school that declares itself a gun free zone. Like most people my students have that tickle in their brain that tells them to kill, and in ordinary circumstances that would not be possible because someone else would be carrying and smoke their shit first. Kids that try that in a lot of places get their shit smoked like in that funny YouTube video where that guy smokes human feces. Google it it's hilarious and nearly 20 minutes long. Any ways.

So ever since the principal said this is a gun free zone no guns aloud not even for teachers there has been a mass shooting every other week usually by kids making Instagram videos or trying to skip class. Usual child things but with more bodies. School protocol is to hide like a pussy and hope the shooter runs out of bullets.

Not in my classroom. I open carry. Even when I take a shit I hold my gun with one hand and wipe with the other. Sometimes I'm dual wielding so I have to ask one of the kids to wipe my ass instead. I have smoked the shit out of 3 shooters and countless more potential shooters this year. I've saved hundreds of lives in the process. Thousands if you count the fact that most mass shooters are never caught and go on to reoffend. You won't hear about that in the media because you know who owns the media but any ways. I'm a hero and I make sure my students know it every single day. I've used entire weeks of class time to teach them how much an hero I am. I scream this at them sometimes for hours, at the end of the day my throat is raw like I've been sucking hundreds of dicks.

So any way the other day the principal said come inside of me to my office. I said that sounds gay but sure. This time I'm dual wielding Uzis with infrared scopes. The principal makes a big show of having to turn the doorknob for himself because my hands are filled with guns. It's very passive aggressive. I know I'm in for some bullshit lecture, probably about indecent exposure or whatever. Before he even opens his mouth I say bro do you want me to shit my pants, if I'm duel wielding and need to make dooky the kids gotta help me out, at some point the kids are gonna see my dick, it's not sexual, I'm not a nonce like you bro. Then he says no this is not about how you make dooky this is about our gun free zone. You must abide by the gun free zone or be suspended with pay. I just laughed and walked out of the office.

So any way the next day I go to school and find on my classroom door the door is locked, my key won't work. After several minutes of kicking the door I see there is a notice on this door. Normally I don't read until I'm on the clock but I figure whatever, I'll file overtime for this later. So I read the notice the notice which says this teacher has been suspended with pay for violation of the gun free zone. I'm like bro what the fuck this is unconstitutional. Then I hear another voice screaming on the other side of the door. Someone else is teaching my class! This guy he is making potty mouth wards at the children and telling them to noose it, that's my job! What the fuck man, this is gay! Now at this point I'm really sad. I kind of want to off myself but what's the point no-one is watching.

So I call up my buddy he is a lawyer or at least tells people he is which is good enough. It's not like the judge checks the hologram on a law degree or asks to see your tattoo and measures your dick like when people say they're a teacher. I'd have to make more verifying towards the judge than my buddy would for saying he's a lawyer. So any way I call up my buddy who says he's a lawyer and tell him the whole story. At this point I'm driving so I can't use my hands on the steering wheel, I just have to hope the road doesn't bend, I have one hand on my cellphone and the other on my gun, which is a needler. So I call up my buddy and say inside of him what happened, suspended with pay, changed the locks, other man teaching my class, ect he says four words my friend shall not be infringed. Gun free zones are illegal. You could actually go into his house right now and open carry and call the police on him for wanting you to leave and they would give you his house as restitution for being a victim of a crime.

My buddy then says he is doing a class action lawsuit on behalf of teachers who.open carry and he takes a retainer in Ethereum so if anyone has any Ethereum they want to chip in, a couple ETH here and there for the cause and for saving children's lives and our Consitution please feel free:

https://i.redd.it/ota9pxsdbss21.jpg

 

Over the past few years, the traditional model of education has taken a back seat. Social media platforms and the internet brings us the concept of a flat classroom and global collaboration where students are made to learn about what is happening in the world.

Education is indeed borderless, meaning that whatever that is being taught in one country can be introduced into another country, making students more aware of the opportunities to come in the future. It has a crucial role in making a child aware of a place he has never been to and pushes him to explore his potential.

At  Sky World School, one of the [best schools in sector 21](https://www.theskyschool.com/), Panchkula, we make sure our students become successful global citizens by introducing them to the different aspects of flat classroom and global collaboration.

With the arrival of technology, the geographical boundaries, are becoming less relevant and is bridging a gap between classrooms and nations. It has now become a necessity to encourage students to harness their skills in knowing the planet better. Students not only get to know about cultural diversity but get to embrace it as well.

**Below are some of the advantages of global education:**

* Introduction of new techniques.
* Amalgamation of technology and education.
* It helps to expand a child’s perspective to view the world.

https://i.redd.it/scc9ih9k4ss21.jpg

 

Free thinking in the system of education gives birth to creativity and innovation. We at Kaintal, one of the [Best ICSE Schools in Patiala](https://kaintalschool.com/) firmly believe of the same. And thus, have laid a few essentials that highlight the importance and need for the same.

**- Encourage Children to Find the Answer**

The learning process through spoon feeding is something long gone. And, as educators, and deliverers of knowledge we must ensure that students find answers on their own, this enables an active approach towards observation, imagination, and reasoning. 

**- Focus on the Concept**

Imparting knowledge as facts and figures help to orient students while inhibiting creativity and an ability to imagine. By focusing on the concepts, we help the students to find solutions by themselves we promote exploration of ideas and thus evaluation of best results.

**- Important for Instilling Traits of Open-Mindedness**

Rather than accepting what one is being told, free-thinking enables one to preserve one’s own sense of identity and utilize their intellect. Any individual should be encouraged to think extraordinarily and unconventionally.

**- Responsiveness** 

When an individual is in a state where he/she thinks freely, he becomes a better-informed person and thus is able to respond better to whatever thrown at him. 

At Kaintal, featuring among[ Top ICSE Schools in Patiala](https://kaintalschool.com/), we believe that one of the essential features of having such an education system is to actively discourage rote learning and thus encourage critical thinking. The main purpose of education should be to acquire knowledge and the enhancement of skills rather than having a judgment based on a scorecard/ mark sheet. Memorizing of facts and cementing into one’s memory should not be a part of the education process. Imparting education implies facilitating students to understand the larger rhetoric rather than mugging up insignificant details.",9.142147950089127,13.3860218006536,7.770154486036841,55.870240641711256,66.2875816993464,10.767914438502677,43.913250148544265,10.436869588844218,6.563275816993464,1685,106,189,54,33,512,170,306,0.026,0.775,0.2,0.9949,0,0,1,0,0,0,80.0,5,0,2,9,6,10,0,0,25,0,16,1,0,6,3,64,26,19,0,8,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,5,21,1,1,24,0,2,4,1,1,0,6,2,0,8,11,51,16,9,28,0,1,0,0,19,17,0,0,4,143,13,10,0.1168386302034208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12659460701074235,0.14197172432252014,0.07945427510567568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903908751470655,0.0,0.2632742517979197,0.2452298680556864,0.2066685472487074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32036517388700897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112082260542463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15662894194545973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13189659185271482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339851103275287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08663436383892885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4750372778001264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12652485066890934,0.0,0.0,0.1020189852175724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12012957129549785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23649386296525185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08994808574960278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.449192858983432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11164431816886662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12163313457736573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14197172432252014,0.0
teaching,Flobagob,2019/04/17,"Looking for ways to make my accounting lessons more engaging I'm in my first year as an accounting teacher, teaching grade 9s (15 to 16 yr-olds) and am really struggling to make my lessons exciting and engaging for the kids. A big problem is that, in my country, learners get a choice for their subjects when they get to grade 10 and most of them won't be taking accounting. So now they feel like accounting is a waste and that there's no point in them trying if they're not doing it next year.

Any suggestions on how to make my lessons a little more interesting?

teaching,strawbeariesox,2019/04/17,"NES 102 test for elementary ed I'm so nervous!! I'm tasking NES 102 (language arts and social studies) tomorrow in WA (Bellevue area). My grad school application depends on me passing this and test 103 (math, science, health, and art). I studied for a week straight. Did two full practice tests, some additional practice questions, and tomorrow it's do or die I guess.

Trying to make ends meet as an assistant teacher is really tough. Between paying for these tests and a math for teaching elementary school prereq, I'm getting so stressed out from the financial strain! Yikes. My SO is going to treat me to dinner tomorrow though..  hopefully it's going to be a celebration instead of consolation.

Anyway, I'm hoping I'll see questions that are familiar from the practices tests.

teaching,DogPemnis1488,2019/04/18,"Principal is discriminating against me So start off I teach grade 1. Extremely well. My students have IQ off the charts.

Any way we have had a lot of shootings in my school as can be expected from a school that declares itself a gun free zone. Like most people my students have that tickle in their brain that tells them to kill, and in ordinary circumstances that would not be possible because someone else would be carrying and smoke their shit first. Kids that try that in a lot of places get their shit smoked like in that funny YouTube video where that guy smokes human feces. Google it it's hilarious and nearly 20 minutes long. Any ways.

So ever since the principal said this is a gun free zone no guns aloud not even for teachers there has been a mass shooting every other week usually by kids making Instagram videos or trying to skip class. Usual child things but with more bodies. School protocol is to hide like a pussy and hope the shooter runs out of bullets.

Not in my classroom. I open carry. Even when I take a shit I hold my gun with one hand and wipe with the other. Sometimes I'm dual wielding so I have to ask one of the kids to wipe my ass instead. I have smoked the shit out of 3 shooters and countless more potential shooters this year. I've saved hundreds of lives in the process. Thousands if you count the fact that most mass shooters are never caught and go on to reoffend. You won't hear about that in the media because you know who owns the media but any ways. I'm a hero and I make sure my students know it every single day. I've used entire weeks of class time to teach them how much an hero I am. I scream this at them sometimes for hours, at the end of the day my throat is raw like I've been sucking hundreds of dicks.

So any way the other day the principal said come inside of me to my office. I said that sounds gay but sure. This time I'm dual wielding Uzis with infrared scopes. The principal makes a big show of having to turn the doorknob for himself because my hands are filled with guns. It's very passive aggressive. I know I'm in for some bullshit lecture, probably about indecent exposure or whatever. Before he even opens his mouth I say bro do you want me to shit my pants, if I'm duel wielding and need to make dooky the kids gotta help me out, at some point the kids are gonna see my dick, it's not sexual, I'm not a nonce like you bro. Then he says no this is not about how you make dooky this is about our gun free zone. You must abide by the gun free zone or be suspended with pay. I just laughed and walked out of the office.

So any way the next day I go to school and find on my classroom door the door is locked, my key won't work. After several minutes of kicking the door I see there is a notice on this door. Normally I don't read until I'm on the clock but I figure whatever, I'll file overtime for this later. So I read the notice the notice which says this teacher has been suspended with pay for violation of the gun free zone. I'm like bro what the fuck this is unconstitutional. Then I hear another voice screaming on the other side of the door. Someone else is teaching my class! This guy he is making potty mouth wards at the children and telling them to noose it, that's my job! What the fuck man, this is gay! Now at this point I'm really sad. I kind of want to off myself but what's the point no-one is watching.

So I call up my buddy he is a lawyer or at least tells people he is which is good enough. It's not like the judge checks the hologram on a law degree or asks to see your tattoo and measures your dick like when people say they're a teacher. I'd have to make more verifying towards the judge than my buddy would for saying he's a lawyer. So any way I call up my buddy who says he's a lawyer and tell him the whole story. At this point I'm driving so I can't use my hands on the steering wheel, I just have to hope the road doesn't bend, I have one hand on my cellphone and the other on my gun, which is a needler. So I call up my buddy and say inside of him what happened, suspended with pay, changed the locks, other man teaching my class, ect he says four words my friend shall not be infringed. Gun free zones are illegal. You could actually go into his house right now and open carry and call the police on him for wanting you to leave and they would give you his house as restitution for being a victim of a crime.

My buddy then says he is doing a class action lawsuit on behalf of teachers who.open carry and he takes a retainer in Ethereum so if anyone has any Ethereum they want to chip in, a couple ETH here and there for the cause and for saving children's lives and our Consitution please feel free:

teaching,ICanMathGood,2019/04/18,"Exit Slip Tools for Math Hi,

Looking for a way to give students a short, quick assessment for each lesson, an exit slip for math.  I tried making one on Google Forms but it was not math-friendly, too much of a pain to write equations in the multiple choice.  I've previously also used Kahoot for review games, but that was more a class activity, I'm looking for a quick way to get quick, individual feedback, preferrably also easy to track.  Also, must be math friendly, preferably one where I could type LaTex.

Also, if you have any non-digital exit slip tips, I'd like to hear that too.",5.914642857142855,6.499379035714284,6.348214285714287,78.04678571428572,66.67857142857143,8.542857142857143,29.392857142857146,8.418075326091056,2.0921642857142846,460,15,85,6,7,149,75,112,0.04,0.858,0.102,0.7876,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,1,10,3,0,0,7,0,6,1,0,2,1,12,14,7,0,4,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,2,3,3,2,14,9,4,12,0,0,2,0,7,7,0,1,4,53,6,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6164689795678149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1310554692773323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1538703701434359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977883078483032,0.0,0.10068767772764453,0.18487354183925386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21720822104362025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941527261572062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3236706984088142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286413707418353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14167057538730718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26118264575661104,0.0,0.20506651085059785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13084349134980486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664472637730732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3059426052143886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,peabeequeen,2019/04/18,"How to know if teaching is right for you? Switching careers 3+ years after college has ended... Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year or so, I've been contemplating on and off becoming a teacher - maybe middle school science or high school biology/ecology/environmental science - in either CA (where I currently live) or WA (where I want to live/my sister lives).

&amp;#x200B;

My background: I graduated in 2016 with a B.S.  in Environmental Science and a minor in Conservation Biology. Since then, I've worked in program administration for a university-based research institute that focuses on education, worker's rights, and immigrant's rights. I currently work doing regulatory work and research administration at a research hospital.  I was part of a sorority for women in STEM, did two independent research projects in undergrad (one focusing on the response of CA salt marshes to sea level rise, the other focusing on ecological responses of keystone species to urban development), and continued as a part-time consultant on the urban development study until late 2017. My GPA was kind of mediocre (3.1), mostly because I worked full time in undergrad and also struggled a bit the first year of college and spent the rest of the time bringing the GPA up.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I feel like STEM Education is something I could be good at and enjoy, but also have so many self doubts! What if I'm a bad teacher? What is my GPA isn't good enough to get into a teaching program? What if my introverted nature makes me hate being in the classroom, and I realize only after it's too late? I also have generalized anxiety disorder, so I also worry if I could handle the stress and anxiety of teaching (though, I will say that my current job is very stressful - albeit in a different way).

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just looking for general guidance, especially from people who (1) had mostly average academic performance in college (2) worked in a different field before transitioning to teaching (3) are introverted/have anxiety. How did ya'll know it was the right move for you?",9.136730769230773,9.372072947802202,9.629428571428573,58.440571428571474,59.9065934065934,12.664615384615386,42.925274725274726,12.07096230602999,5.778754285714286,1659,90,245,49,20,559,200,364,0.108,0.862,0.03,-0.9844,6,0,1,0,0,0,78.0,0,2,0,9,15,11,1,4,23,0,22,0,0,4,1,41,35,31,0,7,10,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,9,12,0,1,4,0,1,3,1,6,0,3,8,4,22,5,47,22,9,55,0,0,1,0,9,33,0,11,19,168,31,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392122511067345,0.0,0.3241046532801175,0.36347280167492657,0.0,0.0,0.17162385896453458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062439767415026215,0.04558635546655297,0.08259073926227327,0.06363389359703475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08164247241626651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11941453289812687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15626234937244973,0.08570654245514735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06623457179015478,0.07726969880134724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03781197834433702,0.05342420820121861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636094505800923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03907045909240222,0.0,0.0,0.12544702858914158,0.0,0.0,0.08238069984839007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738316494939191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07901118892773354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07420950212960703,0.0,0.0,0.07787384678469338,0.08219635904770059,0.0,0.16871449325396476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03653466162675525,0.0,0.19810137776190226,0.0,0.06279796628042993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049917502584126826,0.07581711465007435,0.0751284754036711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07948133071221504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05067415450916358,0.056875008902413725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16196303233472567,0.07138779050849636,0.051844357324454866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2554533546384544,0.0,0.059469572745985584,0.0,0.15136656147746572,0.0,0.0,0.07801383672010156,0.0,0.0,0.061860364969620926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0575707643347941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17132484008056315,0.07817828447698279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347284242386411,0.0,0.08721186090525028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305105539646356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061702903797432464,0.04410830537139998,0.059358395741258924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27221058910754764,0.07594465499252019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36347280167492657,0.1444712858813253
teaching,CoolioDaggett,2019/04/18,"Teacher vs Non-teacher Interviews I'm on a hiring committee for a teaching position.  We interviewed several candidates, one of which was not a teacher but has years of applicable industry experience.  It was very interesting to hear the answers from the Non-teacher.  I wish I could've recorded them and played them for everyone who thinks teaching is just about the content and nothing else.  All of our questions are the same for all candidates but we can ask one follow up.  

When asked how they'd adjust to a class with a lot of students with IEPs, they answered ""everyone should be treated fairly"".  When asked about classroom management, they just responded to every question with ""I'd build relationships and be their friend."" When I asked the follow up what would you do with a student that just didn't want to have a relationship with you, just clashes with you, or is purposefully trying to push your buttons, they responded ""I don't know, I've never had that happen, kids just like me.""

Every response was just as clueless to what the profession entails as those examples.  I know most people are clueless about what actually happens in a classroom, but it was so clearly on display in these interviews that it was almost laughable.  Sad part is, I wouldn't be all that surprised to see our admin hire the Non-teacher.",9.431375,8.762672054166668,8.73,68.09500000000003,59.70833333333334,11.833333333333336,42.08333333333333,11.038039088145766,4.816833333333333,1063,53,174,23,12,336,135,240,0.053,0.8590000000000001,0.08800000000000001,0.8826,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,4,4,7,0,15,7,0,0,15,0,24,0,0,1,5,46,40,14,0,5,12,0,0,1,1,3,0,1,0,1,14,11,0,0,8,1,0,3,5,1,0,2,7,2,22,6,32,26,7,14,0,1,1,0,32,6,0,6,6,135,36,13,0.0,0.0,0.13458313550552198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380998881798155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5157199290300811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011226071344317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11520856497889508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2323952005979423,0.2635634490807309,0.0,0.13490531898525535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10655119553115036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439119152014036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554379068716279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15158669045546572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06737729635562315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11724864998916078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063669615857168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323311857047279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1869067550599228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14934627477541207,0.0,0.09561146791239224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3089881118835639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2961337707079552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10989875773258133,0.0,0.0,0.15580236712745382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836904343326929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363383358821066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379261911974467,0.08134462536192602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585930750790958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796939583972984,0.0,0.0,0.08881141186917407
teaching,nothingofimportance0,2019/04/18,"How can I help my student focus? So I teach my student English (I'm not qualified), we do basic speaking and listening. 
Anyway, maybe it's the way I'm not engaging him properly but he fiddles and spins his chair around a lot especially with the harder sections.

We did 'introduce myself'where we would say our name age likes/hobbies and family. English is his second language so he finds it difficult to grasp and put into sentences.

How do I make my lessons more enjoyable for him to understand so it's ingrained in his head?",3.0993939393939414,5.915935303030306,4.368484848484851,79.7727272727273,79.8080808080808,7.640404040404039,31.222222222222214,8.575989854853784,3.1214161616161618,421,22,71,10,11,138,71,99,0.049,0.871,0.08,0.4645,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,4,0,0,1,7,3,0,0,3,0,6,1,1,3,0,23,11,10,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,3,10,0,0,4,0,0,1,2,1,0,1,1,3,15,2,7,9,3,7,0,0,0,0,16,4,0,1,1,51,18,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2806950155758425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2972486057350534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881899541561297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.323601639284434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2113473526996354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680674504426611,0.0,0.0,0.2104735725176692,0.0,0.3167738327727297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3169761980682358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507491918461319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32825147988851505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2502804219727353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22398898551575727,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,omeezuspieces,2019/04/18,"Temporary License - Nationwide Hey there Teachers of Reddit,

I am an upcoming college grad, getting a bachelors degree in a non-eduction field, hoping to become a teacher. I am looking at potentially relocating to Boston. This works because the process for getting a provisional license in Massachusetts is simply to take some tests. I could be licensed to teach temporarily as soon as the upcoming school year.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering, is anyone aware of other states that have similar temporary licensing options so that I could get in a classroom in the upcoming year?

teaching,N23,2019/04/18,"Had an interaction with a student today that had me stumped. Also, do you have a good system for loaning/giving students pencils? I have pencils for them to use, but they never return them or I forget to get them back. Any bright ideas? I teach 8th grade social studies (13-14 year olds).

**First, here was how the interaction with this student went:**

We were learning about the geography of Asia:
 
Student: We don’t need to know this, I don’t need to know about any of this.

Me: Why is that?

Student: None of this is important.

Me: Any knowledge you gain is important. Geography is important so you know where things are in the world and you can be an informed citizen.

Student: I’d rather just remain dumb.

Me: You’d rather be ignorant and stupid than smart?

Student: Yea. I guess we need elementary school, maybe up to 7th grade, but after that we don’t need school.

Me: How do you plan on supporting yourself in a capitalist society.

Student: I don't know and I don't really care.

So I proceeded to give the usual arguments about getting a job, having skills that are valued by others, not being ignorant of the world around you, if you're not intelligent people can take advantage of you, being a contributing member of society, etc. But I don't really know what to say to a kid with this much apathy. 

Any ideas?

**Second, the pencil issue. I know kids forget/lose pencils or simply don't have them due to their socioeconomic status. But I loan tons out throughout the year and end up having many not returned to me. In the past I have:**

* Asked for collateral. They would leave a shoe or something to make sure I got the pencil back.
* Had a sign out sheet, this was hard to track and I am not sure why.
* Wrote their name on the board. This turned out to be painstaking and kids would erase their name.
* Fastened stickers on the tops of pencils so I could know they were mine, similar to the main office that has flowers sticking out of their pens. The students ended up just tearing the stickers off.

Any ideas on the pencil issue?

**Thank you all and keep fighting the good fight.**",1.2489659736156788,3.9139262468513887,2.4901566836015903,89.19417111386245,92.57682619647356,5.311172778892543,20.582717841437894,6.921425479487867,0.7607629167911885,1628,55,310,26,59,520,191,397,0.087,0.8029999999999999,0.11,0.8939,2,0,1,0,3,0,78.0,4,9,11,6,18,16,4,0,26,1,41,1,1,4,4,72,68,21,0,10,16,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,4,15,19,0,3,13,0,1,1,13,6,0,2,10,3,46,10,50,49,6,39,0,0,1,0,40,20,1,5,17,219,61,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787285985085685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33110065647996795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866867407669838,0.09103494408803864,0.0,0.0,0.1497547817256309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992829891733801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774811817963426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17249536350861355,0.0,0.10860180409067242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282936692909337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10175159076961234,0.09341350102561666,0.0,0.1633514810521949,0.07788179064871473,0.0,0.1072724438489861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872312344049669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32978249257315073,0.0,0.20327390371528256,0.09663227752264664,0.08655371657898818,0.0,0.0,0.3746134124093335,0.0,0.0,0.10310885567205018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500032778177484,0.09872563827522744,0.09782892320691712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07158376643613361,0.28881713113755103,0.07510363556422102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218144767488332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929579715020534,0.067509391401256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476521347308447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743860412520645,0.0,0.19710273154498897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09926423623939594,0.0,0.07496606117468063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11050298667905674,0.1835545379022268,0.0,0.07321586302741287,0.0,0.0,0.08965224358190806,0.0,0.0,0.06469337403347311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230261229476433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591890462742327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08410301166132413,0.10724770798859208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09027004360411482,0.17573633965930247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383485565800351,0.0,0.0,0.1254160090977357
teaching,StarsAndTheSky,2019/04/18,"Been considering teaching high schoolers. Thoughts? To give a little background, I used to teach art for elementary students. I have a BFA and am earning my master’s. I gave the age group I taught a shot since I was interested in teaching, but wasn’t sure what group (dream job is professor, but need my master’s and more experience). 

My question to those of you that have or are teaching high schoolers, no matter the subject, how do you find it? Compared to the other age groups, on average, would you say it’s better or worse?",3.8133555555555536,6.114117980000002,4.437333333333335,83.03922222222225,74.2,6.844444444444445,29.11111111111111,7.793537801064563,1.9604777777777767,418,18,77,6,9,133,70,100,0.07,0.826,0.104,0.3378,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,3,0,4,1,3,0,0,6,0,10,0,0,2,1,15,16,7,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,6,2,0,0,3,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,1,11,3,8,9,1,7,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,3,2,50,17,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21527551486774227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2381007470042366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2224714522273974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335001302039691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5143500282861416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415459129109878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439598032646557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18048471844359346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27267383083296426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935686378041943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20135047265911496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2294101389473985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19323958817998607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21022725792152674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480546061003281,0.17291079779843915,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,modelmaybenot,2019/04/18,"I cant imagine the day I cut off contact with my students For context, I’m 20, Male. Teaching at a student care centre for a month now.
(In case some people have no idea what a student care is, - its like a day care centre but instead of kids/toddlers, they take in students from elementary school. They come here immediately after school to do their school work, and have tuition with the teachers, all the way till late evening when their parents would fetch them home)
You can say they practically spend more time here than at home. 
 
Back to my situation : -  This is somehow a temporary full time job, and I’m estimating to quit by the end of December. This has always been on the table. Don’t get me wrong, I love this job. But I’m planning to go back to college on Jan 2020. This is just a period for me to relax, and take a break from school. I’m a little tired mentally, and physically.

But what I wasn’t preparing for, is the emotional baggage. For the past one month, I’ve been enjoying work. I’ve never looked forward to working before. This is the first time.

I enjoy seeing the students, making their days a little happier. Kids love me too. 

Of course, I have a few favourite students out of all of the students enrolled here. 
It is definite that as we spend more time with one another as the months pass by, the bond would get even stronger. Right now, I cringe and feel a little sad that one day I might leave them. I can’t even imagine how I would feel if that day were to arrive. 

&amp; I’ve been thinking on staying in contact with one particular student, (which happens to be one of my favourite student) 

He’s in third grade now, and he is a really cute and likeable student.  We get along well, and he really likes me a lot too. 

I felt empathetic for him when he told me a little about his family background earlier on, saying that his parents got divorced, he seldom sees his father, 4 months once kind of thing. &amp; I felt like I wanted to be his brother.

Are there any ways for me to stay in contact with him after I leave the student care? 
Social media to stay in contact is not an option, because they’re too young to use that.

Thanks for all the advices!",3.965443925233647,5.3416112803738365,4.707091121495328,85.13741238317758,71.71028037383178,7.406074766355141,28.094626168224305,7.8658589789855275,1.6673981308411208,1700,63,340,22,32,547,212,428,0.038,0.794,0.168,0.9962,4,0,0,0,1,0,62.0,2,1,8,6,23,19,1,0,29,0,29,3,0,3,4,48,61,18,0,5,6,4,4,3,0,4,1,2,2,2,16,18,0,0,8,1,3,4,7,3,1,7,9,9,40,16,59,46,9,60,0,1,3,2,39,21,0,6,34,226,56,23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07070898630183414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06020900308507299,0.1568032429439269,0.0,0.049207025072054086,0.0758753740443528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11128016744779454,0.0,0.044109754666016215,0.0,0.061572709778653124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2951018333470785,0.0,0.0,0.0623314082010954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23332985390833666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139483672598831,0.06408914865361318,0.0,0.0,0.1433785459895819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682142128820859,0.0,0.07317439927520229,0.0,0.1389531714927096,0.0,0.0,0.06154905850252908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341474971731047,0.0,0.041123641375051735,0.0,0.0578726008255383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06398737579692605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14516520376289682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168520691407585,0.0,0.0,0.1436115214442121,0.0,0.0,0.07535141253158616,0.0,0.0,0.08162480669784898,0.15323678606213648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10605377056372617,0.2900934078812486,0.0,0.0,0.0607638592250897,0.0,0.0,0.0615175640135805,0.13061477003646532,0.0,0.048300610346917884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07292148098924132,0.07676212528576425,0.0,0.0,0.2310270434493459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05580820221711984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07706063711224274,0.24516376670504014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16069359668997646,0.0,0.06907544797673294,0.050165051779075806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769633661621879,0.0,0.0,0.09271085495207536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061794722819969984,0.0,0.11508655329303,0.0,0.2929272069713161,0.11532250246722753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813352481911992,0.0,0.0737615233584681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23137719163147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10881086271358552,0.0,0.0,0.06661901919194403,0.0,0.0,0.0480725183680432,0.04636512477310042,0.0,0.0,0.16877391268182487,0.08316674230206338,0.0,0.06914272084140344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06249548169809225,0.0,0.0,0.04267958051820316,0.11487140161648968,0.0,0.0,0.06505999127022741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15803600239771828,0.0,0.0,0.15420660060050706,0.07911388873123687,0.0,0.0
teaching,yesilovecats,2019/04/18,"Student teaching So I've been student teaching since February. This is my 4th consecutive week teaching full time (all subjects).

teaching,Greeneyes_84,2019/04/18,"The children don’t seem to like me that much So I’ve been working in early childhood for 8 years now, and at this place for 6 months. 

Now, the kids all like me and come up to me, I get cuddles and I do lots of fun things with them.

But the parents all comment how the other educators are their kids favourite and now they are attached. ‘Timmy really loves Lisa etc.” none of the parents ever say their child likes me . 

I know it sounds childish but I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I don’t want this to look back for the families either. The children all quickly become attached to an educator but always the same ones.

So I was just registering for my NES 304 exam for licensure and apparently Pearson takes fucking palm scans when you go into take your test???? So while trying to become a teacher, a private, for-profit company that administers one single test gets to have biometric data about me with almost no background on how it's used, stored, given to, or how long it's kept for. All Pearson says on their website is that it's encrypted and kept by them. So that seems super bullshit and fuckey. It's especially stupid because they ""use it to confirm identity"", but I've literally never had a palm scan in my life so how could they possibly use it for identity confirmation unless I take multiple tests with them?
