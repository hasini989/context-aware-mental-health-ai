teaching,norewardisworththis_,2020/01/01,"Help! First time officially teaching in almost ten years I went alternate route in my state and got certified in 2007. I taught in a Title I School two years then had one child, substituted for a few months then started teaching again for a year, got pregnant again and left to raise my kids.

It’s been almost ten years, I had a few more kids in the intervening years. I started subbing again just a few months ago, and a very sudden need for a long term leave replacement came up in the district, and since I’m in their system and payroll and licensed, they hired me for it. This all happened a few days ago.

I am so nervous. My lesson plans suck. I’m speed reading the text (English class, high school) and scrambling to get ready, keep myself calm, and not screw this up.

I feel like it’s cheating to buy unit or lesson plans, but I’m desperate. Is it cheating? Is it immoral? Does it say something bad about my teaching if my materials aren’t original? I didn’t have time to make a study guide.

I never had a student teaching experience and my mentors were not very good and barely spoke to me while I was actively in the classroom my first year. I’m trying to keep my nerves settled but I’m all tied up.",3.9503533240353335,5.367259853556488,4.4494211994421216,86.8116120409112,71.80334728033472,7.15211529521153,27.922129242212925,7.594959193182576,1.4943749883774986,951,35,193,11,18,301,133,239,0.121,0.82,0.06,-0.9463,1,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,2,6,6,9,4,1,14,0,12,1,0,2,3,31,33,18,0,2,7,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,3,8,11,0,2,3,1,1,2,5,6,0,6,13,3,23,3,22,20,8,46,0,0,0,1,8,13,2,4,30,117,31,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22475788989036974,0.0,0.2538949573157344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585235388959872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449975449249862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08175979212076745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11094220631648684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401089043905952,0.0,0.0,0.06410156665649913,0.0905685339152319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21567056868653595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06623503311581502,0.0,0.0,0.10633338186827426,0.202788101639278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210726908450658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497503107755673,0.13394541135980756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2253680061626417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13423708500902595,0.13774209067284732,0.0,0.0,0.061936168116176735,0.0,0.0,0.112192441310633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.084623716063817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20238219338741845,0.0,0.0,0.09400252173267948,0.09777717971953108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08590644645593824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12680993520287456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081706772111393,0.0,0.25660740736053034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10487010947654887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759807206768653,0.0,0.0,0.17946488390116816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14784777628257814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08607232958520952,0.0,0.12384136725618668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2092063400995275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11752227719019065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4898360872598394

I'm finishing my Master's degree to become a high school English teacher and need to complete my student teaching. When I started my degree, I was a residential student but have since switched to an online degree through the same school due to a recent move across the country to Arizona. 

Since I'm not in the state where my school is located, I'm responsible for finding a host school for my student teaching. I've sent out emails and requests for meetings to no avail. This is a longshot, but do any of you have advice for me on making the right connections? I already delayed a semester to Fall 2020 due to the move and don't want to delay indefinitely.

teaching,austin-coverthisnews,2020/01/02,"How many times has your school gone on lockdown this year? Is that a number your district makes public? Hi, my name is Austin Gomberg and I'm a part of a Pennsylvania based news organization called [CoverThis.News](https://coverthis.news/) think kickstarter aka. crowdfunding for localized news research reports. Now, what does this have do with /r/teaching well I'll tell you!

We are in the process of getting funding for the following report: [**How many schools in Chester County, PA had lockdowns in 2019?**](https://coverthis.news/campaigns/how-many-schools-in-chester-county-pa-had-lockdowns-in-2019/) and hope that by collecting and analyzing this data we can reach important determinations about lockdowns in schools for the purpose of making our schools safer; we also believe this data should be public in some sort of public database for the purposes of transparency between school systems and their general public. We would love to see this research report then picked up and expanded for all of PA and eventually all of the country.

So, I just want to pick your brains for a bit about lockdowns and get some anecdotal information to help me determine how best to go at this story! Some questions: What do you think of lockdowns? Have they been increasing in recent years? Does your school do a good job at letting parents/public know about them as they occur? What could be changed about the current way lockdowns happen in our schools? And finally, do you have any crazy stories worth sharing! I'm sure everyone would be interested.

I appreciate your time, my mom is a Philadelphia School District teacher and has been for over 18 years now, so this is a story I know at least one teacher finds important! I'd love to see some backers for this story come out of this post, but I appreciate any and all feedback. And please reach out if you have an idea for a story, our teachers issues are so often ignored but if we all came together and put a little bit of money where our mouths are they couldn't ignore us!",6.991682423721527,8.936756913407823,5.963798882681568,76.8296218306833,65.0614525139665,8.636183927804039,34.71895143962183,9.057496981413335,3.219003094112592,1637,75,267,28,26,491,190,358,0.013999999999999999,0.855,0.13,0.9813,3,7,0,0,0,0,68.0,10,9,5,1,17,11,0,0,16,0,30,4,2,7,5,66,52,25,0,9,5,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,14,22,0,2,8,0,3,7,1,2,1,1,5,2,31,9,47,38,14,39,0,0,2,2,41,18,0,10,11,180,45,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693794096506271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11799524571467243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977452440096046,0.0910459459208521,0.0,0.18943198811772605,0.0,0.0,0.09684932013152366,0.08858842858876494,0.09922670702052776,0.0,0.0,0.09177722794440199,0.07473333142635746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0692682733250211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15184298200458696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289987377936231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09503787216424583,0.07929417550942475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906537311218348,0.0,0.049305908674888536,0.0727675170955737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671878272197485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05815127778304875,0.0,0.0,0.08616911271066566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09793790670099023,0.0,0.09055159566603192,0.08609277199472236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09535857532005644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08871474180109766,0.0,0.0,0.08695314056537655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566028617036938,0.0,0.11582172215670013,0.17591562744799513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160855667207368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08379029191401807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05878867671909894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09394919797477168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523295230387507,0.0,0.0,0.08308906618026965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08721458163082285,0.09718751049818326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566190819612829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7024203904316687,0.13826793019010894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176729031616545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582929780203146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11118055363400683,0.0,0.0,0.10117721640333706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043577904861042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05117142910865173,0.06886353746989847,0.0,0.0,0.07800481379319105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12325913289845104,0.0,0.0,0.16760567202623752
teaching,BetterPops,2020/01/02,"Praxis Test (CS)? I’ve been an English teacher for the past 20 years, and two years ago I started teaching some intro Computer Science classes as well. I’m mostly self taught, but I have three amazing volunteers from different CS career fields helping me teach the classes and a curriculum designed for teachers with limited CS experience. So far, things are going really well.

&amp;#x200B;

My state has made it easier in recent years for people to teach in fields where they’re experienced but not licensed, but I want to get a CS license anyway. I found that I can get that license if I take (and pass) the Praxis test.

Has anyone had experience with the Praxis Computer Science test (#5652)? I looked at the test prep materials Praxis makes available and did fairly well, but that’s just a 25-question pdf. The only other test prep I’ve been able to find is a $400 course. I’d rather not spend that if I don’t have to. There isn’t really a lot of financial incentive for getting the license, so 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone with experience have suggestions for what I could study or review before registering to take the test?",7.093581155686422,7.931970732057419,7.109665071770338,72.72457857931545,64.16746411483254,9.875745307324255,33.780272359219715,9.851270322608157,3.4131572322414416,909,37,151,18,13,291,125,209,0.018000000000000002,0.872,0.11,0.9621,1,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,0,1,10,4,0,0,14,0,15,0,0,2,0,28,29,14,0,5,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,7,0,1,2,0,1,2,4,0,3,2,7,2,11,4,19,21,3,15,0,0,1,0,3,5,0,6,7,95,19,16,0.10963628259394724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971859494447745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3563725991549604,0.3996602509223377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15332047592045947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09329240139367716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08753565046575783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11454658041742802,0.0,0.0,0.0959434497238338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217359657903153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10020557606213937,0.0,0.0,0.12021052495538702,0.0,0.0,0.17184129775394485,0.0,0.06230882596726407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07348688918907152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09206686477555844,0.0,0.0,0.09320884683080652,0.0,0.10374050148480507,0.07318306997114636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08338333331280229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046602373398808,0.07600799385526917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12281772794722033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404716200542895,0.0,0.1082526024418386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437455353025347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0776011251148455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648656802138581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283747451945435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070987173193532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06466632005204354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29572855452053604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3996602509223377,0.21180651427134015
teaching,GreenLigh,2020/01/02,"School website says to email if interested in a teaching position? I quit teaching at a parochial school last year for financial reasons. I’ve been in my “higher paying” job for about a year now and am miserable. There’s a charter school near me that I would love to teach at so I went to their website on the off chance they’ve already started posting for the fall. They have a section of the website labeled “teacher recruitment” with all the info on what teaching is like at their school. Then it says “if interested in a career with us please email the head of school.” 

I’ve never sent this sort of email before. How should it be worded? Do I treat it as a job application or just a chance to introduce myself?

teaching,pumpkins_n_mist15,2020/01/03,"Ethical to leave just before exams? I work at an alternative/special needs school in India where the school size is tiny and there's no concept of an appointment letter or contract. You might say it's almost a volunteer position.

My school has been giving me trouble for months, my principal is an absolute bitch who screams and throws things and I get paid less per month than the driver who drives the school van. I've been toying with the idea of quitting for months now. I've been in the job 15 months. Today I just had it with everything there and after some really horrible feedback from the parents I decided to take my things and walk the fuck out. 
The problem is...
I have a 10th grader who needs a bit of help in history and is writing her exams in March. If I leave her I leave her in the lurch, completely. 
I have offered to tutor her at home for free but I realise her parents might not take up the offer as they've paid the school fees.
On the other hand I promised this child I'd get her through her exams.
However the type of feedback I've been getting and the way I've been treated of late shows that I need to hold my self respect in my hands while I still have it and leave.

teaching,NeonTacoFairy,2020/01/03,"How do you respond to a racist comment by an elementary school child? Happy new year Teachers! I begin student teaching on Monday for middle school math.  I'm nervous and I already feel like I'm going to be horrible at it because I don't know how to respond to certain situations such as what I'll explain below.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I tutor through an agency. I began tutoring a 9 year girl last month. Yesterday, she was doing well on our practice equations. During our break, I let her watch YouTube for 10 minutes if she behaves during our sessions.  I should have closely monitored what she was going to pick, but she usually watches cartoons and since I've been working with her, she has always watched age appropriate videos.  Yesterday, she ended up watching a video of a parody of \*a hot political topic\*. I don't really want to say what, because I don't want my post to become political, but she made a very racist comment when reacting to this video.  It deeply upset me and I asked her to change the video to something more appropriate.  I told her that her comment was ""not very nice."" and she laughed and rolled her eyes.

I got home and told my boyfriend what had happened and he told me I missed a teachable moment and I should have said more than what I had said. But, I wouldn't even begin to know how to respond to that.  If this happened in the classroom, I'm not sure how I would even react.

Do you have any advice how to respond to situations like this?",4.863748948342586,6.4164823780918745,5.426845027763758,80.15737338044758,69.74204946996467,7.65196028941612,31.85074878007741,8.11559375814309,2.417335655392899,1175,52,211,16,21,378,153,283,0.091,0.857,0.053,-0.8859999999999999,0,0,1,0,0,0,42.0,3,2,0,1,10,11,0,2,11,0,22,1,1,9,2,39,47,20,0,8,7,0,2,2,0,4,0,3,1,2,12,10,0,0,4,4,0,2,6,3,1,0,14,10,40,8,30,27,2,28,0,1,5,0,37,8,0,3,18,142,52,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11260373849215767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12716178592983782,0.0,0.09588256306382956,0.2497084498964485,0.2800398851642561,0.07836196320985721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077267108932762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14048916662906488,0.12726509951808326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12190056838514846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020616772014066,0.0,0.0,0.15221978744520526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05826494870915636,0.08232202828227528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13097842301047058,0.0,0.09216185311160237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20379920878174385,0.12266700079556575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155874627653516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12665739412999885,0.09392976155760313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178329057426616,0.0,0.11259343091780252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10903565486801113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919773784980414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11129214117976988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036075746482472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382080703182885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21922474397997416,0.09163740585711072,0.0,0.2332426211728948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532140739270414,0.2590520242624088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08871150831006648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086051451771047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3303284036498638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12691217584843453,0.19015754701985016,0.13593407500178162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036077396446103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08389053790313435,0.0,0.0,0.08185776959881587,0.0,0.2800398851642561,0.14841173671062294

There is a software that you need for your profession?

Maybe you need a replacement for a program that it's too expensive or maybe you need something that is not existing (yet)

Each and every idea is welcome!

teaching,yesilovecats,2020/01/03,"Consequences for upper elementary I teach 4th grade ELA and science. I see my homeroom for two hours in the morning, a different class for two hours, and then my homeroom plus some other students for a 30 minute science block.

I am a first year teacher and I struggled with classroom management this fall. I did not really have a plan for when they did not follow the rules, so I was pretty inconsistent. I realized this and started to formulate a plan and my students seemed to get calmer. I'd like some advice from other teachers to make sure my plan seems ok so I can really set expectations for when we go back.

Consequences for following the rules:
Name on the board for great behavior
Earn a check by your name for following rules
Your name and each check is one Class Dojo point
After three checks you get a positive office referral
Earn prizes with Dojo points

Consequences for NOT following the rules:
Two warnings
After the third time, use a logical consequence (take away iPad for using it improperly, make up unfinished work at recess/lunch, send to buddy room if being disruptive, etc)
If behavior continues, call home and another logical consequence
If behavior continues after that, referral to the office

Is this too many steps? Does it sound okay? My students really like seeing their name on the board and hearing they got a positive office referral. They also don't like going to the buddy room so I'm hoping maybe it will deter them.",7.20856951871658,8.352385053030304,7.227834224598932,70.90219251336902,64.0,11.363279857397506,32.953654188948306,11.20814326018867,4.107691889483066,1170,46,191,34,17,375,149,264,0.036000000000000004,0.8270000000000001,0.138,0.9795,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,3,5,8,8,10,0,1,18,2,11,0,0,4,1,38,33,19,0,5,6,0,0,3,0,1,0,2,3,0,9,13,0,1,5,0,3,9,4,1,0,7,4,4,22,9,31,27,4,36,0,0,2,0,16,11,0,8,18,125,31,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12953892594365155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601049856264493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13900375289389946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245472027628958,0.10193268298659712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1353615363530461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13850000981891386,0.0,0.0,0.1160066820012174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478426684021185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275793004903782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13851728172931788,0.0,0.1506770953235382,0.0,0.10602265630714396,0.14615105879476753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14940801609114115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13297139135587635,0.13166486490961146,0.2610954959635828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942906022221277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17697352243332234,0.13439796810489224,0.1331772448433827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898280478345567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25062956618228865,0.0,0.0,0.13486412057703964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25476955338909985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112709273326304,0.24136056025043925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382869878086396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13858351946162356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1249389589243194,0.0,0.09967079874934062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729848962473429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3884840563446448,0.0,0.0,0.22898355637413534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09650736576178644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08536615759105118
teaching,AFwuertzen,2020/01/03,"Transitioning to becoming a Qualified PE and Sports Studies Teacher So folks, I'm at a bit of a crossroads. Been enjoying the environment of acting as a cover PE teacher at my current school. 

However, I am in a bit of a pickle. After having done a BSc in Geography from a UK university, I'm at a loss as to how to transition into sport. 
Apart from my one year amateur experience as an unqualified basketball and baseball coach and history as a three-sport athlete in high school, I have little credibility that would lend itself to a non-BSc route into teaching PE. 

Am I missing something and/or being too pessimistic? 

I'm located in the UK at the moment and am interested in building foundational knowledge, such as doing outside reading for GCSE-level sport studies next to my job.

teaching,egsmith96,2020/01/03,"Consequences in Middle Grades? Hi

So I teach 7th grade S.S, and I'm a first year teacher. I fell into the all too common trap that comes with being a novice, I failed in classroom management last semester. I've already addressed my faults and written an outline for every expectation I have for students now, and I will practice those religiously with them starting this new semester. Just to shed a little light on how bad it got it in my fourth period, a student, to my face, called me a pushover (in as inoffensive way as possible) and I didn't even get mad, because I knew it was true, but now I vow to NEVER return to that teacher. That was a dark place honestly. My question is, though, even with proper policies and procedures in place, you will still have those who will not listen, and how do you follow up then? I've thought up about 4 options: conversation with them in the hall, contact home, lunch detention, office referral. Anyone else use any different consequences?",6.976683316683317,7.545701483516487,6.877012987012988,75.22707792207795,64.38461538461539,10.134665334665335,34.67732267732268,10.018931242160765,3.4827186813186817,778,33,137,16,11,247,125,182,0.068,0.888,0.044000000000000004,-0.4898,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,2,2,2,12,6,1,0,9,0,11,2,1,3,3,26,22,14,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,2,0,10,12,1,0,3,0,0,3,3,4,0,1,7,2,17,2,23,11,1,32,0,1,0,0,11,15,0,2,13,93,27,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21015602936467614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12950619497032595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13316055356223194,0.19512898503405166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1590100156427486,0.116090872787077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1944612299494501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16404778568600156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19896998056487272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15908875388221472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515685501450092,0.0,0.1604544891176568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16198874772446772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994973967497063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15231281133084654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19102753269371786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15523457447356293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19087159498904352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468795950718505,0.1839287984106975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3979399611297455,0.0,0.0,0.21469325591211344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2133371494253897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13479489566293384,0.0,0.1520861754942564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18710700418663515,0.1511886299191959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644796048065524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15116294992916066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263755604781025
teaching,iamphilsharp,2020/01/03,"Would you find this helpful? When I first started teaching, I naively thought I’d *just* have to teach my students the curriculum. What I soon realized is that I *also* had to be a bit of a therapist, moderator, coach, stand up comedian, etc. 

In the last few years I’ve grown really interested in social and emotional learning because I truly believe that we can teach our students best when we really know them, when we treat them as individuals, and when we help them develop the skills to truly process their feelings.

All that being said, I’m working on an app to help with some of this and I’d love your feedback before I get too far into it. Please save me time if this is a crappy idea...or send me encouragement if you’d like to use it. :)

Would you like an app that lets your students privately share with you how they’re feeling each day from their tablets or computers? That way you always know how every student is feeling and how it’s changing over time?

I put together some more details here: [https://www.moodminute.com](https://www.moodminute.com)

teaching,Gunslinger1925,2020/01/03,"Teaching in NC So this is still a few years from now, but I’m planning ahead.  My 5-yr plan is to move to NC and transfer my FL cert to NC.  I’m looking at the Western side of the state, to return to the mountains.  (I grew up in AZ, and miss them dearly)

Has anyone transferred to NC from another state?  What is the reciprocity of the certs?  I say 5-years, as it gives me time to save and work off the required years at my current school for paying for my path to certification program.  I took the alt cert route.  It’ll also give me 5+ years of teaching experience.

I’ve been doing a cost of living analysis, and it seems the smaller towns are more affordable.  However, I know with smaller districts, there’s a potential for less openings.  The schools I’ve looked at are staffed by young teachers (23-50).

So yeah.  Main thing is certification.  Or if possible, does anyone know if NC’s DoE is easier to work with than FL’s?  LoL

Thank you advance!",2.2814775413711565,4.447914074468084,3.672695035460993,87.33388888888891,78.46808510638297,6.518203309692672,26.401891252955078,7.594959193182576,1.4293430260047284,738,30,152,11,18,242,118,188,0.01,0.888,0.102,0.9591,3,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,1,7,6,4,0,0,12,2,11,0,0,0,0,16,23,12,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,6,7,0,1,3,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,2,3,12,3,31,20,4,26,0,1,2,0,5,10,0,4,10,89,18,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13251373946828093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737554991802118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2317287222577757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29001805375351497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16209068795142434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3179174968387232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18213359654775024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14632001072740586,0.0,0.2782999049362153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17611754083433273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18680680028348265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13177478047535762,0.0,0.3354033750200301,0.0,0.15085105170053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13233173855756525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525583376739066,0.0,0.0,0.1100866326010676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662356138595726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1841036724732876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2412695364463418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4268327729727274

teaching,NearbyFact7,2020/01/04,"Students Flirting Hi all, first year teacher here and I am young... and look young. I teach grades 7-9,  but mostly grade 7 and 8. I find all of my students that I teach core subjects to respond well to me, listen and respect me. Of course there’s the odd ridiculous comment... I work with 12 and 13 year olds. I only teach grade 9s in option classes, so I don’t know them very well. I do find, however, the grade 9s who I hardly know will make inappropriate (often sexual undertone) comments towards me. For example, they will ask for my Snapchat, ask if I’m single, rub my hand instead of going for a high five, one even asked to hang out with me outside of school. Those are only some examples. Of course, I have handled this by telling students that it is inappropriate and I don’t want it happening again and those students have respected that. I have never given any suggestion that this is okay (and have been told by my boyfriend that I dress like a grandma... so it isn’t my clothes!), but it seems like each week, it’s a new grade 9 boy flirting with me. I don’t want to get in trouble, and my admin already has demonstrated that they will take students’ side on issues like these. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I live in a country where I don't agree with its education. Recently, our education minister has been reassigned from his post due to many don't agree with his ways as he made many changes such as not making 7 to 9-year-olds not going through exams as exams are not necessary for younglings. In my opinion, the people who do not agree with his ways are people with old mindsets and are not open to any changes which aren't good. Do you guys think one needs to have a decent education to be successful?",8.506168224299062,6.830583728971965,8.195252336448599,74.42241121495327,62.17757009345794,11.924485981308413,37.28785046728972,10.793553405168565,3.732519252336449,437,17,87,9,5,140,65,107,0.059000000000000004,0.848,0.09300000000000001,0.6838,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,0,4,0,14,0,0,2,0,17,20,4,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,6,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,0,0,1,2,0,9,3,18,16,0,11,0,0,0,0,9,4,0,1,3,57,12,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12518062053027146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38946417798593774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10461682937050656,0.30879491421198363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1822680072908823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16254589324607124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1741808190760745,0.1228747392544947,0.37325618115431897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2729857747787251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.386321705387414,0.0,0.12473728051121348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2552356010729168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17629762624297984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18175665907300328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179509446377082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29222805716212225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854139772926255

teaching,goflycow,2020/01/05,"Selling educational videos online - Is it worth doing? Recently a friend who coaches professionals asked me how to get into selling his coaching on the internet. So I told him about Udemy and Skillshare. 

Later, another friend told me this, that she has tried coaching online but doesn't work out well because her students (also professionals) doesn't have time or the discipline to self-learn, and majority still prefers actual classroom learning. 

Is this because the professional working class have a certain expectation? Or is it a generational thing? Or is it that video-learning just doesn't have the same appeal or effectiveness as live training?

Your experience or input would be much appreciated, as I'm also considering a venture into video/online teaching.

teaching,canincm,2020/01/05,"Free news online for upper primary (10-11 year old) students? Hi!

Can anyone recommend free online resources for 10-11 year old students that includes worldwide current events?  I've been looking at a few (Newsela, Smithsonian Kids, etc), but they aren't quite what I need.  

Ideally, it will have articles at different reading levels, not too much of a political slant, and be updated regularly.

teaching,nivalah,2020/01/05,"Advice for Student Teacher after bad placement - mentor issues and homophobic children in class Hello!

I’m a student teacher about to go back to my second semester of the one year PGDE programme here in Scotland, training as a Primary (ages 5-11 roughly) teacher!

Our course is built around the three 6 week placements we need to undertake. The first in the upper years of the primary bracket, the second in the early years, and the final one can be anywhere in between. I unfortunately failed my first placement after a pretty rough time, explained later, but all is not lost as I can surpass this within my second placement without needing to formally resit anything.

Going into placement two at the end of January, however, I’m incredibly anxious after a difficult experience with my mentor teacher (the children’s usual class teacher who we shadow and eventually take over increasing responsibility from) and the class/school itself.

With my mentor, I really struggled with the fact that, across the five weeks I was there, I honestly never saw her teach once - everything was a consolidation of things covered previously. Obviously I appreciate there can be reasons for this, but across five weeks and every curricular area seems a bit extreme to not have a single new teaching point. Additionally, this made it near impossible for me to learn this practice ahead of my university visit.

Secondly, my confidence has taken a huge blow after experiencing a lot of homophobia from my class. Notes found and even verbal comments must have been picked up on by the class teacher too, however I was too proud to take these issues to the school at the time, and also too stubborn to need to out myself to the management staff. In retrospect, my university have said that if they’d been informed I’d have been taken out that school immediately.

In short, I’ve been through the mill a bit, and looking for any tips or motivation moving forward, or advice from anyone who’s experienced similar issues!",12.789828571428574,10.130217697142859,12.062285714285714,53.10971428571429,54.88571428571429,14.342857142857143,47.0,12.540900571622839,6.073028571428571,1614,77,234,38,14,531,200,350,0.055999999999999994,0.867,0.078,0.8703,2,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,3,0,1,7,11,8,1,1,28,0,21,0,0,4,5,45,40,16,0,5,8,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,13,18,0,1,7,0,0,6,4,6,0,12,14,7,23,2,59,22,6,55,0,2,2,0,15,26,0,5,25,183,36,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2178062184563156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891228086090595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578666173122046,0.0,0.0,0.12590152734313176,0.0,0.07792518212024754,0.0,0.0917100298408729,0.0992099920449248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08569459742191571,0.09305221476203744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24333892298112303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09870750411228896,0.0,0.0,0.07360860465563794,0.0,0.09389751658445353,0.0,0.10015989732740234,0.10901494001732122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12208293691397512,0.0,0.1895907208280068,0.0,0.1221940773883168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12667392485050175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34895998267040995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093586028373634,0.0,0.12165576777964315,0.094746853881108,0.0,0.10545228773804632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184487732929274,0.0,0.2479059516115843,0.08595352669792791,0.10763461648282792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1186856638674272,0.1510365109763879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053518809999568,0.0,0.0,0.11337998942919734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139474691648819,0.11458438418297373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10601005152608138,0.0,0.0,0.3383659413584565,0.0,0.10145566386646084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165068804392952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675860719700391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403934057773122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299693632234661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10886591633442533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227413115575005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2681842199274979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10742934345059936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153014605487083

I normally would just spend it all on myself, but 1) it's much more than I've every received, so I'd like to give a little back, and 2) I've changed schools and grade levels (4th) so I'd be interested in getting more for my classroom anyhow.",5.756285714285713,5.5239110571428585,6.069285714285716,82.71821428571431,67.0,8.523809523809524,32.73809523809524,7.793537801064563,2.1796666666666664,411,16,83,4,6,132,74,105,0.0,0.765,0.235,0.9713,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,0,0,6,3,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,0,1,18,15,7,0,4,5,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,5,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,3,0,9,3,9,9,5,7,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,4,2,51,14,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16438817454986104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15191368942364242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2089953717662404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1577379145068344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664552795765162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10321847075879294,0.18952035346397011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21781381500184926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6690734623205399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965192626450853,0.198009945884528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14523147690972402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935697134593045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2193702408956336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19994422080849172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15684288922285347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16301009814820452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21424855754228672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14034302887913433,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Code_Stripes97,2020/01/06,"Want more legal language and context Can someone become a teacher if they were hospitalized due to mental distress? I know that this question may get taken down as spam due to it already having been answered.  I would also like some more legal language in terms of why someone could or could not become one if they wanted to. So allow me to provide more context. As far as I have heard, any type of diagnosis or history of hospitalization will be on the record for an extremely long time with little to no chance of expunging it. I just think that this is bureaucratically complex. I just understand that being a teacher is a huge responsibility. I will be posting this to other communities on Reddit. I also do realize that being a felon and maybe having any kind of criminal history could get you rejected from the position.

teaching,GinjaDiem,2020/01/06,"One of my students was hit by a drunk driver and might not make it There was a wreck in front of the school this morning. A drunk driver ran a red light and there were four cars involved in the accident. Their car got squished between cars. The girl (a 7th grader) was rushed to the hospital with a brain hemorrhage, and they said she's in critical condition and may not make it. 

I've never lost a student before. I'm tearing up picturing seeing that empty desk. She's a kind and gentle soul. I know there's no such thing as a perfect student, but she comes damn near close. She's meticulous about her work, and I just imagined her one day working a job that's detail oriented. I could picture her being a surgeon or anything really. I know that if she makes it out of this, she probably won't be the exact same with a brain injury, but God I hope she does. 

The school wants us to keep this quiet until we know more, but I know kids are going to talk. I'll try to keep my composure.

Hello educators,

I have a question involving California 4th grade math standards and the opinion of any teachers might have. In your professional opinion, what do you think the most important math related lesson there is for 4th grade? If you were to take your students on a field trip, and there was a math activity, what would you want it to be? I thank you all for any information and feedback in advance.",7.515949367088607,8.599841607594941,7.301113924050636,70.8587594936709,63.303797468354425,10.370632911392406,37.31898734177216,10.355215969177356,4.075114430379748,353,17,59,8,5,112,52,79,0.0,0.919,0.081,0.6432,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,6,0,3,2,1,0,0,5,0,9,0,0,0,1,18,13,4,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,6,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,1,8,8,2,5,0,0,0,0,11,3,0,7,0,41,11,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4163524241114127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.324751363203451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6858624742749334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301686923468605,0.0,0.0,0.2818397382474882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961532125264756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18056107621616815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174631633050596,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Deep-Chemistry,2020/01/06,"Struggling with Lesson Planning I'm currently just a supply teacher so this isn't an everyday issue for me right now, but during my teacher education program I really had a hard time creating hypothetical lessons that I had to complete for coursework.  A few months after graduating, I'm now in an online course to expand my qualifications which is like being in teacher's college again, and not surprisingly I have to create a lot of lessons to hand in to my professor in order to complete the course.  I seem to be spending hours on the computer and getting very little done.

Part of the struggle seems to be that they expect us to dress up the lessons so much which isn't really realistic for a teacher who has to plan everyday.  For example, at the high school level it might very well be the case that today's lesson is just a lecture and not much else.  That's totally fine and often necessary, but I can't just hand in ""lecture"" as my lesson because lessons nowadays have to be ""interactive"" and need to include a variety of teaching and learning strategies, diversified instruction, accommodations, and all of these extra frills that are really just there to make our job seem more advanced than it really is.  I can't even keep track of all this lingo anymore.  Moreover, I am more traditional than most teachers these days when it comes to how I want to run a classroom, and I always end up being forced to create a lesson that I would never even feel comfortable doing in real life because it's just not my style.  And I can honestly say that I have never used a lesson I've created for one of these university courses in an actual classroom.

But even when I have a pretty solid idea of what I want to do, I am struggling to get it down on paper in a timely fashion.  I'm also having a hard time finding resources to support the lesson.  For example, recently I had to create a lesson and I was going to include a jigsaw activity where each group was going to learn about a particular culture's perspective on a certain historical event, but I couldn't reliably find anything that I could use for this because it may have not been grade-level appropriate or some other issue.  It's also worth pointing out that in my jurisdiction we literally do not have any textbooks except for in science and mathematics, so I don't have any government-approved textbooks or resources for social studies, English, or any other subject that I can use to help me create lessons, and it's really frustrating to figure out how to teach this stuff all on my own.

I want to get better and more efficient at making lessons.  If possible, I even want a systematic approach that I can follow.  When I was in teacher's college, our university didn't even require us to use a certain template for lesson plans, so I don't even know how to effectively create a lesson plan document.  If you have any advice you can share then I would really appreciate it.",11.765223482894962,8.051103081227437,11.610484785972151,58.80851383874851,57.898916967509024,14.306893587760015,45.5145263881726,12.11862946488302,5.525877187553721,2353,106,391,52,21,794,253,554,0.048,0.79,0.162,0.9959,2,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,5,2,1,23,31,15,1,3,30,0,50,3,2,10,8,102,78,36,0,12,20,0,5,1,0,4,1,1,0,0,34,19,0,2,27,0,2,7,15,4,1,1,9,6,44,11,74,57,17,60,0,0,0,0,16,28,0,14,25,310,78,21,0.0,0.0,0.0789800976912458,0.0,0.0,0.0790879569236963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12944609016488332,0.06734373226741383,0.0,0.0,0.22015210698280985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08026497201413031,0.0,0.0,0.06660194498515283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.148010198960392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157971686131025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06971764106132702,0.16971592352085418,0.0,0.0,0.06461936761604757,0.0,0.0,0.05219585911228429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282377942231936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761013319182202,0.0,0.07168367265734439,0.0,0.0,0.3207376279049307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040922759895685536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479447727248037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268543265754862,0.0,0.09199353427956757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500228007043167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054248483700089146,0.08551141873925612,0.0,0.0,0.07970387737629281,0.0,0.0,0.09136485280875924,0.0,0.16894854072966697,0.080314698426328,0.07193802964118427,0.0,0.0,0.04447931598522644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05716621418426453,0.03954035866641549,0.08111732378832492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880735684695541,0.0,0.0,0.1080484048858778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585838908872072,0.0,0.0,0.0646009008760773,0.0,0.11899188885807616,0.06001167876394455,0.12484287850190876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054843103923599576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764384428464826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07650897284207782,0.09124114227678712,0.0,0.08233917087894321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09212083064149654,0.31109109971579085,0.0,0.07991275183725748,0.0,0.0,0.0691173587984356,0.0,0.06436211891429516,0.0,0.08190972441548486,0.0,0.22103834951282586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250221771103826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2538299743727092,0.0926502879081602,0.0,0.09184316335974843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415801367775825,0.0,0.07671615179181622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19470773857399268,0.2796046286601148,0.0,0.13355837105238802,0.19094833639030812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727695595164024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11498665750519264,0.0,0.0,0.0

This year, I'm in a completely new school and and new grad level.  While almost all of my kids have shown some type of growth I feel as if they aren't growing enough compared to the other first grade classrooms. I currently teach first grade. What should I do?

My only problem is that I don't know if/when I will be going back to America and I have heard in the past that districts won't hire someone with a masters typically because they cost more.

teaching,throwawaytheteacher,2020/01/07,"I want to quit after my first day Background: this school has gone through 5 teachers/long-term subs, apparently. The first left after two days. The next was gone after a week. One sub lasted two weeks.  

I was hired before I graduated college. Yes, before. My major isn’t teaching, it’s the subject matter I teach. I’ve never been a TA or anything like that. I submitted unofficial transcripts to prove I was set to get my degree before they were done processing. 

The application states it’s for my subject at a gifted level. However, after being hired and touring the school, things began to worry me.

Staff, including previous teachers who had my students, all cringed when I told them who I was replacing. Apparently they are the “worst” group, refuse to do anything, and I’ve been told “good luck” more than I can count by people I don’t know. 

Not only that, but I have 2 classes that are actually gifted. The others are standard or under. Fine. I didn’t expect 6 classes of only gifted. However, other teachers have told me they requested these students out of gifted before and that the group isn’t suited for it. On top of this, I don’t have my own classroom. I travel to different classrooms each period (I knew this when I was being hired, but it makes trying to gain a sense of balance impossible) 


I’ve been warned about particular students from the last sub. One in particular that tried to rip a door of its hinges. I have taken most warnings on the chin, and went into each class willing to give the benefit of the doubt. I’m inexperienced, and I’m not a pushover, but I’m barely older than these kids and they can tell. 

I have never seen this kind of behavior before. I’m completely out of my depth. Students couldn’t care if I dropped dead. I struggled to keep them from mowing over me, barely
kept them in their seats, or couldn’t at all. Getting up for Tik tok dances in the middle of class. Hitting each other. Throwing stuff. Bickering. Making fun of me (lol), my name or pronunciation. They disappeared at 20 minutes at a time with the bathroom pass.  Climbing over desks. Refusing to sit in a desk. Laying on each other? Random students trying to sneak in to hang out??? One student got mad at me for making eye contact with her when she spoke to me... she has no special accommodations listed, it took me completely off guard. Generally being loud and stonewalling any attempt to calm them down. 

I’m not a meek person, but I’m not a babysitter. I feel as thought I was mislead in the interview process and wasn’t told the truth until everything was signed. I’ve had no training! I don’t even know how to enter a grade into the computer! I truly have no idea what the hell is going on. It’s day two. 

I haven’t eaten, I’m not sleeping, I’m so worried about waking up and being prepared and trying not to have an anxiety attack thinking about what could go wrong. I want to quit. My husband is worried, wants me to quit. He’s never seen me so frightened/stressed. I don’t think I can do this.  

I have absolutely no idea what to do. Any advice welcome.. 




Edit: I also understand part of this isn’t their fault. They haven’t had a teacher. But I was told by their previous teachers it doesn’t matter, “they’re like that anyway”, and I’m not a fool enough to think I can “save” them from themselves. No idea what to do. 

If I leave, I’ll burn bridges that got me in. I’m starting to think it’s worth it.",2.3421680376028213,4.785680247747752,3.67735082908996,85.88939482961223,79.85585585585585,6.0830917874396135,24.06658832745789,7.312421594763829,1.1744290638464556,2679,96,511,37,69,875,304,666,0.11699999999999999,0.79,0.09300000000000001,-0.9701,5,0,0,0,0,0,100.0,0,0,14,9,12,23,3,2,32,2,59,4,3,4,7,87,112,31,1,9,18,1,1,2,0,1,0,2,1,2,37,22,1,5,14,2,1,14,29,9,0,8,38,6,69,14,85,65,13,77,1,0,3,0,40,33,1,10,28,348,106,29,0.0,0.0,0.07312960136115045,0.0,0.0,0.0732294708586922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0599286481546522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10192210628434513,0.0,0.0573280886813225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12333673492483813,0.0,0.0,0.08525386977346781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3188376182610917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07640525001019559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15714411851246968,0.0,0.0,0.05983265065643215,0.0,0.0,0.14498826215077756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07829524877622153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07668856014911482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743196380716677,0.0,0.04949646716041898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06735029270082747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0378913828325293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274860586107421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830501273597644,0.07188826564967647,0.08517906012179798,0.0628552325692621,0.11987104206472135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2537908457815947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06660917856714098,0.0,0.07803738049063151,0.08236896995321881,0.12217048614643387,0.0,0.07934952363421026,0.0814213842511235,0.0,0.0,0.07322276754469953,0.0,0.0,0.06631860914410674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15006698537968952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733926053114088,0.0,0.07969841938528023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15234170802192584,0.11398889083769027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115157592424058,0.0,0.05195322956122378,0.06543379724084658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2391203809160507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15168442858915426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499306615216464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053042171787584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08584230961280452,0.07834245749670987,0.08578716434622201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06549994199541606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04978610594004868,0.19207140314177087,0.0,0.059493152474827976,0.04369750213814255,0.0,0.0,0.3580368723808805,0.0832599265246145,0.20351450123381004,0.0,0.21961338397642408,0.0780140857971704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13260279610618156,0.0,0.12022300469430484,0.0,0.0,0.0694691538543333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283124122890742,0.0,0.0,0.08193397349286638,0.0,0.0
teaching,fart_in_my_mouth_now,2020/01/07,"Advice for new para My degree and work experience are in social work across multiple populations. My passion has always been working with young kids with behavior issues and the kids that need extra patience and support and so I find myself happy to be working at a school for kids with behavior disorders. Also here are some issues/questions I have run into so far: 
1) I don’t believe in yelling or shaming  and unfortunately the older male teacher I’m working with uses such strong authoritarian style teaching and correcting behavior that he has made a 5 year old cry. It just isn’t effective for this student in particular and he can’t see that. For example, the student got upset and ripped another students art off the wall. So the teacher allowed the other student to rip up the “bad” student’s art work to “make it fair”. The “bad” student is only 5 years old with learning disabilities.. To me this was inappropriate behavior by the teacher. 

2)  (kinda petty but worth mentioning) I noticed the 5 year old is not doing his basic addition problems correctly (he just enters the two numbers he sees and had been doing that all the time across time) Yesterday I had a really positive session helping him for the first time with the math problems, lots of praise and he was so happy to be getting the answers right with my help, it was so cute and I felt so happy about it.  Anyways, today the other para in the class told the teacher who was absent yesterday that this student had me “fooled” and the para and teacher said “he can do it he just doesn’t want to” to which I explained he is just typing the numbers he sees and he loves getting a right answer so why would he just put a wrong one all the time. 
I guess the issue here is that my approach is pretty gentle and loving and they look at that as I’m easy to fool/unaware. I was just kind of annoyed by that. 

3) I pretty much have absolutely nothing to do all day. If the student doesn’t need help or have a behavior issue. It’s usually pretty smooth. I literally sit there doing absolutely nothing for 8 hours. No helping teaching, nothing. Is this normal for the para position? I feel I have a lot more to contribute.   My class is only 4 young  
kids. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and help and for all your hard work teaching the children!",4.0649639231992145,6.093217882352942,5.220502629326159,78.9112223309282,72.66515837104072,7.583808242631773,29.59300476947536,8.358175599149588,2.371298813745873,1832,78,324,31,37,605,210,442,0.063,0.741,0.196,0.9971,1,0,0,0,1,0,37.0,0,1,1,11,20,21,1,2,33,0,39,3,0,5,6,68,65,31,0,8,11,0,4,0,0,1,0,2,0,6,23,27,0,0,8,3,1,4,7,9,0,3,15,10,25,12,44,47,10,42,1,0,4,3,35,15,0,8,22,220,48,27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684792500956543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06288987487292066,0.0654363355490837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08246285740461677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313253528331423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886024570710882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08638440124635302,0.05071750014658488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901303960120316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692683886391083,0.0,0.0,0.039763692298717616,0.0,0.07550852770771545,0.0,0.07187724428690145,0.06689273428445427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217426230238978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06289708735697316,0.0,0.08663288575629359,0.0,0.0,0.25114719825068144,0.07044766851051275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26355993816411283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07744640056253313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24624504084095694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08189340566804246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06603936417768101,0.0,0.0,0.13371701090174296,0.14195471577059726,0.07441283869317843,0.052494058760957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05781082295838254,0.11662389999021365,0.0,0.07595280790906042,0.0,0.0,0.07705233516186484,0.2263769851911579,0.08953429001119452,0.2475642401312141,0.0,0.05328976624947829,0.11962137145469467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2400211615717797,0.0,0.150499297179469,0.0,0.07905680018721516,0.0,0.0,0.07866315141482089,0.0,0.05037999553915947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13431945424828567,0.07480642699437348,0.0,0.0,0.07958977073473203,0.18800216531926955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801654826650489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08924186190978102,0.0,0.0,0.05912889899414975,0.0,0.0,0.0724028678507659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2292835335310024,0.0,0.07454329722549112,0.07514567672482189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07682167969178985,0.0,0.0,0.06792132573462002,0.08661290915381574,0.0,0.04638501235333802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096205554133768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4007655248825344,0.0,0.0,0.05586492796611897,0.08598253922748557,0.0,0.151928357344081
teaching,Sassysassafraz,2020/01/07,"UK Teachers: How, if at all, do you implement LGBTQ+ Inclusive Curricula in your classrooms/school? U.S.  (specifically Southern California Teacher here). I am curious as to how your school/district manages inclusive curricula, specifically in regards to LGBTQ+. 

What successes have you experienced? 

Were there any barriers? Resistance from parents or the community? 

Are there any school policies in regards to supporting this?

I ask because in California, we have a bill that protects teachers when they implement teaching students LGBTQ+ curricula. However, I know that not all teachers feel supported, and often face barriers when trying to implement this in their classrooms. I was wondering what it is like in the UK, and how it differs regionally. I am trying to create a trans-national approach to tackling these issues to create and support teachers when they implement this curricula in their classrooms.

Often times, here, districts instruct teachers to implement new ideology or pedagogy but don't necessarily support them in doing. 

Pardon if this is too broad, I wanted to leave it open-ended to allow room for discussion and interpretation. I just want to hear about ideas and the lived experience.

Thank you in advance!",8.143652941176473,11.259927730000005,8.173235294117651,57.41882352941178,64.2,11.505882352941176,42.76470588235294,11.20814326018867,6.342158823529411,1006,62,126,34,17,325,116,200,0.006,0.848,0.146,0.9687,2,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,1,5,5,2,15,7,0,0,5,0,12,1,1,4,2,30,24,17,0,4,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,12,6,0,3,5,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,2,3,18,7,25,22,2,19,0,0,0,0,15,12,0,7,6,99,30,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19263853531277933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13241319481090735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08634172173002584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14798244067016147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254499708933497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13854996309658055,0.0,0.0,0.07161685286870281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1596372657717637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598930091141153,0.0,0.14783414919547322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07784100184675828,0.0,0.0,0.14997507967522128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06919758237730605,0.0,0.12506968995435871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1367956735034752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15727316910121494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.430038201010844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6429203048961324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13040201335396762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08259074616486582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19232694879370688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16708451418778858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15360127920026426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So my school has apparently a week in the year where instead of regular classes we work on projects. So that is next week and me and my group were doing a poll about our topic (is a topic related to human rights) but a teacher qued us that many people were doing that (almost everyone, to be honest I was already kind of aware of this just did not give it much thought) and I think that could hurt our grade a lot because we would not get the creativity points. So, what are some great project ideas you have loved seing from your students? (We thought of doing a vídeo but no one knows how that would turn out good) Any tips on delivering a really good project? Thank you so much",5.730497076023389,5.811988657894743,5.746666666666666,83.94277777777779,67.02631578947367,8.860818713450293,30.046783625730995,8.515128840125781,1.984677485380117,604,20,125,8,9,190,104,152,0.071,0.7609999999999999,0.168,0.9557,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,6,4,0,1,9,10,0,0,10,0,17,1,0,1,0,27,27,11,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,8,8,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,6,0,16,9,16,17,4,12,0,1,0,1,15,8,0,4,4,89,24,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15735614029694295,0.0,0.17341134592411558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686271359050502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09579299038134607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546599836979874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15015699005017502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821007969101476,0.15074600442827527,0.0,0.2636083951002621,0.0,0.17325084995185228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10532972417682952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682249653029185,0.17739546047049096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3272807654684234,0.08636175179012875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335974652875797,0.14182780548771162,0.0,0.0,0.1593184640466535,0.15787139042052598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310365558232279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16712349606717855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064842483194502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894325663196312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485510461649153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10066990968227732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341993700380278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15903723185665666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14467627655125573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10069096926629202,0.0,0.24950817620574595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1709265950927698,0.0,0.0,0.18902383071638895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09268708649631142,0.0,0.252101472114313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11440206648330074,0.0,0.0,0.22325993452638385,0.0,0.0,0.10119502028748137
teaching,CalvesDontGrow,2020/01/07,"What do I do? I'm graduating with a bachelors in Secondary Ed, but my school doesn't give certification with a bachelors.. I do not want to do my schools masters program as it's extremely expensive and I just can't with another year of schooling.

I'm in Kentucky.

I was told that I can teach as long as I'm completing my masters during the school year, but how am I ever gonna even get hired if I'm not certified?

teaching,vicster_yea,2020/01/07,"I was just offered a position for 5th grade starting mid-year... help! Recently graduated in December. I filled out applications for 3 districts in my area and had 5 interviews before and one during break. I didn’t think I would be offered anything, so I made plans to sub. 

Anyway, I just got the call. I have 24 hours to think about it. And I think it’s on a rough side of town. I don’t have experience in 5th grade and I’m afraid if there’s behavior issues or hardcore stress preparing for the STAAR test. 

I’m struggling and need money, but also want to be mindful of the challenges that could lie ahead. Anyone have any kind of advice? Tips? Should I take it? Should I not be picky and just finish until May?

Edit: did I mention this would be my first year teaching?!

Teaching is not what I've ever really wanted to do, but the job just fits my schedule.  I am a shy person and not very good at speaking loudly.  The district has also given very little training for this so I will be walking in, not knowing what to do at all.

I'll be working with elementary kids, probably 2nd or third grade.  I've done plenty of volunteering in classrooms, teaching reading 1-on-1, room momming and that sort of thing.

teaching,ThrowMeAwayStudent,2020/01/07,"Should I visit my old school Friday + advice for this? I graduated HS c/o 2017. As much as I hated it then sometimes I wish I could go back for a variety of reasons. I'm home from college on winter break and go back January 18th. I was thinking of visiting Friday, but am not sure if I should. I'd be helping an old speech and debate team of mine, mainly, so no harm there.

But I think I've developed a pattern over my life of sort of over-attaching to female teachers because of sorta emotionally neglectful parents, and there's this one teacher I lowkey sorta wish I would play a more maternal figure in my life. I tried to see a therapist about this issue, but he was totally creepy and unprofessional about this serious concern. 

So...because of this, I wonder if visiting will be emotionally triggering (I'd be sad if I didn't see her, and I'd be sad even if I did see her) because at most we'd just chat for a few minutes and move on with our lives. Plus this might be my last visit to my old HS forever...I personally have the idea that it's weird to visit past the 2 year mark, so yeah.

Any advice from the teacher perspective?",3.53987979539642,4.739212430434783,5.385601023017903,80.5478644501279,72.52173913043478,8.71611253196931,28.312020460358056,9.168548406835145,2.3579872122762158,889,34,179,19,17,306,134,230,0.15,0.7859999999999999,0.064,-0.9678,1,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,2,0,0,1,10,9,1,0,9,1,18,2,0,2,2,38,30,19,0,10,9,1,0,0,0,5,2,1,1,1,9,8,0,1,6,3,0,8,3,7,0,1,4,4,24,2,27,14,6,24,0,3,3,0,15,5,0,10,10,117,33,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477620762253024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08620993832863352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949611129473207,0.0,0.23183880089561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1012178674710526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852049618582532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373232337802197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14409595303112516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251620206063199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497322143860729,0.0,0.12716358330479788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431112049572678,0.0,0.13231800028290894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333685654886203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1790869364585901,0.0,0.0,0.11194281808922478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13448604294143582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347395598040827,0.09319268882458036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3990805875787419,0.0,0.08590461698144977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.140766334076929,0.0,0.12101910451560442,0.0,0.11069323094646716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034368407560065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283009713084544,0.3030648310189043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253816674541972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11948198442675985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14719314053249738,0.0,0.16246194690434393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08607049657805306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915652217323485,0.0,0.13747983274014802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005585082056379,0.0,0.0,0.08163760927481946
teaching,TennyoAkana,2020/01/07,"I'm struggling with what to say to my students in this political climate. Heya,

So today was our first day back from Winter Break, and almost immediately my 8th graders were making jokes about being drafted, and World War 3. I told them as far as I know we no longer have the draft after the Vietnam War so they shouldn't have to worry. But I know they are. Today's assignment was meant to be something fun, it's a start to a new decade, write a letter to yourself dated 10 years in the future. What do you hope to do/accomplish? It was that type of assignment, meant to give the kids a break before we jump right in but...a few of them in different periods made comments about ""World War 3"" and how they're probably gonna die from it--although I know most of them were doing the whole ""What if I'm dead?"" joke, but I know that there is always at least one student who is concerned about it. 

How do you handle this in your classroom? Is it an issue? For background info on the population of students I work with, 99% of them are Hispanic, with parents who work in the fields near the school. They are not a fan of this current administration at all. So I'm sure that plays a part of it, but it is heartbreaking to watch. 

You know 9/11 happened when I was in 6th grade, and I can remember that day very well, and how overnight things seemed different. I feel like that it's happening again, and we're taking away part of our students' innocence. 

Anyway, any advice would be appreciated. Hope you all have a good night/morning.",4.435836101882615,5.478561664451828,4.975415282392029,84.92055370985607,70.22923588039869,7.99246954595792,26.95791805094131,8.269060116576782,1.5901712070874858,1195,38,245,17,21,382,168,301,0.064,0.813,0.122,0.9576,4,0,1,0,0,0,44.0,4,5,7,3,15,15,3,1,16,0,25,0,0,5,3,42,48,19,5,5,5,1,1,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,21,11,0,0,11,3,0,1,3,5,1,2,10,3,27,10,41,32,8,36,0,1,1,0,26,16,0,6,18,164,48,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240269214551,0.0,0.0,0.12709426639312266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056094520241838,0.0,0.0,0.08631145987016478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924760084274215,0.09759535038900694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800145835631343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16370865983164892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317252227540424,0.2652134053792169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06417568647278307,0.09067325714502247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795997289428703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12175535577036692,0.0,0.10645633378879693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2244737945529692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521247993926421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.132473819062292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3487656556483484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06200778411000577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009687052319358,0.0847215653772593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12258226802686975,0.0,0.1191079026551336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08600577897401915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14093210168456513,0.2748887849411157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13684361677559512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437781297899998,0.10839087977892972,0.0,0.10093364119860504,0.0,0.128452059601054,0.0,0.11554521944068667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977109234619448,0.0,0.0,0.08983619841799974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13268665891760442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196226874069427,0.0,0.09542971147706496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843214812093479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24061484207515998,0.12127961742206743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10472412134863532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114118315778099,0.0,0.0,0.14170412256425402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18480177114302065,0.1288956722576138,0.0,0.09016190134068318,0.0,0.0,0.08173374640356802

teaching,Mr_Sense,2020/01/07,"A hilarious and sad story Today was our first day back after winter break. I work as a para in a USA elementary. 

There’s a sweet and innocent kindergarten boy I know well. I work in a “cool down room” which, among other things is a safe space for sensitive kids to come. He gets overwhelmed by loud environments such as recess. We had indoor recess today due to bad rain, so he was chillin in my room. 

I asked how his break was and he said, “good but I miss my PUssy. “
“Your what?”
“PUssy”
“What is that?”
“Well my mom went to Australia and since I was going to miss her she bought me a new stuffy, my PUssy.”
“Oh cool, what kinda animal is it?”
“A platypus”

I asked some more questions about his mom being gone but couldn’t really answer them. I found out later from our counselor that mom is Australian and went to visit her dying mom :( :( :(. 

Super sad. But still. I can’t get a five year old boy saying “my pussy” out of my head.",-0.0551551551551519,2.288052189189191,1.6249249249249262,95.61658658658659,94.67567567567568,4.254254254254255,13.878878878878881,6.037888025583468,-0.7725055055055052,705,13,152,7,27,228,117,185,0.10300000000000001,0.767,0.13,0.316,0,1,0,0,0,0,27.0,3,1,1,4,9,14,0,1,9,2,12,1,1,1,0,21,27,12,1,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,3,9,9,0,1,4,1,1,6,2,6,2,2,11,6,26,8,20,14,2,31,0,5,0,0,26,10,0,3,13,96,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2540497851300812,0.0,0.0,0.10447957787178344,0.11345004715414965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11704438205593905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08762820977121404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14101691949004164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557530507431653,0.0,0.14898005251260305,0.0,0.0,0.14197828114589064,0.0,0.0772209602116512,0.11396560155476435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13944706997312328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07467341083990753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6365411791657034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312290346513862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14257807859463276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522112274765132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08704507920577317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12924835131763426,0.10805334663443293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11239730084400497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851004392127746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09026939016214164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25758744683527696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2443360961851246,0.2519151893928793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19783740682338455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08749912048152315

I’m in need of some book suggestions for this age, best practices, advice for ELL’s and students below grade level in reading, and ways to incorporate other content (such as science, social studies, writing, etc).",5.508301158301158,6.064622018018023,6.540231660231657,76.41567567567569,67.55855855855856,8.505019305019307,33.87516087516087,8.418075326091056,2.7435214929214933,448,20,82,6,7,150,77,111,0.0,0.863,0.13699999999999998,0.9428,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,1,1,3,3,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,13,11,7,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,9,3,18,10,5,17,0,0,1,0,7,8,0,4,7,50,11,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2073121262468778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18052541905360892,0.0,0.22264005637893888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2171047841381126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23660515720029685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11084047512380203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422007716343592,0.0,0.0,0.42142889324700616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1803637368345779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3146155042594187,0.0,0.0,0.22562567484832025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2122090502125691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4294175697382863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21626187904006355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1683960961653313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732373996589276

teaching,misscrash96,2020/01/08,"How much should I charge for private tutoring? I recently finished an LTO in Ontario and am now back to supply teaching. A mother of one of my LTO students reached out asking me to tutor my students’ younger brother. 

I do not want to charge astronomical prices for this mother. She is a single mom and I know they were struggling financially when I taught in her daughter’s class. 

What’s a rate that would be reasonable or typical for private tutoring of a primary student (in CAD)?

teaching,simowilkins,2020/01/08,"I want to start my Honors Physics course with a mini-unit on Problem Solving next year, and I'm not sure where to begin.  

My students have deplorable problem solving and reasoning skills. I think I'd most like something in the general direction of some of the courses on [Brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/), but I doubt I could get my school or district to pay for that.

I definitely don't want to have to design a whole bunch of materials myself, but I'm not even sure where to start looking.

It feels like my kids need to start with very basic reasoning and work their way up.

Does anyone have any suggestions for materials, resources, or sites that might be helpful to me?",9.642526881720427,8.657865080645163,8.171612903225808,73.28575268817207,59.483870967741936,11.16989247311828,38.40860215053763,10.125756701596842,3.7544182795698937,546,22,96,9,6,165,81,124,0.096,0.7440000000000001,0.161,0.8182,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,3,3,8,0,1,4,0,7,0,0,2,2,28,20,7,0,6,6,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,4,0,1,0,3,3,0,0,0,2,12,5,19,17,4,14,0,0,1,0,4,7,0,6,8,61,15,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12093574520357747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12434826596873864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14198894544926316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15562698370968944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746013419875885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992009264137071,0.12704729985292929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09291286663544428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192008723849584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17376505022731653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14933889187714602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18865771322795305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318644130496926,0.0,0.0,0.18913242850411013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3403333534314536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3656935817810901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17998126290710087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13690816215106913,0.0,0.0,0.3776233521578774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352198854375744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11395122764851355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14673474038254514,0.20978658504093656,0.14115930130634194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19854945897689424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12946797529401766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11452165847344795

I always forget how much I love being their teacher on days I can sleep in, see my own kids, eat, use the restroom... But today was glorious. They couldn’t wait to say hi and talk about their breaks and the plans for this semester. I was so glad to see them. 

Four of my kids had a meeting with a local industry leader who was giving them a work opportunity that is attached to scholarship money, and they aced it. Gave my lower level kids a project that the uppers always dread, and the lowers got started on it with no complaints and are generally rocking it.

teaching,jamesters,2020/01/08,"How to get fellow teachers excited about field trips? Hi folks,

Newbie teacher here. I teach at a Title I middle school where field trips are rare and, more importantly, my fellow teachers seem to be a bit averse to them. I'm super jazzed about them and have been working to make them a more regular thing, especially since our city has so many cool educational opportunities that are right under our noses.

From my conversations with my colleagues, it is a hassle and they're burnt out, old and out of shape, and/or just don't like the extra work. What's making me scratch my head is that I'm making it as easy as possible (admittedly, not as easy as leaving everything status quo) to participate by taking care of the funding and logistics, and even providing some curriculum tie-ins for their subject's standards and Units. What's going on here?

Could my being the new guy and trying to coordinate things when I'm a totally green teacher come off wrong? Are folks really just burnt out to where they forget that these kinds of things are what we're here for - to teach our kids how to engage with the world *IN the world*?

I just look back at my grade school days and remember field trips as some of the most exciting and illuminating learning experiences... Admittedly, I'm an experiential learner and a wanderer and things like that.

Maybe, on a bigger-picture level, how does a new teacher keep the momentum and get things happening to shake up a school culture? I know the whole thing about ""a workplace culture is more likely to change you than the other way around,"" but I know I have colleagues who are on the same wavelength as me - I guess I'm just surprised that field trips are looked at as ""too much trouble"" to my fellow teachers.

Any words of wisdom (and support) are greatly appreciated! Negative nancies need not apply! :P -- that said, I can take blunt truths, I just prefer them without the glum spin.",6.202621722846445,7.441661191011237,6.171404494382024,77.23647003745319,66.30337078651687,9.079400749063671,30.00187265917603,9.2995712137729,2.5592344569288388,1528,54,276,28,24,482,199,356,0.055999999999999994,0.8340000000000001,0.11,0.9555,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,3,1,6,4,22,19,0,1,22,1,19,2,2,6,2,57,47,27,0,3,9,0,1,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,20,21,0,1,8,1,1,7,5,3,0,0,2,7,28,16,49,42,12,36,0,0,3,0,23,22,0,5,9,185,48,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07645614183093488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10008638788885918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08645160170626429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122744258576885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1146297078105971,0.0,0.11893585566210148,0.09684834592147216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08976607316074656,0.0,0.0,0.07250794120426761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09838810451946202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0742588443529539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010446843930729,0.10997795027857267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11747989475634575,0.0,0.06389646504683946,0.0,0.0,0.12395428780713445,0.12385413651339724,0.1113232108743514,0.0994213300266658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538544467720135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09993280141922688,0.0,0.1170783699124314,0.12357699185772425,0.0,0.0,0.11904695957261888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478261207728806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188825487104965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2251433597010086,0.11398620411338625,0.11295087885650598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08264886360569135,0.08336529658463658,0.0,0.2171708666338917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11797619701176568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674774382741194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07202542995744664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273610839157018,0.09601446308547812,0.10694651736644407,0.0,0.0,0.34135498004924897,0.0,0.10235189740426726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.093003119684783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758404214742208,0.0,0.0,0.16906648471827646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4481603117199671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633247652660659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892415682664028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12552389345630588,0.0,0.10837834695494468,0.0,0.1637005149301477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292437286698485,0.0,0.0
teaching,Affectionate-Lime,2020/01/08,"What is your impression of overseas students in your classes? In the last 20 years, there has been a huge influx of foreign students, mainly from China and India, to countries such as America, Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.

I have encountered many of these students myself and many have had a very enjoyable and successful time in the country of their choice. Others seem to have failed terribly.

I think because many schools and colleges look at these students as 'cash cows' they try to lower the standards of admission to get all that lovely international student fee cash in the bank. This doesn't seem fair or decent to me...

I had one student who had near fluent English but even she said that she had a very hard time adjusting to life in Australia as she could not keep up with the discussion in the class. If she had trouble where does that leave the vast majority whose English level is not as good?

I just imagine that having to manage a class of native speakers and a group of non-native speakers must be more than a little challenging.

teaching,Gratakos,2020/01/09,"Continue getting a degree in early education or switch to science education? Hello all, I have recently been having doubts about getting a getting a degree in early education due to the surplus of elementary teachers in the market. Math, science, and special ed. teachers are seemingly always in demand and as someone who’s always enjoyed the sciences, I’ve been thinking of changing degrees to a bachelor’s in science education. I know the workplace environments are very different and I am completely fine with it. What motivates me to be a teacher is to want to help students learn and become educated, whether they’re 7 or 17.

A little about myself, I am 21 year old latino male and got my associates degree last semester. I am more than willing to move for a job. 

My parents and a couple professors have said that being male and bilingual in the early education field will help me find a job quickly as going long periods of time jobless has been a fear of mine for since I got to college. While I value their opinions, I would also like to hear from actual teachers who have better insider info since I feel confused at this time.",8.690334928229664,8.383902148325362,9.322392344497608,62.066746411483265,61.00956937799042,11.619138755980869,42.44497607655502,11.022393298168332,5.1433789473684195,915,49,137,21,11,310,129,209,0.045,0.8440000000000001,0.111,0.9079999999999999,5,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,2,4,8,0,3,15,0,19,0,0,1,1,25,32,14,0,2,3,1,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,2,6,8,0,0,8,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,6,3,16,5,29,21,2,25,0,0,0,0,11,8,0,6,16,100,22,9,0.0,0.0,0.1506887842549358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12348727415959587,0.2569747427317068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17054152059751115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365693488163275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1633527838568983,0.0,0.16190335876791306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1708595496085472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16133297093691376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737621329421994,0.07807790971776686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14113440341594116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24202963541354774,0.0,0.087758778762813,0.0,0.2470028724332837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17403925927001826,0.0,0.20700501253865167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30647022775224103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08486358267758659,0.12587052087378547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544037992633028,0.15476646979421907,0.0,0.13665424669896628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16412090653081926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16203473799753967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17146188091543485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15246822646254404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468859936169402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14057549996968913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.255470790087847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308370813232587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989442226227862,0.0,0.0,0.18008366925605154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274102536542235,0.0910791880083587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10969345525965793,0.0,0.0,0.09943952956855516

I've been searching around for quite a while on what virtual classroom connected with a learning management system is the best to use. Do any of you use these platforms for teaching online? Which ones do you recommend?

Here's a few that are exactly what I am looking for: Classin, Tutorroom, [buka.tv](https://buka.tv) .

Something similar to these would be great. I really need something stable, that has admin, teacher, and student login, as well as a class booking system integrated with the virtual classroom.

teaching,FutureHistoryProf,2020/01/09,"Mental health check in ideas without embarrassment? First year teacher here, 11th grade ELA. I’ve been seeing ideas online for how some teachers are creating mental health check in posters for their classes. I like this idea and want to implement it, but I’m having trouble thinking of ways to do it so that it’s anonymous. Ideally I want my kids to not feel  embarrassed by doing it, but are also able to feel as though they’re legitimately being thought of and considered. Any and all ideas would be great.

teaching,etnom654321,2020/01/09,"How do you know if it’s imposter syndrome or you’re actually incompetent? Greetings, please excuse typos/errors, using a tiny mobile. First year teacher here unsure of their level of competence. I teach at a small high school, part-time. I cannot shake the feeling that I am constantly missing where my weak spots are, obviously I have them, but when trying to pinpoint where to improve I can’t find out what specifically is causing me to feel this way. I feel it’s either: I must be terrible at everything or I must be balanced and doing everything “okay” (not saying I can’t improve, just that my teaching must be at least par across the board). We have no mentors. One person per content area. We create our own curriculum—which I actually love doing. I have been observed many times and only have received positive feedback, even when I asked for some type of constructive criticism, the kicker is all the staff thinks our principal is incompetent and literally 8 out of 10 are leaving after this year, so I am unsure if I should trust her judgment. I’ve had students fill out a teacher evaluation, and the ratings where neutral to positive, but nothing stellar.  I see a therapist weekly, but it has not seemed to help this dilemma! I want to teach, and I know I can grow to become a great teacher, but I often see post attacking  those who are obviously just “not cut out,” how do you  if you are just “not cut out?”

teaching,hyamtich,2020/01/09,"Sitting through boring, irrelevant PD sessions is really demoralizing. What are your coping strategies? It sucks the life out of me. We have a week of PD at the start of Semester 2 and about half of it has been helpful and half has been painful.

I like my job and I want to get better at it. But these sessions seem to suck the life out of me and when we get an hour of work time here or there it seems to get sucked up by tedious tasks... there are lots of things I want to do to make my class better for kids but those seem always pushed to the back burner. I dont have the energy or desire to work too much outside of my contracted hours. 

How do you keep your energy up when your PD sucks? Is this just something we have to learn to accept? 

I'm in my 14th year teaching at an urban charter school... I cant tell if the PD is getting worse or if I'm just getting more tired of it.",2.6168725868725886,3.7314987837837847,3.787355212355212,91.44520270270272,74.67567567567569,6.7992277992278005,22.94401544401544,7.1686216300943375,0.5534555984555981,685,18,157,7,14,223,105,185,0.131,0.785,0.085,-0.8799,1,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,3,4,0,4,12,10,4,0,9,0,16,4,0,2,0,30,35,14,0,5,9,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,1,10,9,0,1,5,0,0,1,2,6,0,2,2,0,18,4,30,33,3,19,0,0,0,0,10,8,4,9,10,109,28,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280116486783933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182975715448402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721274054417892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18030559481973168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4018892068142009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311928969389213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3030133437952253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15266776301967847,0.1367448085662326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2173310293338419,0.07516106297945792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130793808044455,0.0,0.0,0.10269296028610908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11309402790145827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16370229058778885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09855726539791257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1556996993214277,0.0,0.4201650634676709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184376603278614,0.0,0.0,0.10889252476997968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13446760974892102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10220800905340374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0897084560002452,0.1768225888453157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814839371885208,0.0,0.12340545339114845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2240024822521375,0.0,0.15678154667853994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09907135610727837

To start, I don’t have a teaching license yet. I am in the process of student teaching in CT. 

I looked up the requirements for Massachusetts reciprocity and it seems like you can only teach in MA if you’ve taught in the state you’re applying from for 3 years. I was wondering though if I don’t have a license if they would take coursework and student teaching from Connecticut? My undergrad is from UMass so it would be the teaching courses that are from CT. I know I would also have to take MTELs. 

Any advice? Has anyone ever switched? It’s just unfortunate that I have to move because it seems like teaching at least in a public school in MA might not be possible.",4.840557398805572,6.8451306934306615,5.373842070338423,78.71772395487726,70.53284671532846,8.485467816854678,31.432647644326487,9.095868883498916,2.8575459854014604,583,26,105,12,11,187,82,137,0.024,0.932,0.044000000000000004,0.3695,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,1,1,6,2,0,0,7,0,18,0,0,0,1,17,28,8,0,6,5,2,0,2,0,4,0,0,0,0,6,2,0,1,4,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,2,1,11,2,20,20,1,15,0,0,1,0,6,8,0,7,6,75,17,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19813434297513796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621467858264718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13788348684274204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14177423280235565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1236003755200058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834076742804696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152329582241475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11143137832247983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19811620605979324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170267004999966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21509590300088352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2155013758462756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15420781911815268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285809936240213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052035488284834,0.0,0.3691694652936531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14351429463947707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048999840032351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19921028608603752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21988414649488872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4321038257002764,0.0,0.0,0.1305705402712113
teaching,mushroom-dino,2020/01/10,Has anyone had any success with sensory objects for restless kids? I work at an after school program and there’s a third grader who has a hard time keeping his hands to himself. His parents are very willing to work with us.

I'm currently starting to prepare for the application to get a preliminary license in California. This seems to be a really long and painstaking process.

teaching,eatabrick1,2020/01/10,"The Romans came from Rome. You would think, that is an easy concept. I had a half day today as the SEN group I was working with are on a reduced time table and we were covering the Romans. My first thing I did was read them a little bit of a Horrible Histories book about them (the kids love these books and I think they’re fab too!) so after I started a little quiz game where the kids could answer questions for points. 

Anyway we’re on the last but one question “Where did the Romans come from?” An easy one you might think, but no. Here is a list of the answers that were given:

- cearleon (a town about 40 miles away with a Roman fort, so not too bad)
-Newport (about a 20 minutes drive away nothing to do with the Romans)
-Greece 
-Romania (okay I understand this one)
-Scotland
-Manchester (Roman capital of England so not too bad of a guess)
-Space (this kid loves ancient aliens apparently so I gather that’s where this comes from)

You should have seen there surprise at Rome. I can’t make this up. I had to go back into the book and check I’d specified they come from Rome once they left. I love working with this group though, they never fail to put a smile on my face and are always trying their best.",1.6388547962188156,4.1300850627615056,2.3777033937703442,93.78175112350846,83.30962343096235,5.047016891368356,19.73051293971796,6.42735559955562,0.09034343716101034,946,26,194,9,27,294,141,239,0.02,0.813,0.16699999999999998,0.9901,1,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,1,3,6,5,18,10,0,0,23,1,19,4,1,1,1,33,36,12,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,10,14,0,0,8,5,1,7,5,3,0,5,11,1,22,7,29,21,2,35,0,1,1,3,22,18,0,4,10,134,32,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105949137646221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23926230528638995,0.09790925919801427,0.21263122036105467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13362545541504325,0.0,0.13901187706047452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563211772745566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32905173356796025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10166300624649503,0.0,0.0,0.08211760880271357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10830721880689076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236483112671525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14026885003054568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379131427388164,0.0,0.0,0.13834491042777133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25523713088592553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34476211712897004,0.0,0.08499406653206648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13507748943171258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982050955093072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12217700437480344,0.0,0.0,0.13560277749449462,0.25884723214363936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12036843551569293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12800227480070644,0.2852784980072288,0.0,0.1273649110543918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012515044223796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459269552063073,0.24476463991415734,0.1251015241948362,0.0,0.07424741147329808,0.0,0.12069438167763225,0.0,0.0,0.08644901982109053,0.0,0.0,0.1325554927735717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18539617347520887,0.0,0.0,0.09045190096622764,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Jozrows,2020/01/10,"Has the culture of teaching changed? I'm just recalling how I felt when I started my teaching journey 12 years ago. I started out as a sub in college and decided to change my major. School seemed so much more laid back as a whole. Classes were brighter and cheerier, there was more art on the walls, kids played, the cafeterias had salad bars, the kids weren't as stressed out... IDK it seemed much more creative and laid back to me at the time. I thought teachers seemed generally happy. Poor but happy.

It just keeps hitting me. I love the kids. They are the only reason I work. I love teaching them. I love nearly every part about the heart of the job. They are some of my favorite people... I brag about them like they're my own kids sometimes.

teaching,Clover51022,2020/01/10,"Switching from Elementary Teaching to Middle School? I am looking for advice from someone who might have done this: I am a New Jersey certified  (K-5) elementary teacher, currently teaching, and have 15 years of experience. Additionally, I have a Masters in Education plus 30 additional graduate credits in education. 

I am thinking of becoming a middle school math teacher (grades 6-8), but can't seem to find the exact requirements necessary to make this change. I am planning on calling the state department of education, but was hoping there might be someone out there who has ""been there, done that"" with some advice. Has anyone in NJ made the change from elementary teaching to middle school? I think I'm mostly wondering if a content area degree is required for middle school - in this case mathematics.

teaching,SteveVLS,2020/01/11,"LessonStack - Lesson Planning Tool  Hi guys, I'm an ex FE teacher + sports coach, and I've been working on a lesson planning tool called LessonStack.  


The concept behind it is that if we work in chunks of teaching that have an objective, activity and learning assessment bundled together, then it's easy to make a lesson plan by dragging and dropping pieces of teaching on to a 'Lesson Stack'. The stack then helps you stay on track by giving you a check-able timeline of your lesson to work to.  


It's new so there's not really any community on there at the moment, but it's designed so if other teachers are working in the same field as you, they can share activities and you can drag them straight into your stacks, which would ease some of the administrative burden of planning and allow teachers to be more collaborative.  


It's freemium, so everything you need to teach is free, but if you want to work in private teams it costs £6 a month.  


I'd really love some feedback, does LessonStack seem like something you would think about using as a teacher? Would it make your admin life a bit easier?

teaching,ingenuisance,2020/01/12,"First Year &amp; First World Problems I see these posts all the time and I hated to add to it. But Monday is coming and the dread won't leave me alone.

Background- I spent the last five years working in a high school as one of only 2 secretaries for 2k students and over 100 teachers. It was nightmarish at times and I had more than a handful of days where I had no lunch and couldn't go to the restroom. The pay was low and I was barely able to cover my few bills while living with my parents. I have an English degree and knew that everyone would advise me to go into teaching. But that was never something I wanted. Fast forward, I get out the office last October, after scrambling through a teacher prep course for 12 weeks and passing the Praxis with a shockingly high score (low expectations on my part), now I'm teaching 10th grade ELD. I came in during 2nd quarter with no classroom experience and the expectation of graduate level teacher prep classes and preparing my students for their eventual descent into WIDA madness this semester. Along with a host of other ILPs, IEPs, 504, 411, and IDK that I have 0 training or experience in. Same high school. Urban and low income. And I am a floater with a shared office.

With 0 classroom experience, vague inclinations of the standards I am supposed to cover, and an insanely supportive team and administration, I survived the end of the first semester and exam season. I get to eat lunch and go to the bathroom. Major plus. Also, my salary doubled and I am able to afford basic living. I am entering graduate classes to complete my licensure, with class once a week.

My students are mostly good. Of course I have behavior issues (they are teens), talking, and cell phone disruption(see previous comment). But they are actually quite funny to be around and I enjoy them more than some of the ones my colleagues have to wrangle.

I have finally gotten trained on some of the other things I am required to do by the school. And I have developed a bootleg curriculum that aligns with what my EL team is doing. I have been observed unofficially by my administrator and told that I am doing incredible. Constantly getting feedback from my team telling me how great I am doing, how organized I am, they love my lessons and always ask me to send them the activities and lesson plans I designed so they can use them. Consistently given great feedback on the work my kids are doing and how I am a great teacher. Even the Literacy specialist at the school stops to talk about the lessons and planning I've done.

And I'm not having to nearly kill myself to achieve this level of input and acceptance. Most days I leave an hour late just because I wanted to finish getting things printed and ready for the next day. I refuse to go in early. 6:30 is hard enough as it is for this nightowl.

From what I have read, this is not the typical first year teaching experience. Especially not in an inner city high school. And I should be happy and excited about all of this. I am having the dream first year in one of the rough schools in the district. But I am not happy or excited. I am just making it work. And I am still fumbling trying to make sure I'm doing what I'm supposed to. Teaching was never on my radar. Never a dream. Not something I trained or studied for. Certainly not something I want to go into debt to further my education doing (which might factor into my current blah mood). And while I feel insanely lucky/blessed I haven't had to put a child in a chokehold, I can't get over how unhappy I am teaching. I want out and have 0 plans outside of what I'm doing. It just isn't something I enjoy... 

I recently read where someone said, ""You don't have to like teaching to be a great teacher.""

Is that true? And is it possible I will eventually just breathe into this position and find some kind of joy in it? Anyone here who didn't want to teach but fell into it? How did you get over the ennui of it and find something to look forward to? 6:30am comes really early and it is hard to self motivate being at work at that time without dire necessity or passion.

I know this is very ""first world problem"" coming from someone who is having a great first year. And I don't want anyone to assume I am ungrateful or whining. My team and admin staff are blessings and I have history in the building that allows me to avoid the ugliness of teacher drama. I am fully aware of how great I have it and how much worse it could be. I just also know that I wouldn't have continued teaching if I'd had it as bad as some of the other people here. The only reason I am still going is because of how easy it's been.",4.467661813889436,6.052481658862878,5.366821922749033,80.08006959472755,70.76142697881828,7.907462784444879,29.690619056987344,8.450384577883757,2.289873513017248,3676,148,673,59,68,1202,379,897,0.077,0.8320000000000001,0.09,0.9482,6,2,5,0,0,1,96.0,0,2,8,26,27,39,3,2,49,0,90,7,2,14,8,150,135,71,1,16,23,1,5,2,0,6,0,1,0,3,43,66,3,4,13,9,4,17,21,13,0,12,21,8,89,25,114,101,17,111,1,4,2,2,34,48,0,14,50,503,132,44,0.10721877474584532,0.0,0.05231502882887349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0555231575730448,0.0,0.08574281542717614,0.04460730485275397,0.058085748820796236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07496986026297968,0.0,0.0,0.047723720612048215,0.050117540458340507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044761599190783895,0.06535956991637963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061314857450871174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13853922096662505,0.05620842269923208,0.0579327026663519,0.0,0.042802733581726204,0.0,0.0,0.10372085958471672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054861016064242735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054855786880729576,0.0,0.0,0.04748200510321944,0.05539282784878143,0.0,0.03540849475764152,0.0,0.0,0.05122606701465219,0.0,0.20976107074255035,0.0,0.0,0.027106517037610002,0.0,0.0,0.058726463460883865,0.0979960176858216,0.3192008225912785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1680521535389155,0.0,0.1828047016370926,0.0449650106482512,0.0,0.35462723301846144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11413637944196753,0.09604696225866832,0.05292817124501235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22656504447640896,0.0,0.0,0.05279444777359309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05595427226122757,0.0,0.0,0.05931084423659633,0.05582592731410635,0.058924634587116075,0.08739761171710059,0.06047372401721024,0.11352920128691875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026190838755657857,0.0,0.09467614243959536,0.0,0.04501838352403136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04838456515428868,0.0,0.07156936471028225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056871088181433375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03940906809426722,0.0,0.1240405933676914,0.0,0.05701419165634289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05709224793103203,0.10898132491722777,0.08154470965724497,0.0,0.0,0.059526880434368074,0.058053742328212976,0.0,0.0371659991530104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06043652930450275,0.05134297409985882,0.0,0.0,0.10259388721995448,0.0,0.05389224132193548,0.0,0.057020182381029766,0.10724778966900436,0.0,0.03434354629791217,0.05511937885022313,0.052932802546078926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05099480381783128,0.0,0.0,0.3255333725399636,0.04271974090543817,0.0,0.05592628280290622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09084611990407966,0.20635562758686554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08562505201216959,0.04481984831322687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06083529749081003,0.05052621315794037,0.0,0.0,0.08617838976570702,0.046856967493331715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07123138972598449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09378019467727312,0.0,0.0,0.05122606701465219,0.0,0.036397255013606064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04630129816445421,0.0,0.04423335901189647,0.18972123386329345,0.0,0.08600443376432222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051677536372047805,0.0,0.156113089968839,0.0,0.05463254571110245,0.038082570661258634,0.0,0.0,0.17261343907677665

Thursday: Emergency meeting after school. Unless we get money from the county commissioners there will be a ""reduction in staff"" by April, meaning we're fired. Our contracts will be voided since we're a non-union state. But! Don't worry because our interim superintendent (our original one ""retired"" under mysterious circumstances...) will make sure we're all good. 

Friday: Last hour of school we get an email, our superintendent is quitting due to conflict with the school board.

teaching,ems1793,2020/01/12,"I had to call... I had to call CPS on a student of mine in Kindergarten due to documented neglect and came to school once smelling like a specific drug. Parent is now asking for my IAs’ emails, however, my principal has my back 100% and she assured me that she will direct the conversation wherein I will not get harassed. Meeting with this parent on Wednesday with other personnels who came in contact with child and I am so terrified... this parent I think has a mental health disorder. She is also threatening me that she will let the superintendent know if I don’t reply right away regarding my IAs’ emails. 

How do I respond to her request? How do I act during this meeting? I know I did the lawful thing and yet it feels like Im the one who is in this darn mess.

teaching,SamNoche,2020/01/13,"Looking for advice from teachers who switched from teaching core subjects to non-core subject Currently I’m an elementary school teacher teaching all subjects. I’m feeling mixed about my current placement. I have great coworkers and supportive academic coaches, but there’s so much pressure to get the kids to test well. It’s incredibly draining. It looks like some positions for teaching art at various area schools will open up next year. I’m interested in hearing from people who made that switch. How does the stress compare? Are you happier teaching a non-core subject?

teaching,2Lx8,2020/01/13,"Tips from a rural village teacher I'm 4 years into education. My first year I was a biology teacher in a private school - that private school was located in one of the biggest cities in my country and had 5000 students. 

My second year, I moved out to a rural village (high) school. My old school population is bigger than the current village I live in, and the school I work at currently has 66 students. I'm the only qualified teacher on-site, my only backup is a TA on exchange from England and local student teachers rotating through. This is where I've stayed. We teach 22 courses, up to 4 at the same time. Here's what I've learned 

1: **Utilize all your space**

We have very limited space, and it's important to utilize all of the space in our rooms. Move desks for activities, make different configurations for different parts of your unit, etc. Have students do different types of work against the walls, on the floor, etc. Also - dry erase markers can come off anything non-porous. That means students can work on floor tiles, desk tops, windows. Have different groups doing different things, have students work independently on tasks apart from eachother. 

2: **Utilize your time wisely** 

We always hear teachers use this as an excuse to cram as much instruction as possible into the time they have. This isn't what I mean. It's not bad to sacrifice some time to create *quality* instructional time. Some groups might need a quick stretch break every now &amp; then, have a certain time for administrative problems (makeup/retakes/conferences), whatever. Alternatively, don't be afraid to have multiple different skill-level groups working at the same time, maybe on different things, staggered.

3: **Utilize child labor** 

We've selected students especially proficient at various topics to be tutors within their own grade/course level and some grade 12 students to tutor in subject areas broadly. We also have students do administrative work as needed during a downtime - students make my blank worksheet formats, we do peer grading. 

4: **Deal with conflict &amp; behavior quickly**

This may differ in a bigger school, but nearly 70 people in a small space unable to escape each other - that's a recipe for conflict. It's really important that we let everybody have fun, but recognize &amp; quickly shut down any issues that develop. My personal goal in these is whenever I act on a potentially developing conflict, I want to have it managed fairly with no further action needed in 2 sentences or less. Reacting to other behavioral issues is important too, but it's also ok to allow the group to reel the trouble back in as long as it's quite minor and everybody knows your aware. This can be done quite effectively by sitting in silence and staring at someone. 

One thing I also do is turn up funny/annoying music while people are arguing until the rest of the class reels them in, and they can't take themselves seriously. 

5: **Don't be serious all the time** 

Nearly 70 people, behaving 100% seriously, 100% of the time - recipe for someone to break. Even though our job is education we have to entertain to do that.",4.498182191089236,7.445517537769785,5.2987429004165065,74.44688817367161,75.06115107913669,8.002473810425343,31.337119777861925,8.841846274778883,3.2687570743405274,2485,120,386,57,57,805,289,556,0.039,0.8859999999999999,0.075,0.9063,10,0,0,0,0,0,104.0,9,4,4,13,14,13,1,1,29,1,44,0,0,7,4,58,60,26,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,2,2,25,22,0,4,5,1,1,5,6,8,0,4,4,2,32,5,78,49,17,91,1,0,1,0,27,57,0,6,25,259,57,40,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018598113248852,0.05250831860621763,0.20512234592277534,0.0,0.042913484989890574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051929942539973885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04852376046357985,0.05268994213821882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05435926976523458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06505836434323624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.527449379629503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06457820574614326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14075725307424974,0.0416801806394282,0.0,0.053168586351323606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0536769819821973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07112379044411575,0.0,0.0,0.06667377450660235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13173020719229542,0.06262185999709619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03468079383935502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452901924318845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055722768591779166,0.055845836429563166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08424600000060478,0.0,0.06339733771973345,0.13747943672888602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06694430940336532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13414100947747695,0.04638935058503437,0.1403744153703198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06621796023691501,0.0,0.08552300495432164,0.09598821559536076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833643970455823,0.0,0.13124694248755095,0.055100750525951606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07114127487975587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06038285136232729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13423962345767687,0.0,0.0,0.040426604499662434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3831930689089736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693712663896936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06726140983284902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047447019170118426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12577224242224316,0.0,0.06200022800072505,0.0,0.3311726873427116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06863999262637495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054502358390086485,0.0,0.052068138070360766,0.03722089549735673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.275646642194933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12191242871108478
teaching,thanks_just_lurking,2020/01/13,"Serious question- Is a Bob Ross chia pet considered culturally insensitive? I bought a Bob Ross chia pet for my classroom.  I thought it would be a fun little thing for students to watch grow.  They are high school age but are amazed by the same things little kids are.  I picked Bob Ross because a lot of them like Bob Ross memes and he seems to be a wholesome figure in general.  Well today, an African American student asked me if they made him into a chia pet just because he has a Afro.  I just replied that I got it just because a lot of kids get a kick out of Bob Ross.  

Now I’m doubting if this is a good idea after all. I certainly didn’t mean to imply anything about Afros or anything else.

teaching,Sooawesome36,2020/01/13,"How do I get into a teaching career while I'm still in school majoring in something else? So I originally wanted to become a high school teacher before I went to college, and then instead went into finance because I figured that's where the money was. I ended changing my mind and figured it really doesn't matter how much I make if I hate my job.

Anyways, I'm in my 3rd year of finance, and to throw that away and major in something else would be ridiculous, but it seems like in order to get a license to teach I would need to graduate first and reapply to get my Master's afterwards. Is that correct? Is it something that I could just do at a community college afterwards, rather than spending another shitload on college (without being supported by the scholarship I have now)?",10.74337807606264,7.671566436241612,10.488288590604034,64.0976230425056,59.13422818791946,12.617897091722595,46.30984340044743,10.504223727775694,5.100824608501117,625,32,103,10,6,207,93,149,0.039,0.912,0.049,0.5368,1,0,3,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,2,10,4,2,0,6,0,12,0,0,4,1,27,25,12,0,7,5,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,3,0,5,3,2,2,0,1,3,0,14,2,21,17,3,26,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,2,11,81,21,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16916338590528568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15157019926278745,0.0,0.0,0.09834225589969443,0.17817084810464193,0.1372757392857384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17066051679418753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1288049289334652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695327646255727,0.0,0.1428861145342755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1372230090026852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25285704769726564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15927509215679278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704487775113166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16009022379455795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07881527281871105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076857266337869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16289231651026925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185924774062401,0.11962048381990358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10334896092043816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3265391359130592,0.0,0.1468642707334879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37258772590675576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12883439697015464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18306976013549234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09515369697230333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29909988366238066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15551159570565296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22920138024648376,0.0,0.0,0.10388804589217818
teaching,lizardstilly,2020/01/13,"Help with transferring new license to new state... I need some advice. Bit of background, I grew up in the West but I’m here in Pennsylvania while my husband attends grad school. I have been substitute teaching in an elementary school and been loving it; I realized I would love to do this as my career. Since we won’t be here long term (his program is done spring 2021) I decided to pursue WGU’s MAT for elementary ed (all online, as opposed to going to a local university or going through Philly’s intern program). 

If I hit my goals, I will student teach in January 2021, leading to licensure right after. However, that is the summer we will *most likely* be moving back to one of the west coast states, wherever he finds the better job (OR/WA/CA). 

If you were in my situation, what would you do? Should I delay my program until I know for sure what state we want to move to? Or is transferring a brand new teaching license to a different state not as complicated as I think it is?? 

Oregon looked pretty easy, but we will more likely end up in CA or WA. California looked kinda complex and Washington didn’t even have an option to transfer a brand new license, just a license with 3+ years experience. I’m worried I will do all this work and have to do a ton again when we move. Please let me know your experiences and/or advice!",4.455055079559365,5.8587534651162825,5.576332109343127,79.26864749082009,70.55038759689923,8.532354141166872,28.695226438188485,8.99025400887824,2.346446511627907,1046,39,198,20,19,347,150,258,0.022000000000000002,0.848,0.13,0.9832,3,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,5,3,0,4,7,6,0,0,12,0,27,2,0,1,3,41,41,17,0,7,9,1,0,2,0,8,0,0,0,0,7,10,0,2,7,0,0,8,3,0,0,1,5,2,27,6,33,24,8,41,0,0,2,2,14,12,0,9,19,132,34,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370736937883127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09327527419787901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10728351405641093,0.13243253044488953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12673684252936576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12413608901353827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10743932276304054,0.0,0.0,0.08012013579775581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.237317140816172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108696415700202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378796963824739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08130750188428393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12037548422065165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13333099182178673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12404153977609017,0.0,0.11852599621211372,0.0,0.0,0.10735020649702356,0.2037295867010808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21896315882450035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3867808055473059,0.0,0.08994536531479948,0.0,0.4686245652658501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08219871729982978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331553448882321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340975884970312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103592937487602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2455322109673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10034390709533504,0.1363507577492777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143275670787136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07772669336535089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07154823122194634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08831074332389786,0.12319008154412148,0.0,0.17234173628627333,0.0,0.0,0.07811578703929165

I told her gently that while I like talking to her, I cannot be a parental figure in her life for professional reasons. Is there anything else I should've done? She doesn't really seem to want to talk to me as much anymore and I'm afraid I may have hurt her feelings. 

It honestly saddens me that no one can play that role in her life for her. She seems pretty sweet and intelligent from what I can see.

I needed to create a throwaway account just in case.

 I am a teacher in the US and have a fantastic teaching position.

My partner is an incredibly hard worker. He works all year round for an office with an employer who rarely acknowledges or shows appreciation of their employees. 

But.... My partner has been offered by his company a free 4 day trip to a resort in central America as their way of saying thanks.  This is a big deal as only a few employees are selected and this method of appreciation is very rare. Spouses like myself, are also invited to go on this trip. No cost is needed as everything is paid for by the company. Super sweet!

The issue is that this trip would be in the middle of the week and during a normal school schedule.   Although I do have personal leave, I do not believe that its supposed to be used this way (and we only receive 3 days per year anyway).

 I have yet to tell any of my colleagues but was considering discussing this with my Union representative at my school.  I am nervous about even considering something like this as I have a hard time trusting colleagues and administrators.  I want to be honest and open about this and would prefer to be up front rather than hide my absence for 4 days. 

 I am content where I am and am nervous about asking my admin about this- yet I would hate that I may not be able to celebrate my partner and his hard work.

 It's a shame that this company chose those dates but there's nothing we can do about that at this time. 

Thoughts on this are appreciated!",5.133354821012205,6.610600681388018,6.014870388149777,76.48729255246194,69.0,9.046166506652037,31.448223837608012,9.43228470229965,2.9644364010423807,1324,56,239,28,23,436,175,317,0.075,0.731,0.193,0.9939,4,0,2,0,0,0,29.0,3,0,2,5,15,14,1,3,19,0,35,0,0,1,1,39,48,21,0,11,10,1,4,2,3,4,0,1,0,4,22,14,0,0,3,1,4,6,4,4,0,0,5,6,29,11,42,34,3,35,0,0,1,0,21,14,0,5,14,179,51,7,0.1281047735199256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125182502054739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024453411009046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1742312777868298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11976067036785835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14433021142699484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24785094323057466,0.13207039643731436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13384222261715645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461199472501726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11513231019622824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0669294568346195,0.0,0.07280489496703799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3442701441960002,0.12647694223774705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12723694520405374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337081008897571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13564445828851754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251710430395662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18997613271066707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255154788307163,0.12291998519721645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19485890576816625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185614700613902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14441888404779926,0.12268896160197328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187405765215908,0.0,0.2592977399792291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09862131328861083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14537177888016306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11196921850286996,0.11794166403802492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10170088073276101,0.14939784726153574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15409426941973192,0.11064139333985057,0.0,0.1056998543711512,0.0755595145022858,0.20336721286745366,0.10275792215686427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18652360168598955,0.0,0.0,0.27300586680913225,0.0,0.0,0.16499054813370026

teaching,Cheldorado,2020/01/14,"Consequences that work? So I’m in my second year of teaching, and I love my kids to death but we have a LOT of behavior issues at my middle school. Most of the kids aren’t intentionally malicious, but they grapple exponentially with focus, responsibility, and listening, which leads to a lot of problems.

My first year I thought I was just awful at classroom management. And while, like any new teacher, I definitely had a lot to learn, I’m slowly realizing my school kind of set me up for failure and maybe a smidgeon threw me viciously and heartlessly to the wolves.

The most glaring problem is our school has no discipline system. Teachers are expected to hold all consequences themselves, so if a kid earns a consequence, which they do daily, I have to give up my lunch and recess for a “restorative conversation”. Every day. Often with the same kids for the same problems multiple times a week. 

I do call parents with varying degrees of success, but other than that, there’s really nothing in place. Supervisors and deans will refuse to come to the room or speak with students, because it might “remove the teacher’s authority”. If a student ditches class, no one will bring them back. If a student has a melt down, kicking and screaming in the middle of the room, there is no place and no person to help regulate the child. The expectation is to teach around them. Or decide to take on the mantle of behaviorist, work with the kid, and just give up a whole block of teaching time.

Now I’m just starting to vent but, essentially, I still want to make the best out of the rest of this year. I have some really wonderful kids who, in general, are just lacking the support and the boundaries they need. But when all I really have to work with is threatening a 12 millionth “restorative conversation,” I feel a little helpless when it comes to dealing with my most challenging behaviors. 

My question is then, without any outside support and only myself to rely on, what are creative consequences that ACTUALLY WORK for you in your classroom? And before you respond with “focus on rewards”, I’ve got an incentive system running that a lot of them have really seemed to buy into . That said, I’m still really looking for consequences that are A, possible, and B, have an actual impact.

I know of MarketWatch that lets you run a stockmarket simulator and  FANschool that lets you do a current events fantasy-football type simulator. You make a game, sign up your students to a class, and play until the end date to find the winner.

teaching,mybicepsarenoodles,2020/01/14,"Planning to become a high school teacher. I am also working on a YouTube channel covering conspiracy theories, mysteries, and murder cases. I don't want to get in trouble for my channel. What can I do to avoid trouble? For starters, I don't have my real name connected to my channel. I'm still editing my first video. I won't be covering topics that spread misinformation like flat earth theory and stupid things like that. Neither will I do controversial videos on American History either. I have a lot of political opinions but I want to stay as far away from politics as possible. My channel is meant for ""fun"" conspiracy theories like aliens and whatnot. 

I imagine that some students and parents might be offended that I cover high profile murder cases though. I really don't understand why though. It's just a fact of life. 

What can I do to avoid trouble?",4.4056540084388205,7.068107329113925,5.6952151898734185,72.99176793248948,73.81012658227849,9.023459915611816,33.951054852320674,9.558583805096642,3.953072067510549,690,37,111,19,15,230,95,158,0.221,0.7290000000000001,0.05,-0.977,1,2,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,3,5,13,4,2,4,0,17,1,0,0,1,21,23,10,2,2,3,1,0,3,0,3,1,0,0,0,8,4,0,2,3,6,0,0,5,9,0,1,1,0,17,4,18,17,4,11,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,4,6,79,25,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1515928908979068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17810000684902053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093566507273387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16124158285791507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990384700636918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40056592377424816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13389344798044014,0.27783167199938097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611590759703538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20109562819885585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2104864844062444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21370299418000727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21576338089583147,0.12143845384709626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19184715275645653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20204817383921686,0.15138468573886332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12593675910267546,0.0,0.3724879652773391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973410240496527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22361749426871055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1710504777646034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13800360121998345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Ready_For_Battle,2020/01/14,"I created an excel sheet that automatically generates ""Mad Minutes"" I'm not a teacher, but I tutor a ten-year-old that struggles with some of his multiplication tables. He's... energetic. And flash cards can only hold his attention for so long. I remember doing Mad Minutes in elementary school and thought they would be the perfect way to add some variety to our sessions and allow him to challenge himself. 

Unfortunately, most websites require you to pay for their worksheets. I can't afford that. So I created a spreadsheet that generates a new set of numbers every time you press F9!

I don't know if any of you will find this useful, but just in case, I'm attaching the dropbox link.

teaching,Frandroids,2020/01/14,"Software to conduct oral examinations? Hello all! Hopefully I'm at the right place to ask this question...

Currently, I'm working for the Faculty of Humanities on a Dutch university. My work mainly concerns digital examination and I'm looking for software/a platform with/on which academic staff can compose oral exams (for language courses). The software should be able to play an instruction/a message, uploaded or recorded by the teacher, after which the students should be able to record their own voices to respond to the assignment given to them. Preferably, this recording is saved every 10-30 (?) seconds in some kind of cloud space, in case the software or hardware crashes. It would also be convenient if students could pause their recording at any given time to, for example, think or take a sip of water, after which the recording will pick up where it was paused instead of starting a new recording.

We currently have software for this purpose, but the main flaws are that it's not cloud-based and it's not saving recordings every couple of seconds, resulting in students having to take the exam from the start after a software or computer crash. Also, a recording session can't be paused.

As you can imagine, the use of the current software results in a lot of stress and frustration. Therefore my question, is anyone familiar with software or a platform that has the above described features? Many, many, many thanks in advance!",8.16333333333333,9.43328481746032,7.550119047619053,68.98446428571428,61.936507936507944,9.315873015873017,42.3373015873016,9.354420925462401,4.5116539682539685,1162,67,166,19,16,363,149,252,0.05,0.9129999999999999,0.037000000000000005,-0.7371,3,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,1,1,3,3,4,8,1,1,22,0,19,1,0,5,1,36,34,13,0,7,9,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,12,5,1,0,7,1,0,1,3,2,0,2,3,2,7,6,37,22,6,26,0,0,1,0,12,15,0,11,10,121,19,12,0.3009852783692421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24069781836889695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10234015525803368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105227952446036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14069030262463333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12015612669141773,0.1665172428420386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2535930784146973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14947314732630726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15671492527952505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637591437537793,0.0,0.0,0.12794346016705954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4577277461384254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453467287034986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15723277722245452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33717239549047595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12851989158585592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21303892919247552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723888097244312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2263034712536033,0.0,0.0,0.1385534028374635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09642960656306804,0.0,0.0,0.08775346813829832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299773211354063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2191208673701725,0.0,0.0,0.10690565303199773,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,MR_JSQR,2020/01/14,"My students stole from the school Hello!

I'm brand new here and looking for advice.

Last week some students returned to school after my class and they stole a fire extinguisher. A witness (janitor) saw them and linked them to my class.

They probably thought it was a fun thing to do, but I have been trough a tough week trying to solve this whole situation. calling parents, taling to the principal, ordering a new extinguisher, talking to the janitor and colleagues,...

Tomorrow I have that same class again and I want to talk this through with them. I still don't know exactly who did it, and what they did with it. I don't want to go light on this, but I also don't want to come down raining hard on them. I am looking for a constructive and durable way to deal with this.

Did I mention it was on my birthday they stole the thing and ruined my evening since I spend it calling the principal and parents??

teaching,throwthenachos,2020/01/14,"I started my M. Ed today. I’m in my 12th year teaching. I graduated in 2007 with my BS. I love my job, but I’ve been itching to go back to school. I have zero plans to be in admin in the next 5 years (i really love teaching kids too much to leave them), but I want to have my license as an option for later in my career. 

I spent 3 hours after work today reading an accounting manual. It was boring as all get out, but I cannot even explain the rush I feel from being back in school. I love it. I’m invigorated by it. I know it will be stressful, and I’ll feel completely overwhelmed at times (what’s new..?), but today it’s wonderful. 

I had my first child during the summer after my first year of teaching. She’s now almost 11. My son is 6. I love being a mom—more than anything. I love being a teacher, but Im loving this feeling of newness and accomplishment today.",0.6208473105841534,2.6590987307692338,3.3820532099479443,87.87610468478891,83.67032967032965,5.58982070561018,20.56795835743204,6.8360192770164,0.4690725274725276,667,20,141,8,19,235,110,182,0.045,0.73,0.225,0.9897,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,1,5,5,10,0,2,7,0,13,7,1,0,1,19,32,9,0,1,5,1,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,7,4,0,0,6,1,2,2,1,3,0,3,4,3,25,7,24,22,2,32,0,1,0,6,12,8,0,3,22,93,32,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11206840295609673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920979034455137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17211405934246812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11734252461451555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391992103913385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697653299961569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19039256590887316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05847185355322186,0.0,0.06360483646220744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11021539993270864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208892347886874,0.0,0.11106005001163904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06150648828413456,0.0,0.0,0.1185036197133722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6060551164682283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13107547967328467,0.0,0.0,0.08227164757195451,0.0,0.0,0.21617968140301352,0.11902467399965885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11194698049461066,0.0,0.07169670012582598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265313390516638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07921521222059665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12820019513371828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06525952442605677,0.0,0.4243357602850252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06601136592886436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12136888086509875,0.0814766863337318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21621204528772053

teaching,ms_duckie,2020/01/14,"Thinking about switching from secondary to elementary. I am a secondary English/Language Arts teacher that moved from Iowa to Oregon almost 3 years ago. In preparation for the move I finished my program and got my license for Iowa right before we left, and began the process of switching to Oregon standards as soon as I got out here. Unfortunately, I have found it extremely difficult to find a position and have started re-thinking what I need to do, to be honest part of me feels like maybe I should give up being a teacher and find something else because it has been so discouraging. 

Recently I've started thinking that maybe part of my problem is that I'm with the wrong age group. I have worked with elementary age and younger for a very long time (I worked in childcare for 6 years before we moved) and in general interact well with that age group. The reason I chose secondary was because I enjoyed the subject matter of what I was teaching, though I have much more experience and confidence working with younger children. So now I'm wondering if I should try for elementary? And if I did, does that require I get another degree?",8.6375974025974,8.268736880952385,8.094502164502167,71.03201298701299,61.14285714285714,10.683982683982684,41.94805194805196,10.018931242160765,4.357857142857142,915,48,154,16,11,289,119,210,0.07200000000000001,0.8490000000000001,0.079,0.1254,0,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,2,0,0,4,8,8,0,0,9,0,16,0,0,1,0,35,31,15,0,6,2,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,9,15,0,2,8,1,0,3,0,4,1,0,8,1,21,4,29,19,4,25,0,1,0,0,7,7,0,4,16,105,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11171253425960603,0.0,0.1261946761081889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214698912528436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536459317290928,0.0,0.2144740190612491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028431553626053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10527675100989588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232755019500766,0.0,0.0,0.06372144234581911,0.09003145965449952,0.0,0.0,0.23036702142229665,0.0,0.0,0.13817864067968882,0.0,0.0,0.0658422572817869,0.12089355501177974,0.0,0.0,0.2015855618049116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13692527573368654,0.0,0.0,0.0615688846870917,0.0,0.0,0.11152713659748544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532157810082579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4018302073294649,0.0926420261587662,0.09344508381595434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27294308520667315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1205877992449045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12957350133433207,0.12443334276265215,0.0,0.0,0.1076236745761164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970193124241472,0.0,0.0,0.17840065148310946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24225297270765955,0.12381778731228135,0.0,0.07348551715461611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556191795786933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10398286995439816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331057101415007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366674834867117,0.2752405790849479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13778729034949425,0.0,0.16231044794110794
teaching,SanmariAlors,2020/01/14,"7th Grader Doesn't Retain Information I have this 7th grader that we do additional tutoring for because she's behind in school, but whenever she's here, she just sits there.

We'll get her started on content, walk her through it, do it with her, try just about every strategy and she always seems like she's just existing.

She's so far behind her grade level that she's working in second or third grade level reading and math and no matter how many times we seem to teach it to her, or walk her through it, she doesn't pick up on it well. We've tried using hands on material as well, but she ends up playing with it instead of using it, so we had to stop using it as a teaching method.

I'm wondering if she has a long-term memory problem because she's not retaining any of the content. She doesn't appear to have a disability outwardly, but it's very concerning for us because her mom pays a lot of money for tutoring and I feel like I've seen no improvement.

She comes several times a week and even if I put her with the same teacher, when they open up the content, she can't tell them what she learned two days previous.

I know we've shared concerns about her with her parents and the teachers are becoming frustrated because they spend weeks going over content that shouldn't take that long to get through. She's very slow and often appears to be staring into space. For context, we have a fluency test for math that is based on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (each one has their own individual content) and if they can do 25 questions in 2 minutes, we consider them proficient. She has over 100 attempts on addition fluency to do 25 questions in 2 minutes. They're always low numbers too, not adding double digits or anything crazy, it's literally 9+5 and 3+4.

We do our best to encourage her to work, but I'm getting exasperated. I had to stop scheduling her with myself (since I'm in charge of scheduling the students) because I couldn't handle working with someone that doesn't retain the information. I ran out of ways to work with her. Sometimes she'll spend an hour just on one lesson and children younger than her get through five or six.

Is there any advice that can help us help her improve?",8.209992319508451,6.869523301843319,8.26677419354839,72.60349462365593,62.525345622119815,11.492473118279571,38.639016897081426,10.504223727775694,3.955420583717357,1779,78,334,35,21,581,213,434,0.066,0.836,0.099,0.9398,1,0,1,0,0,0,44.0,10,0,6,7,19,11,1,0,13,0,28,1,1,5,0,79,51,28,0,6,17,2,2,2,0,3,0,0,0,1,19,32,0,5,11,2,4,8,11,3,2,7,4,4,57,8,57,42,6,50,0,1,2,0,61,25,0,16,17,228,76,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09983790432538997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1700248017663549,0.0,0.0,0.13895620679131046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840759942468597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31140493567278865,0.11283711357889363,0.0,0.0,0.1072195681466785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08800914132587939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589024917234168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09049099168614663,0.0,0.0,0.06748134999285138,0.0,0.08608139238256503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05165947820776517,0.07298921770781397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21351535872268013,0.0,0.0580647296453685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13696282306729365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061542102464813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05614915173591113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09982876531601004,0.0,0.0,0.18083186665376125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686002998404731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10358285267101706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196585466403718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384640791192625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344606089778235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776148432746884,0.0,0.10270759102968907,0.2289042702444904,0.0,0.10219617750133142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1034000061147368,0.0,0.1860207836885097,0.0,0.1154213569327004,0.0,0.08451486317301189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656706328100451,0.0,0.10104728786714648,0.0,0.0723154108590849,0.0,0.0,0.17083493050766593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07681801896289034,0.0,0.08929979782150413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915058204216313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13873144967972156,0.0,0.09980380740573026,0.0,0.2457923220082445,0.2647224171440901,0.0,0.16859947316439106,0.0,0.08109662296214434,0.16390686290144355,0.0,0.18372355547909144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11079741174997304,0.2975196244505485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,JigsawZball,2020/01/15,"Advice on helping kids with test anxiety I’m a fourth grade teacher and my school was chosen to pilot the writing state test a few weeks ago. This was just a practice but we had to follow 90% of the test rules. During the test, I had about 4 kids literally melt down. One even asked me in the middle of the test if he could call his mommy. It was super painful to witness. On an everyday basis, these kids are successful in the classroom. They understand the materials. 
Yesterday I went to my Vice Principal and asked if we could have the GC talk to the kids before the real test. She suggested I just continue to build their confidence and not place too much emphasis on the test. Easier said than done when they tie a teacher’s effectiveness into state test results. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to help my kids?",4.158146201624465,6.023460428571429,4.99776397515528,81.28946010511228,72.04347826086956,8.680554228380316,26.67032967032967,9.265573868473778,2.3125399904443387,663,23,125,15,13,215,106,161,0.03,0.83,0.139,0.9668,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,2,0,3,3,6,3,0,0,16,0,13,1,0,2,0,20,20,7,0,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,5,4,7,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,8,1,15,2,20,10,2,20,0,0,0,0,23,10,0,2,6,83,19,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19615787143841065,0.1779412371632557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13650804236887012,0.0,0.15356325421305236,0.0,0.0,0.14035997653780505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3753239917049078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17081240052457536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20497491894595904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3205443179544874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756662999034739,0.20542364359773746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1325848941424725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690995571332674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14756479080219276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360245851224608,0.0,0.213598319139143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20972743846969155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2284826509200174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19094685363726707,0.0,0.0,0.20315655905677169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16134479540378036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20897429453936905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16101911171986616,0.0,0.0,0.1860852084673501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,pantherpickles,2020/01/15,"Conflict of interest as a teacher candidate Hi all!

We recently found out that a teacher candidate at our school has become very close with their AT. For example, they have sleepovers at the AT’s place, they go partying together, have dinners together etc and they post it all on social media.

The AT has gone as far to say that the candidate was “meant to be in their class” and that “they are now besties for life.” Due to their new friendship, the candidate is getting off scot-free, and doesn’t have to do any work with the class, other than occasionally read to the students.  We know that her final report will be glowing, and she will mostly likely pass her practicum.

Myself and other candidates in this program are debating if we should tell our supervisor at the university about their friendship, since it has to be a conflict of interest/ integrity issue at this point.

teaching,SatoshiSounds,2020/01/15,"What kind of principal/supervisor do you have this year? In my experience, supervisors fall between four axes:     
      
Organised/disorganised; Pleasant/unpleasant.        
         
Organised supervisors are great - no surprises, no trying to 'catch you out' with unscheduled observations and meetings that lack agendas.         
Pleasant supervisors are also great - they will tend to view and treat you as a human, with human needs and human faults, not just a cog in the machine which should run as efficiently as possible (often with ever shifting goal posts, ultimately meaning that fulfillment of success criteria is impossble).     
     
Unfortunately, highly organised supervisors tend towards the unpleasant, and pleasant supervisors tend towards the disorganised.       
       
I feel really lucky at the moment, because my supervisor is 5/5 pleasant and 4/5 organised. It's a great year so far, and I feel free to do things in my own way, yet 100% supported in the event of hard times or unfamiliar processes.

teaching,fntastk,2020/01/15,"I've been a classroom assistant for a preschool since September and I've been sick at least once a month. How can I stop this?! I only work half days so I'm never eating, touching my face, etc. yet I'm still getting a bad cold like once a month. I wash my hands all the time and carry hand sanitizer. I used to be borderline germaphobe so I've trained myself not to touch face, eyes and so on. But at the same time I'm constantly holding kids hands, sitting on the floor, helping them in the bathroom, touching things that were in their mouths. 

I got a really bad cold Friday night and it's still lingering but none of the kids I work with are even sick right now. I'm vegetarian and eat healthy and drink a lot of water, exercise (when I'm not sick lol) and before all of this I haven't had a cold since 2016. It just seems like I've been constantly sick and I'm *sick* of it! 

I get that my immune system is probably adjusting, right? I've had barely any contact with kids before this job. I worked with the elderly before this and they warned me of the ""sick"" period but it never happened and most of the residents (it was skilled nursing) were worse than the kids. 

Does anyone have any tips and tricks for me? Do I just need to wait it out?",1.3505211535646282,3.63144347826087,2.6628634167764598,92.66083296735472,82.59683794466403,6.119689650124433,20.832820963255745,7.3871296695380915,0.5984848192065582,972,29,211,15,27,313,135,253,0.125,0.815,0.06,-0.9561,1,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,3,4,12,5,1,0,17,1,15,20,7,2,4,37,29,19,0,1,7,0,6,2,0,0,9,0,0,4,13,15,4,3,2,2,0,0,6,3,0,1,9,10,19,2,22,19,8,29,0,0,1,0,9,10,0,3,19,125,32,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740177217528436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08946404518933099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.213662061991516,0.0,0.0,0.3266223469760853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765321376404865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08251571708429156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11196794257495482,0.0,0.0,0.1253400896246864,0.0,0.26184499099659114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14269556822255094,0.08450828543555639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336948422173159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023315078774332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11314377714177165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576068311508737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696840411804547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12501762034841113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087766057971641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20425335460476035,0.0,0.0,0.09487163906980517,0.19736239268121625,0.0,0.0,0.12007030059498774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.272520366501712,0.0,0.09731003318048187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13794932019183567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08196660810572462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21853336725261102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647883071811545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2116794101282352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043584847479906,0.10697005225321256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500280308633783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492147296712126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105057797034444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794424683458096,0.0,0.13038969316899732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,redfirestone,2020/01/15,"Is my wife really supposed to be subjected to this? (Inappropriate sexual behavior in a special needs classroom)  

My wife is a paraprofessional in the state of Florida. She works in a MC3 classroom. These are higher level students on a modified curriculum according to her district. The students she works with have already graduated high school and do a work program.

One of the students in this program (who is an adult and has already graduated) likes to lock himself in the bathroom and masturbate. My wife was not made aware of this when she signed up for this job. She has been a paraprofessional before and has had to endure disgusting behaviors like this. At this job she was told that when he locks himself in the bathroom if he is locked for a long time, she must make him aware that he has to come out. If he doesn't, she has to tell him she is coming in. Well, she comes in and multiple times now, he has an erection. She has told him to put his pants up before she comes in, and nothing. The teacher in the classroom said the only thing is to ignore it, not make a big deal of it, and tell him to wash his hands.

What happens when he does this in a public restroom? What happens when he's at Walmart, does this, and gets caught? There is no punishment, and there is no consequence and I am furious. These kids are supposed to learn life skills and every district she has worked in doesn't have any sort of solution to protect her or the other staff members from disgusting acts like this.

Am I crazy for being furious? Am I crazy for thinking something could be done? She gets upset with me because I get so angry about it. How is this okay?",5.164293088614857,6.351515858044166,5.514718956122742,81.18895253799829,68.65299684542586,8.665844565529106,30.812876398049887,8.97023862654752,2.4971652996845424,1305,52,249,23,22,416,156,317,0.109,0.833,0.057,-0.9616,2,0,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,5,11,13,5,1,20,1,37,3,1,4,1,35,55,20,0,5,5,3,1,3,0,1,2,1,0,2,22,18,0,2,2,0,0,7,6,7,1,1,10,2,31,6,43,40,0,37,0,0,0,0,43,21,0,4,11,182,53,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26685715653958114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08222380068875318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370637974511711,0.0,0.205773147606181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.416617365270218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09653779972971216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12465419632441235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21162051085552508,0.12373419495897525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10187294851685598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.189513423383465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21384284973207265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774938105094974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2399715304582337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540319628345988,0.17721339748447765,0.0,0.0,0.10700265720583746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11440915447492607,0.16141840529862056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896541646829544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11601761167000295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08193259665725093,0.09195845908857443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215492087622995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745884706605304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11501429339371692,0.0,0.0,0.12236864678902044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09308339249428138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21136353523664184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08032806622860139,0.0774750510251369,0.0,0.0,0.14100865209277436,0.0,0.0,0.2310717743743632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087137405112772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35209933930557435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My wife has been very interested in pursuing college after being a SAHM for the last 13 years. Is interested in history or english, however the college choice we are looking at it AMU American Military University. It is regionally accredited, but is online. Are those degrees usually looked down upon in this industry? 

The reason she is interested in this is because books are of no charge and I graduated with a bachelors here before starting a Masters at a not for profit better known college with no problem (transfers good). I transferred part of my GI Bill to her so there would be no loans. The goal is to not use any debt and cash flow a Masters eventually.",8.79462765957447,9.250871539007097,9.192969858156033,60.54562500000003,60.56028368794326,11.872695035460993,43.866134751773046,11.45678717892309,5.628353900709222,641,37,94,17,8,214,95,141,0.131,0.7879999999999999,0.08199999999999999,-0.8212,2,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,1,0,0,4,3,9,0,0,10,0,15,0,0,2,0,15,19,6,0,3,5,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,0,2,1,5,1,5,2,0,0,1,2,7,7,20,15,1,16,0,0,2,0,5,10,0,2,5,72,13,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41109458796029374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430422267008458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822473046106456,0.0,0.17898861997543286,0.0,0.0,0.18603359698496785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17642791646050893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17145974521716606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35327466815017244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22778379575676175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21976639089075825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20127233934620414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2162703183418577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1782251513135325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14888370419617547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18167106927815546,0.2316659701364628,0.3471143120399588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14942348502451153,0.22997990206699315,0.0,0.135455675292198

Secondary ELA teacher candidate here. My field placement for the EdTPA is requiring me to design a unit and conduct the EdTPA learning segment (3-5 consecutive lessons) within that unit. My inquiry is whether or not teacher candidates can refer to data gathered from learning conducted outside of the learning segment but during the unit. 

For example, during the EdTPA week students focus on reading comprehension of a unit, then the next week the unit focuses on composition. Can the teacher candidate refer to data of the composition focused week even though the EdTPA learning segment was conducted on the comprehension aspect of the unit?",9.905714285714282,11.698350449541287,9.536068152031453,54.42816513761469,58.26605504587156,10.999213630406294,47.681520314547825,10.914260884657429,6.40101992136304,545,35,60,13,7,176,60,109,0.0,0.9690000000000001,0.031,0.5267,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,14,0,5,0,0,0,0,13,5,6,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,7,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,14,4,3,12,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,1,5,46,4,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2163045324081756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482900968049168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3275793443769301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32175797036279563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7880799067181558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Katie-MR,2020/01/16,"How do I find motivation/energy to actually enjoy my life?? This is my first post here so I’m hoping this is the right place! I’m sorry if I seem to ramble, I just really would like honest advice!

I’m a middle school ELA student teacher in a credentialing program at a university, and I’m in phase of the program where I teach 2 7th grade class periods 5 days a week, as well as taking 3 grad courses and planning/submitting the edtpa this semester. 

I’ve always been busy. In my undergrad, I was taking 18+ credits (23 credits in my last semester ugh) and tutoring/volunteering, but I still found time/energy to run 3-5 a week and meet with friends and basically have a life. 

How can I find that energy while teaching?? I realize I’m only in charge of two periods, but my Mentor Teacher has me teach her 1st period (which is 6th grade) as a “practice run,” and I’ve been planning the curriculum for all 4 of her 7th grade classes (I’m taking over only two 7th grade classes). I find myself getting home at a mostly reasonable time but with no mental bandwidth to go out and run, even tho I want to. 

I don’t want to lose myself to this job. How can I manage my “teaching life” with the other parts of me that are important?? 

Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far!",5.3729817708333325,5.272957105468752,6.9683437500000025,75.50061458333336,67.7890625,10.264166666666668,31.129166666666666,10.047579312681364,2.974523229166667,993,36,195,22,15,345,140,256,0.032,0.843,0.126,0.9542,1,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,3,11,11,0,0,13,0,14,3,0,5,1,34,32,21,0,6,6,0,0,1,1,1,3,0,1,0,10,11,0,0,7,1,2,4,2,2,1,3,5,0,24,9,28,26,3,30,0,1,0,0,4,14,0,5,12,120,34,23,0.0,0.0,0.13224842123001868,0.0,0.0,0.1324290263903519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276388017293755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08739948625195477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950998660723318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3715897395805172,0.1152736352058452,0.0,0.1485911909576417,0.10470277227704723,0.0,0.07080384766209588,0.0,0.07701940126361036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359380724114469,0.1346023964825962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13448314675387185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046726368696544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28716632903344924,0.06620845201970088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15161273147519058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1282327372906077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13657275030256358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20613883530690053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14675545328502493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14159003806586534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12979114067146502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13555713512583328,0.0,0.08681787774973378,0.1393376051835057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115733733533923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371539419928378,0.0,0.1233727382335224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15170406127378555,0.0,0.0,0.10822681550447596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056835636494041,0.0,0.0,0.1247690330760755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15804614169645206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26476759771949315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15986695865353298,0.0,0.2174126792765115,0.0,0.12184917011966155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626984748123536,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,stevenvrancken,2020/01/16,"I always wondered why I was able to learn a new language in such a short amount of time. Now I realize it was probably because of this relaxing music playing in the background.... Here is [a link to one of those relaxing Spotify playlist.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1PWS2C5XO8LBuqAr4dEjZo?si=JaIQcxwxQDiYsf2P7eZfMw) If it works for me, it can work for you and your students as well. Have you already experimented with calm background music in the classroom? 

Back in the days, I was studying 'communication sciences' at the University of Antwerp &amp; Montréal (1996-2002). During that time, I never listened to relaxing music while studying - simply because I was not aware of all its benefits. And there was no Spotify either, giving access to (almost) all the possible music/playlists you can think of! If I knew then what I know now, I would have completed my studies in 4 years instead of 6, ahah!

IMHO science is only starting to scratch the surface... Researchers around the world are discovering many benefits listening to music has to offer. Listening to relaxing music can give us more mental, emotional, and physical well being. For example, music is believed to trigger the release of dopamine in our brains. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that promotes feelings of happiness and excitement. Why would we study languages in a bad mood anyway? :-) 

The right music can help us to study with less stress and anxiety: listening to music (you like) actually lowers your cortisol levels. And whenever that happens, our memory and concentration improve. It actually is that simple. But it will not work for everyone.

I just wanted to share my experience.

Anyone else here who has experience with learning languages with the help of music? I even heard about a teacher who suggests singing every new word you are studying, because this would help memorization as well! Which is pretty logical, because when you sing, you engage more parts of your brain, helping you to remember more.",7.979728915662651,10.396421466867473,7.360284337349397,65.94616144578315,63.24698795180722,10.131277108433737,38.28,10.355215969177356,4.722825638554216,1605,83,223,40,25,500,187,332,0.031,0.778,0.192,0.9949,1,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,5,11,0,4,17,19,0,1,16,0,26,2,2,1,3,42,41,15,0,6,7,0,2,1,0,4,0,5,0,0,17,13,0,0,12,7,0,0,4,2,3,1,7,7,30,16,44,29,9,28,0,0,0,0,32,14,0,4,15,173,47,9,0.10088877420998804,0.0,0.19690578049661034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10102553401806223,0.0,0.11133327109901826,0.0,0.08394754217390432,0.1093129447056374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717963612592238,0.0,0.0,0.0705437767084649,0.10337247166187588,0.0,0.0898123987091366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775772398751015,0.08423791233842598,0.2460034413706473,0.0,0.0,0.11366710007939736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252504758784944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10577996026991776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506491304539518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08427962508769535,0.11348629172847025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06663608386100618,0.0,0.08500314356906667,0.09640354725107922,0.0,0.2960657406460037,0.0,0.0,0.051012395609055385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19356341061387294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892156098435989,0.10739797616566572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2704944748354668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05544583183642438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049289158990173214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228538192966412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10167215511072897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778116422663863,0.19487801361950152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836484442668679,0.07673045900897696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10925271093014162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373693410488395,0.0,0.1026401535405998,0.10877516235827336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.114287314088773,0.08615846192843286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140959365750063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155677499899546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06464545280360483,0.0,0.0,0.11765811113574895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427135465349742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05950681296705715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27213337280842514,0.0,0.1820728529590408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10940957200375752,0.2203446876131186,0.0,0.0,0.21500547167529624,0.0,0.0,0.06496906282283832
teaching,oppa2335,2020/01/16,"Education Majors/Teachers.. help? So i’m a first year student for childhood education specialization in English and I just completed my counseling for the TEACH grant. I was hesitant at first due to everyone on Reddit saying how they had issues with the loan provider, but I come from a background where financially, this is the best I can do. I understand there are guidelines to follow and that you have to teach low-income.. The question basically is, is it truly worth it? I pay a little over $9k a year for my private university and I have been paying out of pocket, with about $2,800 worth of federal loans out. I just found out about the TEACH grant, but I don’t know if I messed up by doing this during the spring semester instead of the fall. Will it be disbursed during this year or next year? If it did go through for this spring semester, do I still have to pay my federal loan that I had taken out for the spring, during the beginning (fall) semester?",6.490375494071145,6.844555152173914,6.902114624505932,75.37094861660081,65.41304347826087,10.386561264822133,32.48814229249012,10.230975488527342,3.230169565217391,764,29,142,17,11,249,106,184,0.043,0.8340000000000001,0.122,0.9465,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,1,1,3,10,3,0,0,13,0,19,0,0,1,0,22,28,10,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,10,10,0,0,4,0,8,5,1,1,0,2,7,1,17,2,28,19,1,30,0,0,0,0,5,11,0,4,14,106,27,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22126453875453514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18162078432374892,0.22106269426824615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20146753541937512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3586823594151107,0.0,0.2311761872774081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119825754243977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14132222502074376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2200631433490652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11587265622361728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21131799275479735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22423171143796414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23619008474881475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16766916292635364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16837783187721014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21949283448146487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5430985617711181

teaching,wanderingwhiskeywave,2020/01/16,"Time Off-Last week of School I am in my student teaching year for the entire year at an Elementary school. I love this job and love this school, hoping to get hired before the end of the school year and can very well see that in the cards for myself. However, the last 3 days of school happen to be at a time when I go to my yearly festival Bonnaroo. This is like my Mecca every year it feels very deep, spiritual, and personal to me almost like a family gathering. I would be devastated if I couldn't go. That being said.... I was wondering how poorly it would reflect on myself to take off the last 3 days of school? How can I make this not look like im skipping out on my students final days in 4th/5th grade?",5.7558333333333325,5.258216250000004,6.589722222222222,79.87750000000003,67.05555555555556,9.977777777777778,28.416666666666664,9.516144504307137,2.195225,556,15,116,10,8,185,84,144,0.027000000000000003,0.809,0.165,0.9620000000000001,2,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,0,9,0,11,2,0,3,0,17,25,7,0,5,2,0,1,3,0,2,0,1,0,1,8,4,0,0,3,0,1,2,2,0,1,0,2,4,14,8,20,17,0,28,1,0,2,2,5,10,0,4,19,71,22,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10787331627886576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0916679863418275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20842556325457093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541440070704124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09076488513571572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10155569825126426,0.0,0.05447015290901012,0.0,0.0,0.11800997671819599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0562830609286833,0.0,0.1224477990150563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526288369779637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069975027138588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11636395554042915,0.0,0.10690270928145168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634363500578589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15789033203968916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0904637888692268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1944561640828528,0.0,0.07190880027044431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09406331135706833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10247331878412196,0.0,0.0,0.6541545914819974,0.0858446998603285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099751263935369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12563329418334346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17777258699183873,0.0,0.0,0.08641233123930175,0.0,0.09685976811152586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682564689622466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15305274699872234,0.0,0.0,0.3468642027161425
teaching,notagirl__,2020/01/16,"CA - District Intern Credential Professional Development Plan Hi everyone, 

I hope you’re having a great 2020 so far! 

I have some questions around the District Intern Credential option in California. It looks like this is one of the requirements as part of a Professional Development Plan: 

Prior to beginning daily teaching responsibilities, individuals must complete one of the following:
- 120 clock-hours of training in child development and the methods of teaching the subjects and grade
levels to which the district intern is assigned
- Six semester units of course work in the same areas

Is anyone able to give me some insight on what the 120 hours/six semester units is? Is that something that happens after being offered an intern position through whatever program you’re going through, just before your position starts? 

I am not currently in a teacher prep program, but am planning on working towards a Multiple Subject Credential once I’m done with my BA this year. I’m just trying to navigate all of this on my own and I’m feeling kind of lost. Any insight you guys might be able to provide is highly, highly appreciated. 

Thanks!",9.779499072356217,10.377979918367348,9.420315398886828,59.259749536178106,58.48979591836735,12.025231910946195,43.838589981447114,11.567385478589935,5.6962408163265295,928,51,129,24,11,300,122,196,0.015,0.889,0.096,0.9429,1,0,2,0,0,0,20.0,0,2,0,7,4,6,0,0,13,0,15,0,0,0,2,22,29,6,0,2,4,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,2,8,5,0,1,4,0,0,2,1,1,0,3,2,2,8,5,27,23,6,22,0,1,1,0,8,14,0,6,7,88,16,11,0.33754832568189763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11477221824449495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801081885313752,0.0,0.0,0.15024478712886766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14361438177318225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17695649867591268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1727145657240445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16127094525238042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533728782857256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16190355586539104,0.09591824614462018,0.0,0.0,0.1860741103572819,0.0,0.1671129558486219,0.1492464348150187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3566383387720067,0.0,0.1676308252940606,0.16620855343217095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17575231893093524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824545308518314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14172778992730606,0.0,0.18423693577935807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17904271561445215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797389752328092,0.2287314813013851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18276597143464315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1890656881635632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12993059611452568,0.0,0.0,0.11945922113467243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15538457362004518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11458657794199285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457392012775775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10868502739128336

teaching,ThisPreciousMoment,2020/01/16,"Having trouble deciding what direction to go... Hey all! I’m looking for some insight from those who have come before me.

I (think I) am an aspiring youth educator who can’t figure out what direction I want to commit to so I can actually start building a tangible career. I’m in my late-twenties, and I have a BA in Math from a Liberal Arts College, currently no accreditation, a broad range of interests (Sports/physical education/basketball, English/Japanese/language learning in general, math, religion/spirituality, dance, and music, to name a few), and a mix of work experience (assistant sport coach, teaching aide, mental health counselor, personal trainer).

I give these details to illustrate that other than helping young people grow somehow, I’m really not sure what I want to do in my career. I can’t seem to confidently narrow down my interests to determine what subject I want to teach or coach, what age group I wish to work with, what kind of school system I wish to be a part of, or where in the world I’d like to be at this time in my life.

Does anyone have any insight on how to determine this for oneself? I feel like I’m running into barriers where I need to start pursuing accreditation and/or an advanced degree, but, well, I can’t seem to make a decision on that either.

teaching,Gimbleturren,2020/01/17,"How to Teach Executive Functioning Skills using PBL? Hey all you wonderfully brilliant educators out there. I teach HS social studies and about two years ago I transitioned my class to a blended model, using the free version of Canvas to develop a self-paced (ish) inquiry-based approach to the curriculum. It also incorporates some elements of PBL for summarize assessments, and I allow students to resubmit work for a better grade than they got originally if they want to (mastery-based grading...ish). This was a HUGE change for me and it has had its successes and failures. One area where it has struggled is that the kids I get have never been taught executive functioning skills by previous teachers or their parents. I am trying to figure out how I can build teaching these skills into my curriculum or creating an introductory unit that accomplishes the same goal but I’m not sure how to go about doing that. I’ve done some preliminary research but what I have found is mostly theoretical and not very practical, especially to HS students. How do you wonderful people approach teaching these skills to your students? What are your goals/“picture of success” when you do? What successes and failures have you had in this area? How have parents reacted? How have you involved them in the process of teaching these? I recognize the last question is the unlikely dream.

I have yet to be accepted into my university’s teaching program but I’m required to complete 10 hours in the field for one of my classes. 

Look, I’m by no means an imposing person. I’m a 5’4” 20 year old woman that still looks like a high school junior. I’m worried students (this will be secondary level by the way) won’t take me seriously because of my appearance alone. And I also have cerebral palsy, which concerns me when as a teacher you’re on your feet for lecture a good chunk of the day.

I’m also horrible with public speaking and get really anxious and nervous. In my head it goes so well and then in front of a crowd I’m shaking and stumbling over my words.

I have been placed at a school already and assigned a mentor teacher, however I was warned it’s possible the principal may not have told the teacher they have been assigned someone to mentor. I did reach out to my mentor teacher in an email as my instructor recommended. 

What if I’m not cut out for teaching? What if I come off as boring and can’t keep students engaged?

Were you succcessful?

What was the process?

I work in a very low income, rural area which is overlooked by their own district on a regular basis. I want to take 100 high achieving students on a day trip to a large city (3 and a half hours away) and will need 10k to do so. This accounts for charter bus, a meal, and cost of fun. 

How do I make this happen for underserved, underappreciated, but high achieving students?",5.640892857142859,7.27615070833334,6.106488095238094,75.70875000000002,67.95833333333334,8.81904761904762,31.42261904761905,9.23628265651192,2.806674404761905,412,17,74,8,7,133,72,96,0.031,0.9209999999999999,0.048,0.364,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,3,1,3,3,2,0,0,8,0,7,1,0,2,1,10,12,7,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,4,1,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,7,1,13,9,1,12,0,1,0,0,5,8,0,0,3,49,11,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2659791141209647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825742572941774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2560776016550299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503418961749454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5982154152461019,0.0,0.0,0.27879369097342943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889695620434475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20991296753510666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2865094540959156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128538430971197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23358481702402956,0.16697804811979053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20609811446616436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am realizing I really want to pursue a career as a middle/high school teacher. Unfortunately, I am graduating in May with a bachelor's in history and don't have time to get certified as part of undergrad. If possible, I want to start working full-time rather than going back into a full time college schedule for a MEd, so I'm wondering what are the best pathways to alternative certification. I want something relatively cheap that will still give me the skills I need to get hired and do a good job.

teaching,nothinggoeswrong,2020/01/18,"Tell me about... I often (or maybe even always) teach my students the way I've been taught. One of the English-learning dogmas is that you have to lie when you know you can't say the truth. Can't say I was ever an expert in lying, I guess my imagination is not that strong, but I must admit your creativity gets significantly boosted after this sort of exercise.

One of the episodes I remember was when I was asked to tell about the happiest moment of my childhood. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing to complain about when it comes to my growing up, there are some life circumstances no one can influence. But still, I don't remember a single moment I could call my happiest one. I remember grandpa bringing candies home for each of us and then leaving his one for me. I remember my mom sewing a Christmas costume using sketches from my grandma's old magazine that had a yellowish page with drawn kids in various animal attires. As far as I'm not mistaken, I never had a chance to show it anywhere but at home, there must be a picture of it in one of my albums. 

I also remember long waiting hours at child hospitals I was brought to millions of times, my mom crying because it seemed to her my illnesses would never stop, plastic fish in an aquarium that stood in the doctor's office, my math struggles, imagining dolls' adventures with my only friend who was fond of babysitting much more than me, a bully at school who tied my bag to a chair and a short muslim boy defending me from him, another bully showing off in front of his girlfriend, being grabbed by arms and held for a while in the school halls or spitted at with paper pieces because it was fun, being called a ""muzhik"" and whatever came to their minds, writing fairytales together with different girls I was friends with, retelling everything I read to anyone who was eager to listen, being afraid to show my affection for smb, feeling ashamed for pitying whoever, being scared of literally anything and crying often enough to be considered a sissy, staying inside too much, going to the children's library once a week, reading books I didn't understand and rereading those that were being hidden from me because I didn't want any other literature. 

Finally, I remember having to adapt to the ""real"" world I live in now and becoming more sociable. Funny, but the peak of my extraversion was when I looked the worst. My more or less manageable acne decided to break out at its worst when I was doing my last school year, so I had to take exams not with a standard ""pizzaface"", but with a swollen something of a beaten drunkard. It was the time I learned people could like me despite my face. It was also the time I met most of my good acquaintances. Some of them are gone, some are still with me. So, I don't really remember any best moments or something. I just know I can perceive them differently. It also makes me avoid some overpersonal questions when I work with people concerning their families. Though sometimes they tend to overshare. Or it's visible that you've touched upon a weak point when they start talking on any usual subject. I guess it's a part of a human psyche to end up speaking about something disturbing.

teaching,cds75,2020/01/18,"I need advice on how to help my one student of color who has expressed how hard it is to be the only black girl in her class. This is the first time she has ever said anything about her race. She seems to have lost her bright eyes, her smile, her enthusiasm &amp; her spunk. She’s 6 y/o. This breaks my heart. I love teaching kids about MLK and Rosa Parks, and others who were brave enough to fight for civil rights, and their impact on society. There are so many fascinating stories, from Ruby Bridges to a group of 12 year-olds who won again Woolworth’s. It’s hard, but it’s important. I wasn’t them to see how people have the power to change injustices. I want them to know that THEY have the power and the potential to do so. 
The hardest part to me is that my district is primarily white. We have some blacks, Vietnamese, Indians and Brazilians, but I’m guessing the percentage is under 10%. 
I’d love some advice on how to talk about race, and these turning points in our nations history with little ones. I taught 4-6 for a couple of decades, and it seemed a little easier to talk about. Just a little. 
I haven’t talked about slavery at all yet. Not with these little ones. I love teaching and learning about the heroism of Harriet Tubman, Henry “Box” Brown and the bravery of all who were a part of the Underground Railroad. There are some beautiful and compelling picture books I love to use. I’m wondering if I should even do any of that this year. 
I’m worried about this little one. She’s an amazing kid who has a very difficult and complicated life. She’s clearly been struggling with this. Her behavior and effort have tanked. I want her to get her spark and her smile back. 
So... any advice? I’m most interested in hearing from people of color. I’ve only ever worked with white teachers, the bubble of my current life is white, so beyond my sister-in-law, I have no one of color who I can talk to about this. -That even feels lame &amp; shameful to admit.",3.4168458549222787,5.235302948186534,4.093649611398963,87.19778011658032,73.92227979274611,6.793911917098446,24.756800518134717,7.531066641456977,1.148482124352332,1542,49,306,19,32,490,197,386,0.079,0.732,0.18899999999999997,0.9932,3,0,0,0,1,0,58.0,2,0,4,7,27,15,1,2,18,0,27,8,2,6,5,50,54,24,0,5,5,0,3,0,0,1,2,2,0,3,23,18,0,0,7,1,0,0,4,6,0,6,8,17,39,9,51,44,9,27,0,2,12,4,45,17,0,9,9,209,62,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2622048233013016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19382056303130707,0.0,0.12164714358582153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360307812394908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06877531454072848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946176903826988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09896578180112962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09241741132295787,0.0,0.11815108747569532,0.1618106721755876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04522452151091395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607925033331768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04672971092850151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09853035719131152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16024478189869534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10080754278709177,0.1059891042756277,0.0599510327329561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04915493939539227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12635094454352058,0.0,0.4482214987361641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09763641987305732,0.0,0.3228992945984592,0.0,0.0,0.09068006707195304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663200493828913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09385424789897448,0.0,0.3030407943453015,0.13604921911872694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937137637468168,0.0,0.12401552924249296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08455152333064601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763829098458963,0.08507974665297273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07127362909952828,0.16284912711591282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09350411332141184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875601049244044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05215430205210387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09728712362462984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07724910035163357,0.0,0.07379895002216304,0.10551032198914773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969959454659582,0.0651147820433287,0.09083261002825978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151953263160926

Someone was foolish enough to give me a student teacher. Just kidding, I’m excited to share my love of my job.


Anyone have any tips, podcast, or books for a new coach or mentor? I don’t want to scare this child away from a good job. By child, I think she’s like 21.

teaching,teacherdrinker,2020/01/18,"I thought today was going to be the worst day of the year. It was the BEST! My school is insane over UIL. During my interview last summer, my principal literally told me that they don’t care about test scores. UIL is what matters to admin, the kids, and the community. We have less than 200 students in the entire district. Every single one of my 4th, 5th, and 6th graders competed in at least one event today (many of them competed in 3 or 4). I am new to this school this year and my last school did not put much emphasis on UIL. 

I have been DREADING this day! We had to leave school by 7am this morning. 3 to a seat because we only have two busses. We knew we wouldn’t get back to the school until after 5pm. 

Even though my last school didn’t care much, it was always still a crazy-busy day. Making sure everyone was where they needed to be at all times, directing, judging, grading events, etc. It was always a nightmare. I figured since this school cares so much, I’d find this day would be so much worse than usual. 

It was hands-down my favorite day teaching in the last 3 years! My students (the ones I specifically coached in events *toot toot* especially) did SO GREAT!!! They gave their best and were so so proud of themselves! I enjoyed the events I got to direct and judge, and I even enjoyed the grading room. We competed with 7 other schools.

teaching,bubblyqueer,2020/01/19,"Starting to build my classroom library. Need advice Hi everyone. I’m graduating with my bachelors in early childhood education this June. After that, I’ll be getting my MAT, hopefully graduating a year after (although health issues might push that back. I am not rushing it). I want to teach kindergarten or first grade. I’m starting to build my classroom library and wanted to know what tips everyone has. I already made deals with two, possibly three people through Facebook marketplace. I live in a small apartment and my bookshelf is already filled with my personal books so I’m not sure where to store them. So I’d like some tips

-Where can I get cheap books to build my library and read aloud collection?
-Where do I store these until I have my own classroom

I suppose I can try storing them on the shelf in my closet but it is pretty full already.

So I'm currently an active duty soldier and have no idea about college seeing as I enlisted a year after high school. I was wondering if anyone on here have gone through the transition from active duty to schooling to become a teacher. If so what were the challenges faced? What's a good degree plan/school? How hard is it to find employment? Should I start knocking out my prerequisites now while I'm still active duty?

Any information from those more experienced than myself would be greatly appreciated.

teaching,saxonktm,2020/01/19,"Taking over at the semester I could use some teaching advise.  We have had a shakeup in our school and one of my team members is being moved to another position teaching something else. I will be going on a 'super' contract and taking over her LA/SS block. I already teach two of the same blocks so content wise there's no issue.  What I'm worried about is her and I are two very different teachers.  I have high expectations for behavior for my students and I start teaching them that on the first day of school.  My students enjoy my class but there are clear parameters for what to do when they enter a classroom, turn in homework, participate in discussions, etc... She's a great teacher but runs a looser classroom and this particular group of students is quite animated and unruly.  When I'm in her room there seems to be a lack of management happening. In addition, it's not like she's leaving the building, she will just be teaching something new directly across the hall.

teaching,anya1973,2020/01/19,"Taking kids on international trip I am new to a school and state where I teach foreign language. My colleague has not been very helpful to me since the beginning and withholds information and resources, etc. He is very non-communicative in every aspect. So, every other year, a student exchange is planned to a European country. Usually enough students sign up that two chaperones can go free. So, my colleague went about planning this trip on a very haphazard manner. He didn't return emails to the company, or even the parent that was helping. He missed meetings and at one point the parent volunteer quit. He never really asked for my help although I offered. He only sometimes includes me on emails. In the end, we only have enough students for one chaperone to go. Suddenly, he wantse to be the one. 

The issue is, I am terrified of going alone because I have panic disorder. I don't think I can do it alone and I have said so. I don't know his reasons for suddenly not wanting to go, but he keeps insisting that I go and is making me very uncomfortable.

teaching,contrafbulationist,2020/01/20,"commonlit.org - who's done a UNIT? (High school English) Last year I discovered [commonlit.org](https://commonlit.org) and ran a few experimental lessons past  my year 11 &amp; 12 (grade 10 &amp; 11) English lit classes. I just did the basic: chose some paired texts that connected with my oversarching theme, had students read, annotate, answer questions and discuss in pairs. Later, I advanced a level and used [Socratic Smackdown](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12lGSsowE3b2nTI4BxPMf0GjDUTqhaNqJ/view?usp=sharing) (from the tragically defunct Institute of Play) to facilitate the discussions and saw some pretty good results as my use of that tool improved.

&amp;#x200B;

But I haven't used a who unit yet. I thinking to start my year (we start in February) with the Grade 12 unit on [Morality](https://www.commonlit.org/en/units/morality) or the one on [Values and Beliefs](https://www.commonlit.org/en/units/values-beliefs).

**I'm wondering if anyone here has worked through a full unit, and if so what your experience was**. What kind of class(es) did you try it with? How long did you allow for the unit?

teaching,Edgather1,2020/01/20,"Large Educational Survey: Edgather I apologize if this is not an appropriate place for this but I am seeking the educational communities input. I have taught in special education, elementary education, and currently working as an AP. I am researching the climate of schools related to school wide behavior systems, building relationships, job satisfaction, and academic achievement. I set a lofty goal of having one million educators from across the globe submit their feedback in one of the largest surveys ever conducted. I want to be very forward and say that my goal from this is to have the largest impact on education as possible. This includes summarizing the results online for educators to use for free. My personal goal is to use the results to write a future book and to be able to speak about the data and trends in schools. I need educators input and also need help spreading the word. If this post gets removed I totally understand but I hope to hear from educators.

&amp;#x200B;

Submission statement: The link is to a website called [edgather.com](https://edgather.com). At edgather you can take a survey that does not gather personal information including name, location, email, or anything else. The goal is to gain input on what is currently happening in schools and share the information with the educational community online. I believe most educators would find the information beneficial in helping make future decisions for their schools.

teaching,kantigone,2020/01/20,"Tips on how to handle an extremely distracted student I teach maths and English to young kids (4-8 years old) after school. One child in particular (about 8yo) has the poorest concentration I’ve ever seen in a student - he doesn’t respond to the usual tactics I use (for instance, giving him little challenges, ‘pencil feeding’ questions etc.). It can take 30 minutes for him to write a single word even when he knows how to spell it perfectly well, simply because he will put his pencil down, scribble, draw on the table, chatter to himself, put the pencil in his mouth, screw up the page, lie down, pick his nose and whatever else in between every single letter. If I leave him alone to work, he talks to himself and draws, but if I actively try to keep him in check, he still won’t do anything. I have to physically take the pencil and put it back into his hand every few seconds. He is obviously a big distraction to other students and takes my attention away from the 1-3 other kids at my table, impeding their learning. As such, my boss has warned him that if he doesn’t behave next week, she will have to speak to his mum about kicking him out of the class. I can tell that he’s a sweet boy and capable of the work he’s set so I really want to keep him in the class if possible. 

So I’d really appreciate any advice that you more experienced teachers may have (I’m not a qualified teacher, just a uni student doing this as a part time job).",10.290279473177002,6.5893412402826845,10.121374879537424,68.32040475425636,60.62544169611307,12.976421458400257,40.56826212656601,10.637119530657019,4.166317314487632,1133,42,215,19,11,376,174,283,0.049,0.857,0.094,0.9279999999999999,1,1,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,1,1,4,14,7,1,2,18,0,16,5,3,5,3,33,27,18,0,5,7,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,4,9,8,1,2,4,0,1,3,4,3,1,2,1,6,27,4,40,22,7,33,0,0,1,1,39,17,1,6,12,142,36,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13693822038062692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14513751296185842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529654992971084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11531909755810894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13166136877771376,0.1077551022221618,0.0,0.08542494555934023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11706474258675993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15628747698676929,0.09255779194629243,0.12676005655046238,0.2361394254097363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13443018294249975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390622833198114,0.2491167085339385,0.0,0.0,0.0770144862970853,0.0,0.0,0.14838264467985673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14045200298105207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490350754934301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470480236095332,0.0,0.09495904741468074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517524605577533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15798106481538465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4226228954891053,0.15698317996862746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17954803414816195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14182401884708926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11191192683815666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31609205584862016,0.11263513917771667,0.12248409536093087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08171379784271113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951424108825882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12103157594475095,0.15433881448374984,0.0,0.08265520563123692,0.0,0.11240777871670037,0.0,0.1259981211510165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20403977915935395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09024229293313507

teaching,Ron2002,2020/01/20,"Teaching in a foreign country Hi, I don't really know if this is the correct place to ask this particoular question, so feel free to delete my post if I'm breaking some rules!

So, I'm currently studying Geology in Italy (level 7 EQF for those of you who are in the EU) and I'm hoping to get my degree in about a year. Since I'm approaching the end of my university career, I'm looking around for my options... and I must say that I'm really starting to like the idea of becoming a Science teacher. I wouldn't mind teaching here in my country, but today I found myself thinking about what it would take to teach abroad. 

I tried to search for some answers, but I found only information regarding teaching Italian, which is a really interesting possibility... but what if I wanted to teach Natural Sciences? 

So here is my question: where should I look for informations? Does anyone want to share their experiences?",6.1448502364687325,6.924930358381503,7.049994745139254,72.52962165002629,66.22543352601156,9.99033105622701,34.80241723594325,10.018931242160765,3.5988196531791896,724,33,128,16,11,242,104,173,0.0,0.887,0.113,0.9468,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,1,0,9,5,0,0,8,0,9,0,0,0,2,32,29,11,0,10,6,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,9,3,0,0,11,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,2,4,17,6,23,23,2,17,0,0,2,0,11,9,0,9,6,82,26,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511224561373072,0.0,0.0,0.14655448548055802,0.15390565239309642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18181951352443512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1440677232878953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14581220278392915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16103850141120649,0.0,0.0,0.0832412395066701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3610138408701217,0.0,0.0,0.08601172393914938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635134890276144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185845813296366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047565228877556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08042928859931903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764933643025821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662281010604554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520757826729434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720019980379463,0.0,0.0,0.18559417293663366,0.15766882916389374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3688437406759759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3163961668988716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13091938494271674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13618259826326806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165250723426684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12378032718798745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10548745173784346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15604879977818653,0.0,0.0,0.11177211066140226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942045971897124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694753630815498,0.0,0.0,0.10601551357058343

teaching,tarheel_gal77,2020/01/20,"It is from my heart. A teacher is what I have dreamed of becoming. A teacher is what I became. I love what I do. I love my students and see nothing but the next grade for them. My students don't say, ""I cant"" but rather say "" I will try"". 
I have done this profession for 3 years now and I still love it. However, now I work at a private school and the students there get scholarships or other ways of financial support to attend. My pay at this point is $350 per month. That's right, $350! Plus I have a family of three at home.
Yes, I would love a raise &amp; yes, I have signed up for support to help me supply my classroom. 
As I said before, I would not trade my job for anything. I have the heart to teach for tomorrow. If you have a heart that loves to see people improve instead of money, then you need to be a teacher. #teaching #heartofgold #ourfuture",1.3286864973262027,3.290550244318183,2.7953743315508035,93.46085561497328,80.64772727272728,5.732085561497327,23.98930481283423,6.794906146795322,0.7002163101604273,657,24,145,7,17,214,100,176,0.009000000000000001,0.75,0.24100000000000002,0.9928,2,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,2,1,1,6,7,0,0,10,2,18,8,3,0,0,14,30,10,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,1,0,10,4,0,0,0,1,4,1,3,0,0,1,2,5,26,7,21,24,0,16,0,0,2,5,12,6,0,2,8,101,36,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13583008543135108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10316255647210716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13845289854739914,0.106674151279703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12828923875711284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818049409500378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06549666896360677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44566506866122796,0.0840277602175763,0.0,0.12574868770937908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244028175722698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5657222082770864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100063055009324,0.0,0.0,0.09295461567753756,0.0,0.0,0.133324312429417,0.0,0.0,0.12028858383487134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691048910584953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11850796899705067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107058786824259,0.11924833026601345,0.1993863911524089,0.0,0.1268734204760972,0.1997951709185285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10011455792503154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28451948449220704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511282643901727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995068214294936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0912653050787033,0.0,0.0,0.17810767464918134,0.0,0.0,0.08072926200446455
teaching,Bill_MF_Bradley,2020/01/20,"Questions from Prospective NYC Teacher Posting on behalf of my significant other. She has her certification in FL and a BS in elementary education. She has several years of experience in the classroom and says she has her student teaching done. We understand that most schools prefer a masters degree. She told me not to ask about reciprocity because she has that process under control (feel free to chime in though lol). Please see below for a few of her specific questions, or otherwise, any general advice would be very much appreciated. I will be starting a new role in Manhattan during the Summer, so she is starting a job search process now. She is kind enough to move with me, so I'm really trying to be helpful to the extent that I can.

1. What helped you get a job when you were first starting?
2. Are there any job fairs for teachers? If not, how should I be thinking about the job application process?
3. Is there still a hiring freeze?
4. Did you have a network to leverage when you were job searching? Is networking helpful? ""My resume is updated but I'm not sure where I should start/who I should be sending it to""

teaching,softbal20,2020/01/21,Advice needed for a sub feeling stuck I’ve basically been a building sub for a while now. I am in the same school 90% of the time this school year and last. There are 3 other schools I am able to sub in- in the district. I’ve been brought in to do a demo lesson for a maternity leave once. Debriefing was fine- only criticism was that they (principal and elementary ed. supervisor) wished I met with more math groups. Demo lesson was 40 minutes and principal was 10 minutes late- I was asked to stall. 🙄 it’s getting to the point where other teachers are baffled as to why I haven’t been hired or given at least a maternity leave position yet. I’m considering leaving this school to sub at other schools. I’ve sent an email to the principal (that was drafted by myself and other teachers) to ask for a brief meeting. I sent this last night- I plan on giving her a few days to respond. Does anyone have any advice? I plan to tell her in a roundabout way that if I’m not on her radar I need to stop wasting my time. It’s just hard because I love the kids and they love me. I love the staff and they love me (so much so that some of the teachers are willing to drop a few hints after I meet with the principal). Does anyone have ANY advice- meeting wise and how to proceed with the future? I’m afraid she won’t even respond...,2.6736988968202446,4.4773213731343295,3.9685269305645687,87.36401362751461,75.94029850746269,6.601168072680077,25.83127839065543,7.423996415210882,1.239773329007138,1040,38,214,13,23,341,141,268,0.067,0.833,0.1,0.9254,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,3,4,9,7,0,1,21,0,20,4,0,1,0,24,41,14,0,4,4,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,13,10,0,1,3,0,0,4,3,1,0,0,15,2,23,6,34,24,7,32,0,0,0,4,26,11,0,3,15,138,36,8,0.10640410084443144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119305676111801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14471687465260932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14880044265799872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989469415835038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06486295226760748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06862184245302283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18622989138708812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702789050867717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05380111047245326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05559175102390836,0.10207250917670296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0953171744612634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17346708750874215,0.12002846038892814,0.33799973776484005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3841354212222344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821925713341471,0.15779458506935928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985304063103002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11331689474513808,0.0,0.08092511344460772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10058626814279288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5384331534919659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08895859276618917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09300187408862194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12409017376300065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08445862254708919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960131509129246,0.0,0.1223594647685944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06852075234833316
teaching,___girlbutt,2020/01/21,"Sometimes I love it, and sometimes I hate it. Anyone else get that feeling about teaching? I feel like there are days where it feels so rewarding and wonderful, and I love the kids and the freshness they bring to the world, and I feel like I am making a real impact on the world. Other days, I hate children and don't want to be anywhere near them, and I hate what I do, and it all feels hopeless, like I am throwing myself repeatedly against a brick wall. It makes me feel like I am going crazy. I do struggle with mood regulation and frustration tolerance, and working with middle schoolers definitely tests that often, but I don't know if my level of flip-flopping is normal or not. I want to be a consistent adult to model that for my students, but some days, I just can't because I hate everything about what I do because it feels useless.",9.411480836236931,6.8142557926829275,8.944703832752612,72.66231707317075,61.19512195121951,11.566550522648086,39.89198606271777,9.606745405546679,3.727135191637631,666,27,126,9,7,214,93,164,0.155,0.7120000000000001,0.133,-0.6787,0,0,0,0,0,1,19.0,0,0,2,2,7,16,5,1,7,0,13,2,0,2,1,36,35,15,0,4,6,0,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,12,12,0,0,9,0,0,3,4,8,0,0,0,7,23,7,13,33,2,15,0,2,0,2,7,8,0,5,8,90,35,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944804031781156,0.13107414210577384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.155963621234654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475028657486543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10686481011598033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497062041567535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4527785897546913,0.2741686482955269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06683546228895572,0.0,0.07270264905995652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5051972810262495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07030416052227001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24999051008024645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309143711619122,0.0,0.17078168206981933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12533920711173888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456065031893869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25304192590351743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373484482532544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1509068001124781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387290596616481,0.09313082561904096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, upon searching, it seems the process to obtain a teaching certification is quite different in the states. 

1. what is the best way to go about applying for a certification as an international teacher, and if school boards offer work visas?
2. what sites should I use to apply for teaching positions within US?

teaching,Buttonmoon22,2020/01/22,"Creating a book Hi all,

I teach HS history and my students will be writing a series of diary entries as an immigrant who came through Ellis island based on research.

I wanted to have them actually bind their diary entries into a little book, or maybe take the entire class' work and make one book.

Does anyone have any ideas or resources for this sort of project? Websites, materials I'd need etc.

Students will type their diary entries on a laptop, but we don't have access to fancy formatting like in Microsoft word.

Thanks!",5.0748711340206185,7.2787736391752595,5.68307989690722,75.91369201030929,70.34020618556701,7.73659793814433,30.68170103092784,8.472884824447931,2.6968360824742272,421,18,67,7,8,136,76,97,0.0,0.905,0.095,0.8398,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,3,1,0,2,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,1,1,16,13,6,0,2,3,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,3,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,7,2,11,9,2,6,0,0,0,0,7,5,0,3,1,41,9,12,0.0,0.0,0.27608371434489265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19239154291209887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19782037732432128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3235787873679099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475803614908185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155244220016533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3193760030865666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13821772074565614,0.28355462583430496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18884760732095426,0.0,0.2842256140066994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2097774966294928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19171016851133368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21271647424741805,0.0,0.0,0.2604696356030656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16687028599502976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20596510554089453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,mircatt,2020/01/22,"Teaching high school in Washington DC? I’m thinking about making a (pretty big) career change to become a high school teacher in DC. I’m only 22 but have been in my current industry for 3 years simply because it’s what I did to make money while I was in school, and when the position I have now opened up I thought, “Hey, maybe I’ll be good at this!” and ended up being right. But quite frankly, it’s pretty boring even though it’s fast-paced, and I’m really not feeling intellectually stimulated by this position. I was a psychology major in school, and had always considered teaching but have never tried. The closest I’ve come was tutoring one-on-one, and being a certified trainee at my job. I loved training the new employees, and when I was in school o focused on adolescents as my age group, so I think teaching could be a good fit. 

Does anyone here teach in DC, or the DMV area? My dad was a public school teacher in another city for years so I know the basics, but how is it in DC? Do people enjoy it? Are the teachers good? Is the curriculum comprehensive? How are new teachers treated?

Really looking to get a feel of what it’s like to teach high school, especially in DC to see if it’s the right fit for me.",4.313556149732623,5.37288875619835,5.613830821584834,80.16882109868745,70.5289256198347,8.669324258629072,28.69810403500243,9.007467420416297,2.2798932425862906,957,35,188,18,17,321,133,242,0.04,0.7879999999999999,0.172,0.9890000000000001,3,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,0,1,11,8,0,0,15,0,21,1,0,5,1,28,37,21,0,2,7,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,8,0,0,6,0,1,1,2,1,0,0,9,4,14,7,27,23,1,39,0,0,2,1,5,26,0,2,13,113,25,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08150065399641154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027071084053576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0684875791265744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970824409469176,0.1081759655792405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10361608751854197,0.08437360315912637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820357655007444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08571503010526121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08675293164981293,0.0,0.0,0.06469378702215245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09905099056858599,0.06997413219805257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05117383226857067,0.0,0.0,0.2464626222242049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3104625916961231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719836170169648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05382970649316242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047852487262944166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225172337089348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08840197174932114,0.0,0.13076221594758788,0.0,0.09840201748866928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07554360221896603,0.18919774359335814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637215797927114,0.07449393310076492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06790487000725882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1992968328369088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417984611239474,0.0,0.0,0.12549610397109984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16729426050248394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6939008455031317,0.07805194314795083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255223570565892,0.09623349716986318,0.0777598393640663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06650032090203546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261507120393399
teaching,theXwinterXstorm,2020/01/22,"Advice on 3-4 year old kiddos Hey all! I just got my first job teaching 3-4 year olds while I'm finishing my degree (chemistry for secondary education). I have nephews and cousins in that age range, but dealing with family is a lot different than dealing with other peoples kiddos. I'm just looking for advice on how to handle issues like fighting, biting etc. Honestly, just anything because I'm excited and also very nervous. 

I'm also looking for specific advice on how to properly interact with autistic children that age. I will have a few autistic children in my class and I really want to make sure I do things right by them. I start next week so I haven't met them yet and don't know where on the spectrum they fall but like I said, I really need advice because I want to make sure I do things properly.",3.874454722492697,5.767988753164557,5.206962025316456,79.3785929892892,72.86075949367087,7.899513145082762,30.508276533592987,8.617729084823388,2.6479458617332043,645,29,114,12,13,215,92,158,0.04,0.809,0.15,0.9454,2,0,0,0,2,0,16.0,0,0,3,1,10,8,1,1,3,0,8,0,0,4,3,24,24,12,0,3,5,2,0,2,0,1,0,2,0,2,5,7,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,3,4,17,6,18,20,4,22,0,0,2,0,14,8,0,1,15,73,22,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5153311797303595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21086524722250385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10849331622844008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16073722095677415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27184307745237685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13774503094863955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14703676166670018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12428728170718865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11214327410241233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10544471508254116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13760699826261374,0.1308311337769771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07245596950487927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12882100177517847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2214252593423384,0.0,0.0,0.11208589068838773,0.0,0.0,0.17600882019099134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775789645463992,0.0,0.0,0.14021363258145933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2766883901115714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09140144932991046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16892051758569734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125908780391456,0.1254102966008031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09331722816726976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2485158056843832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17517764642717326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878203773757864,0.15552562502421272,0.0,0.10575431945868476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16980163445071447
teaching,loofahloafs,2020/01/22,"Where the HELL did this sense of entitlement come from?! This is my second year teaching. 5th and 6th grade English. I have noticed it since the beginning but it is just so overwhelming and apparent that I have to post about it.

Where the hell do these kids think they are when they are in school? Every day when I assign class work, or homework, they always assume that its a discussion, or if enough of them say they don’t want to do something, that I will just decide to not do it. 

I just gave a test over a story that we read. I told them yesterday and today that they needed to review the vocabulary in the story because that’s going to be on the test. I give them the test and they start complaining that the vocabulary words are on the test and asking me if they can just skip that section. No? You can’t? You can’t just skip parts of your life that you don’t want to do!

I am so tired of the eye rolls, of the attitudes, of the thinking that they know what they should be doing. This morning I had a kid tell me that they didn’t do their homework because they were sleepy. Well, I am also sleepy, quite literally all the time. But that’s part of life, sorry. 

I’m just frustrated. I don’t understand what happened to respecting your teachers. Of course, there are some great students who are still very respectful but a majority of them are so rude to me. And then admin doesn’t do anything! Ahh! 

I just had to get this out.

teaching,MystaED,2020/01/22,"LinkedIn Article on the Poor State of Education- Interested in Feedback Hey everyone. I wanted to share a LinkedIn article about the current state of education to see what people thought, as I'm doing a bit of research. I am trying to find a diversity of opinion since education can vary so much by location. If you have time and interest, I'd be interested in feedback. Not trying to start any arguments, just trying to see what teachers' perspectives are. Much appreciated!

teaching,Teach_is_a_Peach,2020/01/22,"Needing Encouraging Words Today was rough. Not just rough, but bleak. Many days as a teacher are rough but the shit icing just piles on the shit cake when hours upon hours of preparing materials for students are negated by just one hour of their complete and utter disregard for their free education. Sure, I understand occasional slacking-but how do I get through to some of these kids that they are biting the hands that feed them, shooting themselves in their own foot? I try, try, try to tell them how important it is to focus and use your FREE education as a time for improvement/increasing opportunities, but they don't seem to give a crap about improving. Free education=squandered? I stay up at night thinking about these kids and it kills me to envision what their future may hold. That's the bleak part-they hold the key to their own happiness and freedom and they don't even see the golden key sitting right in the palm of their hands.  Context: bought materials for ""fun"" wind-turbine project (complete with tiny generators and LEDS) and certain kids did absolutely nothing-did not listen to the assignment-then amidst their socializing, had the audacity to ask the most basic questions about the generator and windmill design (duh the whole point of the project is that you design the windmill yourself).  How relevant is high school to adult success, REALLY? I think it is a lot more relevant than the kids think it is, but how do I teach them this? Any advisement is greatly appreciated.",10.027504273504276,9.081512177777782,8.986296296296299,67.62756410256415,58.7037037037037,12.455840455840454,40.3988603988604,11.51311941424646,4.643245014245017,1208,53,207,28,13,377,157,270,0.035,0.755,0.21,0.9956,0,0,0,1,0,0,35.0,0,2,13,2,12,15,4,0,19,1,17,8,7,6,2,41,30,19,1,1,9,0,5,0,0,1,0,1,0,5,12,9,1,3,6,0,4,1,5,4,0,1,4,7,22,14,33,25,7,21,0,0,1,0,28,9,3,6,9,135,34,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09431621280801862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12965953089393828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908346121066589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944571684005657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09160562904623216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724615347384686,0.13304726930384642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15290987365195338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14764161689737546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14653710614647028,0.0,0.0,0.4097549442486308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153443608172131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11791209995807952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14061325652697967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283933854348444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1301542843886195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939821822575496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15019134873888235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13111001594656155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15536825855837652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08885049149454988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844333648227033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14036504314937587,0.11052061843126423,0.12626118851552467,0.0,0.0,0.2847333974262199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413803724962824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14782862415058595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13071681163905632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122407382197932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666072355664681,0.0,0.0,0.08087318955795425,0.0,0.13146504927657449,0.0,0.0,0.2824909782722089,0.0,0.0,0.1443846361954376,0.0,0.11978649680093027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15484613746133155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,GothicFluttershy,2020/01/23,not sure what to think of this situation. teacher-student relations My friend has been hanging out with his high school teacher. Hanging out as in going on coffee dates and emailing eachother. While he is graduated I find it weird that his teacher would be with  him alone 3 months after his graduation. The teacher is young around 27 or 28. He tells me they still email eachother. I'm getting concerned. It's legal because he's technically 18 but he hasn't been 18 for very long. Teachers could you give me insight into this? could this lady really be into her student? or is this just innocent? while it seems like she is offering him advice I feel like this might be grooming.,3.629733494851607,6.3567102047244095,4.201102362204725,82.34285281647489,76.8740157480315,6.427377347062388,28.66686856450636,7.61054688173877,2.0080216838279834,544,24,94,8,13,172,90,127,0.034,0.862,0.105,0.8795,0,1,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,1,1,0,3,5,0,0,1,0,15,0,0,0,1,23,22,7,0,3,5,0,1,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,10,8,0,0,5,0,0,3,2,1,0,0,2,1,14,4,14,13,0,19,0,0,0,0,19,8,0,4,10,63,24,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21081646335631107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22343927866086435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920523647189958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13151174927765674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3444981277814454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10908350458858587,0.15412311430491427,0.0,0.0,0.19718042399291927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666784749287898,0.0,0.11271408665456703,0.20695533838184046,0.12260875298104493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2279388111211817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21079716553902333,0.0,0.0,0.19092114787294776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288636935534615,0.0,0.0,0.1721998390408001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820714719558552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21833815270285226,0.0,0.1963995738540748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24249830561397304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17228847109180176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20333030603713495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18856433017470164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13823605936047156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17800626373532086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15325393025259093,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,limonade11,2020/01/23,"Am I being Paranoid? I was just wondering, and maybe being paranoid - but is there any way for an admin to blacklist you from working?  I don't just mean in the district but more broadly, like across a state?  is there a list-serve for admins?  I am still so traumatized by my short stint in the last situation that I am hesitant to apply anywhere.  But I am also (wisely) afraid of the p who was not honest with me about the position and who said and did some things I found very concerning.  Without giving much away, we parted ways a month ago.  He was all smiles and nice guy about it and said he would say great things about me, but I would never consider anything he says as trustworthy at this point.  : /   

Just trying to salvage the wreckage of this experience, learn as much as I can from it and move on.  I think karma or the Universe works things out but - I am nervous about teaching anywhere again, especially reading others experiences here.  I had definitely had some great teaching experiences and cherish those, I know I am a good teacher in the right environment.",6.0780826636050485,6.975114427860698,6.232039800995025,77.92064293915041,66.41293532338307,8.970685036356679,31.87944890929965,9.057496981413335,2.6819602755453498,844,33,154,14,13,269,127,201,0.087,0.736,0.177,0.9778,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,1,0,2,14,10,0,2,12,0,20,0,0,0,2,33,28,18,0,2,11,0,0,1,0,2,0,4,0,1,12,10,0,0,6,1,0,1,4,2,0,0,9,4,19,8,27,15,7,22,1,0,0,0,13,12,0,4,7,122,31,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975968842347688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10804094572127657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09187392918031544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11117735752245124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269326883270072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3964667653894727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481322670213807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12960205921899262,0.0,0.1133170692051843,0.0,0.29790065747161065,0.0,0.13377212800786736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07424847452647185,0.1101260855111094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06600396719648352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13572802388935468,0.14716558252906806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10783705272530934,0.14359194560652674,0.1986308924280698,0.0,0.1041989189687536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463021990250969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771497032459644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13513846687477962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.115376289864421,0.2570257019856717,0.2148769170940059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15186020331933225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078925569534797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692671102305666,0.08656784643255205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172532611011287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11147322177991698,0.0,0.2144752096169832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302334166277468,0.14651225440785182,0.1967115938014585,0.0,0.0,0.19194503605887625,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,throw_some_glitter,2020/01/23,"Calling all 5th-9th grade teachers! Still looking for participants for doctoral research. Hello teachers!

I posted about this a couple months ago, but I am still looking for participants for my study, so I'm trying again in the hopes that I can catch some teachers who didn't see the original post.

I am a practicing school psychologist working toward obtaining my doctoral degree at Penn State. For my dissertation, I am conducting a study on teachers’ perceptions of student bullying behaviors, and I would very much appreciate your participation in my research study. The specifics of the study are as follows:

**What:**  A 20-minute online survey about teachers' perceptions of and responses to student bullying behaviors.

**Who:**  All current teachers of Grades 5–9 in the United States are eligible to participate.

**Why:**  Contribute to a research project about an important topic impacting teachers and students.

**When:**  The survey will be open for responses until February 15th.

**How:**  Please email [spsyresearch@gmail.com](mailto:spsyresearch@gmail.com) for the link to access the online survey.

In exchange for participation, you can choose to receive a $5 Amazon or Starbucks gift card or you can choose to enter a drawing to win a $20 Amazon gift card. *Please note that in order to be eligible to receive a gift card, at the end of the survey you must provide an email address supplied by a school district to verify your status as a teacher.*

Participation in this study is completely voluntary and your responses will be kept confidential. The survey will not ask for your name.

Thank you!!

Please feel free to share this invitation with any teachers you think might be interested.

(Also, I apologize if this violates any rules against self-promotion or spam.)",5.063705001592865,8.677598712328772,5.2433035998725686,69.565729531698,84.13698630136986,8.195731124561963,32.133163427843265,8.638961771785754,3.969479993628545,1432,74,199,40,43,450,158,292,0.055,0.768,0.177,0.9895,1,0,0,0,0,0,70.0,0,9,0,3,10,7,1,0,24,0,20,2,0,2,3,30,31,16,0,4,6,0,1,0,0,6,2,0,1,0,9,6,0,1,7,0,2,5,2,1,0,0,2,4,20,7,44,19,4,31,0,0,3,0,21,11,0,7,10,138,29,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13071299179904966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11792244483877888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20055356371716904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785371685569264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15057153320009994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546073473842135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16315993652797664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3018598815150826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306043917434591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455940755418365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14645948259864078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476558681398744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15643008048160786,0.0,0.0,0.11769990364933032,0.0,0.10839890515237208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4855951912003447,0.0,0.0,0.282448809313555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2984715860275531,0.11750526887531587,0.0,0.1538312910768588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2355209686646787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13575990105805769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09448540113754457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10011458744949407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166863922364325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330582879538036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073514856536128,0.0,0.0,0.10475023045949143,0.0,0.0,0.0

The person who did it last year imported every student picture individually, then labeled them all by hand in the template. This feels like a ridiculous waste of time. I've looked into software that will mass upload the pics, and it does exist, but it appears to be proprietary to companies that also require you to publish through them. We already have an in-district printer, so that's not happening.

Does anyone know of software that's either free or that I could buy which would make this task easier? I have some money in the budget, but I can't pay for a monthly subscription to something.

teaching,iBeFloe,2020/01/24,"Any FREE app or website suggestions? Looking for something where students can submit answers that would pop up on the projector screen as they submit. 

I’m a TA at a Uni &amp; I’m trying to find ways for students to be more interaction in class. 

I’m basically trying to look for apps or sites that allow students to submit discussions. Way back in HS, I recall my teacher using something that allowed us to send in answers / what we thought about a question in with a code. Then our texts would show up on the board in a bubble as we submitted them in, so we could talk about them. 

Was wondering if there’s an app version of that or if anyone can recall what I’m talking about?",4.2016541353383445,5.670830105263157,5.0345939849624095,82.65580075187972,71.25563909774436,7.4252631578947375,29.841353383458646,7.908726449838941,2.0293615037594,536,22,101,7,10,174,84,133,0.0,0.95,0.05,0.7425,1,0,2,0,0,0,12.0,5,0,3,0,7,1,0,0,8,0,7,0,0,3,0,21,16,9,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6,4,0,0,6,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,3,10,2,26,10,2,18,0,0,3,0,15,13,0,7,2,68,16,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2230277162711644,0.0,0.1399783603996336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14392821873748782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15827836941503529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16434661022184638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1881341677763864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3457077672721478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305880764680035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.316931607457725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3308930305894687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16341408634548474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27950389997614816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476003557380092,0.17777979968662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32677265962611524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22322486186711574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2924458731011443,0.0,0.0,0.0

\-I use this when there are big issues or events for all my Social Studies classes (9/11, Martin Luther King Jr. ,etc.)

\-I show this daily in my study hall, and let kids ask me questions. I think kids enjoy that.

\-They do a good job of explaining things. I know CNN has bias, but I like how they simplify things for kids to understand.

\-Specifically, Quizlet Live is amazing!!!

\- You can easily shuffle teams and get kids up and moving. It helps when kids complain about their team mates, but at the same time it gets them to work with others they don't like.

teaching,aintthedevilhappy,2020/01/25,"Teacher/Sub Shortage? Been teaching for 15 years and this is the first year we’ve had trouble hiring qualified candidates let alone subs. Apparently we are approaching the “cliff” where seasoned teachers will be retiring in droves. Couple that with declining numbers of enrollment in teacher prep programs and well, here we are. 

Interested in hearing how the situation is at other schools ....

teaching,Stock-Advance,2020/01/25,"Oregon Trail 😂🤣😂Had my students play Oregon Trail today.  I received this email from a student:

“This game caused frustration but it was great to play I enjoyed the activity.
Before playing this game I didn't know what typhoid was, after playing I learned that it was a disease that is caused by salmonella. I did not record everything I have done but from what I Remember and Oxen is an animal that what was used to pull the wagon, I realized now that you need more than two oxens to pull you from missouri to oregon. And it is very important to buy extra parts, my wagon broke down before I could reach the river. I believed that conserving money was best but I then found that most travel supplies are given through trading, with no bullets I was unable to hunt, with my lack of supplies I was unable to trade which lead to my family's death.”",7.009342818428184,6.7044045548780495,7.202032520325204,75.88334688346883,64.42682926829268,9.727913279132792,32.856368563685635,9.150863307647796,2.8171214092140917,673,24,122,10,9,218,99,164,0.096,0.74,0.16399999999999998,0.9009,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,0,2,1,9,1,0,6,0,16,0,0,4,0,22,21,6,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16,4,0,1,5,7,4,5,3,2,0,1,12,0,19,7,19,8,6,10,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,1,4,92,35,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3638777227282949,0.2408936969287314,0.22438323956807868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4392890847752247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707120444601329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21880462834470604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19216106984741474,0.0,0.20156358661546225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344345917528481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2357292587953912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750586934157173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15853940933234303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315383203852681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24220811108639995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20266944104606935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2088639416667908,0.0,0.0,0.18466552505858447,0.0,0.17641787143902685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,DwighteSnoot,2020/01/25,"Today I passed the ParaPro! Getting started in WA state. I've noticed that there is not much information available in terms of the process of becoming certified as a Paraprofessional in Washington State. I can see that  the state requirements are 1) Passing the ParaPro and 2) having a high school diploma. 

I looked into this certification while living in NY, where is seems to be a much more involved process. There you have to send all of your documentation to the Dept. of Ed. and then they mail you back a Certificate. Being that the WA state requirements are just those two things, is there a certificate for me to receive or do I just start applying to schools in my district now that I've passed the test?

Also, I'm thinking of what I can add to my resume to beef it up as I have no classroom experience. I have a cover letter, letter of enrollment in an Associates of Early Childhood Ed program I'm in now, letters of recommendation from a current school psychologist I know in NY and a former HS teacher of mine, a reference from a Nanny job I had for a few years, a Food Handler's Certificate, and like ten years of food service and administrative experience. Does that sound like a list of weird or irrelevant things no one cares about?

teaching,Check-mark,2020/01/25,"Want to stop teaching yearbook and focus on English I need some guidance. I am a third year teacher. I moved to a new school this year to teach yearbook and English. I have 3 freshmen and 2 yearbook classes.

Before break I was told that I needed 300 hours over 3 years to get my CTE certification. I am certified in secondary education.

That made my mind up for me. I already was spending all my time working on the yearbook. Most days I don’t leave until 6 or 7pm.

Now, after telling my two department chairs I will not continue yearbook (I have two chairs because I’m CTE and English) my vice principal and CTE chair are saying it’s actually 240 hours and there are things that would count beyond getting an internship or taking more classes.

I don’t want to move schools again, but I can’t imagine teaching yearbook again. I spent 2 weeks doing a CTE conference over the summer and yearbook camp. Now they want more.

Teaching English is enough. I miss my own kids. I’m sick of missing deadlines and feeling unsuccessful. I’m always behind. 

How do I get out of this and stay at my current school?",3.0130435759209355,5.481163183962263,3.8763881401617257,85.25154088050316,77.5377358490566,5.924887690925428,29.906558849955076,7.07126945348624,1.8272634321653185,873,42,160,10,21,279,128,212,0.076,0.892,0.031,-0.8626,1,1,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,1,7,2,0,0,6,0,16,1,0,2,1,29,34,14,0,6,4,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,7,10,0,1,2,0,2,3,4,2,0,3,5,2,25,0,20,27,7,33,0,2,0,0,5,9,0,4,19,103,32,11,0.0,0.0,0.13830086597709354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15639447218078814,0.0,0.11792460079148785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08639281408879558,0.0,0.12059553967433052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0913993870185782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14643738581251398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0716592318468771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.222132711039624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791365314833026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15006382681187494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13410140135479093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309947934404318,0.0,0.0,0.3012575038067501,0.0,0.21017110346554124,0.0,0.13687662178072454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270354231220868,0.0,0.4302926743478413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510574917223146,0.0,0.11848648416036303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10655779775282596,0.0,0.1238718457479218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09415423353851214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08263961889927005,0.0,0.0,0.13542206871186735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2768848785241221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507750786429336,0.0,0.11368136397652708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10317577958178517,0.0,0.0,0.10067570675176743,0.0,0.0,0.2737942266841704

I'm finishing up my 2nd year in my current district, and I'm looking to update my resume not just for the purposes of finding potential new contracts this year, but to perhaps apply to the state department or private companies.

teaching,IgnoreTheOP,2020/01/26,"Personal technology - what do you prefer? So I am in a weird spot and thought I would ask for advice here before doing more research. I am graduating this spring with a focus on elementary education. I am looking to replace my current laptop due to need more than want. It is starting to show its age and I'm worried about it lasting through my final placement. I want to be prepared should it die. Best case scenario is it is good until after I am hired and I have more concrete ideas of what I will want/what I will be given.

All schools in my area will provide you with either a laptop or desktop to complete school work on and to keep security tight. However, I 100% want a personal laptop or tablet to keep my personal life separate. That being said I am not naive enough to know that lesson plans, assignments, etc. may get created on it if I just receive a desktop and want to do some lesson prep at home. 

I am looking at a chromebook or laptop with the potential for a tablet to support one of those 2. I am not an apple person, so some type of android/windows product. I do little more than lesson plan/create assessments etc. using microsoft word and PowerPoint which could transfer over into Google Docs and Google slides. I have been using a laptop for ""forever"" and I am just unsure how well the switch will go. 

What works for you in this regard? Am I not considering something that you feel is important? 

Thanks in advance!",4.276581818181821,6.121343549090909,5.247181818181818,79.70677272727275,71.69090909090909,7.763636363636365,29.59090909090909,8.438071523408619,2.354745454545455,1136,47,203,19,22,372,156,275,0.037000000000000005,0.8440000000000001,0.11800000000000001,0.9501,3,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,4,0,8,8,7,0,0,11,0,31,1,0,3,1,49,54,16,1,10,10,0,2,0,0,7,1,1,1,4,16,12,0,4,8,1,0,4,3,1,1,1,4,5,26,6,37,39,12,26,0,0,2,0,11,13,0,7,9,156,42,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12194698910457813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166652920718908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106190273135368,0.0,0.1309633209644147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13084385209519803,0.0,0.0,0.09963763922011036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12951618983625754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12894528303993386,0.2783559944084663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06309945975647283,0.0,0.0,0.1367054318579005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06519957349804141,0.0,0.07092315289738396,0.10467106031778337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251782867178415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14087693175284044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22184480313032,0.0,0.0,0.0685833706269927,0.10172354632842318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08814550241833045,0.0,0.1250761024178582,0.0,0.0,0.2095906069772612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925329698861079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845634614519749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4358602877029279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870741515141488,0.0,0.0,0.25259583530501684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09607231058400248,0.0,0.0,0.08832964473477263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416144464620187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11489330044810653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09907228239631197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21556343045819992,0.0,0.0,0.36803287761928216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11220455081490216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18170264413313786,0.12673409092167834,0.0,0.08864988561713771,0.0,0.0,0.0

However, I heard there might be an “alternative” degree or certification I can obtain an was wondering if anyone has any information. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and just want to go out and do this! Thanks I’m advance",4.8581904761904715,7.198496342857148,6.266666666666668,70.91333333333334,71.28571428571428,8.476190476190476,32.61904761904762,9.150863307647796,3.3626190476190483,456,22,73,10,9,154,73,105,0.017,0.9009999999999999,0.08199999999999999,0.7546,1,0,0,0,1,0,9.0,1,1,0,2,4,2,0,0,5,0,11,0,0,0,1,20,20,7,0,2,5,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,5,0,0,4,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,3,1,7,2,11,15,4,13,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,8,4,52,9,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694722419214768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18752817792989315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19281977968222325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21204459130236952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2891320763606409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15672236892218805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24350362748882096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29254077985382754,0.0,0.32297008882673806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21268529158173374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25388536019497965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3317087257900455,0.0,0.0,0.22753321159624035,0.16265205949091738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25563490236927144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29905302144617685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,jesmanak,2020/01/26,"How do I confront young white girls in the touching of a young black girls hair? On phone, formatting. 

This is a charged topic, please give me all you've got, whether it's criticism or advice. Don't hold back. 

I started long term subbing a 5th grade class. 

End of my first week here,  I noticed the white girls in my classes have an obsession with the touching of  the black girls hair without permission. I've made it very clear to the girls being touched that they have an advocate in me, if someone's touching their hair to let me know and I will address it. However this puts the weight of reporting on the girls being messed with if it's a time I don't see, and I don't want them to feel they are being punished for something that is in no way their fault. They shouldn't have to worry about this. 

It's not enough to tell the white girls to keep their hands to themselves and enforce consequences for breaking this rule - the gravity of them touching other people in GENERAL, let alone these girls' hair, is high and I want to impress on them the implications of their actions. There are generations of racism and systemic oppression behind their actions they don't understand, an entitlement to space that isn't theirs.

I'm new to the school but it's something that has been going on for awhile now, as far as I can tell. 

How do I manage this? I've told everyone in the class I'm enforcing a boundaries rule with write ups for any future misconduct, what more I should be doing? How do I further address this in a younger group without alienating those being touched, or making them feel responsible for things happening to them? 

I'm speaking with the principle on Monday for furthered support but this has been eating my mind.",6.532831325301206,6.963436620481932,6.024963855421689,81.43298795180725,65.32530120481928,9.290602409638556,33.46746987951808,9.120678840339163,2.770218795180723,1386,56,264,22,20,426,166,332,0.066,0.89,0.044000000000000004,-0.2576,1,1,2,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,15,1,8,7,2,1,22,0,32,7,5,5,2,39,52,17,0,6,10,0,14,0,0,3,0,1,2,8,22,9,2,2,4,0,0,4,10,5,0,1,5,21,32,2,47,37,4,39,0,0,6,0,31,18,0,4,14,180,54,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1414703723085316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499410313466675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0984505155741169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132140016966184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14813878784557266,0.0,0.0,0.1282257913055147,0.1495890741791475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13833668068869606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464030252778138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123143728640422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13887932804675165,0.08227775789596059,0.0,0.11578808880533427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12802217017219836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529604849616328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12868077811517298,0.0,0.0,0.07956338281098584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29608013497298635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12811943356391367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369875893610441,0.09663701441482184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1461793278527933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13982253927397129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648248712074804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003672789448338,0.0,0.0,0.15891713597738516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14553672014715294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465178727518239,0.11536523299844732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12266558232338062,0.22290645544686868,0.0,0.0,0.10247098200835766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16428653640695978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25307573772203057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618066142689682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441822430159075,0.0,0.0,0.13833668068869606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15071366259538374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119452778985881,0.1707815784576036,0.1149139650009812,0.11612806316034464,0.1762943527279535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791117594811116,0.0,0.0,0.14702387618195026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Tndo_seth,2020/01/27,"Sometimes a nap fixes everything! Today one of  students was falling asleep at our morning meeting. Instead of yelling at him for something he can’t control.(He has shared at our share put that he had to get up at 5 am to make it to school from where they had stayed the night before.) I had him put his head down before lunch for 15 min for a nap. After lunch he came back refreshed &amp; thanked me for letting him take a nap,then he apologized for coming to school tired.

teaching,ColdOneWithTheBoys15,2020/01/27,"Any teachers here work for Los Angeles Unified School District? I have some questions (I also posted this in r/teachers but I’m asking here too to cast a wider net)

5th year physical education teacher (elementary) relocating to Los Angeles from Maryland. Just had my eligibility interview and from what I take it went pretty well. The interviewer said I need to add an additional reference and send in a video lesson and then after it’s all reviewed I’ll be able to apply to schools directly (assuming I passed, but I am confident).

Obviously that process will take some time. Naturally I won’t find out anything else before that all happens so I’m turning to Reddit for some answers for some more questions I have;

1.) What is it like working for LAUSD? Is it actually a good school system to work for? Good benefits? Decent funding? Administration? 

2.) Where are the most of the openings? Tried to ask my interviewer about it and he said San Fernando Valley area can be pretty competitive but there are openings elsewhere. I’m not really that picky, but I don’t want to work in a dangerous area. If those are realistically the only options, I might consider something else.

3.) Do physical education programs get decent funding? I’m hoping to find a position in elementary 

4.) If you are a physical educator, do you have flexibility in using the SHAPE standards for your teaching? Or are you strictly bound to the California physical education standards?

Thanks for any help you can provide!",4.392542643923239,7.3698594589552275,6.1510660980810234,68.01029850746272,75.67910447761193,9.201705756929641,33.45202558635395,9.606745405546679,4.128029424307037,1197,64,188,36,28,409,159,268,0.015,0.8190000000000001,0.166,0.9913,0,0,1,0,0,0,38.0,0,5,0,5,10,8,1,0,13,0,22,0,0,1,3,43,41,14,0,5,9,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,12,9,0,1,8,1,2,3,3,1,1,0,4,2,17,7,29,32,8,21,2,0,0,0,17,12,0,14,5,123,29,13,0.12506296620416535,0.0,0.1220434144655037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001280888946584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17009421122136098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10291616513070777,0.0,0.23383398228285399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10641937291703656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2089481210685317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2286105708078817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06534023805810185,0.0,0.0,0.2097937649596236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105927679875548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08382707003246642,0.0,0.0,0.12421574419707895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06109944811292495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326720436059509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09273260477329784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0951160213513602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11977575102667908,0.2544679951551549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2801982883061301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08011853857066037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23792703998250464,0.0,0.0,0.3797111957751691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09627958140767884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1880635726146991,0.0,0.0,0.11514117654137435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0729252213233816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490954470392112,0.1360325944953399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10801424846117264,0.0,0.0,0.07376537773694038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244662607598696,0.11593462262350375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3641893155574841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08053644988507082

teaching,wolverine4343,2020/01/27,"Has anyone here worked for Chicago Public Schools? How exactly did they apply Common Core? My fiancé is from Chicago, and she's interested in moving back there once we graduate from college next spring. I would love to as well, and am trying to learn a little bit about schools in the area, as I'll be a high school English teacher once I'm out of school. Specifically, I'm wanting to get a picture of how CPS would mandate my curriculum look and common core be applied.

Utah applies the core standards, but they're really relaxed about it for the most part. For example, a lot of English departments around here choose overarching goals they see in the standards (e.g. ""critical thinking"" or ""effective communication"") rather than individually addressing each standard. I like this, as I have some of the same concerns with the core as the Chicago Teachers Union lists on their website, worrying that it will keep my curriculum from focusing on anything beyond getting students ready for college and careers. A lot of my most valuable lessons in high school came from class periods where we weren't necessarily hitting a specific common core standard, but were taking a somewhat broader view of education's goals. As one example just to illustrate more clearly, two lessons while reading a book were spent discussing and learning about sexual assault, with simply the hope that we would be better people by the end of it, not necessarily better writers or readers. I know that was a special experience in some ways, as in a lot of states spending that kind of time on a that kind of subject could never happen.

We definitely still hit the standards, ended up with strong test scores and were prepared well for college and careers, those things were never discounted. However, I enjoy the freedom Utah offers to broaden the horizons of education a bit alongside all of that important work. Living in Utah all of my life and watching teachers do this here, I know that it will be possible. But I'm not sure what the requirements and usual practices are in Chicago, especially in a district as large as CPS. If anyone--hopefully teachers in the area--has information or experiences seeing the way CPS or other Chicago districts apply common core standards to curriculum I would be extremely grateful to hear. Thank you so much.

tl;dr: My home state of Utah allows a lot of freedom for teachers to determine their own curriculum. Is that same freedom available in Chicago districts, especially CPS, or are there stricter mandates on how class time can be used and what content can be taught?",10.552123205741633,9.759739822368424,9.494952153110052,63.906028708134,57.57456140350878,11.975119617224882,45.06937799043061,11.022393298168332,5.256784210526316,2093,111,317,42,22,657,236,456,0.043,0.7929999999999999,0.165,0.9965,1,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,4,1,4,11,21,18,1,0,29,0,31,2,0,6,7,82,56,32,0,9,13,0,0,1,0,6,1,1,2,0,19,21,0,2,10,3,3,3,5,1,2,2,10,6,23,17,68,30,20,48,0,0,5,1,16,24,0,16,18,230,42,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639872897027354,0.0,0.07530654518097905,0.08146504544049324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07036704800681683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16186978272360067,0.19981471633543965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046653023769391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07306485310645187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16210486750536238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17903251193049627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09562244343654032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809237233875453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314062901955567,0.0,0.0,0.19337481871476705,0.0917939566086226,0.09089202401474997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813400341478334,0.0,0.19059124674588787,0.10058515917537243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06463760318489989,0.04470812086716571,0.0917190242745518,0.08080673664015514,0.0,0.07684699793747637,0.0,0.0,0.3112007811984534,0.08259311613515595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0972627302934316,0.06727181958768877,0.0,0.1411593290935165,0.0,0.09732400689782733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1949145000579542,0.06201087197090665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09909853414833288,0.0,0.06344287014950281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031659841880403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153672373746354,0.0,0.05862490442626497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4630749420179338,0.14584636694017628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308156890909916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08624893864223393,0.0,0.0688056045909713,0.0,0.0,0.08425191710545872,0.0,0.0,0.06079647946970665,0.058637168429520915,0.0,0.0,0.10672271877692664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06213061336303431,0.0,0.08939388702993639,0.0,0.0,0.07903695081914539,0.10078749445851844,0.0,0.053976124589210916,0.1452758675250909,0.0,0.0,0.16456048311332436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13324359254752433,0.09293483676701957,0.0,0.2600298811259913,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,AllieNB,2020/01/27,"Any Illinois teachers who can provide some guidance on obtaining an Illinois teaching license? Hi, hoping this is the right place to ask. I recently moved to Chicago from NY after getting home from teaching English abroad, and discovered a passion for teaching ESL students. I’d like a career change, and I’m looking for a little clarity on the process of obtaining an Illinois teaching license. I’m interested in early childhood education, like birth through grade 2. I have my MBA, so I’m curious what additional coursework is required for individuals who already have a bachelor’s degree or higher that’s not in education. I found a list of “approved programs” but I wasn’t sure exactly what coursework would be required for a license. I’m pretty new to the world of teaching/licensure so I would appreciate some guidance.

teaching,cam5576,2020/01/27,"Asking about a job opening? Hello all - I could really use some advice. 

I am a band teacher, and I work a 45-50 min commute away. I actually live on the border between two states so I teach in a different state then I live. I am in my second year in this job and while I really like it most of the time, I would love to have a middle school only job closer to home. I know a lot of teachers deal with a commute like mine but I feel like my life is wasting away in the commute and I would love to find a job somewhere closer to where I live. 

My boyfriend has a job that he really loves and he doesn't want to move, and honestly I don't either. I just know I don't want to be in my current job forever. Through one of his friends who has a kid in the school, I heard that one of the band teachers in the town I live in is leaving after this year. The problem is, I have ZERO connections to this school district. I have been to state conventions and done my best to make connections, but since I am teaching in a different state, it doesn't seem to help me at all for this. 

Would it be appropriate to contact the school and ask about the position? Should I contact the band directors in the district and ask to get coffee? Should I ask if they need someone to run sectionals or something after school to meet some kids? Are there any other suggestions anyone has for me to get my name out there, for this year or for future openings? 

I suppose I should have been doing this all along, but my own job is very busy and takes a lot out of me. However if there is a chance a job is opening this year I think I'd need to try. Thanks in advance!",3.5960984654731436,4.2125574205882375,4.682276214833761,87.8224168797954,71.8529411764706,7.913043478260869,26.84143222506394,8.04050195162591,1.4256227621483382,1273,41,281,17,23,418,154,340,0.038,0.833,0.129,0.9875,12,0,1,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,1,3,8,11,0,0,25,0,34,4,0,2,3,54,57,19,0,14,9,0,1,3,1,6,1,1,1,2,14,16,0,0,6,3,0,3,4,1,0,5,4,2,39,10,50,44,12,45,1,0,0,3,27,26,0,10,15,203,53,17,0.0,0.0,0.0724618691044282,0.0,0.0,0.07256082671288908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050495737614859405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05192060792820445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27767245763411,0.0,0.13952945697858696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07792571926555762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059286330286775164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765533280809492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516069998257012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07598833172751769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037545403938919024,0.053047567592613684,0.0,0.0,0.06786744426284343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0573689916979365,0.0,0.07759002479821046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04977135556804047,0.0,0.0744835115441866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5894906017747578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08161687480751811,0.0,0.0,0.07862499846929867,0.0,0.0,0.05244828571382011,0.1088312769083414,0.0,0.2622730176910001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12625736941367205,0.2010532788782317,0.0,0.04956558424623569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07892098741878849,0.0,0.1101178281224623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10063380355207917,0.05647404015269015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105171298829323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14270837341378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37574856846704857,0.0,0.06759868379361161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061424249465149135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06291576050419201,0.057164890510043385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05583028810607939,0.0,0.0,0.0683637449805145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757940907003432,0.0,0.0,0.04329850869126554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05041406241375873,0.0,0.07253604553688593,0.0,0.0,0.06413221366908743,0.0,0.06126789839405007,0.08759468373483968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05405830095120978,0.0,0.0,0.15824521053651205,0.0,0.0,0.19127035130131906

As many of you can probably relate to, I am on a time crunch to seal a teaching position in September of this year due to college loans. Unfortunately I can't seem to find many available jobs (it is only January, but I really want to try and  get a position ASAP) for the 2020-2021 school year. Thus, I was wondering if it would be ""frowned upon"" if I was to call a school and ask if there is a teaching position that will become available for the 2020-2021 year? If it is not frowned upon, who do I ask? I am looking to teach High School English -- should I try and get in contact with the English Coordinator? Principal?

teaching,Diaetiacurare,2020/01/27,"How can I find a school with good administrative support around discipline? I'm looking for new jobs in a new area, and I've also decided this is going to be my last try at enjoying teaching; if it doesn't work out, I'll look in earnest for something else.  My biggest frustration is not being able to give consequences for disruptive behavior.  I have heard that some schools are better about that, and I'm looking through student handbooks to try to get an idea of how discipline is handled, but I'm having a hard time getting an idea of how things would really be.  Any ideas on what signs to look for?",9.67358974358974,7.157758239316242,9.067623931623933,71.73015384615384,60.62393162393162,12.77880341880342,42.2034188034188,11.20814326018867,4.558847521367522,482,22,92,10,5,154,83,117,0.047,0.861,0.092,0.6322,1,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,2,6,5,1,0,5,0,12,0,0,3,0,21,25,8,0,2,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,6,5,0,2,5,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,6,4,4,20,20,1,13,0,0,4,0,2,8,0,2,4,57,10,6,0.14550787055327635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11636259151090945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09895034165371937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12953285425242594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12868988693269595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155315468512215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329915575883565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15204371349640816,0.139584408255531,0.08269547606561974,0.12204509824592932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034647135725894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4927820237273182,0.0,0.0,0.1443941092913752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11860833517769855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4887598566844346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28106481619457296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09321606781839667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2945234665887468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201906762327833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651206071575791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09666896362271812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484680946291376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19758058543639906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10593146275315944,0.0,0.0,0.10336461641628944,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,blackpantherismydad,2020/01/28,"Is this Academic Dishonesty? Good evening, quick question for the teachers of this lovely forum.

I have a very confusing homework problem essentially for which I googled the question and found a surprising answer.  The question asks if position A or position B is correct, when the correct answer turns out to be an alternative position C (not listed, therefore somewhat of a trick question).  I felt flabbergasted, considered the perspective and then utilized that information to craft an original argument, based on my own thought process to arrive at position C.  No direct plagiarism took place, everything stated is my own words and ideas but the work arrives at the same conclusion I viewed.  I haven't submitted yet, but is this an act of academic dishonesty?  I feel like I can't unsee what the right answer is, however the right answer is so niche and weird I can't imagine arriving at this conclusion without prior knowledge of the right answer?  What would the community recommend that I do?

teaching,12INCHVOICES,2020/01/28,"Anyone have any recs for an adult ESL textbook/curriculum? I'll try to make this short since I know it might not apply to many of you here, but I'm also not sure where else to ask! (Sorry if I'm in the wrong place!)

Basically, my partner and I have been together for many years, living together in a Spanish-speaking country and speaking exclusively Spanish between us. Recently he has become more interested than ever in learning English to communicate better with my friends and family, but I have *no idea* where to start teaching him besides the very obvious stuff -- and even then, I'm not sure in what order we should take it from there. 

When I was in HS and learning Spanish, we used the old Glencoe ""Bienvenidos"" series and I thought they were actually pretty good...so maybe something like that? Basically I'm looking for vocabulary lessons (ideally based around a theme) and some grammatical concepts that build in a logical progression. Culture is great to learn as well but he already knows a lot about that since we've been together for a long time now, so I'm more interested in the vocabulary/grammar aspect. 

Any suggestions?

teaching,Jogius,2020/01/28,"Teaching 4th grade kids german Hey everybody,

I'm not a teacher, but I didn't find any subreddit rules and hope that it's fine for me to post here. I will soon take part in a school exchange (I'm a 15 y/o German boy) and as part of this program, I will teach five lessons of German to 4th graders in a middle school in the United States. 

First of all (if there are any teachers that teach German to English speaking children), what would you say is the best topics to start with? I think the best idea would be to start with colors, then teach them about numbers from 1-10, maybe pets and easy 'small talk' (What's your name? How old are you?), but then I still need a topic for my last lesson...

I also don't really have any experience with teaching, at all, so do you have any tips for me, just things that I should look out for? Furthermore, I'm looking for some small games that I could try to play with the class, does anybody have ideas for that? 

Thank you for any answers! I'm really looking forward to teaching this class, but I'm a little scared of them just being distracted and loud all the time...

teaching,willteachforicecream,2020/01/28,"That High School Life: Now in Season 3! Hey /r/teaching, I'm a fifth year teacher who's been running a podcast since 2017. 

I originally started it as a way to stay in contact with my colleagues who were leaving my school, as well as to document the lives of my students as they went through their final years of high school. Since then, the podcast's grown into a series of interviews with students, teachers, and soon-to-be graduates. 

The show's now in its third season, and I've just uploaded my latest episode where I interview my guest (now a senior software developer) about the concept of trajectory. Show link to the podcast website is below!

teaching,hxldencaulfield,2020/01/28,"Classroom management trouble/Elementary school I'm not a teacher but I do work with children. Ive previously worked as a teacher at a daycare and it was short lived and i've come to the conclusion that my problem is classroom management.

I'm a lunch/recess monitor (and will hopefully at some point be a teacher's aide) and I enjoy the job because I get to hold conversations with the students and it's all fine and great till it comes to the rooms that have a load of the children that just start trouble. (This is a reason I ended up quitting the daycare job, and realized i could never take on the leadership role and am better suited to work ""behind the scenes"").

I am currently having issues with the first grade class, there are certain students that just act up on a daily basis. I've tried raising my voice, waiting in place for them to quiet down when we are in the hallway, giving prices to the children that do follow directions, trying to practice ""signals"" to announce its quiet time/clean up time, bringing games and other activities for their indoor recess time, trying to engage more with the students that give me the most problems to try to understand why they might be acting up so much, but they just continue to ignore my directions, and scream in the hallway, push each other, punch each other, steal from each other, tackle each other etc etc. It's gotten so bad i've had to call security and they had one of the children removed.

I've reached out to their teacher and administration and they are aware of the issue. Teacher has informed me that she has spoken to the parents of the students but that the parents are either apathetic or don't believe what is being told about their child.

I cant imagine how the teacher deals with the stress of this, and I feel embarrassed and terrible that I can't handle a group of 30 first graders for an hour and have to constantly give reports to the teacher about what her students did that day. I feel irresponsible and am trying my best not lose my cool, they are just children or course.

Seeing how you are all teachers, I've come here to seek advice on what I should try to do,  or how to avoid these mistakes from repeating again. (I've come too aware that my flaw when it comes to working with children is setting rules/being strict/not knowing exactly what to do when students act up but because this is my passion I wish to learn how I can improve.)",8.776558441558443,7.391472673160172,8.282251082251081,73.0862337662338,61.44588744588744,10.564502164502166,38.31601731601732,9.218907990703514,3.4872822510822505,1933,80,345,25,22,614,223,462,0.11,0.79,0.1,-0.7455,5,1,0,0,0,0,45.0,1,1,9,11,20,24,0,3,32,1,39,1,0,5,5,81,64,35,0,7,14,2,2,0,0,3,0,4,1,7,30,34,0,5,10,1,1,12,6,13,0,3,6,8,36,11,60,51,14,50,0,1,1,1,33,19,0,7,18,257,66,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09192807175560767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0785479013068532,0.11469333401982615,0.0,0.0,0.10598923823044423,0.09872491035137347,0.08320085135365353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09606012197619238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4051823159561925,0.0,0.10166062637933622,0.0,0.07511047312476689,0.0,0.0,0.06066997895076494,0.0969862135777735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08332168461637718,0.0,0.2098348636196412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09513333140613547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16003867577334566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049149807756409404,0.27073319930640555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371697095811737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934367570282941,0.09264398833462192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19637773157026148,0.18670795522227804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05170063699426694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306910864335314,0.0,0.0,0.10524479744366988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0997976994219706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915525019715785,0.0,0.07255570594757314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06374701015039551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2089161966503775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09828735839853896,0.0,0.08893038357483539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1800323195266582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005933074629854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09672379021958168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09520795980118013,0.07496483711836596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665860959663552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077615051046938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07073197706883685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645660032084954,0.0,0.0,0.08989178512267272,0.0,0.38322062388303546,0.0,0.0,0.09793440254333267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08488719679701859,0.0,0.10818051347163264,0.0,0.0,0.2739481118919673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I teach in an urban school serving kids in foster care. We have an advisory period in which we are teaching mindfulness based concepts. My co-teacher and I are tasked with creating a weeks worth of lessons on self-management.

I want to focus on individual's view on things being interpretations loaded with assumptions, being cognizant of the potential effects of those assumptions, and intentionally deciding to choose interpretations that have more potential for positive outcomes.

So, I'm reaching out to you fine folks to ask if anyone knows of any curricula or lessons to help teach this?

teaching,pohlarbearpants,2020/01/29,"Spending my summer interviewing for jobs outside of teaching I made a grave mistake going into teaching. Luckily, I am only 22 and there is still time to fix this.

I am a second year teacher. I am not looking for advice on ""it gets better"" because many teachers I've met with 20+ years experience have also been honest and said ""education is not what it used to be, it is terrible now and it's not something I would choose to be in if I wasnt already in this deep.""

The reasons I'm leaving:

- Low salary and low salary increase. It's RIDICULOUS that I have to work 10 years before I even make 50k, and I work in one of the highest paid and lowest cost of living districts in my state
- Thankless job. All the feedback I get is always focused on ""improving"" even when I bust my ass, and admin doesn't care to give me good feedback on what I'm doing well.
- Lack of independence. Teachers nowadays are not treated like adults. We are TOLD how to do our lessons, told what to do for behavior, and I even was forced to stay after school twice a week to run a club. I had no say in it.
- Disrespect. Hate to sound like an old lady but children are just not as respectful and compliant as they used to be, and parents are even worse. And admin lets them get away with it
- Dumbass politicians. Our governor just posted his improvement plan, and my favorite bullets were ""get rid of confusing math"" ""stop punishing children for solving problems their own way"" ""bring back cursive""
- Unrealistic expectations. Look, this curriculum is brand new, and I'm only a 2nd year teacher, and 75% of the kids came into my class behind grade level. You're not gonna have 60% proficiency by the end of the year.
- Long hours. You want me to plan, grade, set up materials, go to duty, go to meetings, confer with parents, organize special trips and games, all within my 1 hr 40 min of planning per day? Oh, and twice a week I HAVE to stay late to run a club? And twice a month I HAVE to go to a 3 hr required training? But you're only gonna pay me for 37 hours a week? Bullshit.

As an aside, these are the problems of a relatively GOOD school. I worked at shit schools too. The worst ones involved students sexually assaulting me, admin doing nothing about it, and a principal telling the entire staff not only that I went to the hospital but why. Fuck that noise.


I'm spending my summer sprucing up my resumé  and applying for jobs in HR in the corporate world. At least field has a salary ladder to climb.

And people wonder 44% of teachers quit before the 5 year mark.

teaching,flowers_and_wine,2020/01/29,"I added up the time it would take for me to complete everything that is expected of me during one school day I want to note that this post is going to look like I’m complaining and I am absolutely not. I’m truly BAFFLED. I laid everything out so you have an idea of what is expected of me by my administration. I would really like ideas on how you make your requirements work. Obviously I can’t do all of these things on my to-do list and my administration has to know that no one could even finish these in the 5 hours we have the kids. Yet they ask if I’m able to finish all these small group sessions and I can barely fit 4 groups in during the day, much less 20 or so “required” of me. It is incredible to me that anyone would think this is humanly possible.

I’m a 1st-year first grade teacher in Nevada. I taught kindergarten for the last 6 years and that was a different world. However, in addition to teaching whole group lessons, this year:

I am required to teach 1 (15min) small group lesson PER kid PER subject (ELA, math, and writing) daily.

I am required to meet with my tier 3 RTI kids (3 of them) one-on-one for 15 minutes, daily.

I am required to progress monitor all of my students in ELA/math which averages out to about 20 minutes a day.

I am required to teach an additional (15min) reading group, daily, to students who do not perform well on state testing.

This doesn’t include a reading program we use where I have to read one-on-one with each student (15min per week, per student, which averages to almost an hour a day of one-on-one reading) or me testing students to see if they can read sight words/fluently read passages/etc. (~15 minutes a day, averaged).

I added everything up and I’m at about roughly 9hrs, 10 minutes of teaching, if I did absolutely everything required of me, without transition time.

How do you do it? What do you cut out? Does your admin even expect you to complete this much? I just don’t understand at all and I appreciate all advice!!",4.030918952288559,5.373767186700772,5.119938266161039,82.36943734015347,71.50639386189259,8.359855366434429,30.36255401710909,8.841846274778883,2.419572995855013,1554,66,309,29,29,512,182,391,0.03,0.9279999999999999,0.042,0.6754,2,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,2,7,3,13,12,5,1,0,14,0,30,0,0,4,6,60,47,16,0,11,9,0,1,2,0,3,0,0,0,4,22,17,0,7,7,6,0,1,7,2,1,3,3,4,41,3,51,40,10,40,0,0,3,0,26,20,0,6,19,196,63,31,0.09056437999860162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08849846398188843,0.0,0.0,0.09068714457101272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06332472022174128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08466547000604144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18991005873819808,0.0,0.0,0.0723082881382128,0.0,0.0,0.29203266447436804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462050145283787,0.0,0.0,0.07925349923936327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10100322331113457,0.11963383771213255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255737004712405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703401536197557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05146982421016137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17837534298699992,0.0,0.0,0.20447232296840126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04977181478408109,0.07382205716564058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0884903629675702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07605126997687775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060452426893002426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331504795401808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3068438385581451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10209773090028154,0.08673564173177895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5435333280361057,0.0,0.05801786086058978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09165598756007674,0.0721680854490799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06809314288279274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06016694988600884,0.05802999787371516,0.0,0.0,0.10561763655327233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428071350294796,0.0,0.07821854654343871,0.0,0.0,0.0534172177653512,0.0,0.07264528287568832,0.0,0.08142825396353963,0.0,0.0,0.10111189602797373,0.0,0.08730083052121516,0.0,0.06593194725554198,0.0,0.0,0.19300301139601306,0.0,0.0,0.17496147434779852

teaching,fitz_11,2020/01/30,"Please Help!! A little backstory to create some understanding. I work at a before school program where I work as a lead teacher. I am currently in college as a Middle childhood major as well. 

Now to the issue. So in the mornings there is me, another lead teacher, and one administrator. The admin leaves early to go to their full time teaching position which has been fine since I started (a little over a month ago). Everything is fine when she is there, but once she leaves a few students feel as if there are not rules or they do not have to listen to rules. One student in particular is pushing on the line of defiance. For example, we aren’t allowed to let them go to school breakfast if it does not say that they normally go on our class roster. This child was upset with me telling him no and I told him why he couldn’t go (you aren’t listed on the roster, what if you end up missing, etc.). He still wasn’t having it and decided that he was just going to leave, which could in turn could lead to me getting fired. 

That was just one example of many. A few cases this child will just scream “I hate it here!!” Or “there isn’t anything for me here!!”. Not only does that hurt the culture of the classroom but it makes other students who have an inkling of dislike or anger that day also act out. It just makes the last 30 minutes of the before school program harder for the students who want to have fun and play games, especially when I have to keep talking to the trouble makers. 

So if anyone has any tips that would be great, unfortunately my university hasn’t taught any classroom management techniques yet. The only other thing I can add is I have build a pretty good rapport with the students, including the one causing issues, which is why I’m so puzzled on why he just flat out does not listen to simple requests from me and the other lead teacher. 

Thank you all of you 👍🏼 I feel bad for sounding desperate, I just want the before school program to be enjoyable for all of the kiddos, since it’s not their choice to go. And I think shrinking the amount of time I am trying to cool children off or trying to stop bad behavior. 

Again, thank you guys!",4.819795718254613,5.852550454976307,5.296546821376044,83.00718009478675,69.33175355450237,7.811210982186633,28.769733616604015,7.990435384864732,1.8156786076156235,1700,60,329,21,29,544,211,422,0.134,0.7659999999999999,0.1,-0.9718,4,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,2,5,5,6,25,20,2,1,28,1,36,1,0,9,2,61,63,26,0,11,22,0,3,0,0,2,0,5,0,4,24,12,1,2,5,2,0,12,13,9,1,4,7,9,35,11,52,48,9,49,0,2,0,0,36,19,0,10,18,233,59,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739524281949371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06982195209942396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11874788839710387,0.09155237931894757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061049336508294666,0.0,0.07184887247746878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14580077498140806,0.0,0.0,0.22288370182091827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08969164755869954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13942021376267835,0.0,0.0,0.05630786947808283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2292172880155547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07733094065980048,0.0,0.09737397570414927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07846879673814748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829334211866141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04561598681724729,0.0,0.29772246357119503,0.07323167087506686,0.0,0.0962598267606313,0.0,0.0864508455720038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08620076723554984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05852220064042628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09346739725301427,0.0,0.0,0.18225837339804865,0.0,0.07760533598714024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07116948316326617,0.0,0.2773467519575535,0.0,0.0892806163059218,0.0,0.0,0.17501555709462066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11656050083477194,0.08851886009888386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969018532431115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554547875459366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298253574784067,0.2366546611186015,0.1328067146683641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09584040376722623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08882588323359793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0694325920254093,0.0,0.3534504192335352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14444783391414384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617986237274169,0.0,0.06972605518397179,0.07299525415485039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07017664829699019,0.07631298140944243,0.16076704179018275,0.0,0.0,0.05800503116960558,0.055944864112510484,0.0,0.0,0.10182258385940303,0.0,0.0,0.083428657655328,0.0,0.11855581757839265,0.0949684485645358,0.0,0.0908930191042117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10299566081854247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850237411386568,0.0,0.2363516823445307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1271257613316317,0.0,0.0,0.062022675865867585,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,WhoIsGarth,2020/01/30,"What would you do if your school had a 3D printer? I am considering buying a 3D printer for my school (specifically an anycubic photon). I'm currently brainstorming reasons why a 3D printer would enrich my students' education. So far I have ideas of student-designed models of biological structures, physics projects (like the classic bridge project), and chemistry models. It could also be really cool for the art department!

I really like the idea of using it to open up possibilities for the ""design"" side of learning (hello bloom's taxonomy) and think that this tool would be awesome to have for the classroom. 

So for those of you who have a 3D printer for your school, what have you used it for? For everyone else, what would you use it for if you had one?

teaching,takingtacet,2020/01/30,"How do you kindly shut down a child who blatantly lies? Today I was spraying down the instruments we used in class with Lysol because I got the flu last week from another student because parents won’t keep their hacking, vomiting children at home. I told the kids I don’t want anybody to get sick from using the instruments. Then, unprompted, one of the 4th graders then claimed their friend got the coronavirus.


I almost had a knee-jerk reaction to roll my eyes and say “oh, shut the fuck up.”


I just kind of stared off at the wall and said that only 4 people in the country have it and if he knew any of those 4 people or where they lived I would believe him. It ended there. 


I understand that kids lie. I get it. I did it as a kid too. But I can’t think of a nice way to tell kids they’re lying and to cut it out. I had a first grader once say that she’s eaten a dodo bird when we were talking about them in class. I had already said the whole “all of these animals have been dead for 350 years” and she still insisted she had one for dinner before. I didn’t know what else to say because she was already so up in arms and angry about it.

I recently created an app called Marking Buddy, to help teachers with their marking.

I am looking for some testers to give it a go before final release, to let me know their thoughts.

The quick start guide can be found here:

teaching,Actual_Albatross,2020/01/30,"Future school counselor, here! How do I land a school district job between B.A. and M.A. + Credentials? I have my B.A. in education.  I will be starting a master's program for School &amp; Clinical Counseling this upcoming fall.  Now that I am no longer a full time student, I am trying to find a relevant job on EdJoin that will look good on my resume/CV.

I am finding that I am either overqualified or under qualified for every listing I find.  I am in SoCal and have been looking daily for a month.  Positions are either: 

* Nearly minimum wage, part-time, teaching assistants (HS diploma or AA req.)
* Require a B.A. + *credentials*
* Only open to in-district employees
* Unrelated office staff jobs that require years of clerical experience or people majoring in business/management.

What should I do?  I don't mind having to take a part-time position but I don't want to be paid minimum wage.  I just want to get in a district so I can eventually apply to better jobs from within (since that's where it seems all of the opportunities lie)  I even applied to a position that required only an AA, 17 hrs/wk, and $14/hr.  Meanwhile, I have my B.A. in Education, experience in classrooms, and Certificate of Clearance. I got an email today saying ""Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that the position you applied for will not be filled at this time.""

Should I be looking elsewhere?  What would you do?  I wouldn't mind getting my experience in clinical counseling side of my future career but I wouldn't know where to begin to find an entry-level paid job in that field without credentials/license.",4.021734693877551,6.600720731292517,5.562823129251701,73.88158163265307,74.68027210884354,8.553741496598636,30.568027210884352,9.23628265651192,3.2983210884353733,1261,59,206,32,28,425,158,294,0.031,0.929,0.04,0.669,8,0,0,0,0,0,64.0,1,3,0,6,8,4,0,0,14,0,29,2,0,1,1,38,44,11,0,8,10,0,0,0,0,8,2,1,0,0,13,6,0,3,7,0,4,2,7,1,2,0,4,4,29,3,35,28,5,32,0,1,3,0,7,20,0,4,10,143,42,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11461136617868045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355281834528532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06986594889263077,0.0,0.08912326385651582,0.0,0.0,0.3104161095057521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3867198992886525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11053019198556918,0.0,0.0,0.08872230117122798,0.08460102891239685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5248460542874728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058133302993513186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2664828401246892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2136130178789024,0.0,0.08443168832745247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1608992010638345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22909642571877825,0.0,0.07333375268112467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411960654682714,0.0,0.3211616043606952,0.0,0.09629711444365982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08750137796204206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07487083171521683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07953254917785413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12336102458481997,0.0,0.1002660044972654,0.0,0.0,0.07181691218500216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478224147120452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10196706015827957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514227740351187,0.0,0.0,0.06811812699333503

He once attempted to bake brownies to us, but it turned out stone hard - like a cracker. But he tried.  He listens to everyone and sees each student and tries to help us as best as he is able. His personality is so sweet. 

I can respect if he does switch jobs. I respect that. But I really like him, he lightens up my day.

She jumps into the new Great Leap rejecting all ideas in the past as having failed (fill in the blank) and only the NEW solution will work and conveniently soothe her own soul.  She is a weak (theory and content)  teacher who teaches the new wave of  social-emotional learning because any measurable subject matter identifies her as sympathetic but otherwise ineffective.  She stays employed because she teaches kids do damaged or so behaviorally destructive that everyone looks the other way because they aren't in her class. 

Whenever some Ed.D's research thesis or a guest speaker yet vague expert at PD day appears to be leading a new campaign/ slogan, I ask myself:  

1) what are the assumptions?
2) what will it change and what will be left alone? Does this theory aim at one small goal or group?  
3) how will admin interpret and use it?  Abuse it?  
4) how will students, parents, their lawyers, interpret, use and abuse it? Will it prevent our central task of educating and enriching the next generation?  

I will neither give examples nor answer these questions. I ask you, how do you prevent the latest idea chosen by TPTB from becoming Mao Zedong like propaganda?

teaching,angryoldostrich,2020/01/30,"Would a Masters of Science in Teaching (grade 7-12) Chemistry suit me? I'm 26 (27 later this year) so age is definitely a concern. My resume is pretty weak due to anxiety issues and severe depression after turning down some med school offers. My only real work experience is tutoring at a test prep place since 2016, and this was only part time. My undergrad degree was a BA in Natural Science (a general science degree which covered the basic biological sciences, intro to chem, and intro to physics, with their lab components, the electives were more advanced biology classes like vertebrate anatomy, advanced microbio, microanatomy, etc.)  


I was hoping to pursue Fordham's MST in chemistry since I know there's a larger demand for chem over bio teachers (I might be wrong on that) and I want to stay in New York. This program gets me the initial teaching certificate upon graduation. From your experience, how hard would it be for someone like me to break into teaching? My time as a test prep tutor made me really like teaching and everything else feels pretty dull by comparison.

I work at a very urban high school in the USA and students seem to think that it's okay to leave my class early. It's particularly bad with the class right before lunch and it was easier to just count the number of students who stayed...

Admin told me that I need to call their parents...but I just don't the time to call 20+ parents. We have an online system where we can send messages to parents in mass with pre-scripted phrases, but there's no option that says ""left class early""

What can I besides call 20+ parents?",6.701279761904765,6.081068473214291,6.650714285714287,80.62761904761908,65.16071428571429,8.538095238095236,31.16666666666667,7.1686216300943375,1.8455309523809524,447,14,87,3,6,142,75,112,0.06,0.879,0.061,-0.2374,5,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,2,0,1,1,4,2,0,0,6,1,5,1,0,0,0,14,10,3,0,2,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,6,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,2,1,9,1,12,8,0,14,0,0,0,0,18,8,0,2,3,48,17,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254410291586383,0.0,0.0,0.12784001979261653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4602241572842596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10070022025465228,0.15873289194471515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15907854172378924,0.16323217177093186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22279661502762796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6672784957895577,0.0,0.0,0.10415492895130088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12830097321984424,0.0,0.11947393012046514,0.0,0.15204714910075248,0.0,0.13676947853339907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16013189860714394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626535018498174,0.0,0.0,0.08760399053121629,0.0,0.0,0.14355721605653407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1239606756216667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10937381050305647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,shawnbrose,2020/01/31,"Giving Up on a Student: Understandable and Normal or Concerning and Unacceptable? I'm a second year teacher in San Jose, CA. I have a student who has gotten straight F's his entire educational career, actively disrupts class to obtain attention, has bern involved in multiple fights, abhors female students and harasses them and has generally not responded to any supports given or disciplinary actions from a single educator or admin. Nothing I (or any other teacher, principal or counselor) have tried has helped him control his urges to act out. Positive reinforcement does not work. ""Real talk"" does not work. Planned partnering does not work. His parents are at their wit's end because even strict discipline has not worked. He is simply not interested in being a student or  doing anything other than what he feels like.

I have stopped trying to educate this child. I am content to do whatever is necessary to get him to just shut up and leave me and other students alone since he wastes so much of my educational time by acting out. I have given up on him; abandoned any pretense of being able to get him right and cannot wait until he's gone.

Is this normal for a teacher to do or feel like doing? Am I rotten to the core for letting this kid go?",6.873857350800584,8.065750825327513,7.471423580786028,68.68780494905388,64.76419213973799,9.949461426491997,35.790684133915576,10.047579312681364,3.9423464919941775,1005,47,158,22,15,332,140,229,0.114,0.813,0.07400000000000001,-0.8624,1,1,0,0,1,0,25.0,0,0,2,7,3,8,2,0,7,0,23,0,0,1,0,37,37,16,0,2,14,1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,3,8,9,0,5,5,0,0,5,7,4,0,1,4,3,17,4,29,30,2,24,0,1,0,0,24,14,0,7,7,110,25,11,0.14190092573290722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14696656397921454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28949248646538045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11677237113573102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08650148725000542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15915395429007986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3725353690869928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12568210177317934,0.0,0.0,0.09372422314708126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14349874339263438,0.20274809939346908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14827475390143724,0.13612429811545967,0.08064556620212797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09511319937562822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15025259147494208,0.0,0.14510331064375792,0.0,0.13865124924096062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431350774346336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780655575979368,0.1361577653298551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575641851840174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1615143195502576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12118261524241705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11738191212996668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11863552781555768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16102748891965415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11405458899257738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08274357093187464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1926828279024904,0.0,0.0,0.14772386809288485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4132222558617009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09137954376739237
teaching,Impulse882,2020/01/31,"Online Teaching headaches I’m just so annoyed at the hoops to teach online.

I’m trying to develop a class to teach online - it’s a popular class and I was practically begged to develop it.  I finally said okay, but it can’t be fully online because of the course requirements (i.e. a hands-on lab).  Almost a year is spent arguing with me that there are “lab kits” to send students home with.  I repeatedly - with the help of others who teach this class - have to explain to the online department that these kits are not suitable for our level nor has there been anything done to verify the student is actually doing the work with these kits at home.

They FINALLY say “okay” and let me create a hybrid.

Next we’re required to have weekly online discussions that are graded.  Ugh.

This week I’m told my videos are too long - they should all be 10-15 minutes.  Ugggh.

The kicker is, we’ve been told over and over again our courses are supposed to be as similar to the onsite course as possible.  Yet then we have these requirements that are NOT in line with the onsite courses.  Like are there discussions in my course normally?  Yes.  But I don’t dock points for people who don’t participate.  Some people have social anxiety and would rather learn the subject from reading or listening than talking with a peer (who may not actually understand it and isn’t a good source of information).  We aren’t required to have graded discussions in class, and the online class is supposed to be as close to the experience as possible, yet we’re required to have discussions online.

Then then videos.  My classes run for 80 minutes.  Each class.  And although I have some activities, a lot of it is lecturing.  Yet a 20 minute video is “too long” for the online class, and I need to break it up.  Um, onsite my students have to listen to me for 80 minutes.  If 20 minutes is too long you can at least pause and go back to it later, which my onsite students don’t have the luxury of doing.

and I’ve read that videos should be the length of a “coffee break”....but honestly, I don’t want “coffee break” students.  I question how well they’ll actually learn.  Some people have said, “do you really expect them to recall at the end of an 20 minute video what you said in the first 2 minutes?” Well how much better will they recall that information if it was in the first 2 minutes of a *completely different* video?!

I’ve taken several online classes myself, and I’ve got to say the worst one was when I would put about an hour aside to go through the material and had to click after click after click because all the videos were only about 5 minutes long.  It was so annoying.

Anyway, rant over.....",4.843584665215314,6.260960903732808,5.493013327669518,80.18269739287422,69.6286836935167,8.646121170286198,27.90213986088249,9.068930737419137,2.26848925821696,2096,72,391,40,37,678,217,509,0.051,0.8759999999999999,0.073,0.8056,2,0,0,0,0,0,66.0,4,3,5,9,23,14,3,0,34,3,58,0,0,2,2,62,77,31,0,11,10,0,0,1,0,7,0,7,2,0,26,22,0,5,7,9,1,6,11,5,3,3,17,10,30,9,66,47,10,51,0,0,3,0,37,16,0,10,28,272,56,31,0.0,0.0,0.2955241941051545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10108215021903047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722288873361242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08306939213351867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07762071530580343,0.0,0.12307065266579223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08927792679453944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058392409215596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10546636777350836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10330210344977828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08940758584259333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09874388675288516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2211613141313987,0.0,0.17172806464750642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147390962008878,0.08466813987124691,0.0807351889507701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06766151598329571,0.0,0.20251276057568654,0.0,0.09941080017721887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10322342258279127,0.0,0.04931678136265623,0.0,0.0,0.3573337044862486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582009592760201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07420642053669085,0.0748496710860947,0.0,0.0,0.1073564863926717,0.0,0.09890497477386834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06840315709495272,0.07677345989117829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2099483111006968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954259499203529,0.22760134792430506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10147792162033192,0.11308185384133428,0.0,0.20194526200852775,0.0,0.0646681528527418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2880663289149821,0.16055153031424566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140394716174698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102901035044111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0811360194667884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19291514644483349,0.0,0.06853524182455176,0.0,0.0,0.10508763166095504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0595401614636988,0.0,0.1619444835556429,0.0,0.18152392024584305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07348939067652754,0.0,0.0,0.14341730927754126,0.0,0.0,0.06500547244495268
teaching,Kateban,2020/01/31,"Advice/Help for the edTPA? Hi everyone! I am currently pursuing my MAT in secondary science education (biology) and my state recently just started evaluating teacher candidates using the edTPA. My university isn't entirely prepped or knowledgeable regarding it, despite constant attempts to hold meetings with students and staff. I was hoping I could find more insight and help from anyone who has done their edTPA, and hopefully someone who has submitted an edTPA for biology. 

I have my handbook, my learning segment, etc. and most things planned but this edTPA is so particular and specific, I'm worried I'll do something wrong, fail and have to redo it. Is there anyone who has experience with edTPA who wouldn't mind sharing some insight?",8.185476190476189,10.318436753968255,8.50650793650794,59.01071428571429,62.412698412698404,11.314285714285715,44.158730158730144,11.20814326018867,6.117387301587303,605,38,78,18,9,199,88,126,0.11699999999999999,0.8390000000000001,0.044000000000000004,-0.9121,1,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,3,3,5,0,0,3,0,14,0,0,1,0,26,19,10,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,9,0,1,5,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,10,3,8,15,5,7,0,1,0,0,9,2,0,5,4,59,18,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3000626742507483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2318724034920337,0.0,0.17131554812457395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21957814960045746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23930068059170956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20502946925399088,0.0,0.20988923955548155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19611179098896836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2876415868142855,0.0,0.0,0.4262300203779876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21665309487227252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118605827975167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18180325792325847,0.16518537247689774,0.0,0.0,0.15187274228725645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14254982746933748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18531835726747306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2179048040706164,0.0,0.0,0.23459705403250006,0.0,0.0

teaching,Orian3030,2020/01/31,"Proud of my field trip chaperone I took 100 students on a field trip to the science museum. They all did great, followed the rules and stayed by the chaperones and I didn’t even have to chase them down to get on the bus. 

One meek and mild mannered student accidentally bumped a toddler. Didn’t knock the toddler over, apologized to the toddler, and was Immediately accosted by the mother with a finger in my students chest. I believe there was a little bit of a language barrier.

My parent chaperone (not his mother) immediately jumped in and got him out of that situation. Things got a little heated, but the chaperone did the right thing and asked for the museum to help diffuse the situation. She later reassured the student he did the right thing and said the moms understanding and rationality where overridden by her protective instincts. 

The museum was sorry it happened and glad nothing further happened. Yay for good people who donate time to help with field trips!",7.123275862068965,8.753192419540234,7.290287356321841,68.62094827586209,64.45977011494253,10.397701149425288,34.614942528735625,10.504223727775694,4.033308045977012,787,35,125,20,12,254,103,174,0.044000000000000004,0.82,0.136,0.9582,2,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,2,1,3,6,0,0,21,1,9,2,2,0,1,17,19,10,0,0,2,4,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,12,0,2,1,3,1,6,3,0,0,1,12,2,12,6,23,7,2,22,0,0,0,0,18,13,0,0,2,87,18,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14813770477993515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17852894598472455,0.0,0.0,0.17299610593393874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10466062570387884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08278824832220734,0.0,0.0,0.13290782851513136,0.25346815613341883,0.17470152456065416,0.0,0.0,0.2802494086615493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21242335492563716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31763494362289163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855851781792268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15204561249338364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10737586873757404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1759498842044513,0.0,0.0,0.10985546696882496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706461128154733,0.15073072469619628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3562289424286556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773817936584401,0.0,0.16889613074689366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31581920678241304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923986736397182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17605369647661473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16496132959924215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’m looking for a strategy book that I can use as a reference when planning. Much less on the conceptual side, much more of ready to implement strategies and protocols that can be used right away.

teaching,Mythos_92,2020/02/01,Lucy Calkin's Units of Study I found this article today about the Units of Study and I agreed with *a lot* of these points. I have 7 students in my classroom with IEPs and it is so hard to help them with their goals while also teaching them the curriculum. It is way over their writing levels at the moment and there are few opportunities to help them with the skills they actually need. I was curious if anyone had any thoughts about Lucy Calkin's curriculum for reading and writing or any advice for helping struggling students?,7.18242424242424,7.825989414141418,6.2207575757575775,79.85113636363639,63.94949494949496,9.024242424242424,32.66161616161617,8.841846274778883,2.576325252525253,428,16,78,6,6,129,67,99,0.045,0.809,0.146,0.8577,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,6,3,5,2,0,1,5,0,6,0,0,0,0,16,9,9,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,11,1,16,5,2,9,0,0,0,0,11,5,0,3,3,54,15,6,0.0,0.0,0.23426698793691594,0.0,0.0,0.2345869148330075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919784004426402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3265023246264298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16785772409023747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632168340146839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.215049413643928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4827277724919831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20409309063469852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17800377102629686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22693725560999825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2401280971366193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25096610953331416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19058331200686274,0.0,0.0,0.2275517799007744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19055094067341105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,coolpuddytat,2020/02/01,"Teaching Algebra I teach junior Science and I am always running into the issue of using formulas with some students who haven't figured out Algebra yet. What I mean is that unless they are given a ""triangle"" (which I don't want to do) or separate formulas - solved for each variable, some students can't seem to figure out how to rearrange the equation (which I definitely don't want to do).

So rather than just moving on and hoping that they will somehow figure out algebra by the time we start using these formulas, I usually give a crash course on how to rearrange these formulas and have them practice. I first highlight the meaning of that equal sign - that in order for it to be true, whatever you do to one side, you do to the other. Then we go through a bunch of different ways to isolate the variable including creating a fraction equal to 1, etc.

What are the most effective ways you have found to do this? Any hands-on or gameified methods of teaching algebra that are actually effective?

teaching,teachmusicrun,2020/02/01,"Resources for a resource teacher? Hello everyone!

I am a resource teacher in Ontario, fresh out of teacher's college. I am having a bit of difficulty with fulfilling the requirements of my role in a way that I feel is satisfactory. Let me explain.

There are less than 200 students in my school, 30 of whom have reading/writing based individual education plans. It is my responsibility to make sure these 30 students are getting the accommodations they need in their classes. It is almost entirely integrated classroom support. Mostly what I've been doing so far is having students in my office to write tests so they can be accommodated, doing decoding sessions with small groups of struggling readers, and being a general floater during language and math classes. 

The problem is that a number of teachers wave me off when I come into their room. I show up for a language block (they know I am coming) and they say ""Oh, I don't need you today, we're just doing a read-aloud"" or something along those lines. I completely understand that I won't always be needed in their classes. I don't want to step on toes by pushing the matter. But then I have an unexpected prep with nothing to do. And I already have plenty of preps on top of that. No teachers have asked me to modify tests/ assignments or do anything for them or their students, and I've expressed multiple times how happy I would be to take some things off another teacher's plate. No bites. 

I sit in my office and feel LAZY. I didn't know that was possible as a teacher! I fill my preps with researching reading/writing disabilities and making language and math games that I could hypothetically use if those teachers let me :p 

 I'm trying to be proactive, make the most out of the job and take initiative for the sake of the students who would benefit from the extra support. It feels like the classroom teachers think it's too much trouble to have to explain to me what I need to do for them. 

Also challenging to get to know the learning needs of 30 students when the teacher's barely let me in their class :/ I honestly feel like I'm being annoying to them at this point.

teaching,dont-know-1,2020/02/02,"I wanna talk to people that understand me Hello,
I’m a new teacher. 2nd year. The school that I work at is a start up. It’s only a few years old. Less than 5. There aren’t any real policies and procedures in place. I was observed the other day and my principal used that as way to say that I am on his intensive coaching list. Here’s the deal... I want to get better. I do. But last year (my first year) I wasn’t coached at all and you all know how your first year is. Literally drowning. Now, I’m half way thru my second year and I still haven’t been coached. Now I’m on an intensive list?! And lest be honest he’s not gonna fuckin come in anyway. So then I’ll be stuck being mediocre, again. There’s no peer mentoring. No one can cover my class so I can watch others. It’s literally sink or swim.

I have lost my love for this.

teaching,cheezwhiz17,2020/02/02,"First year and I'm ready to leave mid-year. How will my resume look? This is my first year teaching and I'm beyond in over my head. I took a job in an urban rust belt school (completely different demographic than what I grew up in) because I did my student teaching in the district and thought I could handle it, but here I am halfway through the year still crying in the bathroom. My education background is pretty solid: BA in elementary education, and MA in environmental education (largely informal). My current position is a traditional gen ed elementary job. I got a job offer last week for an informal education job doing environmental outreach work, and even though it's a pay cut, I'm extremely tempted to take it.

The problem I'm experiencing in my current teaching job is not even really related to the job, technically speaking. I'm past the ""I'm a terrible teacher, I'm inadequate, I can't do this"" crap; I am a good teacher by my own standards and by the standards of my administrators. The part that's killing me is the emotional toll the job is taking on me. I waste countless hours in a week putting out fires (my third graders jumping each other in the bathroom, kicking the puke out of each other because someone bumped into the other in line, kids yelling and spitting at me and each other, constant disruption of my lessons), and trust me when I say I know this is not unique, especially in urban education. Yes, I have a very supportive administration, but frankly it's not enough. I am still very green behind the ears and I know that leaving this job would be a pretty big indicator of a lack of maturity on my part, but I don't know if I can survive the rest of the year, and I mean that very literally. I have bipolar 2 disorder (recently diagnosed, originally thought it was major depression) that I'm still trying to learn to navigate. Until the diagnosis, I didn't know anything about the condition, so trying to educate myself on the condition while also living it and working a soul-sucking job is incredibly difficult. Suicide has been very heavy on my mind for the last month. I can barely eat and forcing myself to do so makes me sick, and as such I've lost nearly 10 pounds in the last month. I piece out and distribute so many little parts of myself to these tiny, broken, abused humans that there is nothing left for me to nurture and care for for myself; I feel that I've completely lost any and all logical attachment to the job and now I'm too emotionally wrapped up in it to separate work from home. I absolutely love teaching, but right now I'm hating it, hating myself and hating my students, and I'm genuinely afraid this job will kill me.

The job offer I got allows me space to detach myself from those close emotional relationships with kiddos which I think will give me some breathing room to finally learn how to take better care of myself. I know that my issues right now are not *caused* by my current job, but the current job is exacerbating them horrifically. I also know that taking the new offer wouldn't make all my problems disappear and might even make new ones appear. Another big benefit of this job is that it would allow me to pursue the real fulfilling passions in my life (environment, conservation, natural sciences). The new offer place needs my answer in three days. If I accept then I start immediately, leaving my classroom and students behind. If I decline, I burn a very valuable bridge and likely lose any opportunity to work with this employer again.  **My biggest concern right now is this: If I take the new job offer, how the heck would I ever get hired back as a formal educator if my resume shows that I couldn't even make it through my first year at my first teaching job?** I'm good at my job. I'm state certified. I have a master's degree as an early twenty-something. Should I suck it up and force myself through the trenches in my current job, or take the new offer and run? I know trying to decide which $30k+ job to take is such a first-world issue, but I genuinely don't know what to do and I need some help.

My friend's mother is Chinese and unable to return home due to the virus. She usually teaches a class in her home but because she is unable to return home was going to ask her students to install an app and try to teach them from America the Midwest. My question is do any of you have recommendations for a good meeting app paid or unpaid that you know works well from the US to China?

Thanks so much.

teaching,theloralae7,2020/02/02,"[Advice] Mid Year HS Switch HS Science teacher switching schools midyear - looking for some advice! Background info below, questions at the end, sorry if its long!

Experience: This is my 8th year teaching, all at the high school level. This is my first year back in MI after teaching 5 years in GA. All my evaluations, feedback, etc. in GA was fantastic and supportive - showed growth each year, was moving forward  in becoming an assessment and curriculum writer/leader in district before moving to MI. 

Previous school: Detroit Charter School - was hired in as a teacher leader, but my role was not utilized in the building and my administration was unsupportive of what I needed to be successful. One admin was condescending and belittling on several occasions, including hinting to me that I should leave teaching all together. 

How it went down: After Christmas I started applying other places. Last week I interviewed on Tuesday and got a job offer on Thursday. Within one hour of the job offer, I was forced to resign and had to clean out my room by Friday. I'm currently in limbo as I don't have a firm start date for my new job - hopefully this week some time. 

Situation: My new students will have had a sub for 1-2 weeks of second semester. I will have 9th grade and either 10th or 11th/12th mixed.

Questions: What do I need to prioritize my first several days? Any advice for ensuring a ""fresh start"" and not bringing poor habits from my old school? Anything to be ready for with a midyear switch?",6.236115241635687,8.141784089219335,6.368511152416358,73.35945817843869,66.84386617100371,9.246171003717473,34.26784386617101,9.642632912329526,3.622353011152416,1196,56,191,26,20,381,165,269,0.035,0.856,0.109,0.9659,5,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,0,0,3,2,4,0,0,11,0,21,0,0,1,3,30,33,14,0,5,6,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,9,11,0,0,3,1,1,6,3,1,0,5,11,1,19,3,39,17,8,57,0,1,1,0,6,23,0,7,30,127,28,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791423237422376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647525585334709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07835757559078664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321795562449114,0.0,0.0,0.10516251084398656,0.08102482294283148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061408731784463814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843362577493078,0.0,0.10619496727949354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09314299011519124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16198739946294705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07615577180194352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060468142830307,0.0,0.09457449714655426,0.09377207524170507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834721292776876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0776166412141213,0.0,0.10082375376727126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426630447533713,0.07996043949884657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20240662276614016,0.0,0.14120817811323855,0.0,0.18392726753818367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991689901712687,0.0,0.12904646139943232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09948416225094547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2133353737818741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4818363355557887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21514197439260235,0.0,0.0,0.1070307626121068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10659048935962596,0.202190660611112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080540157958262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055523284753803206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2291381359452958,0.0,0.0,0.08826947588139347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065913382833621
teaching,MsLauryn,2020/02/02,"Looking for suggestions for continuing education programs or certifications  Some background if it helps: I am currently part-time subbing/staying home with my young kids. My husband is military and I've just decided this works the best for the family until we move again and I'll work on getting the next states teaching license once we do and try to work then. But previous to the the kids and break from teaching, I got my bachelors degree in Elementary Ed, along with a teaching license then taught 3rd grade for a few years. 

I've been feeling the itch to refresh my knowledge and go ""back to school"" or something similar for a little bit now, but don't think we can afford me to dedicate the time or money to a full-on masters degree right now. I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on additional certifications or programs/course work they've done that really benefited them in the classroom and looked good professionally.  

I've always really loved the child development side of the profession and always find myself picking up books about that or history/social studies (but in elementary ed, I'm not sure how much going into specific content areas would help as much as it might anyone in secondary ed - except reading/language development maybe). I've also just felt out of the game these last two years and really feel like any advice or direction would be helpful as I'm feeling rather lost in all the options.

However, I did apply and get into Lakehead Orillia campus for the Primary/Junior section and I am having trouble deciding if I should just wait the year and apply for Brock next year to avoid having to pay rent + transportation fees etc, or if I should just go to Lakehead so that I can graduate a year earlier. I was just hoping for some insight into anyone who has had to make any similar decisions. Does it really matter what school you go to? I would still choose to do my Practicum in Hamilton but I know that's only in the second year and in the first year you have to do it in the Simcoe school board. I appreciate any insight! Thank you all!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Should I just go to Lakehead- orillia now and deal with having to pay for housing and food etc or just wait a year and apply to Brock?",5.076235294117649,5.953638819607848,5.669411764705885,81.13235294117648,68.64705882352942,8.509803921568627,30.68627450980393,8.671277953709913,2.381039215686275,1029,40,195,16,17,333,132,255,0.035,0.907,0.057999999999999996,0.7617,3,1,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,3,0,2,14,5,0,1,10,0,29,2,0,1,1,54,41,20,0,13,14,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,1,0,13,12,1,3,10,0,4,5,2,3,0,3,7,0,23,2,32,26,7,34,0,0,0,0,7,11,0,12,17,147,36,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12363226846812753,0.13864955822988084,0.15519005908319305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07978457779416857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695570949751632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763681519528435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09985368989205756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531973787087754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25451354540567783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19411460074116735,0.13797571520245078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059614935346331714,0.0,0.19454479290401594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333159748699667,0.0,0.13166136929732528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541778991497532,0.0,0.3861448204462021,0.0,0.0,0.11667966737367105,0.08059544174620327,0.0,0.0,0.10075643765677014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07616569547251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212751142862954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135151896030312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0867816774438359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11921500375607345,0.12525256763686302,0.0,0.0,0.10928064950060927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278232474962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07309831795662199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309598603572704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112406771775884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10505216998307954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06730183965162595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16211324448875794,0.12475544953717008,0.13864955822988084,0.5143572746179155

**Here is a review from Derrick Smythe, author of The Other Magic:**

*Hilarious, helpful, and real. The absolute best book about teaching you will ever read, unless Lanious decides to write more.*

*I remember harboring feelings of total betrayal when reflecting upon my college education program as I struggled through my first few years of teaching. I have since determined that most of the educational authors and professors had either never actually been classroom teachers themselves, or they were so far removed from the reality of the modern classroom that their strategies were limited to pure idealism and wishful thinking. There were of course exceptions...but not many.*

*Lanious however, has truly captured the essence of what it is to maintain a healthy, balanced, and fulfilling life in one of the highest turnover professions in the nation. Instead of being grounded in theory alone, his tips come from years of experience in the field. Plus, it's written in a humorous tone that makes you feel like you're sitting across from him at your local coffee shop, during which he is likely telling you how much money you're wasting every day by buying coffee at that place.*

*If you are looking for practical, real-life strategies to help you maintain your sanity as a teacher and human, look no further than Best Teacher Life, by Eric Lanious.*

teaching,Pretty-Bison,2020/02/03,"Interested in becoming a teacher but unsure of the best way to get there A bit of a backstory... I graduated 3 years ago with a Bachelors in Economics and decided to put career pursuits on hold and travel for awhile. I've recently relocated back home to Ohio in hopes of starting to get serious about my career and recently developed an interest in teaching. So now I'm trying to figure out what's the best route to get there.

I've already researched quite a bit and I'm leaning towards a Masters plus licensure program since it seems like most states and districts eventually require a masters degrees.  However, it could be a bit risky since I'm still not sure if teaching is something that I 100% want to do. I'm also having a difficult time deciding where to do this. I'm an Ohio resident so it would make more sense to find a program here for in state for tuition and obviously way easier to stay with my family versus trying to pay rent and work full time while studying. Unfortunately, I don't see myself living in Ohio but I'm not sure where exactly which state I would prefer just yet. 

So I guess my main question is, would it make more sense to just suck it up and stay in Ohio for a program, get my teaching license here, and then try to transfer over to another state.  Or would it be smarter to stay in Ohio and try to get some experience first and then look towards other states. Or another idea would be to find a program in a state that I'd be interested in and pay out of state tuition/go to a private school and get my license there.  I'm also a bit curious about the process and ease of transferring pension/retirement when moving states.  

Any insight and advice would be super helpful!

They pick up the receiver and say goofy stuff like ""Dominoes Pizza?"" and ""Hi mom..."" Today, the kids were getting ready to go to their next class, and one student (who has a referral rap sheet a mile long) picked up the reciever and yelled at the top of his lungs to my ENTIRE class of 24 kids ""Mrs. --- is a child abuser!!!"" 

What??! I almost cried and in front of everyone, gave him a spiel about how adults have feelings too, and he hurt my feelings, and how it makes me sad that he can make up an awful and hurtful lie about me and tell it to everyone like that. What did I do to deserve that? Teaching is my job, my career, and I do it because I love kids and I love teaching. How could he try to get me fired like that?! Blah blah blah.

I sent him to principal. He made him write an apology letter and he'll miss one recess. The student brought me the apology note (2 sentences) and said ""Mr. ---- told me I had to apologize."" Oh so heartfelt...

teaching,waterfae9,2020/02/04,"Why can’t parents, be parents Sorry for any mistakes I’m on my phone. And just took my melatonin for the night. But I just got the most frustrating e-mail!

I teach 3rd grade and for the most part 
haha a very mature class. I have one student who likes to cry when he can’t handle something. Now we have gone several weeks with out an incident. Today he cried one bc he couldn’t remember what he did over the weekend for share. He started to cry so bad I legit thought something horrible had happened! It was completely Unacceptable. And he yelled at another student trying to help him During math.  “Bc he didn’t want help” Then he cried when I told him that was not acceptable. 
I emailed his mom and she pretty much blamed the other kid for trying to help. Then said I don’t know what to do.
I don’t know how about teach your child crying won’t get him shit.

It doesn’t help that I’m a hard ass. I’ve caught on to this and if he is crying due to something trivial. I make him take a “time out” until he can act like a 3rd grader again. Here he is prepared to get his way and instead he gets in trouble. 
I can’t teach your kid math and reading ect if your not helping with the emotional end.  Parents just act like it’s all out job to get their kid prepared for life. Your 9 year old crying all the time is not normal bro. 

Ugh sorry I just really needed to rant.

teaching,Emaedennis,2020/02/04,"Parents Proud of “Self Defense” I’m a middle school elective teacher. I don’t have many problems in the classroom, but I have a bone to pick with parents and am curious about some other points of view. 

Came across a Facebook post by a parent of a child that goes to my school. Parent is ENRAGED that his kid is suspended for three days because of fighting. He claims his son was “defending” himself by punching a student multiple times in retaliation to having been smacked in the head twice. Parent claims that the other student was twice his son’s size and was being a “bully”. Parent outright tells principal that he is proud of his son and hopes if it happens again that his son does worse to teach the “bully” a lesson. 

Can we PLEASE stop telling our kids it’s ok to get in a fight if it’s “self defense”? Throwing a punch is never self defense. Self defense is getting out of the way of danger, and if the attacker gets hurt in reaction to your move, it’s not your fault. All these parents claim their kids are “bullied” and only retaliate in “self-defense”. If your kid hurt someone, they deserve to be punished. IT IS NEVER OK TO HURT SOMEONE. You can stand up for yourself by physically blocking an attack. You can stand up for yourself by publicly calling attention to the situation to get an adult involved. YOU CAN STAND UP FOR YOURSELF BY GETTING HELP. 

And all these adults who say they are proud of their kids for “defending” themselves, or tell their kids they won’t get in trouble for fighting back, are making it IMPOSSIBLE for us to give appropriate consequences to only instigators.

This is a common thought process that I have seen throughout my six years of teaching. Not only did this Facebook post have 67 comments, ALL of which were in support of the parent, but in my home room where we have social and emotional lessons I have had countless students tell me that their parents have taught them similar ideals: they’re not allowed to “start” a fight, but if someone hits/kicks/hurts then, they’re allowed to do so back with full parental support. 

Am I crazy? Isn’t throwing a punch always a BAD THING? Isn’t defending yourself considered blocking or removing yourself from the situation, and if the attacker gets hurt then it’s not your fault because you didn’t physically involve yourself in the altercation? The phrase we shove down our students throats is SE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING, not see something DO something...

I don’t have more specifics about this student’s altercation. I don’t recognize the last name of the parent as one of my student’s, and I have no frame as to when it happened, where it happened, and who was around at the time. We have 1300 students in just 7th and 8th grade. 

Obviously the Facebook post is a one-sided rant with heavy bias, but I’m curious if 1) you’ve noticed similar issues with the current generation of students/parents, and 2) what you do as a teacher to try and reiterate positive defense behaviors.

teaching,slopnessie,2020/02/04,"Need advice about an awkward student and want to nip it in the bud before I continue with the semester. Hey all,

First time coming to the subreddit for advice on a situation.

This is the first time in my very short career that I have encountered a situation like this, and was hoping that I could maybe get some pointers.

Bob, lets call him that, had my class for the first time ever today. My class is a 9th grade requirement that deals with aspects of the community. We talk about ourselves, community, research into topics within our county that interest them. So today was Day 1, and immediately Bob leaps into my introduction of the course. he said ""I heard this was a response to a right wing hate group that sprouted up at this school a couple of years ago and that is why we have this course"" He is right that there was an extremely racist happening at our school a few years ago, but the course creation was completely irrelevant to the topic. I could tell in the moment that I had responded to him that a few ""popular"" kids were snickering at his little interruption rant.

Fast forward and we have about 10 times he has interrupted or asked a series of detailed questions or said something awkward in front of the class (one of which being really personal to the point of discomfort). To top it off, the class is probably my one bad egg out of the bunch. Lower level kids with Low energy, already a few have less than a 5% interest in the topic. I just know now that Bob is not going to help this class buy into what we will be discussing and doing.

What I'm actually worried about is Bob's well being in the class. What steps should I take towards making sure he understands that he shouldn't jump in randomly or go into long details without stomping on his personality. And How should I address the near 50% of the class that was snickering every time he talked. I would talk to the parents, but I'm not even sure if Bob can comprehend that the way he talks is being laughed at.

How do you tread lightly around the situation? Is basically what I'm asking.",6.75224784815714,6.961449936548224,7.1137122048113,74.57197417788568,64.86294416243655,10.405473405429266,31.85124696534981,10.176274734539398,3.1026604723019213,1641,58,303,35,23,535,206,394,0.079,0.845,0.076,-0.3667,2,0,1,0,0,0,38.0,6,1,1,5,14,15,1,3,34,0,38,1,0,3,4,53,59,16,0,10,10,1,0,1,1,5,0,3,1,4,27,21,1,1,3,0,1,7,4,6,1,5,12,4,27,9,53,35,7,61,0,1,0,0,43,33,0,8,23,215,54,14,0.0,0.0,0.09311531337100994,0.0,0.0,0.1864849527437133,0.16916661544202413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10529739046623013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08494326199374637,0.1784080249837123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07967099376493142,0.0,0.0,0.0811946576659992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09743360741270428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08219513756859545,0.1000451497570528,0.0,0.0,0.15236883319458586,0.10557946022919336,0.0,0.06153744955988005,0.0983729404437306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06302344009287529,0.08631207229763174,0.08039473834635187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434904076534565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04985256082159413,0.0,0.10845778902471703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08437882775427691,0.0,0.0,0.09420664313796052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395743620605603,0.0,0.0,0.09477273310632853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05243986228889662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757253246349837,0.0,0.0466169705489425,0.09563504281667612,0.0,0.08444293361160854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369301491318258,0.0,0.09586134835624403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07075208106059935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12931695344435798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10595165958478127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666326199440588,0.0,0.0,0.09020192668961224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10287796838089748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10689127117555616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0611279425318199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1629748433346448,0.18153090016725051,0.0,0.0,0.1931385217297933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217653238003045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07345831344746356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17986281483440295,0.0,0.07174331599284757,0.30677715174703224,0.08340053153805667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781983307299345,0.0,0.18089236968631195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09933468679094272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873078115503004,0.05628067924834732,0.07573926958382772,0.0,0.0,0.08579326357292186,0.0,0.08610092967751523,0.0,0.0,0.0919806430627291,0.0,0.0,0.09690276541505602,0.0,0.06778301724149284,0.0,0.0,0.12289359162360527
teaching,WellJenial,2020/02/05,"I was told I ""overstepped the process"" for student teaching placements by my grad school...? Just trying to get some opinions and feedback!

 I switched careers in the summer. I started a masters of elementary education program (mostly online) with a school in PA. However, I live out of state. 

I started subbing this year. I was quickly offer d a LT Sub position at a school from October through Feb. This week, the principal offered me another LT Sub assignment to stay through the end of the year (yay!!) 

My student teaching is scheduled for next Fall, 2020. My student teaching application required by my school requires us to list the top 6 schools we prefer to do student teaching. I also have an email from my advisor stating to ""list any schools you jave formed a working relationship as #1 if possible."" I spoke with my current principal at school A to ask if our building accepted student teachers. She said yes. I asked her if I could student teach there. She said yes.  I asked her if I could list our school as my #1 choice. She said yes. I did so an submitted my application last month. 

Two weeks ago, I received an interview to be a LT Sub at school B for next fall. My college confirmed I could use this as assignment as my student teaching if the school B principal agreed. Unfortunately, the principal decided she did not want to assign me a coordinating teacher, and fulfill student teaching obligations required - she just wanted a regular LT sub for hire.

Where it gets frustrating - my college emailed me to tell me school B would not agree and I had.to choose a different school. I emailed them back stating to move forward with my #1 school on my application - which is the school I currently work in, school A. I stated that I already had a ""verbal agreement"" with my principal that student teachers were accepted there, and she's be happy to have me. 

I get a scathing response from my college saying I ""over stepped the process"" and never does a student teaching candidate coordinate their own student teaching placement with a principal. She went on to write that by ""doing what you've done"" she will be flexible and communicate with my current school, but reiterated that ""all you should have done was submit your application and let me do the rest."" 

I replied very calmly and factually stating that I'm following the list of schools as stated on my application. I also clarified that by ""verbal agreement with my principal,"" I simply met I've asked my principal if the school accepts student teachers. I think my college may have misinterpreted that as stated in the email. 

Personally, I feel like she's being a total cunt. Why WOULDN'T I talk to my principal about it first???

teaching,yess5ss,2020/02/05,"Is teaching in the suburbs really that much better? First year 7th grade math teacher here. 22 years old, white man, teaching in a rough inner city school. Earned a degree in math, not math education, so I had no student teaching. My first day in a classroom as a teacher was the first day of school this year.

I'm so mentally exhausted. I've figured some things out, and it's gotten better, but I am on the verge of giving up. I have three blocks, and my second two blocks are great (relatively). It didn't start out this way, but I've gotten to the point where they listen, are actively engaged, and they seem to respect me. We all genuinely have a good time in those classes.

My first block, however, is awful. Pretty much the polar opposite. This is my ""low class"". They never listen, never are on task, constantly talk back, want to yell at me, cuss at me, just because I move them or tell them to stop talking. I hate teaching this class. Every day is like going to battle. I find myself not wanting to come into work because I am going to have to deal with some type of attitude at 8 AM. Yesterday and today really set it off because I had to deal with my first class for 4 hours each day (we couldn't switch because of testing).

However, if all of my classes were like my 2nd and 3rd ones, I'd be happy. It just so happens that the AP of a middle school out in the suburbs reached out to me about a math position that'll be opening up next year. Great school apparently, in a really wealthy area. A month ago I would've told you that I'd never leave this school because the administration here is so wonderful and these kids need me. Today I almost quit (and it's only noon). I don't know what to do. 

I want to stay because I have an amazing administration that is very supportive of me. I also want to stay because I feel like these students need help because they come from bad situations. I also want to stay because I'm a very loyal person. 

I want to leave because I am miserable for half of the day. I wish my entire day could be teaching and not baby sitting/arguing/getting cussed out. I am wondering if the suburbs are actually better to teach in, or if it'll just be more of the same with rich helicopter parents to go along with it.

teaching,drowningalaska30,2020/02/05,"I want to quit So I’m about 6 weeks into student teaching at a high school and I don’t know if I can make it.

I have taken over the whole course load already and two of the classes just do not respect me at all. No matter what I do they do not listen, they do not respond, and they mock me etc. I have tried so many techniques and I don’t know what to do at this point.

I have an extended class split into two where its the kids who are failing English and they are so unmotivated to do anything because they do not get a grade in the class. They respond to NOTHING that I do or tell them to do.

The kids have no motivation and just sit on their phones the whole time and we aren’t allowed to take them.

I feel miserable at this placement and like I’m drowning. I want to cry every day with how they behave and I don’t know how to make it through the rest of this.

The school culture is off apparently because all the teachers complain about how there is no discipline from admin, the teachers say they don’t know how to get through to the students and reach them, and at this point like I said I’m lost.

Please help me or provide some advice or insight. I want to finish but I don’t know if I can.

I’m also making every lesson and making all major decisions with little to no help from my cooperating teacher which I know I will have to do eventually but right now its so much to handle with everything going on + edTPA

teaching,treeisfree100,2020/02/05,"Has anyone else ever accidentally ventured out of our teacher culture world? I took a job in corporate and am running back. I. Had. No. Idea. This was like a year ago and I'm still learning how much I didn't know about non-teacher types.  Omg...it was so scary and confusing...real serious culture shock.  It even took me awhile to figure out what was wrong, I thought I was like sick or something.  

Since IT happened, I've been googling stuff and finding out that we are so so different than everyone else.  O.O Yesterday I told my cousin that I just read online some adults actively enjoy breaking the rules.  When I read it and even as I say it now, it feels like oh yeah of course so obvious.  But I guess it was something I never thought a lot about and none of my friends were like this.  I did not know it was like all that.  

It got worse, then my cousin was like I am one of those people and told me all these irresponsible things he has fun doing sometimes.  I had an inner anurisem watching him just tell his daughter the answers for her chemistry assignment instead of teaching it to her.  I guess I was really isolated before...ready to re-isolate forever.  Saw a post on here about a teacher who was working on not burning too hard to help her students.

teaching,cahrisstie,2020/02/05,"My students found my hobby instagram  So over the weekend my students found my cosplay instagram. For the most part the cosplays are fun and reserved, but I had 2 posts (out of like 30) that included somewhat more revealing outfits. One had a little bit of cleavage, whereas the other was a body-positivity post while I was in 1950's-style lingerie. Basically, this instagram was hidden (atleast I thought it was), but somehow one of my students dug and found it. They screenshotted and sent my pictures all around school, and even sent it to the principal. Basically I got told it is all my fault and faced pretty bad judgement about my ""hobby"" (was told I was objectifying women), and though I wasn't fired, and that I had to delete it to keep my job. I'm pretty bummed about this situation on multiple fronts. For one, that the students didn't face any disciplinary action as many false statements were said about me and went out of their way to find my private life, and two that my reputation is forever tarnished at the school where I have no coming back. 

I'm curious about unbiased opinions on this situation, along with anyone has similar stories they have experienced/know someone who has? Because I'm feeling pre-demotivated right now to teach and that I can never recover from this.",9.039519774011305,8.45647809322034,8.580000000000005,68.57672316384182,60.4406779661017,11.76497175141243,40.42937853107345,11.038039088145766,4.539495480225988,1034,49,177,23,12,330,142,236,0.051,0.8540000000000001,0.095,0.8843,1,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,3,0,12,4,0,0,9,0,20,3,2,0,3,34,37,16,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,16,16,0,1,8,1,0,6,4,2,0,4,23,3,24,2,27,14,7,25,0,0,0,0,10,11,0,4,6,128,40,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09081273081734596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09337525134536284,0.0,0.0,0.118880157750177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10268509300194424,0.11150149034287976,0.08140559749422963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579262105804155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11503409088729732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08820283474340122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06752254392913809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12205441960489702,0.0,0.0,0.4392637544860147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680525621643594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13251923297624313,0.11869773150697542,0.0,0.0,0.07339086061659073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09432423957618942,0.0652415822352294,0.13384356462939226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13539001868456468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029953596650494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714733246240773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446123218696358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2557914924518083,0.2717192240667234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140436252987278,0.12702845135617205,0.0,0.0,0.2703020509450671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3002122558367891,0.0,0.0,0.11314919422336485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13120374673299814,0.10601695428269843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.255209059542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13045054273962234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10599894688140774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12379421499556185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was thinking SeeSaw, but they can’t draw over and voice-over on a video, only photos.


Example:
The video would be a time-lapse of a life cycle of a plant. Students will interact with the videos and record their own, explaining the features, by drawing over and using a voice-over on the video.

teaching,dissresearchmap,2020/02/06,"[delete if not allowed] Survey about minor attraction - 18+ England residents Hello everyone, I am conducting a questionnaire as part of my third year university dissertation project, and I am looking for participants who currently reside in England and are over 18 years old. Teachers are a key group that I'd like to look at. 

The aim of the research is to explore the public’s attitudes towards non-offending minor attracted persons. In doing this, it will help inform the academic topic area and further research.

teaching,forsellingtoys,2020/02/06,"Bad feeling about a job offer I have a bad feeling about a job offer that I accepted. 

Throwaway account just in case. On January 30th I applied for a teaching position at Westside K-8 in Kissimmee, FL. On the 4th I got an email telling me that my voicemail was full. I emailed the principal back and forth and we set up a time to talk about a potential opening during the 2020-2021 school year.  And on the 5th, I called her and after an approximately 10 minute phone interview she offered me the job. She told me that it would be a contingency contract granted that I passed a background check and drug test. I accepted and am now regretting it. 

This all seems waaaay too fast for me and that if they needed a teacher that bad that I’m walking into a disaster. I’d be relocating from CO for this job and it would be my first full time teaching job. Is it worth taking it for the experience? It’s a title 1 school and she told me on the phone that many of the students cannot speak English and that many live in hotels, which gives me visions of the Florida Project.

teaching,Jjennings5,2020/02/06,"Help with the most difficult decision of my career I want to leave teaching after this school year (4 years at this school, 6 years total).  I have been networking and preparing to step into training or education management not at a school. 

I applied for an education coordinator at the local aquarium, and had a great interview with them yesterday. They were very clear about their interest in me, and were visibly disappointed when I said I’m under contract until the end of May and want to finish the school year. It really felt like I had the job until that moment bc they reacted so strongly and were clearly thrown off as they told me they respect that, but would want me to start sooner. 

I offered to unofficially do some front work and the hiring guy said he would see if we could work something out. 

I’m thinking there are 2 probable outcomes here: 1 is that I am not offered the position. 2 is that they offer me the position, but only if I break my contract and quit before the year is over. 

I have such respect for my school and my students. Quitting mid-year is the absolute worst case scenario, but this job would be a dream.  I’ve put my whole life into teaching. If they offer the job, do I ruin my teaching reputation and screw over my (amazing) coworkers who I love as dear friends, or do I turn down an amazing job to finish out the year in a career I know I want to leave?

Non-teachers won’t understand.

teaching,KenAdams1967,2020/02/07,"What are your thoughts on shooting threats in primary grades? 6 year old student has threatened “I’m gonna bring a gun to school and shoot you”, which, wouldn’t scare me since I’m an adult and I have been told there’s no gun in her house, but she’s saying it to other kids, and it’s not fair for them to try to judge the probability of it happening.  I assured the girl she threatened that she’s safe here, which I believe is true.

The specificity is bordering concerning, though, it’s not “I’m going to get my mom’s gun from her night stand”, but there are extra steps involved, as opposed to just, “I’m going to shoot you.”

teaching,make-that-monet,2020/02/07,"Those of you who do lessons teaching students about determining appropriate/academic/“good” sources, what resources do you use? Is the CRAAP test generally regarded pretty well? I work in a college classroom as an assistant, and the students (freshman composition) are starting a semester-long research project. Several of them were asking about how to find good sources, and how to evaluate sources for presence of bias, validity, usefulness, etc—just overall “good”-ness of a source.

Does anyone who does lessons on this have any input? I know many instructors I’ve met use the CRAAP test, but I’m wondering if there’s a better way to evaluate sources that I’m just not aware of?

If you are any teacher of the sort within elementary to secondary it would be greatly appreciated if you could help me find information on my project, also I’m in grade 8 so please try to keep what you say  in a form that’s descriptive and simple.

teaching,elemenop512,2020/02/07,"how to manage a student who wants all of my attention? To start this off, I want to clarify that I am not myself a teacher, simply a college volunteer who is planning on entering the teaching program at my school (waiting on the results from my application now!) and I work with a kindergarten class for about an hour once a week. I worked with them last semester and while they can be very energetic, they’re a great bunch overall. One student is very sweet but she latched onto me from the first time I worked with her. She began needing to hold my hand at all times and to read with me after I already worked with her and was working with other students. She won’t even really let me get my own coat on my own. When I gently tell her to let go or to let me work with others, she tends to pout and even cried once. I’ve tried asking her to let me treat the other students like I treat her and to be kind and patient but it doesn’t work. I know I’m just there as a volunteer so it isn’t my place to discipline too much but I know this isn’t great for her or her classmates. What can I do to help manage her dependency?",4.742467532467534,4.780005995670994,5.45452380952381,85.34464285714287,69.12987012987013,8.504761904761907,29.054112554112557,8.192908349453996,1.7438865800865802,879,29,190,11,14,286,127,231,0.013999999999999999,0.8109999999999999,0.175,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,2,9,10,7,0,0,12,0,17,1,1,3,2,35,30,17,0,3,7,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,11,14,0,3,3,1,0,2,5,0,0,2,2,2,38,7,34,21,6,22,0,0,0,0,19,8,0,3,13,143,49,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12658555118934525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072385463645871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12600376139548786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15153000215259607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757243215511656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059931341715687876,0.0,0.06519244657290252,0.0,0.0,0.2529367870170935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07688782484498019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11296643417821667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11945301465055365,0.1260834450453404,0.09350411802499707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4691957796159592,0.0,0.056041606402467116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08432519108804212,0.0850561551354071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24432522509358626,0.0777305959691891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11984773758849485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147412359000252,0.0,0.07348628740180095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1160928401017787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08119246550568296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10026176534370153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13377687283408454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07788069174234047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18929584643929886,0.13531808855695485,0.0,0.09201359816790898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5845727103997057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,immersonnig,2020/02/07,"Am I crazy? Last week, my school had police officers in the building searching students and K-9 units sniffing out cars.  A student was taken out on a stretcher for a possible overdose.  Teachers and students saw and reported these things to me.  Later that day, admin sent an email saying that new police recruits were touring the building, so it may have caused confusion.  Today, we were told to not release students.  After 20 minutes, students started receiving pictures of all the police in the front of the building.  Another student was taken out on a stretcher.  That’s fine.  I understand why I wasn’t informed during any of this.  But, when they released students, they said “we are now ending our shelter in place.”  They never announced a shelter in place!  I feel like I don’t know where I work.  I don’t know how to keep anyone safe, if no one tells me anything.  I feel disrespected.  I understand confidentiality.  I understand there is a ton of stuff I don’t need to know.  But, don’t lie to me.  And, don’t let me think I am safe when I am actually in a shelter in place situation.  I have never worked anywhere that is run like this.  At first, I thought teachers were so highly respected that admin is hands off.  But, now it seems admin doesn’t even exist at all which means no discipline ever and no safety.  This is how I feel and I feel crazy.  We live in a time where I can’t just trust that everything is fine.  No, nothing happened.  But, if it did, I’d be the last to know.  I’m still semi new.  Is this just what teaching is?",2.768042870456661,5.137675999999999,3.937986952469711,85.00878378378381,77.85135135135134,6.244920782851818,27.436626281453872,7.372421405659032,1.6376404007455738,1200,51,224,16,29,390,154,296,0.066,0.847,0.087,0.7919,0,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,4,0,3,3,16,9,0,1,15,0,31,1,1,3,5,52,57,18,0,3,9,0,5,2,0,1,0,2,0,0,18,12,0,4,16,0,0,5,15,1,0,2,15,8,30,8,27,39,3,47,0,0,1,0,15,21,0,5,23,161,48,13,0.0,0.0,0.11545927175294772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08045888359900598,0.12406455946739844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272924304121307,0.0,0.09736392192596617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12154304262819175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630398110145394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10479278810148968,0.0,0.0,0.07814655004699134,0.1070235243827784,0.0,0.0,0.10633472086334204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392963388902113,0.08452491770094507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10063946207745564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10462637831716036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500726667612388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516462699480476,0.0,0.0,0.2600933441130812,0.19288653428465705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1209860455115406,0.0,0.11560636539908227,0.0,0.10447512601217283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888072361906944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08772975634752703,0.18250506465212699,0.22854050781466026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11352731732903545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801739302025692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3708448659842195,0.0,0.0,0.13338342378820076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11254553507464868,0.0940895693415282,0.0,0.11974202877625426,0.0,0.10771037096793884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13299205260080926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08374461794950575,0.0,0.09448724745495142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354434228657939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341333005909996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07860384069188774,0.07581206487711269,0.0,0.09392962536617687,0.0689909650864456,0.0,0.1121496589203824,0.11305593296385835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3695131396162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949058952297924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10676171596188498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17227079944717955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,wutevvs,2020/02/07,"Computer Education content test Hi everyone! I’m currently teaching middle school computer science on an emergency license. I need to take (and pass) the computer education content test in order to enroll n a computer ed transition to teaching program. I have no background in computer science, only a week of training last summer (PLTW). Anyway, does anyone have any advice on studying for this test? The Pearson site basically told me to go learn everything about every CS standard, but how would I even go about doing that? CS is seemingly endless and I could go about learning for weeks and be studying things that aren’t even on the test. If you have any advice I’d be glad to hear it!

She will just correct with a red pen.

teaching,OnlyPopcorn,2020/02/07,"New job at a prison facility. I will be working half time at a work camp, and half time at am alternative high school, with my brand new, shiny Sped licence.  The governing law that applies to education in prisons is PREA.

My question is first about suggestions to bond with the students, since PREA is really clear. There won't be a lot of personal information about each other that we can share, from teacher to student. So, without getting to know them as people, does anyone know how I could bond with these students? I'm extremely easy to get along with and people tell me my main attribute is my positive personality, I always see the good in things. 

My second question is a lot more simple, which is, does anyone know if I'll be allowed to decorate a classroom? I would like to put up some pictures, wrapping paper or fabric on the walls, plants, light covers and an incandescent or warm LED lights. I have also thought of maybe selecting some personal journals and writing utensils such as markers for the kids. 

There are about 20 boys and 10 girls, divided into three classes of 10 each.

teaching,dragmonkey,2020/02/07,"Oof Before I say anything else, I just want to make it perfectly clear that I’m not trying to be a bummer, I’m not looking for karma, comments, or any sort of ‘atta-boy-isms. But I don’t want to burden my girlfriend or colleagues anymore with my woes. I just want to put some words out into the æther. 

So I just got out of a meeting with one of my sophomores who’s in the oncology center. He just went through three straight days of chemo and, to be honest, is looking like a champ. All he has is a little bit of his meticulously quaffed hair buzzed ever so slightly for what I assumed was his brain biopsy and he has a port in his chest for all of his chemo, IV, and other meds.   

This kid is one of the most mild-mannered, sweetest kids you could ever meet. He’s not going to be a Rhodes scholar, but I would personally climb Mt. Everest if I had to to deliver a recommendation letter for anything he would ever want to do. When I worked outside of teaching, I would hire him on the spot. 

I dropped off a set of prayer beads to his mom who, from sheer force of will and expert makeup-try does not look like she’s been up until five in the morning and waking up at six in the morning for half a month, and her hijab was worn, like, perfectly. She for real looked like someone from a magazine. 

Anyway,  I wrote and erased a whole novel about nonsense that we all deal with every day, but I boiled it down to this: 

It’s just not fair that anyone has to deal with this. I want to cry, but I’m at a bar, and as a former bartender, I would cut myself off so I won’t. Hug, text, or think about people you love tonight and take care of the quiet kids. They might not be there tomorrow.

teaching,xymoxinfused,2020/02/08,"What are my options with teaching? I have been back and forth between education and nursing for a good while now, finally settling on education. My father, grandfather, and grandmother were/are all teachers, so, although I'm not following tradition for tradition's sake, I grew up around the profession and it's a natural choice for me. I want to start off at secondary education and eventually get my degrees and teach at the college level in a speciality I'm passionate about - most likely English. I'm 26 and have a child, so that was the motivating force behind the nursing option, but I foresee myself being miserable and have decided the considerable financial increase isn't worth it. I'd rather do something I'm passionate about. So, what are my options with teaching in terms of traveling, moving, and overall demographic? I live in florida and know licensing is by state, but what if I would like to move states or even countries?

1) An ""expert"" who hasn't taught in 10 years, or taught for 3 years and then became a consultant, presenting theory that is nearly impossible to implement. (Even worse is the academic ""expert"" who never taught and went immediately to grad school, but thinks all teachers are brain dead, bigoted assholes who hate children)

teaching,Nerdy_Gem,2020/02/08,"I'm tired of non-teachers trying to put me off teacher training Yes, I know it's stressful. Yes, I know kids can be crazy. Yes, I know there's a lot of paperwork. I can't say this from firsthand experience, but I've done my research, spoken to many teachers, and done experience days. But I'm not doing it because it's easy. I have my own reasons, a lot of them I can't articulate well, and I've not yet been put off. I know I'm going to be stressed during training and on the job. I know I'll end up in tears at some point. But I can be (and am) stressed in my current career and I'd rather have a tangible reason to feel stressed rather than just a job I feel no value or control in, that I have to justify remaining employed.

I still want to do it. I believe I can succeed and I'm sick of people trying to put a negative spin on it, like they've already decided I'll fail. Just because it's not the job for them doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile to me. If it was so awful, no one would stay in teaching. If I hate the school I can find a better one. I don't think I'm going to change the world or be the popular teacher who transforms lives. I just want a place in life, a positive role, and if I'm going to be stressed be stressed for my students' futures, not for some rich businessmen on the other side of the world who don't give a damn about me.

Rant over, sorry and thanks :)",2.371022727272728,3.3146012804054044,4.0883538083538085,89.71512285012287,75.04729729729729,7.003439803439803,26.96805896805897,7.348242739294969,1.2051743243243245,1073,40,245,12,22,362,141,296,0.207,0.6509999999999999,0.142,-0.9679,5,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,2,4,11,16,2,6,16,4,27,3,0,3,0,46,50,17,0,8,17,0,2,1,0,1,3,1,0,1,13,8,0,1,13,0,1,6,13,9,1,2,4,3,27,7,34,39,5,31,0,1,0,0,8,18,1,9,7,157,40,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09961443971958384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11005467969872043,0.0,0.0,0.1017026121408812,0.0,0.07983587821071056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09549297166906236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10124471855354387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05821624384552585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18475371115878444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0799518244959908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1766014332971206,0.0,0.0,0.09128576133957894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250452345357656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659455753062273,0.15390640507449638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08912226535243875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2687351150543612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480482886494648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06375989055985205,0.04410103025436831,0.0,0.07970946369927745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15348749623801966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915189225273467,0.0,0.0983297532434072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223376553451679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06258138077867635,0.0,0.09431222694350044,0.0,0.08533368537460963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722367985829742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18562379135342225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07178578670520439,0.0,0.09135737146568833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104911369858044,0.0,0.09621508480152352,0.07208919585488288,0.0,0.6204192089890253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310786213305499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05784093557910992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10375130461438876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225738861978406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10648636790595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08116295992417834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412473523909107,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,NerdTeacher16,2020/02/09,"Attendance Issues I am a newish teacher. I teach at a relatively small suburban high school. The school is located in low income community, nearly 85% of all students on Free And Reduced Meal plans due to income. 

This year my admin is pressuring me hard to find a solution to why nearly 50% of my enrolled students are failing my 9th grade course. 

I teach the same subject and lessons as my fellow 9th grade teachers of the same subject. I offer turning in late work until the end of the quarter for 3/4 credit. I send home tests for students to complete and redo. I stay after school weekly and have an empty classroom most weeks after school. All of these things and so many more that I have come up with and Admin have all but forced me to implement in my classroom. Nothing seems to be working. 

The biggest issue is attendance. I teach students every other day, so 90 days by the end of the year. At this point nearly 45% of my students have been absent more than 13 of the days they have my class. Admin wants me to come up with a plan in the next two weeks on how I will “reach these students who are not passing, because people from central office are looking closely at my numbers &amp; grades”. 

I am tired. I am frustrated. I feel betrayed. I have already had one meeting about grades at the end of 1st quarter where I reported my data &amp; findings. I already warned them that truancy was going to be a major factor this year in grades, but they brushed that off. My principal also dictates to the staff that we do not have an attendance issue, even though our schools daily attendance report shows that nearly 20% of our school is absent on a DAILY basis. 

I am getting the feeling that they are just looking for a scapegoat. 

Any suggestions on how to 1) handle the upcoming meeting,  or 2) what have you done to address attendance issues in your class. 

TLDR: admin pressuring me to find a solution to attendance issue while also dictating how I should run my classes. Pressure from central office, feels like I am being set up to take the blame.

teaching,Anthony-Palma,2020/02/09,"Convince me to teach black history in math class A well know edu Twitter person was arguing that all classes at all levels should include black history (for sure if black students are enrolled in the class).  I honestly don’t know how I feel about it.  I’m open to it, but I need to be convinced to make the change in my math classes.  My hang ups are: 1.  there aren’t really great examples of mathematical advancements in the high school topics I teach.  There are other examples, so I’d have to go out of my way to cover them, which seems a little too little and almost condescending.  2. I feel that 1 culture shouldn’t get special treatment.  That means I also need to make the same effort for Native Americans, Hmong, etc.  3. Students already struggle with a jam packed curriculum when NO cultures are discussed, it seems like they would have a harder time doing the same work in less time.  4.  Why does it matter?  Beauty can be found in topics without knowing their complete history.  A persons mathematical skills can grow regardless of their cultural background.

teaching,Stranger2306,2020/02/09,"The Most Important Training Teachers Need (that's not behavior management) This is stemming from a post I commented on yesterday. If training revolved around Cognitive Science, teacher's would actually be interested, lessons would actually change, and student outcomes would improve. Long post coming:

You ever have a training where all you did was discuss stuff and then a month latter not a single thing is different due to that meeting? That's the worst. When I was asked to do a PD session for my school last semester, I wanted it to be actually good. My goals:

1. It wouldn't just be a ""discussion"" - teachers would walk with concrete strategies and lesson activity ideas.

2.  it would be stuff they didn't know already - but if they knew about it and used the strategies I discussed, student success would improve. 

So what I ended up presenting on was 1 strategy supported by cognitive science. There are educational psychologists out there who have been doing great research on how people actually learn. Based on their research, they run experiments testing what teaching strategies are most effective. However, this research doesn't really filter to the teaching community. Teacher training is led by former teachers - not cognitive scientists. And the researchers job is to publish their findings, not come to schools to teach what they have discovered. So education is one of those fields with a disconnect between research and the practitioners. 

For example, 76% percent of American teachers believe that students have learning styles (Auditory, Visual, or Kinesthetic) - and each student learns best when the lesson uses their learning style. But experiment after experiment where they had some students learn with their learning style and other students not showed there was no difference. See - disconnect between us teachers and knowledge of the latest research.

For my PD last semester, I focused on  a strategy called spaced learning. Research shows that when learning about something happens spread out over time, students remember it better. Even if they spend the same total amount of time on it. So for example, 1 experiment with a math class had students do the same amount of practice problems (let's say 15 problems). 1 group did 15 problems all in one class. The 2nd group did 8 problems one day and 7 problems another day. The 3rd group did 5 problems initially. 5 problems on another day, and 5 problems the following week. Same amount of work. Same amount of time teacher spent in class on it. But better grades. The more spread out it was, the better they did on the eventually test. Another example was a Science class that taught the same lesson (about biomes) that took about 30 minutes. Except for some classes, that 30 minutes happened at once. Other classes, they spread that 30 minutes out over a few days. 2nd group tested better.

I structured the PD to explain the science behind spaced learning and how experiments showed students did better - this was to get teacher buy in that it actually worked and wasn't just a pie in the sky idea. Then I gave teachers specific ways they could implement it in their class. For example, I gave them lots of ideas for brief activities they could do in class a week after teaching something that would effectively review what students learned the week before. I also gave suggestions on how to break down the time in a period to each day spend time reviewing something from the past and learning something new so that you still have the same amount of time spent on learning each concept, but it's just spread out over time. 

That PD went over so well, that I'm doing a follow up PD next month. This time over a concept called Cognitive Load Theory, which explains how their are important limits to how students transfer what they learn into long term memory. And there are specific strategies and ways to make your lesson plans to reduce these limitations. If asked, I'll do a separate post about Cognitive Load Theory, but 1 example is they did an experiment with students learning some Math. Group 1 learned about the concept and did 8 practice problems. Group 2 learned about the concept, but they only had to do 4 practice problems. The other 4 problems were still on the WS, but the WS showed the full answer to those problems worked out - so that students had a model to follow to help them solve their 4 problems. Most teachers (including me) would probably have assumed that the students who do MORE problems on their own would learn more. But it was actually the 2nd group that did better. Cognitive Load Theory explains why (again, I can explain that in a separate post if people are interested).  


In summary: There IS a need for teacher training to improve our lesson design. But most PD doesn't do that. PD needs to give teachers SPECIFIC ways to lesson plan and design practice. In my PD, I try to have my teachers understand why they should implement a change and walk out with concrete ideas on how to.

teaching,mementomoriok,2020/02/09,"How do you reconcile what parents want, with what is beneficial for students? I believe the way to create long-lasting learning for students is to give them time.

1. Don't rush to see results.
2. Don't compare too soon.
3. Don't make judgments during development.
4. Let students figure out their own way of doing it.

However, it seems many parents want the following:

1. See results every 2 weeks.
2. See rankings for how their child compares to other children.
3. Make judgments to fix everything immediately.
4. Have the teacher instruct the right way of doing something. 

I am kind of having a hard time dealing with parents. A lot of the time, I view parents as obstacles, and I am pretty sure this is an unhealthy attitude for me to have.",1.9521739130434768,4.794032115942031,3.5183913043478263,82.12715217391306,90.15942028985506,5.368695652173915,30.08840579710145,6.961326702584282,2.2496944927536227,584,32,97,9,20,192,84,138,0.053,0.852,0.095,0.5719,5,0,1,0,0,0,26.0,0,1,3,1,4,2,0,0,8,0,15,0,0,6,1,18,25,4,0,2,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,4,0,0,4,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,5,9,2,18,24,2,12,0,0,4,0,12,2,0,2,5,63,15,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15480961722900674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14165965197165736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11577056254622176,0.0,0.12349173950448275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13181244830625405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308887312276524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14308730484615803,0.0,0.1120043079645448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14050704318103274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12160007145185005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681774952413013,0.0,0.0,0.1834392727294359,0.13930821507360852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6102928368268032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13979139848599706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173440556050417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32848460656061923,0.12508934960762585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10578192611152952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12950361978179534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240367799513978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16209135152587514,0.3271996909344093,0.11021888237445547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hello! 

A district near me is expanding from k-8 to k-12 and is looking to hire high school staff. They had been sending their 9-12 students to another district but that district is overcrowded so they said no more. 

They have offered me a contract for next year. 

Does anyone have experience with working in a district expanding like this? If you do, can you tell me how it worked and what it was like? I want as much insight into it as possible.

I am pretty sure no one gets paid more for teaching additional content areas, but I am just checking.",5.915582329317273,7.563324674698798,6.2965662650602425,74.55802208835345,67.31325301204821,8.90682730923695,33.110441767068274,9.2995712137729,3.166848995983935,360,16,61,7,6,116,58,83,0.02,0.9079999999999999,0.07200000000000001,0.4926,1,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,2,0,1,4,2,0,0,2,0,7,0,0,1,2,14,13,3,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,3,0,0,2,0,3,0,3,0,0,2,2,0,7,2,8,11,6,7,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,2,5,42,10,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19226619721956725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17733362158024113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2872862908772822,0.0,0.0,0.2406290760028445,0.0,0.32226409926185284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2873221174673513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2722646350511425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3022338677136843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13433699761150014,0.0,0.0,0.24334078421035565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27877755249823105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3726550880809065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27974447816763426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591570220274106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,brandoesco,2020/02/09,"I want to teach my (middle school) students about things that actually matter- What do you think about having students research the actual platforms of democratic candidates (and trump)? Is this problematic? I teach middle school social studies at an inner city school. I don’t know if it’s just me but my students really don’t seem to care as much about Ancient Greek systems of government, innovations in technology during the Industrial Revolution, or the balance of free states and slave states in the early-mid 19th centuries. 

To be clear, it’s not so much about who to vote for so much as understanding the different issues facing our society. (For instance, why are candidates discussing healthcare? What is wrong/right with our healthcare system? Is this moral? What is MY opinion on this topic?) 

I can use this opportunity to also explain the historical context as it is relevant (ie domestic issues like the history of immigration/discrimination in USA, foreign issues like Israel-Palestine or the Cold War, etc.) 

Literacy (inc. vocabulary) and global awareness (current events, the global community/diversity, and environmental issues) are huge issues to address for me. 

Any suggestions? Has anyone done something similar? Would you NOT go down this road for one reason or any other? Politics aside, any resources for teaching modern or environmental issues? I’m willing to share what I have.

teaching,scoopyloopythrowaway,2020/02/09,"Did you know teaching was for you when you started teaching? I’ve just started my first year of full time teaching this week just gone (Australia), as a high school maths teacher, and at the same time, so have quite a few other people I went to uni with or through school with or just know from somewhere.

All my life I’ve wanted to teach, and can’t actually imagine what else I would do, or what else interests me.

Many of these people are constantly saying how excited they are and how much fun they’re having or how much they are enjoying themselves and teaching, even if they are exhausted.

I’m not feeling that at all, I’m a week in and already wondering what else I could do career wise. Now, I get very anxious over things and doubt myself a lot (when I started my part time supermarket job 5 years ago I cried from the anxiousness and stress for the first few ml this for example) so I’m thinking it may just be a similar situation, but I just... not loving it? 

So that’s stressing me out even more, like maybe I’m not in the right field after all...

How did you feel? When you started compared to now? Did it get better or worse in terms of enjoying your job and knowing you made the right (or wrong) choice?",5.267441217150761,5.657488551867223,5.413759336099588,84.86509266943294,68.04564315352697,8.584343015214385,30.174550484094052,8.447377352677275,2.0119275795297367,955,34,197,13,15,301,133,241,0.099,0.813,0.08800000000000001,0.2804,2,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,7,3,4,19,14,0,3,10,0,17,3,0,5,3,50,39,27,0,4,16,0,2,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,13,11,0,0,8,0,0,2,4,5,0,2,7,3,23,9,23,28,13,35,0,0,0,1,12,11,0,11,23,138,36,11,0.0,0.0,0.10884579202456916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887242804272976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308585396422456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520142213300507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864701617768824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12053383218939773,0.0,0.08905466635140788,0.0,0.12252014885071205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2795290982641884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14734066835364815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11279475064946345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1897497150715847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11654885261372695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784688006090645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2213701227770714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838964442428009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07878316236398017,0.05449223009075319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09482631032443192,0.10066813368697372,0.10554072195386258,0.0,0.11308284988476,0.11205572970371397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16398772305763287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078566532715153,0.0,0.15465393806535313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11863525743147738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1905070740852202,0.0,0.08870014110380695,0.0,0.2257664674807269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12537429933979016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31579098430529245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2555346673607796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07410143132193406,0.07146956776432879,0.0,0.0,0.1951175368603133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203120218677434,0.06578848190156343,0.0,0.1789394160772333,0.0,0.0,0.10339759730412684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095908499774205,0.0,0.0,0.11366757968718627,0.07923397269865508,0.1219501825876054,0.0,0.14365467752568215

teaching,sakurastressball,2020/02/10,"Need some advice about book suggestions. I have an interview to get onto a teaching placement degree on Thursday. As part of the interview I have to pitch a book that isn’t currently on the British curriculum and explain why I think it should be.

I’ve opted to go for A-level students (16-18 year olds), and am seriously considering talking about Nabokov’s Lolita. Is this too much of a risky move? 

I was thinking of pitching it in a way to talk about cruelty, the prevalence of sexual assault in the modern world, his writing and how amazing it is, including the psychological element of his writing, as well as censorship etc.

I believe in taking risks and not staying completely safe, but perhaps this is too much? At the same time, I really love the book and feel I can convey it to the interviewers 

 But again, do you think this is too much of a risk at an interview?",7.398306559571619,7.0708316686747015,7.95273092369478,70.89702141900939,63.63855421686747,11.474163319946456,38.3239625167336,10.980518767755715,4.326260508701472,691,33,124,17,9,230,103,166,0.087,0.851,0.062,0.2774,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,0,9,8,1,2,15,0,13,1,0,1,0,21,23,11,0,2,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,1,5,3,0,2,2,4,1,0,1,1,10,4,26,20,7,20,0,0,0,1,14,9,0,1,7,93,18,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19000947370711227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21907300991066386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20387195827442087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21685765425260087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09831727070562338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015895245733947,0.0,0.11050761527309463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17549426891133715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066643389169919,0.4288185026543019,0.1441785569099825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2040373936367531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21056506418873625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12456649202396583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072525747625984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14619849498032567,0.31257516647431266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3737776519194512,0.0,0.0,0.11338248503264085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.154341447294807,0.0,0.0,0.17482947143204294,0.0,0.17545643327267624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12521625108525128

teaching,kolson0359,2020/02/10,"Needing some advice/encouraging stories about teaching high school Hi all. 

I am currently a 4th and 5th grade teacher. I have always wanted to teach high school, but I got suckered into this job last year while still working on my cert for ELAR 7-12. Now that I have completed that, I will be transitioning into a public high school English teacher job(hopefully)this next school year. 

I frequent this sub, and recently I have just seen a lot of things that are giving me a good amount of anxiety about beginning to teach high school. Everyone talks about the violence, the gangs, the attitude, and a host of other issues that they see at the high school level, and frankly, that scares me. I have always been so passionate about teacher high school, and high schoolers in general because I was bullied myself in high school and my teachers were my saving grace and I want nothing more in my life than to give that back to even one student. I just want to do my best to educate them on what I am passionate about, English, and show them that there are people in their court. 

But since seeing posts like that, I have gotten a little standoff-ish when it comes to wanting to teach high school. 

Can any high school teachers speak to their experiences? I know it’s definitely not all sunshine and rainbows. It’s hard work and these kids are in a tough age, especially now. But I would love to hear some positive things about teaching high school.",6.744738929279578,7.684606456928844,6.003458911654551,79.99465300727034,64.95505617977528,9.128794888742013,31.810751266798853,9.168548406835145,2.6693755893368576,1152,43,208,19,17,350,150,267,0.092,0.743,0.165,0.9769,3,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,5,3,16,12,1,1,11,0,18,4,0,0,2,33,35,16,0,6,6,0,1,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,18,13,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,3,0,1,6,7,28,9,31,26,8,40,0,0,4,3,14,23,0,3,16,139,46,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948294155706169,0.0,0.0,0.03875062856428895,0.0,0.043592102867123735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04381667484497409,0.0,0.03473651814190753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980050486431709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04908610596866743,0.05974595295892773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037636961874139035,0.0,0.0,0.05445002800568005,0.0,0.05574064554461311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093272335856121,0.0,0.047794926133460126,0.045574786432545915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05104588434779813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642243711093034,0.0,0.0,0.6622663572167279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947580732266323,0.11309435424897504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031316556105851566,0.04644903154740065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0402490216903351,0.02783918397111993,0.05711228163709524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048445202077944186,0.051429693537474036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04225242819924723,0.0,0.0,0.06060243374766839,0.0,0.0,0.054677056266934934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03861338923496285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03950507647135317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05457429274889648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05626417855246893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0570502690552616,0.6343720594167412,0.09081669643040026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047137211738912936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04550697283393718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04580105412821354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571440462829175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13444101280406998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296910748999309,0.0,0.0,0.040479333274614095,0.0,0.0,0.07339081166780886

He's a refugee and have lived in this country for two months now. He's very skillful in construction, but it's hard for him to find work since he doesn't speak english.
He is gonna take basic english classes from next week, so I'm not gonna teach him that. I'll be teaching him the vocabulary he can use in his work. 
Should I just show pictures of tools and materials and give him the english words? Or what would you do to teach him ?
We have 1 hour every day this week for the lessons.

Quick background: I'm currently a master's candidate in English literature. I had hoped to go straight into my Ph.D. but it doesn't look like the fates are in my favor this year. Which is okay because I'm very excited about the prospect of teaching. I, of course, have a great deal of experience in literary studies, but I don't have a lot of experience putting together high school curriculum style lesson plans. I'm hoping someone here can help me out with that. What exactly should it look like? What should be included?",4.739019607843137,7.183199176470591,5.141764705882356,78.38460784313726,71.94117647058823,8.847058823529412,31.92156862745098,9.444778638647367,3.3084627450980406,444,21,77,11,9,141,75,102,0.046,0.6859999999999999,0.268,0.9765,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,5,3,8,0,0,5,1,11,0,0,0,1,13,19,2,0,4,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,2,6,8,12,15,1,12,0,0,2,0,4,7,0,3,5,46,13,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12994671717996611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21976935580176146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170431747029909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211496694016148,0.0,0.0,0.23502115457777964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857672951593261,0.2252262659860627,0.0,0.4234526772992782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082886114974049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3580189501969471,0.0,0.0,0.18122987881027786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2142951629031756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.215739858489542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1806186158381416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17588793196750602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13727476957310844

For some work experience two years ago, I helped out at a local secondary school as a science teaching assistant and thoroughly enjoyed it. For my gap year I would like to do something similar, helping out in a school (primary or secondary) for a year, ideally in an english speaking country (like Australia, Canada, the US, etc., I live in England). The only problem is that I have absolutely no idea how to go about finding schools that would like a gapee helping out. Does anyone have any helpful ideas?

teaching,Fernxtwo,2020/02/11,"Selling a FB online teachers group. Hi guys,

I have a group with 6000+ members, its a closed group, which I have to personally approve each day. 

The groups been active for a few years now and I'm thinking about leaving FB so would be interested in passing the group onto someone who would like to take it over.

Could be a good stepping stone for targeted ads, referrals from online teaching sites/apps and the like.

If anyone is interested then just shoot me a DM and I can provide some more information.

teaching,NaylorEdu,2020/02/11,"Credential Program Assignment Help (CA) Evening all!

Long-time lurker, first time poster here. 

I am working on a Group Assignment for my Credential Program and wanted to seek the help of my fellow Reddit-ers (??)

The assignment asks for us to interview individuals with students currently in a California Secondary Public School who’s primary spoken language is NOT English; regarding their experience within education and what their perspectives are now. 

Each member picked a different population source for collecting responses (i.e. In-Person, Email, Social Media, etc.). 

So, since none of my group members know what Reddit is... here I am! 

Our cohort is made up of mostly Secondary Ed. Teachers and we all had to agree on and ask the same following 7 Q’s. 

I’ve pasted the link to the Google Form we created below. 

Thank you in advance to those who kindly participate! 

(P.S. the Cred. Prog. Instructor and the assignment instructions do NOT ask for any background or participant information to be collected; other than what the individuals Primary Language is and that they currently have students in a Public Secondary Education School in California)

Here is our Google Forms Link:

teaching,SteveNJulia,2020/02/11,"Should I email the principal? I need help making a decision. 
I’m currently on the OT list in my board, and was looking through the LTO postings when I saw one that looked perfect. It was for a 7/8 history and grade 8 science position for the remainder of the year. I have two years of full time experience at a private school where I was the coding teacher and ran all the STEM clubs and camps. On top of that I specialized in history in university so I thought I’d make a good fit for he position. 
After spending an hour writing a whole new cover letter just for this position, I saw that one of the questions on the application was whether or not I had my science and technology qualification. If not, I was not eligible for the position. 
Needless to say, I’m pretty torn up about it because this seems like my dream job and I really do think I’d be a great fit for it, but based on that question my application will never make it past HR.
SO, here is my question: Should I email the principal of the school and explain the situation and ask if they would be willing to give my application a look, or would that come across as desperate and disrespectful of the system in place?

teaching,OldschoolScience,2020/02/11,"Middle School Science and Math Teacher Okay so I have two degrees: one, in chemistry and the other in education. I taught for 2.5 years as a chemistry Teaching Assistance at a university and loved it. I did my student teaching at a high school during which time I created and implemented freshmen science curriculum effectively, sure there were some behavior issues but I dealt with them the same way every time and had high expectations, it all went well for the most part. 

I have always learned and been told that being consist with behavior management, being organized, and having high expectations were the cornerstones or classroom management. So when I got the job in my new school teaching 7th grade science, 8th grade science, 8th grade agriculture, and 7th grade math I put all of those in place and am frequently told that I am one of the most organized and consistent teachers at the school. Planning and grading for all of these classes is not what I find troubling it is the behavior of my 8th graders. 

Forgive my language, but all my 8th graders are disrespectful little assholes who are constantly trying to argue with me and are so so so immature and unwilling to take ownership of their choices. When they argue with me or argue about a behavior that I addressed and they think is unfair I shut them down quickly because it sucks up far too much of our class time and is disrespectful. Then others begin arguing. I have used the school mandated behavior management channels and received little backup from admin, even so much as them deciding to not issue referrals I have given to students because he “ felt like they didn’t deserve it”. I also have many students who will go into the principal and say things like “well I don’t know why I was given a referral” and “well I have been having suicidal thoughts so that is why I misbehaved” and he principal does not issue those referrals. Essentially the students know they can walk all over me now because no one backs me up and I feel each day like I want to run away. 

I have put in place several of my own classroom management methods but the 8th graders remain assholes who blame me for their poor grades and seem to have no respect or responsibility. They have been pushing me all year and I have remained fair and have not blown up at them, but each day is getting ridiculously more difficult with them, to the point where I am feeling the emotions rise up. Is this normal that these sort of problems arise in only a few classes and among only one grade level? I feel like I am losing my mind and my mental health is deteriorating.

teaching,almostdeadpoet,2020/02/12,"Need some tips on working with wild kiddos Hi, so I should start by clarifying that I'm not actually a tutor, but a tutor with an after school program. The program is K-8 and runs from 6:30-8:30. It provides the kids with a free dinner and 1.5 hours of tutoring. Most of the kids are first or second generation and most are multilingual. I've been tutoring 5th graders, usually about 5-8 of them with the help of one other tutor. 

As you might imagine, keeping kids focused on academic tasks after an entire school day, at 6:30 at night is an extremely challenging task. To add to this, I'm a college student who pretty much has no experience working with children under age 14. 

We usually have 1-2 kids who have homework to do, so helping that child individually while keeping the others occupied has been one of the most difficult things. We've tried doing multiplication/division flashcards, making blackout poetry, making acrostic poems, and doing math problems out of some textbooks we have. Usually this keeps at least some of the kids occupied for a little bit, but they of course become bored and then start running around, drawing on the table, ripping up paper, etc. I'm not allowed to let the kids do anything that isn't somewhat academic (I got yelled at for getting out Uno the other day).

Are there some activities you would recommend that we can try, or any books we can read to them that are fun and interactive? 

How do I establish myself as an authority? 

And how do I convince kids, who just want to play, that they need to keep their brains turned on for a just a little bit longer? 

Thank you in advance for any suggestions you might have :)",8.990388349514564,7.8807303689320385,8.826524271844663,68.47163106796121,60.84466019417476,11.735145631067965,38.399352750809065,10.793553405168565,4.145274692556635,1320,55,229,27,15,429,175,309,0.038,0.8240000000000001,0.138,0.9858,1,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,4,4,5,5,9,9,0,0,21,0,28,2,1,5,0,54,46,19,0,6,8,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,9,16,20,1,4,1,3,1,3,4,3,0,4,3,1,18,7,45,38,13,34,0,0,0,0,30,16,0,12,15,166,34,22,0.0,0.0,0.11158980393008557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555248168281891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09410089629554017,0.10179638136744036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12629138219881528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2496827314945419,0.0,0.0,0.1276532175695693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474935041754897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12753127604742906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11185694283421284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09726666096493752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05974352967410323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145671405234404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15329374960417078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11261242146923715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.406560683384225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693135503052003,0.0,0.0,0.229218917714146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15265998230728975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426160788409685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406093392573143,0.16957921457537312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10731040102377352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15497400972270814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633578841680148,0.0,0.109418192205807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11438166134101466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23145805980699394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16187605127427432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10527877616995923,0.0,0.0,0.07596953486531491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552732605327356,0.12438074282268208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37782347634467867,0.0,0.06744701526537959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664973669184698,0.0,0.0,0.08123146805756977,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,whatsinsideagirl_,2020/02/12,"My mom is a substitute and is being investigated by CPS. Hi, let me know if this isn't the place for this post. My mother has been subbing at least since I was 10 years old (I'm 24 now), she's been subbing for this class room for a bit, and I believe they're 4th graders.  Apparently the little boy asked to get up for a tissue, my mom told him no, and she got him one instead. Apparently the boy went to the principle or something and told them that my mom pushed him back into the desk when he asked to get up. Of course I don't think my mom did this, she's good with kids and always wanted to be a teacher, but she's been subbing for so long. I don't see her doing this and apparently the boy has always stirred up issues. I asked her if he had bruises or anything (because I'm sure that wouldn't help the case) but she said she didn't know anything. She had two long term subbing spots at the same school but with this happening, they've been taken away from her. Has anybody been in a similar situation? I'm wondering if there's a large chance of her being fucked over or not.",4.272667509481671,4.376771336283188,5.168546144121368,86.75884955752217,70.15044247787611,8.227054361567639,27.204804045512013,7.957251820313856,1.3514308470290768,846,25,191,10,14,277,122,226,0.05,0.9159999999999999,0.035,-0.6354,3,0,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,0,7,3,1,0,14,0,24,1,0,0,1,27,46,17,0,5,10,5,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,4,8,9,0,0,4,0,0,2,7,1,0,2,16,2,26,2,24,25,4,23,0,0,1,1,34,12,1,7,8,123,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2003762998830273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198169166629267,0.0,0.3376924704181111,0.0,0.11312620494103692,0.09258544013777596,0.0,0.07339890195687096,0.0,0.0,0.13565729467791102,0.0,0.0,0.13145310185620793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11131419833663596,0.12581522549821916,0.0,0.0,0.10099155830685927,0.096300362270105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064753852783151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08070617763598763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12567347517813654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13234491850045976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231241682674989,0.0,0.0,0.12067930191762608,0.0,0.2131125574891972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5640762189066219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12634674095718718,0.0,0.08159080190769799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257995374246796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11531648469997907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11453449312850668,0.0,0.0,0.12185816667867623,0.0959486752545287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09960179568978368,0.13534235120611635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269508044116516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11348203700166125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715185163024266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301078220223899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1176200026963116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07101908341443285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11161836199201323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13057609932452274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753806769196342

I had a post observation conference today which basically boiled down to “great content, needs to work on class management.” My principal came in and said she had decided to give me a contract for next year but I’d be repeating my induction year, which just means I wouldn’t be formally evaluated because they think I wouldn’t pass yet. Has anyone else had this experience? I feel like a failure on one level but I’m glad they’re giving me another opportunity to grow.",5.7732967032967055,7.768750285714281,6.985494505494508,68.1345054945055,68.12087912087911,11.793406593406596,33.879120879120876,11.491704259439757,4.752665934065933,400,19,68,15,7,135,66,91,0.047,0.773,0.18,0.9102,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,1,2,2,4,0,0,3,0,8,1,0,0,0,12,17,3,0,3,3,0,1,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,3,2,1,0,4,0,0,3,2,0,0,1,5,2,10,4,9,8,0,17,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,9,39,13,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22060187922387053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14710265816448326,0.21555927499228955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824575686096795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2406187895871913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17574557895790094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2057921075043964,0.0,0.0,0.10637450025453216,0.15029558615384714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4036315257454505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2319448040031953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10278109061428067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22916560497335384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559941791370516,0.0,0.0,0.22374162406939516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425590010828019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20148598227784045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20011965256079228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13480307391191632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19941573660005404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15315921910573008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4064336622856776
teaching,GonnaTossItAnyway00,2020/02/13,"PA teacher here, struggling with school/ student I teach in an urban school, been doing this for about 10 years. I'm at a charter, otherwise I'd ask my union rep. 

I have a kid who has swung on me, and made threats several times. The same kid has also accused other teachers of hitting him, and last year, he hit a teacher several times and then the teacher pushed him off, he was fired. Needless to say, this kid is a walking risk. I've told admin that I don't want him in my class, I don't feel safe as I'm not allowed to defend myself. They said no. Today he threatened me again, and now I'm asking for another adult in the room if he's with me. 

They haven't responded yet, but he is back in classes like nothing has happened. 

What recourse do I have? Can I refuse to teach him? Should I request a transfer? I've got a family and I enjoy my career. When I see this kid, all I can think about is how he may be the end of it. If I'm denied a transfer and have to resume teaching him, do I just refuse until they fire me?

I'm so lost here. Any advice is greatly appreciated. This is middle school if that matters.",1.8700862068965518,3.4952561810344847,3.53141379310345,90.40496551724141,77.70689655172414,5.8468965517241385,24.96206896551724,6.508806274219699,0.7597786206896546,862,31,186,7,20,287,136,232,0.14400000000000002,0.797,0.059000000000000004,-0.927,1,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,3,1,14,8,1,2,12,0,24,0,0,3,1,28,43,17,0,5,6,1,3,1,0,2,0,2,1,5,10,8,0,3,2,0,0,2,5,4,0,0,7,6,27,4,21,31,2,25,0,1,1,0,30,9,0,4,15,120,37,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566811618051745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822283307772792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10903584198414393,0.16812914990641015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29979015699170924,0.0,0.0,0.12329059454457587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14201253327672408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15115309503048954,0.0,0.08107208498148855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12823753822924253,0.1767740277619832,0.0,0.0,0.14178701895018708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306974738672042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07833340972538219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17502867614257778,0.0,0.0,0.15171639336022422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384934614386575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15251885968962076,0.1275078021988086,0.0,0.486814097256618,0.12776921727964735,0.0,0.0,0.3622742769600816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676208651424389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273859090103818,0.0,0.0,0.18698961832456268,0.0,0.15198237834820671,0.1532105379867528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457194354907764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2065057843080721
teaching,anxiousteacherOCD,2020/02/13,"Teenagers are kind of the worst (not all of them obviously) So I just got my degree 9 months ago and I've been subbing. I did my internship at a local high school so I end up teaching there a lot. For two days I subbed for a teacher that teaches Native Studies and a Land Based Learning class. I personally am not a fan of Land Based Learning, but I understand that it has a purpose, especially for students who don't do well in lecture based classes.

The Land Based class takes up two of their regular class periods. It was supposed to have 31 students, **ONLY 13 SHOW UP**, and at least half of them show up late. 

Aside: If you couldn't tell by my username I have OCD, and the thing that I am obsessive about is getting to places on time, I have in the past drove faster than I should to get somewhere early because my brain tells me if I'm not early by at least 10 minutes, I'm late, which then spirals to me worrying about people being mad at me, or me getting fired (my anxiety runs wild); so one of my biggest pet peeves is students being late. I also hate when students show up late, when the class is right after lunch, you have a ton of time to grab that drink that you came in late with, you had 45 minutes. Ok back to the story. 

So the few students who show up, show up late, then proceed to just mess around on their phones, and talk a little too loud. They had to do an assignment, where they read a large handout about trapping, and then write a quiz with 20 questions. They had almost two hours to do it, only 2 of them actually got it done. One of them finished before the end of the first period. SO the ones that didn't finish, because they were fucking around instead of actually doing work, have to do it for homework. I don't know about the rest of you, but I would rather work in class, then have a free evening, instead of dicking around in class, then having to do work at home. 

TBH, the ones that didn't even try probably won't finish it at all anyway, then they will fail, and have to retake the class. They don't do any work and then worry about whether or not they will graduate. It just bugs me that I busted my butt to get a degree because I love teaching, and these kids don't appreciate it.",4.482307573891628,4.989622584821434,4.947774014778325,87.10455357142858,69.80357142857143,7.697167487684729,28.17149014778325,7.503015589744147,1.4063445812807889,1730,57,368,17,29,551,210,448,0.095,0.875,0.028999999999999998,-0.9812,0,0,1,0,0,0,56.0,0,5,13,6,30,12,3,1,26,1,44,7,3,0,3,44,60,31,0,6,15,0,2,0,0,5,0,1,3,2,21,15,2,0,5,7,1,3,12,7,1,9,14,3,45,6,64,38,9,72,0,1,0,4,29,33,3,7,36,267,66,30,0.0,0.0,0.1649021188532582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07489620212755754,0.0,0.08460556402074325,0.0,0.0,0.0675674479060095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057456799201165136,0.0,0.06463540835311926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256447953291835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496838842378186,0.0,0.15451484699268905,0.0,0.07189564532388037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09431993477131027,0.0,0.09663523214244844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05448972598533424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08646366057666442,0.0,0.08276904546135938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14966795248329612,0.0,0.0,0.11161105979773388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07186802880731345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07811059777708779,0.17657230829448553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1351503936689149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0834174020421597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08926941437434123,0.08475139425099991,0.0,0.08320664727177067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08798440818179656,0.04643406165298036,0.0,0.5718573867944405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468221083172474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718312541288034,0.07625645528969056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743993579204711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2290132401923687,0.12851847456434826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08065625057231282,0.0585754432983057,0.07377431032573821,0.08827514562523517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910956230246132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946492927191028,0.0,0.08451389665003181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07215487982782172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550943532383756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06352674115825238,0.06791069120028734,0.1476977724310092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056132087459512835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09853480064233634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0573638647110276,0.0,0.2476063842287353,0.08795814423232687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759675848919791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2460419108321575,0.1716094889356613,0.0,0.06002000509225085,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hello Teachers :)

I'm currently trying to complete my thesis for a psychology degree in Dublin!

Ok teachers, I have a uniquely tough situation. I am going to be (hopefully) starting my first year of teaching in the fall (finishing up my masters program this spring). I had originally planned on doing another masters program next year and therefore RSVPed ""yes"" to a week long trip in Italy in September, courtesy of my mother in law. Now that I'm planning on starting working August, I'm in a pretty bad position. Everything for this trip has been paid for, but I don't know how I am going to ask for an entire week off in the beginning of the year, during my first teaching position nonetheless. So, I need some advice. What should I do? When interviewing for jobs, do I tell them that I will be away for a week in September? Do teachers even get that many days off during the school year? SOS

TLDR: Starting teaching in the fall, have a week long trip planned in September that was NOT paid for by me. Don't know what to do.",4.551053540587219,6.302571393782388,5.324373056994818,79.8064214162349,70.81347150259067,8.255474956822107,32.55578583765112,8.841846274778883,2.894078687392056,801,38,144,15,15,260,104,193,0.02,0.9470000000000001,0.034,0.3591,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,1,8,6,4,0,0,11,2,19,0,0,3,0,14,37,6,0,4,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,2,0,2,7,3,2,0,2,5,0,15,2,32,28,1,51,0,0,0,0,5,18,0,2,25,97,23,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133965504316754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10963306820216273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14375376144814572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281632683466189,0.0,0.12880320496582026,0.0,0.11446676744803275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08841351908950795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054850604940724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12321017510775008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332221431464312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07162533334391671,0.0,0.15582600300995214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13616409044557018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360434571487497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506852428461147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426456402155305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13899058869880407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20330515854046746,0.0,0.0,0.14579975549461324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129701312344874,0.1394726704403718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13874523968742225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15409805899564588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2911049831545852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030767294297108,0.0,0.11982515590022867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4398703217568398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09980519624026396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4414163646162736

I feel like my observation was a failure! I teach HS agriculture, large class of freshmen and some seniors mixed in. So I had this really awesome lesson plan with a lab that went with it. I told my kids we’re going to have a visitor and it’s really important to me that y’all are good. I told them this Monday and Tuesday and was super excited because they all said yeah they got this. Well they didn’t. First, I had a kid cry and she didn’t want to talk or do anything. 2nd, multiple kids were tardy. 3rd, They didn’t listen to what I was saying or on thief phones after I tapped their desks, my sign to put it up! So when it came time for them to do each station they were lost and were asking me questions while I was doing a mini lab where I was teaching to small groups. The one glorious light out of all of this is that they stayed seated when the bell rang and waited until I dismissed. 2nd period came and it was awesome! They are generally my worst class.

teaching,hippohunta91,2020/02/14,"Am I in the wrong here? This is going to be kind of like an ""Am I The Asshole"" posts, but for something that happened with one of my students in my class today and I can't stop thinking about it.

So I am a male, 2nd year teacher and I teach middle school English (mostly 8th grade and one 7th grade class). I teach in a low income area (99% of all students received free/reduced lunch). We are a low achieving school in terms of test scores in our district.

So we are currently reading a novel in class and we listen to the audio recording on audible while taking notes and all that. To ensure that students are on task reading, I patrol the classroom with a 3 ft long ruler and when students are looking elsewhere or lost, I point in their book where they're supposed to be reading. It allows me to reach them from further away and point exactly where we need to be.

There is a student who moved to this school and district just 3 weeks ago (from a higher income area) sits right in the front because he is often a behavioral issue and needs to be constantly re-directed. He is off task, mouthing to people across the classroom, and overall not following along so I, as I do with all the other students, point in his novel where we are supposed to be.

Instead of doing anything that I would have expected, he grabs the ruler and starts trying to shake it. Surprised by this I pull the ruler back and he lets go, at which point I try to point back at the book to where we are reading. However, he hasn't moved his hand at all and my ruler strikes the back of his hand.

He then slams his book closed, drops it on his desk, and takes all of his stuff and throws it into his backpack then stands up very quickly. I look at him and he says, ""just kidding..."" then sits down, takes out his phone, and doesn't look up. At this point I am fairly concerned because I literally ""struck a child with a ruler"".

I ask him to open his book and read and he replies, ""No fucking way I'm doing that.""

We continue listening until we get to the activity where we write some annotations and the students work independently. At this point I ask him to step outside and I assure him that he is not in trouble. He reluctantly goes.

Outside he refuses to make eye contact and I apologize to him telling him that I was simply doing what I do with all the students by pointing to where he needed to be reading and him refusing is what caused this whole ordeal. I also assured that I, in no way, was trying to harm or disrespect him but just by accident ended up lightly tapping his hand.

He said, ""I was just about to swing on you for doing that."" To which I was very confused but said he can take the period to sit in the back, on his phone to cool off.  So he did that. But I still wonder, am I in the wrong for what I did? And, perhaps more importantly, could I be in serious trouble for what I did? I mean I didn't do that out of punishment or spite or anything, but it did in fact happen.


TL;DR
Student wasn't reading, accidentally hit him with a pointer/ruler. He jumped up like he was going to fight me.",5.050251604621309,5.3263595951219544,5.534199828840394,84.21095314505776,68.4959349593496,8.164741121095423,30.330551989730424,7.85451343220497,1.8625121951219508,2401,87,493,26,38,772,263,615,0.115,0.8190000000000001,0.066,-0.9877,4,0,1,0,1,0,80.0,10,1,2,3,28,22,4,2,29,1,50,7,5,4,10,91,82,45,0,6,15,0,4,2,0,1,0,7,0,3,32,45,1,3,3,13,0,13,9,15,0,2,14,17,71,7,92,57,11,107,0,3,4,1,71,61,1,9,27,353,103,36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061016035243361036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055045485159789145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113286894015062,0.0,0.12869856515909706,0.0,0.06467058729402114,0.2117123894222815,0.0,0.08391954982952357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07071014353221107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438369521690373,0.0,0.05495730982084255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06096534139320778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06363472180778536,0.03596224467947292,0.0,0.11735762863596075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12173705821555325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184345529213844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07167866457826003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038609910141701,0.0,0.06725636049455185,0.0,0.0,0.06091477328237375,0.17340639561534707,0.0,0.075139022932861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04594636160975341,0.0,0.0,0.07497898907728873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14631653320288848,0.0,0.1531157241724507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0932856375746216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04771992719467777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5205532000300539,0.0,0.06592269929073158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4819592883279615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05878274953190105,0.13095132007485275,0.0547385256215415,0.0,0.20898710099371445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052990775165852884,0.0,0.0,0.04872013919689571,0.0,0.054969882973404036,0.05754721915529204,0.0,0.0,0.07879697318942072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20701449565126076,0.0,0.060162813547394126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04410521468787497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06524535101204859,0.0,0.0,0.14019865459702438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11358837215346435,0.0,0.10927238640219873,0.055213439853405835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684925116690111,0.0,0.0,0.07464612672440209,0.05011102524634913,0.0,0.0,0.04889677502977166,0.15051550338146644,0.0,0.04432600190111954
teaching,cincophone89,2020/02/14,"Looking for perspective Hi there,

First year teacher at a Title I middle school. Currently, I'm in a mental health spiral that's hard to pinpoint, but seems to be related to my failure to control my emotions in front of the class. I'm curious to hear what people think and what advice you can offer. Also wishing everyone out there the best before February break!

Back in October, I dropped an F bomb with my 8th graders. I certainly didn't mean to, but I lost it when about 50% of my class was absent for 20 minutes and returned, giggling, with bags of popcorn which they began eating and spilling on my floor. ""Guys, what the fuck,"" I blurted out in a moment of abject, pure frustration. 

What was odd about it was that in the moment, it just came out of my mouth like I was having an out-of-body experience.

This week, something similar happened. I was reading out of a book to explain a part of a worksheet to students. Nobody was doing what I asked despite repeated requests. After waiting for them to be quiet, I threw the book in my hand against the floor at my feet and launched into a tirade about the importance of education, and how if my students preferred, I would be happy to sit in my chair and not teach them for the rest of the year. Of course, I also stated that I did NOT want to do that.

The principal confronted me about all this after a student gave a report to a counselor, as he should have. He seemed relatively supportive but stressed how important it was to be a role model for proper behavior. I am of course remorseful and want to make things right, but I'm scared of how I've lost control so quickly (it's like I go from a 3 to a 10 with NO WARNING or way to detect it psychologically). 

Needless to say that before I started teaching I was a relatively normal person who had never done anything like this in any professional context. I'm a career changer with success in another field. And right now I'm regretting the choice I made, because I am suffering.

What the hell is going on? Can anybody relate to this or help me? I care about kids, other people, and education.

I feel like I'm doomed and that every card is stacked against me.",6.0873159144893085,6.282862643705468,6.729619002375298,76.80843325415678,66.26840855106889,9.396332541567695,34.179667458432306,9.174902378510234,3.0143297102137767,1707,73,317,28,25,562,226,421,0.142,0.723,0.135,-0.4708,1,0,1,0,0,0,51.0,0,1,3,7,18,22,4,2,29,0,28,6,3,8,4,57,62,25,0,9,10,0,3,4,0,2,1,3,0,3,26,20,1,3,7,3,0,5,5,11,0,1,19,7,37,11,68,37,4,51,2,5,1,1,20,23,2,5,22,227,63,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11271793579855245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18448948042312155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07844143415142807,0.12095372862106303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09492259063081028,0.0,0.10783596215238636,0.0,0.0,0.08869644033991267,0.0,0.07031582199906243,0.0,0.1963074033658745,0.0,0.12105190388729264,0.0,0.0,0.12812699459540494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13192879353182135,0.11760623099326023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2587479470257888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11804231408488056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11803106265413885,0.0,0.12975236190277026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09718670404383073,0.1102211356201607,0.0,0.1128336839695878,0.0,0.0,0.058324038223313814,0.08240551533175228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09811599893590132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066385074916576,0.0,0.0,0.13111125503988558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11421387616753614,0.10200294607827903,0.12279140377953375,0.10333025615639306,0.0,0.0,0.12261084104594998,0.1300069692786864,0.0,0.07731615963698464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254152355415003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09686430454212686,0.0,0.2518346284012958,0.0,0.0,0.10914623359526876,0.07699650894264856,0.0,0.0,0.1256491308720885,0.0,0.0,0.11624489675745014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08896443979113829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11301775769251494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12491197898494907,0.0,0.1599372691224185,0.10071850130778016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538044846082607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970152299957394,0.0,0.09173034011536907,0.11548470538987946,0.11673958232160946,0.0,0.21001921960080105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.088801475263481,0.0,0.0,0.08164478104321861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321321570438064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13089694302140095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07663290512967331,0.07391113111362257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13607193281556593,0.09155885234463723,0.09252619721089524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326459256598743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194078581942135,0.0,0.0,0.1485622487699619

I will finish this summer my bachelor in Economy and Politics in Montreal, Canada. I speak French and English. However, I do not have a bachelor in teaching.  


I'm really interested in teaching abroad, (more specifically in the USA for personal reasons) however i do not know much about it. I have some friends who did it but mostly went to Asia. I'm just wondering if anyone that taught abroad or know about it could give me some tips or instruct me about this long process i.e. (how to apply, what do i need, requirements, salary, how much should i save etc.)

teaching,rebecca_pm,2020/02/15,"Advice for a public class on climate change aimed at kids and their parents. For one of my class assignments (Conservation Biology) I am hosting a class at a local community center to answer questions and educate children and their parents about climate change. Specifically focusing on the radiation budget, albedo effect, and the carbon cycle (I will touch on consequences, but in a very sensitive way so I dont upset the kids).

I need to keep this class simple, but I also need it to be fun and engaging. I think I can keep it relatively simplified, but I have only a few ideas about how to keep it fun. I was curious about any advice you all might have. The budget for teaching aides is somewhat limited. Probably about 75-150 dollars. I will have a laptop with projection capabilities, but I want to heavily restrict the use of power points for the sake of maintaining attention. If I use my laptop it would probably be more for notes and cute graphics, cartoons, or some kind of educational games.

Mostly, I want the kids engaged and having fun. Suggested activities or experiments focused on these topics would be incredibly useful.

 Planning about 60-90 minutes for the event. Could do it for longer, but kids have short attention spans so I want to try and keep it relatively short. Overall my goal is to educate on fundamentally what climate change is. Where I am from people don't have very good education or oppurtunities, so my hope is by preparing these kids and their parents they will be more equipped to challenge climate change deniers.",7.419452438049562,8.658200161870509,7.9211031175059965,65.78047162270185,63.568345323741006,11.069864108713029,36.30775379696243,10.980518767755715,4.462598880895285,1247,58,197,34,18,412,150,278,0.039,0.797,0.16399999999999998,0.9890000000000001,4,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,4,6,11,11,0,1,14,0,28,0,0,5,1,51,42,23,0,10,9,3,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,10,10,0,7,7,1,3,0,2,1,0,1,1,1,24,10,35,30,7,17,0,0,0,0,18,15,0,10,1,143,34,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21673888520363815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08868607297371063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07541527828428103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4692667162081302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08854401001393107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1299730698809045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10848072537761176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09301701129703188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11014795681342203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12519173028878566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3942893192504499,0.0,0.11548448086146446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11764655619074392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644607454842354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514818733385929,0.08434386059348283,0.0,0.0,0.3694214076688556,0.0,0.0,0.07688356153465069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10483561674166188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23913625041409725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12423251641342326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105974771546615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752932965426356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2873439800640488,0.0,0.18300695565720995,0.1962337148277217,0.08802664565809071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15755926016025878,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,esmelcor,2020/02/15,"Is Mastery Learning possible in Science? I teach science to 11-16year olds in the UK. I love the idea of Mastery Learning, not moving on until students have ""mastered"" the topic. I see it working successfully in the Maths department with the help of Sparx. I think it would build students' self esteem and resilience to implement mastery in science for example how can you teach fractional distillation if the class is still confused on states of matter, boiling points, mixtures etc... It's just going to make them feel bad at science when in reality they're just missing a puzzle piece which they never got the time to master.

However after scratching my head for awhile I don't think it's possible there is too much content and you have to be ready for scheduled assesments and data drops and also individual students will master concepts at different rates and planning for this seems impossible. Also in my school homework is knowledge organisers so I can't set homework.

Basically - has anyone done it? Or got any ideas on how to implement it in your classroom without getting behind?",7.541937026703867,9.107350367875656,7.441450777202076,68.15371861299325,63.45595854922279,9.461777600637703,39.19848545237147,9.661875296680813,4.26758780390594,883,47,130,17,13,282,127,193,0.040999999999999995,0.8859999999999999,0.073,0.7383,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,3,2,6,11,5,0,1,8,0,14,4,2,3,1,29,26,14,0,2,6,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,8,6,1,0,9,0,0,3,5,3,0,0,3,3,13,2,30,20,3,27,0,1,1,2,8,13,1,5,8,96,21,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652320389389676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1127716413400044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11595379039896345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384630322714778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1732594436183596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16970400466195393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18494683505001916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08384978667425995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08664052513544218,0.0,0.09424630993138618,0.0,0.2652624569013968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17019176839668115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11115388593656687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3744089321965457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14967011294312893,0.0,0.11069433883820347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1762534761898714,0.12190581136450734,0.0,0.1279000824586277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17401308851665684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15676511231959533,0.3739019721703079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678311271354386,0.13214686183144084,0.15096748525535453,0.17299924132641306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13243387808236587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21251726613995725,0.0,0.0,0.09669813975054373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159856406289134,0.0,0.12072787950573285,0.0,0.0,0.1178024982524835,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Brewmentationator,2020/02/15,"I got the job! Last year, I was a first year teacher. I had a part time gig at a fairly rough and tumble school. Although it was title 1, we taught in the IB framework for all levels of classes. I really like IB. I liked the kids, and I really enjoyed the classroom; however, I had a lot of concerns with some stuff that was out of my control. I also had some serious issues with my contract not being honored and constantly changed without my approval or any notice.

I stuck it out for the year, but I resigned. It was also an issue that the part time position paid less than subbing, and I was worried about paying my bills the next year.

Anyways, I spent this past school year subbing and checking out the differences between middle school and high school, IB vs AP vs standard classes, and Title I vs standard schools. It was a pretty solid experience and helped me figure out a lot of stuff about myself and teaching in general.

I had two interviews last week, and I just got the call that a school wants me to start by the end of the month. I'm hyped! I'm teaching the same two classes I taught last year, but now I'll be full time!. I'm using the IB framework again. I also have a couple old classmates who teach at the school.

The only bummer is that I will have to quit my tutoring job. I'll miss those kiddos. Hopefully, I'll get to work with them over the summer.",4.300913823019087,5.293267446886446,5.098665895508002,84.0994042799306,70.5018315018315,7.5056101792943934,28.65413533834587,7.669130373188453,1.7154219780219782,1075,39,210,12,19,349,142,273,0.069,0.87,0.061,0.4191,3,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,1,0,1,6,9,8,0,0,25,0,16,0,0,2,1,41,32,17,0,2,9,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,13,18,0,1,1,0,5,0,2,3,0,3,17,1,28,5,28,12,10,37,0,2,0,0,7,13,0,6,26,145,41,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2063200586353428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05848225512712291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878145733865756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097551730996932,0.0,0.0,0.09293434520024876,0.09645516821103388,0.0,0.0951562351493377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08985062968377541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07616957003501804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08412350391381082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07315068807570288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04493091733977805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13756248021063275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057643303214098364,0.09086264357000956,0.0,0.08541639119611286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17952118283526586,0.1706814346934488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21030193940127975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08402951486729368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462265141277377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06864356500156919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09146089039241727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979104082191853,0.09024146245603762,0.0,0.0,0.06540609921295837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18625702863436527,0.08209575697129158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874918793972592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09147050057889962,0.0,0.0,0.110186296863539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6092489100225467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0608705203623648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1968965130265867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15044008968955375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16801701376681952,0.0,0.0,0.07427550638569226,0.0,0.0,0.0507244262974492,0.0,0.06898319401942693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289994740893948,0.0,0.06260828135793227,0.08733613822650083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3322831394713545
teaching,coffeeanddoggo,2020/02/15,"Colleague arrested for child pornography I found out yesterday that a band director a few counties over (who I went to college with for several years and have spoken to at least once a week for the this whole school year) was arrested on 20 counts of child pornography, including operating an account that distributed such materials.

I am a graduate out of a California state university with a bachelors degree in business management. Right now I am working full-time, while running an Internet marketing business on the side (not fulfilling). 

I certainly have a drive for educating others, specifically in business. And I can see myself as a professor. I love talking to people, meeting new people, and have always had the desire to teach others. 

My questions are; how is the professor work/life? How is the pay at accredited universities?

teaching,elderknight,2020/02/16,"Should I apologize to a student? For context, I am the welding teacher at a high school in an area with a large population of Native American students. Most of these students live on the reservation with no running water, no electricity, and many of them only get to eat, bathe, and wash their clothes at school. Many of them feel like they have no future. Finding weapons, drugs, or alcohol on students isn't uncommon either. 

The othe day in my classroom I say this student pull out, what appeared to me, some brass knuckles out of his backpack and put it in his pocket. He knew that I might have seen something so he quickly went into the welding shop. I notified administration and security immediately. It took them about ten minutes to get to my class. They pulled him out of the shop searched his clothes, backpack, school locker, and welding locker but couldn't find anything. He explained that wat I saw was just some scrap metal he had cut four holes in for cutting practice and it's in one of the steel scrap bins in the shop. Myself and security went through all of the scrap bins, but could not find anything resembling what either the student or myself had described. In my shop there are a lot of places to hide something that small, so he could have hid it anywhere. 

I feel like I know what I saw but because we didn't find anything, I'm second guessing myself. Administration says I did nothing wrong and that they talked to him about how things may have looked to me. I've never had a problem with this student before either. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do and most students that take my class genuinely want to learn to weld in hopes of being able to leave the area and make a better life for themselves. Should I apologize to the student, or just let it go and move on? 

P.S. Sorry for any mistakes. I'm dyslexic and on mobile.",5.243881019830027,6.589278067988669,5.193287252124649,82.97855410764875,68.60339943342777,7.461031161473088,31.40045325779037,7.699297019823105,2.0567421869688403,1470,61,275,16,25,457,179,353,0.057999999999999996,0.8390000000000001,0.10400000000000001,0.9662,0,0,4,0,0,0,39.0,1,0,7,1,9,14,3,0,18,0,24,7,0,2,2,64,49,21,0,9,12,0,2,2,0,4,4,2,1,0,18,20,3,2,10,5,4,10,9,7,0,4,13,8,36,7,50,27,9,37,0,0,4,1,25,23,0,13,6,189,54,16,0.10871224680911623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11618033033353355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07392805573198802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2683827487204912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06626997662424303,0.0,0.09250611499923736,0.0,0.0,0.09614714789563313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17359576616209274,0.0,0.0,0.07011040565209306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1260716924444773,0.1112397685278946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993635684844867,0.15532810168433325,0.0,0.0,0.39744409638049394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17039298607573392,0.0,0.061783675136331574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975879618731898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11486045747035632,0.0,0.10797579052048052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059745407775421075,0.0,0.0,0.11511057256158015,0.0,0.11116563784238877,0.07678667492437065,0.10622262504648416,0.0,0.09599490563314013,0.0,0.0912909074406596,0.0,0.0,0.09242326465037554,0.0981170471547217,0.0,0.07256626890951619,0.22043431040520087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532651421056403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11554391384121115,0.0,0.0,0.083845586636621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10431233279885717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07366623193291832,0.08268056245979111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.113581159693271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10402293828669687,0.0,0.10928583456720996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17290468410539026,0.0,0.33006779292205835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1673839975869911,0.0,0.12169445990006834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173808019440844,0.08737878603844786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07222358620310232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078330624724055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412129980520855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20155468386689065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23771955190271502,0.0,0.0
teaching,MrsVlikestoteach,2020/02/16,"A student threw a chair at me Help me please, I’m using an alternate account because some coworkers know my original one.


Background:

I have a student who is pushing me over the edge. I just can’t take it anymore. I see her for an hour every other day during her music time. She has no IEP but has a personal para due to behaviors. The last 4 years the school has tried to get her tested for OCD, Autism, oppositional defiance and a few others. Her parents refuse to meet/speak with us or have her see anyone who can help diagnose her. I’ve called home and emailed with no return.

The last 6 weeks since we got back from winter break have been incredibly difficult. She has SCREAMED at the top of her longest during every single class for the entire class period. She threw a chair at me Friday because she wasn’t “it” during our game. She bit a kid last week because she was using a blue crayon instead of red (it didn’t matter what color they are using- I even stated that). When she is screaming or throwing a fit our special ed teacher has told me it is against the law for me to remove her from the room, and if I punish/discipline her I could lose my job. Is this true? This child doesn’t have an IEP and is 100% disruptive for the other 29 kids in my classroom. We have done NOTHING in regards to music since Christmas. We can’t sing with her screaming at the top of her lungs, we can’t play games because she attacks people if they get her our or if she isn’t it, the last time we got instruments she picked up at $300 xylophone and tossed it on the ground, and we don’t do worksheets because she will rip them up and rip other peoples up in her anger spells. 

What do you do? In my 8 years of teaching I’ve never seen one child take hostage of everyone else’s education. These are 3rd graders and they have been dealing with this since kindergarten.

teaching,cherry_kiss,2020/02/16,"About to become a 2nd semester teacher Hello everyone! I applied to a job at a small university for the 2nd semester and I got it. I'm going to be teaching Chinese as an optional to 1st year and 2nd year students. Apparently they don't know very much, since it's an optional course and they're not usually very intensive.

I have no real experience as a teacher and am very nervous. I applied knowing this because I want at least the experience, but now I'm very uncertain about everything. I don't know how I should act inside the classroom (as my age is close to theirs), if I will be able give classes that range from 2h to 4h long or even how to prepare them, how I should communicate with them...

I also didn't have a lot of time to prepare, as the time between accepting the position and having to start wasn't a lot.

Can anyone give me any advice?

teaching,jaevidubs,2020/02/17,"Looking to quit, need advice I'm a first year teacher. In fact, I just graduated in December and started teaching my 5th grade class in January. 

And.. I hate it. I hated my internship in different grades and schools as well. I realized I hated teaching when I was way too far into my degree so I just decided to push forward and hope I warm up to it. I didn't.

Each day going into my classroom is a nightmare. The school is in a bad area and we have no supplies, plus I never get done with any lessons due to all the fighting between students. A girl broke her ankle in a fight the other day and I've had things thrown at me and been punched. Admins just shrug and mention that it's a bad school so they cant do much to help. And then they keep talking about how I need to improve my lesson plans - the things I never get to teach anyway because of all the chaos. So far I've had a new student added to my class every week I've been there, which is just more chaos on top of everything. 

I'm exhausted. I'm crying in my classroom daily. I know it takes a special person to be a teacher, and I just don't think I'm cut out for it. 

How do I approach leaving? Do I just talk to the school district and give my two weeks? Do I go through the principal? Will they even let me end my contract? Can I get a job somewhere that isn't a school with just an Elementary Edu bachelors?

I'm at the end of my rope here. I was ready to apply at McDonalds because I just need to be doing something else. I know I should try to make it to the end of the school year but honestly I don't think my mental wellbeing can handle that. 

Any advice is appreciated. And bless all of you teachers, you aren't paid or appreciated nearly enough for all you do. 

For context, I'm located in Tampa, FL.",1.795458662714097,3.5794522201086987,3.6373517786561287,88.84664690382084,78.42934782608695,6.417127799736496,25.010210803689066,7.348242739294969,1.1032561594202894,1379,51,296,18,33,464,188,368,0.078,0.828,0.09300000000000001,0.8047,2,0,1,0,3,0,37.0,1,3,3,6,22,16,6,0,22,0,31,1,0,3,7,54,60,23,0,5,10,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,13,20,0,1,8,0,1,5,9,10,1,2,9,2,44,6,46,46,8,44,1,1,1,0,17,22,0,2,18,204,57,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18553918176293274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911839988604404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15853387392279478,0.11574324872316917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10428187307812284,0.12245071649088099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09918709109544996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09715168315295353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930618819371116,0.0,0.2522532599388836,0.09809345225777667,0.0,0.06270381247750025,0.0,0.07998701102349423,0.0,0.08532164750526995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075184322464188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14879919061894228,0.09107050638625576,0.10790773805282887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2811866034328989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06363307176657257,0.0,0.0,0.0942920868159846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094208549627439,0.08438277884798799,0.0,0.0,0.10434782000040756,0.0,0.0,0.10052268243736966,0.0,0.09707768680240064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07972166842596026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06336999150407087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09567236516396034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06978830454696698,0.2111797713681889,0.14643977684567813,0.09168901977698284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08289376570216782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10097528426229836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5764770201791463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07308576467002321,0.0,0.0,0.06719563201124165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137946494034869,0.1526106553940885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12614147352101027,0.12166130166278726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06445477755239447,0.0,0.09273790795193652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535515278392513,0.15230260207059007,0.0,0.08535815726627395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12227032850788765

teaching,Jmess98,2020/02/19,"Is the high cost of entry worth it for teaching? I am currently about to graduate from undergrad with a bachelor's in History and have wanted to be a teacher for years. The college I went to (the best one that I could afford due to instate tuition) did not have educational licensure programs for undergrad and so in order to become a teacher I undoubted will need to either seek out a master's program that offers licensure or join a program like Teach for America (which I've heard doesn't properly prepare you). Many of these programs seem quite expensive and I have already been told that there are far less scholarship opportunities for grad school. I am very reluctant to have to take out student loans as I feel that I would be stuck with those for decades. I honestly do want to be a teacher and I feel like I would be a good one, but is it worth it if every option seems like it will either leave me improperly prepared or sandbagged by debt for much of my career?",11.57313216195569,7.617232470588237,10.982582123758595,63.90395721925135,58.518716577540104,14.535981665393429,45.430863254392655,12.28987398476788,5.4161205500381975,780,35,141,18,7,256,116,187,0.043,0.8240000000000001,0.134,0.9104,3,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,4,3,7,0,0,10,0,22,0,0,0,1,27,34,10,0,7,7,0,2,3,0,4,0,1,0,0,11,8,0,0,4,0,8,1,2,0,0,2,6,3,14,7,29,19,5,11,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,6,6,104,25,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093820938966186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20955220801759156,0.0,0.0,0.19911974469392849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15149143391686748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15986358805946385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1918758355318076,0.13554983149631075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1591443669405956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2004700435641302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20090657833282227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780911909051996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923659228911068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13948025594040206,0.14068932586475302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25714459179494065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018111570984185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19202635465525186,0.0,0.345463161212779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14266037989314476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813040826271974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565548371081757,0.2238263724251025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17589028089052375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695707845714573,0.0,0.0,0.12218592230392845

So I want to teach high school math/physics, hopefully the AP/honors classes.  I am a engineering major planning on switching to education and a math minor.  Then I plan on getting a masters in education and credentials in one of the two subjects.  Is this enough to teach what I want to teach, or would I have to switch into a math or physics major to get a teaching job I want? Does the major matter essentially?

I thought I could handle it but I've been struggling every day since August to try and catch up. I have chest pains headaches and naseuated all day every day. I've asked everyone and even my admin for help. Weve exhausted all options and the behavior is still horrible. I truly feel I am dying every day. I am gridlocked with stress and they expect to have my online program finished, lesson plans organized and my entire portfolio completed all in the next two weeks. I truly am at the brink of a heart attack and breaking down in tears in front of the kids every day. Prior to this I was a teacher at a small school where my class sizes were 6-13. I had behavior disorders there too but nothing compared to what I have to deal with. When do I put my health freedom sanity first? Please help .

I want it to be noted I love my CT and the students (for the most part) are awesome. I am incredibly thankful for my placement. 

I just don’t like teaching. I can plan lessons and have them go wonderfully but still not enjoy what I’m doing or feel like I’ve done a good job.  I can’t place exactly what it is but I just don’t think this is the career for me. 

I still have to submit EdTPA — a requirement to get a teaching license in my state and to graduate from my university. I have no motivation to do it because I don’t think this is what I want to do. 

I mostly feel totally lost and stupid for going into this degree and not absolutely falling in love with teaching like everyone in my cohort. 

I have less than 3 months left.

teaching,PennyPasta87,2020/02/19,"My behavior is going to get me fired: A Novel Ok I will start by saying I know this is an area in need of growth, and I go to therapy weekly. I’ve made incredible strides in recent years, but I am finding my work environment has shown me that I still have a ton more work to put in. 

At any rate, I struggle with communication. I am very friendly and easy to get along with, but I’m quite direct. I was the only girl amongst 5 older brothers raised by a single, New York catholic mother. Because we were latchkey kids my mom never knew one of my brothers was not super brotherly. So I turned to drinking/pills and all kinds of self-destructive behavior (I’ll spare you the eye rolling details). I didn’t get my life on track until my mid 20’s, and I did not start therapy and sober up until I was 29. 

So now I am 32 in my first year teaching. I am a mod/severe SPED teacher, and I love my job more than anything. I have gotten great marks on all my observations and lesson plans, but I received a ‘needs improvement’ in the area of staff rapport. I really want to emphasize that I know my inability to modify my communication style is the common denominator here, HOWEVER I also work with (amongst dozens of brilliant teachers/staff members) some notoriously challenging individuals. Below are the incidents that led

2. Was reported daily by a paraprofessional for being condescending. She wouldn’t read the lesson plans, which I would reference. When she wouldn’t understand my direction I would ask her if she read the lesson plans. She would say no, and I would ask her to take 5 to read the plan. 

3. Asked for a new intern support provider because mine was consistently  inappropriate with a student and would consistently give me incorrect information. 

So I accepted my poor score in the area (I passed the evaluation overall), and continued on with my job. 

4. Now today I messed up (medium sized mess up). I was repeatedly scolded by my peer, and I expressed how ineffective yelling at me is. I assured her I would never make the same mistake, but repeating the same thing over and over again is not productive. I told her my blood pressure is raised and I need to be alone to breathe. I leave.

Then I get a call from administration 🤦‍♀️ 

My inability to communicate effectively while I am feeling attacked could cost me my job. So I guess this is a shout-out to the trauma informes teachers out there. Am I out of hope, or is there a strategy that has worked for you (I’ve tried a gazillion, but I will take more!)

Thanks and sorry for the length!",3.965199032738095,5.865722636718752,5.251004464285714,79.1280729166667,72.6328125,8.469940476190478,28.792038690476193,9.107695989026183,2.487485900297619,2098,85,402,46,42,698,266,512,0.098,0.79,0.11199999999999999,0.8953,5,1,1,0,1,0,63.0,1,2,0,18,15,20,1,2,29,1,43,5,3,5,5,75,78,33,0,16,10,5,2,0,1,10,1,3,1,2,8,23,0,0,14,4,2,7,9,8,0,4,15,6,76,12,59,50,10,62,0,0,1,1,33,25,0,5,30,273,84,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08647070254343918,0.0,0.0667671095460158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05677622176530998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870534832125456,0.0,0.3122083917854017,0.09498219361961388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017897427964389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08525286314600405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666015776790693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042215170645946105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763085608433238,0.14203349988618824,0.0,0.0,0.06450434727654664,0.0,0.17448080423416795,0.08009143966202469,0.0948988474344096,0.0,0.0,0.09204827715294707,0.09197390494520634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08292464027594955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3314046958795264,0.0,0.0,0.08694223034126021,0.09176809771958992,0.0,0.0,0.17680820442462167,0.0,0.0,0.058971621003153875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535319538781618,0.07900047762373158,0.05573037915705804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09778275237998624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18572085066310848,0.1287856301315796,0.16127077550206048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05657514294709639,0.06349808477198306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0839307447999084,0.0,0.0888021403169685,0.2505384813546344,0.0,0.05348598145389556,0.0,0.08243653322005384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13278956942432926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08709852205808483,0.09432019927696812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09346048092951928,0.1181896339513972,0.0,0.06667540830211469,0.0,0.0,0.08728211970155814,0.0,0.0,0.0947437275437538,0.0,0.0,0.12554853017135148,0.0,0.0,0.07686658971743777,0.19095671645003068,0.0,0.055467201272263865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913897907783264,0.07977849598101237,0.0,0.056684388086875835,0.0908133991970677,0.0,0.0869162774890259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06888818642172738,0.04924470286109807,0.0,0.13394165848129014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24312753733563214,0.0,0.0,0.3558543984542284,0.0,0.0,0.1075299460465429

teaching,Papoki147,2020/02/20,"Am I in the wrong (topic about prep periods) Hello all! I have been substitute teaching while finishing up my masters/credential program and have my degree in Biology. I have been in a long term position for 4 weeks teaching high school biology, I have a 0 period at 6:45am, prep 2nd period, and classes until 2:00 pm (end of 5th period). 

The front office keeps assigning me to cover other teachers during my prep and during a 6th period class I don’t even have (2-2:54), which I would typically use to get grading and lesson plans done. Because of this all of my duties: lesson plans, grading, answering emails, setting up labs, ect has to be don’t during my own time. 

I asked the office about it and her response was because she would have to pay a teacher extra to cover the class, but not me... Does this seem fair? I’m taking on all of the former teachers responsibilities, but left with no preps, starting early, staying late, and teaching 2 extra classes a day. 

I just want to know if I’m just being “dramatic”. Thanks!

teaching,sleepybear10,2020/02/20,"Is it worth it to get a Masters in Teaching if I already have a Professional degree (J.D.)? I am living in the Bay Area (San Francisco) and have been an attorney for a few years. I have decided I want to change careers and teach elementary school. In the Bay (or in general), is it typically very advantageous to have a Masters in Teaching? Is a credential sufficient? I have heard that some schools are more reluctant to hire teachers with higher education because they are required to pay them more. If that is the case, would having a Masters on top of a J.D. actually be a bad idea? I'd prefer to just get a credential, but ultimately want to do what will be best in the long-run for job prospects. Any advice is appreciated!",5.74215027977618,6.564296388489209,7.072182254196644,71.86680255795365,67.12949640287768,10.782094324540367,35.588329336530784,10.746095033038511,4.030116866506795,574,28,107,16,9,196,87,139,0.037000000000000005,0.807,0.156,0.9481,1,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,2,7,1,3,0,0,14,0,20,0,0,0,0,17,25,6,0,6,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,6,3,0,1,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,7,2,18,19,5,10,0,0,0,0,3,9,0,4,1,77,13,11,0.0,0.0,0.22459217902091225,0.0,0.0,0.22489889350660813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539750929667086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156509180377966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19216476266510996,0.14029666575742816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24152712741098664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434670759137881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404866580877608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598101544323436,0.0,0.0,0.228387323569692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032257422752992,0.20367458129238208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4658460555820563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18989698960871346,0.2714956312029917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16349121311789044,0.0,0.0,0.14820838018596402
teaching,westiebutt44,2020/02/20,"Kids say the darndest things Today one of my students was building a staff using pvc connectors. And he asked myself and another student “hey guys! Want me to build you a THUNDER POON?” I said “run that by me again?” So he said “A THUNDER POON! A HARPOON THAT SHOOTS THUNDER” and I said “of course I want a thunder poon!”

so then he proceeded to ask me how many poons do I want in my thunder poon? have I ever wielded a thunder poon? what color poons I want? and finally, when it was time to go, he laid his thunder poon down gently and, with all the wisdom of a 9 yo said, “you have to be delicate with the poon”

So yeah. That’s why I became a teacher.

teaching,runningbree,2020/02/20,"Teachers in Phoenix, AZ- Insights for Potential New Teacher? A little bit of my background I'm in my mid-20s, and single. I have a B.S. in Poli-sci and a certificate in Socio-legal studies. For 4 years, I have worked in the legal field as a paralegal and legal assistant. The legal world stresses me out a ton, it's isolating, and I get no sense of fulfillment from my positions. Plus, I often have trouble sticking with firms long-term.

However, the pay is great, and I love the financial stability. I really want to buy a house and travel.

I'm currently subbing, and about to start a long-term assignment.  I'm already starting to see how much work goes into lesson prep, and classroom management. I love working with kids, and I'm considering an alt teaching cert. The pay is a huge factor for me though, not to mention the state of education here in AZ too. I want a career I like while being able to make a good living. Just not sure if teaching is a good path?

teaching,Kailiak9000,2020/02/21,"Students, who was the best teacher you have ever had, and what did they do for you? To answer my own question, I have the best teacher I have ever had right now. For some context, he also teaches my favorite subject, biology.

I mean, where do I even start? He's done so much for me this year that I feel like I've learned more in his class than I have the rest of my life! Well, I guess I'll start with the beginning of the year.

At the beginning of the year, he was automatically my favorite teacher because I raised my hand for something and HE ALREADY KNEW MY NAME! It was crazy, and I was honestly so happy :) No teacher has ever taken the time to learn their students' names BEFORE the school year had started, but this teacher did. You can imagine my surprise when, on the first day of school, I was called on without him having to look at the seating chart or ANYTHING! Plus, he pronounced it correctly, which is definitely not something people normally do. They see my name and want to pronounce it with an I sound instead of the correct a sound.

But anyway, I was really nervous for the school year because it was my first year in high school, and he really just took away the nervousness. He was super chill and talked to the students before class started. I never participated in this at the beginning of the year, though, because I thought it was weird, but after a bit, I realized that he genuinely cared about all of us and was just trying to find out the best ways to teach each one of us individually.

Once I began talking to him, he started seeing that I was one of the best students in the class. Like, I almost never get things wrong, and I often have intelligent conversations about topics that would generally be more AP oriented (a typical 12th-grade course) than Honors oriented with him. Because of this, he even let me audit one of his AP classes recently! It was honestly so cool that a teacher would take me three grade levels above where I am ""supposed"" to be just to give me the best education possible.

From the beginning of the year, he has given me worksheets from his AP class to work on, and I have really appreciated all of it. No other teacher has gone above and beyond like that to make sure that I am actually learning something in the classroom.

On a different note, he also has been grading the tests LIGHTNING fast! For example, we would sometimes take a test in first period and get the grade back by lunch! It was crazy! He is the hardest working teacher I have ever seen--in fact, he's probably the hardest working PERSON I have ever seen! Some days, he will stay after school as late as 6:00 just to finish grading papers or setting up a lab. The way he works so hard is crazy, and I'm really, REALLY impressed by it.

Speaking of tests, he also does something really special for each student. He will grade your paper and then write a little note at the top. He doesn't always do it, but the times he has done it, it has really meant a lot to me. In fact, the first one he wrote said, ""Every paper you submit becomes more and more proof that you are going places in life.""

He doesn't know how much that meant to me, but just by writing this on my paper, it gave me hope that I really WILL be able to get my Ph.D. when I'm an adult, and that I WILL be a researcher and professor at a university someday. It has meant so much to me, I can't even put it into words. But I am certain that I will remember this forever, and when I have tough days, I'll think of that note on my test and know that I can make it, know that I can do it, know that this is not the end.

And this isn't an experienced teacher, either. He is a first-year teacher and is doing all of this on his own. Yes, he makes mistakes. Fairly often, in fact. But the important part is that when he does, he corrects it immediately and clears everything up so that there are never any misconceptions left behind.

He is also the first teacher I have had who NEVER underestimates me. Sometimes he will overestimate what I can do, but for me, that is far better than underestimating me. He always respects me and believes that I know a lot of stuff. I've never had an adult in my life trust me with what I know. Everyone else has discounted my thoughts and opinions because of my age, gender, or other stereotypes, but he truly respects me, which makes me respect him even more.

Then there's the thing with how he talks to me now. Because I have started to talk to him like the other kids do, he has found that he can trust me with information that he couldn't trust with other kids, like how down he's feeling because of parents bombarding him with hate emails because of their kids' poor grades.

Anyways, he's done so much for me and my education this year, and I appreciate everything he's done more than words can describe. So, for the end of the year, I am writing him a thank-you note that I've been working on for a couple weeks now so that he knows he has made a difference and that people like me appreciate everything he's done during the year. The knowledge, humor, and great moods that I leave that class with gives me a great day every day, and I am really glad he's my teacher.

So, if by some odd chance you're on Reddit and see this post, thank you so much, Mr. Newcomb! You have done so much for me this year it's AMAZING!

Some of my colleagues and I have been asked by our administration: what specific modifications would we want in a new career building if the district were to build a new building specifically for tech classes at our school? 

What I’d like to know is:
What are some things about your room setup that make it easier to work with technology? What things could be improved?

What are some things you would say if asked the same thing?",4.122054545454546,7.168730660000005,4.4754545454545465,79.1677272727273,77.4,6.836363636363638,26.09090909090909,8.00094639256281,1.9127,446,17,76,8,11,140,70,100,0.0,0.892,0.10800000000000001,0.8736,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,3,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,10,0,0,1,0,15,17,3,0,6,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,0,11,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,7,1,12,11,4,7,0,0,1,0,9,4,0,5,4,52,18,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887966674246136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612392320470219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15425763582142105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061798401928502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09438969263291837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16224266138655874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12896513929851605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5597927470255398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153643538562125,0.0,0.1955327157361255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5134244874535646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139566975903345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14065477928757272,0.0,0.0,0.274493090727083,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,gaurava12,2020/02/21,"Is the education system broken or has the reason of learning simply been forgotten?   

The unemployment rates are rising, per capital income dropping, more businesses closing down, yet there are an increasing number of scholars graduating from college and universities across the world. Something isn’t right, yet most people seem to be overlooking the problem. The problem is linked to peer-pressure and the choice to opt for branded education as opposed to focusing on learning. In the past, learning was meant to enhance knowledge so as to help set up business, but today education is aimed at securing good jobs. This is great but restricts professional objectives resulting in over reliance on employment to generate income. This is the clear reason behind rising unemployment rates, low per capita income and the increasing business closures. The altered perception of education from learning and skill development to acquiring certification, has resulted in ignorance towards skill development, which is an important component associated to self-dependence. Now with the problem identified, it’s time for stakeholders to rethink study tips and focus on learning as opposed to acquiring certification.",14.067635933806145,14.058586851063836,12.64177304964539,41.63277777777779,50.17021276595745,16.015130023640662,54.39952718676122,14.554592549557764,8.773366903073287,1000,63,109,36,9,320,118,188,0.11900000000000001,0.782,0.099,-0.3,9,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,4,5,8,0,0,14,0,14,0,0,4,1,34,16,12,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,5,13,0,0,4,1,5,0,0,3,0,0,3,35,12,4,29,0,1,0,0,1,16,0,3,6,82,4,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18009054849805084,0.0,0.23672114527092736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14391717527007372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21306889597295725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20496725180865488,0.14885452213729322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6163522199468449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4415201520871701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18336319030392886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1954660770742298,0.22399182831783016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652960718657073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520050927154214,0.0,0.20352222053812447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,hoe4tomatoes,2020/02/21,"Student teaching vs 1st year teaching Did you feel like your performance during student teaching was an accurate predictor of how well you did your first year as a teacher?

I just began student teaching recently and feel like I'm doing terribly. I've taught three lessons to the class so far and I'd say only one went well. I'm finishing my program and have this terrible feeling like I've spent the last two years working towards something I might not be actually cut out for.

Basically, I'm wondering about the relationship between your student teaching experience, but any student teaching advice is welcome as well!",7.063175675675672,8.976367783783783,7.1491779279279255,68.51944256756758,64.85585585585585,9.874324324324323,42.703828828828826,10.125756701596842,5.066431531531531,508,32,75,12,8,163,77,111,0.040999999999999995,0.8009999999999999,0.158,0.8532,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.0,0,5,0,4,7,10,1,0,5,0,8,0,0,1,0,15,19,8,0,0,4,0,3,3,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,4,0,0,5,0,1,1,1,3,3,4,7,4,8,7,9,10,0,12,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,2,11,46,9,15,0.0,0.0,0.16785193499891193,0.0,0.0,0.16808116212579002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1169692056333326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1682537618719061,0.0,0.0,0.2609124818067191,0.3686409270470354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14630724921854768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14020692112189362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2520986643491254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1824699787124804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11655494718314276,0.13081744970136305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16983405211029873,0.18466885262089516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136785171406441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13241774749535615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1680237585783093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4639590883362693,0.15945023191910268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18653193747706787,0.12522158936222605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33229647852010163

teaching,FluffyMcCuddles,2020/02/21,"How do you regulate bathroom and water breaks with kids? Hi everyone!

So I work with 3rd graders and 6-8th graders in an after school program. We only have 90 minutes for the program so one of my main issues with the kids is bathroom and water breaks. My organization has a rule that only one child can leave the class at a time due to previous incidents. I made a bathroom pass for them to help with that.

My problem is now my kids go to the bathroom and basically disappear for 5-10 minutes. They’ve been found just walking around campus. I had talked to my supervisor and she had said to limit them to 2 minutes and if they take longer, they lose privileges.

The issue with this is some children take 2 and a half to 3 minutes so I don’t know if I’d cut them off for that. But today, I had a kid take 7 minutes and then when I told him he lost privileges, he kinda threw a fit. A lot of kids also come up to me saying it’s an emergency and I don’t want any accidents to happen during class.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle these situations? What do you do when kids need bathroom/water breaks and take too long?",3.1026280193236744,4.533878373913048,4.528115942028986,85.35685990338165,73.95652173913044,7.371980676328503,25.82125603864734,7.984000788550335,1.4450966183574874,886,30,183,13,18,295,132,230,0.084,0.8640000000000001,0.052000000000000005,-0.736,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,2,5,4,12,6,1,0,14,0,16,2,0,3,0,34,32,22,0,5,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,7,18,2,1,2,0,0,6,2,4,0,3,10,2,23,2,28,22,3,25,0,2,0,0,26,7,0,5,9,119,30,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495606756568269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12239565579417465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20816126214633432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701754037314602,0.0,0.0,0.1362487586195648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318407745997554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13393686580631273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14624777679104453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1678136547706022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698299765276425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13534340765181233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102587551773167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31949311735467445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841133948866846,0.0,0.0,0.16206000437556325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1354462332706627,0.0,0.17122607615318525,0.1670743742362226,0.1301193655833041,0.0,0.14482153462320496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11348614343262667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074240376659303,0.23280593634159305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14645012581170702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455875323030386,0.12171311999896753,0.0,0.15489682883404876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720368981428308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4603043261510864,0.12301742691920706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08924587147307639,0.0,0.14507543173539708,0.14624777679104453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09027405472629206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11142370313825097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,whatsYOURtruth,2020/02/22,"Issues with African American Students I teach students who relate everything back to slavery and racism who:

1. Failed the entire Civil War unit. 
2. Do not know what the 13th amendment is.
3. Want a Black Student Union for one purpose. Parties.
4. Refuse to put their phones away during instruction and blame whites when they fail.
(Please, stop throwing away your education when so many people have fought for you).
5. Cannot name important historical figures, events, or court trials involving equal rights for African Americans with the exception of Rosa Parks and MLK.
6. Do not take interest in their culture's history.

Students, if you don't understand these concepts, explain how racism and slavery affect you. What do those words really mean to you? You are doing a great disservice to yourself and your community and it's painful to watch. What will help you change?

teaching,trylikeafool,2020/02/22,"Becoming a private school teacher I have some questions for anyone who can answer. I’m thinking about going into teaching as a second career (I’m 39). I’ve fallen in love with the classical model and the idea of teaching in that environment. Problem is, my degree is in communication (film &amp; TV). I know private schools don’t require teachers to have a teaching degree, and the classical model doesn’t jive with the modern teaching methods taught in universities. So I’m not sure what help that would be, and I really don’t want to go back to school for such a low paying job. 

So considering my degree, what steps would I need to take to get a job teaching middle school and high school at a private school? Can I study whatever I want to teach on my own and become an expert, or will that not be good enough? Will my college transcript be a factor in getting hired? I went through some rough patches in college and have a messy transcript. While I have a lot of A’s, I failed a couple of classes because I missed the drop date, and have a ton of classes I withdrew from because I realized I wasn’t cut out for that field of study. Probably changed my major a half dozen times...it’s not exactly pretty. 

Am I dead in the water as far as a teaching career?",5.776815114709848,6.088437072874495,6.40608906882591,78.46303373819165,66.93522267206478,8.529986504723345,33.06585695006747,8.238735603445708,2.522032334682861,995,41,185,12,15,326,134,247,0.146,0.823,0.031,-0.9748,2,0,1,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,2,5,8,1,0,21,0,21,2,0,0,2,33,38,14,1,6,4,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,7,11,1,1,6,2,1,5,7,5,0,3,3,1,19,3,33,28,7,25,0,3,0,1,4,15,0,5,4,126,26,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276286632038003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236360243421788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090575543884229,0.0,0.1436110355009538,0.2601862216633397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12460937219570807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303357108931414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12171165411380686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308395857340106,0.0,0.1338889496474824,0.0987991773625254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895416302302816,0.124454768778331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13297395597484496,0.0,0.0,0.2337827478369584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06473595068325531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10014339386354612,0.1063127788778396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873420148406155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1198378254532923,0.1270007737779551,0.11271198998536686,0.0,0.0,0.13195511500716547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546121023942184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7152768107316747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11101850579551154,0.0,0.08856567434101674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07547699630401555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13895472326640934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919528848001228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16735353106511186,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Cairopractor,2020/02/22,"Student Teaching vs. First Year Enjoyment So, yesterday /u/hoe4tomatoes [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/f75mb6/student_teaching_vs_1st_year_teaching/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) about being a student-teacher and feeling like they're not good at it and being concerned about that. 

I feel I'm somewhat in the reverse situation because I'm student teaching now and I feel I'm not bad at the job, and will only continue to get better, but I don't know how much I actually like it. I feel pretty confident about my lessons and my field mentor has been really encouraging of my teaching, but student-teaching feels impossible sometimes, especially because my undergraduate work is full-time and I have to get certified (which is an arduous process in itself in my state). 

I'm working with 7th graders right now and it's very hit-or-miss for me. I was given the opportunity to basically take over a 6th/7th grade creative writing class and design their semester from scratch and I'm sincerely enjoying it. But on top of that I'm also being expected to take over the 7th grade ELA class and I'm much less stoked about that. Part of it might just be that I don't like teaching things I haven't designed/being thrown into the middle of things, but I'm kind of dreading taking that class over.

I guess what I'm asking is, how did you enjoy your student-teaching vs. your first year experience and beyond? Did things get better? Worse? Do you feel you were able to make an informed decision based off of your student-teaching?",7.63798235058163,8.958768805054152,7.1105836341756925,71.49253409546733,63.115523465703966,9.765663858804654,36.32751704773365,9.861636050157227,3.763726193341357,1257,58,203,25,18,392,152,277,0.039,0.759,0.203,0.9928,1,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,0,6,1,9,12,15,0,1,9,0,20,0,0,3,0,40,46,19,0,1,9,0,7,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,16,13,0,0,10,0,0,0,5,2,0,2,6,7,23,13,30,34,5,24,0,0,0,0,11,15,0,3,11,129,39,15,0.13134080563240574,0.0,0.12816968015824168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050331948121088,0.0,0.14230770802910267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1227859235608025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10966408659394253,0.16012827210446168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23232053856901025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12847651023315848,0.0,0.0,0.3984591460643812,0.09382989778692452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2234368443508854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20586045015327128,0.0,0.0,0.1101624363421456,0.0,0.0,0.14468670489745195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13033548337138964,0.0,0.0,0.13677123779844302,0.07218147191676277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19249945005493552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767100763770094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13933183916057554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19310120881320603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13782008160961653,0.0,0.0,0.09989060112681608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14222929343182122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336208172001122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.084140283261657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11216433037610476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476325684948606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12989941514615333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29625582081188906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2617709855882082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10836991976864647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1912353415236736,0.0,0.13384750169836235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16915834529961393
teaching,neldadee,2020/02/22,"Memorization/ recitation assignment to focus on speaking/ listening/ presentation standards I have an assignment for 9th that I’ve always enjoyed. The students get a chance to earn points in other than traditional test way. I assign a 17 line passage from Romeo and Juliet they learn and recite before their class. If they need a little prompt,I give it. 
First, memorizing is good for them.
Second, presentation skills are important.
Third, an appreciation for Shakespeare’s use of words is valuable. 

I have several kids (more and more every year) in an honors class -no IEPs here- who claim their social anxiety should preclude their requirement to present. One asked why I didn’t just let the students write the passage and turn it in because of anxiety.  

My solution is going to be to offer “anxious” students to stand before a small panel of me/ counselor/ SPED teacher in a private setting and recite the passage. They will adhere to the same rubric everyone else does. 
I am SO ANNOYED with all the student mental health issues (real or imagined)I have to put up with.

teaching,Extra-Situation,2020/02/22,"How to go on about teaching journalism education at community colleges? Hi teachers of America! I have my masters in journalism and currently teach creative writing to seniors with dementia. I really enjoy connecting with them as if age was never a factor. I’ve learned more about myself but I must continue to fulfill my role in teaching. I’m in my mid-20’s, in the midst of gaining more journalism experience, but I’m thinking about my future. 

Does anyone currently teach journalism at community colleges? In California or elsewhere? I went to community college and I remember I had a great business teacher which is why I pursued that career before switching over. 

I’m aware colleges vary in their requirements for faculty. 
Is there any advice you can give me on obtaining a secondary teaching credential or special certification? 

Are there specific websites for opportunities as a part-time instructor? 

Are more people leaning towards online teaching businesses? 

Thank you so much! And sorry if this was asked already!",5.937544873745054,9.431316335260117,6.7864861575905095,62.624371767569244,73.50867052023122,9.884879829631883,40.31913599026469,9.93914555978268,5.693295953757224,838,54,107,27,19,276,115,173,0.01,0.825,0.165,0.9828,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,2,5,7,5,0,0,5,0,10,0,0,1,2,19,19,13,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,1,3,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,4,0,17,5,27,14,4,21,0,0,0,0,9,12,0,4,7,80,20,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23312327324829785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26326276698288953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16223260085558247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16681042123675954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22302637368885095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20300151928489404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.208770122415266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333626636550961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288535967811996,0.13558217118709442,0.0,0.0,0.2630191115662126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17537296258237894,0.0,0.18399628470731472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583429975238057,0.0,0.16539115726377127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15283105516331907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702480061983759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2670543482284621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21963889778199688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15286302656824455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2211524451345873,0.21526809815834352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,snappingturtleteach,2020/02/23,"Does this job ever spill over into your personal life? I teach 7th grade ELA, and the last few weeks have been rough. I have an IEP meetings, child interventions, parent meetings, my usual grading/paperwork load, and my school has been pulling me to sub in my prep period almost every day for the past two or three weeks(there's a lot of springtime sports and activities going on, and the school can't really afford subs.) I have lunch duty twice a week, and the days I don't have duty, I usually have kids in detention (they make us host our detention, sigh).  My students behavior has been awful lately, and I've had to call so many parents recently. 

There's a leak in the roof at my house. We're renting, and my roommate asked if I would call. I said yes, and usually she's the one who makes the phone call to the landlord. I just don't have a lot of time to make personal phone calls. The leak is in my bedroom, so I guess it's fair that I'll make the phone call. I know it would only take maybe 10 minutes. 

I have spent all weekend trying to catch up with grades, and doing grad school work online. My roommate asked me if I had made the phone call about the roof, and I told her that I've been swamped and forget. She just made a throwaway comment, ""That's why you need to use a planner."" I just wanted to scream, like, I have a planner and it has more things on it than any human could accomplish. I just wanted to go irate, but then I realized that reaction would be way out of proportion. I just took a breath and realized she just doesn't understand. I just said, ""i'll call and leave a message.""  No one understands how difficult and demanding this job is. I remember when I used to think of myself as a patient person. Sometimes I just feel like my patience is eaten away, and I feel like a failure for not being able to keep up.",4.962038043478259,5.310170040760873,5.496195652173912,84.15532608695653,68.70108695652175,8.9,28.5,8.841846274778883,1.9828358695652173,1437,46,298,23,23,463,201,368,0.084,0.8759999999999999,0.04,-0.9005,6,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,2,2,1,4,15,6,0,0,24,2,31,4,1,9,2,67,61,26,0,9,13,2,3,3,0,3,1,3,3,6,12,19,2,3,9,2,2,5,6,2,1,5,14,6,44,3,33,41,5,36,0,0,0,0,38,13,0,7,20,191,56,14,0.07821972656419335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07832575733794694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05319209633236684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14624977090118058,0.0,0.07349000794300503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5590976041822749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062452086864429934,0.0,0.0,0.10089050535475687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06845060982976113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07075422084117125,0.06590349321947672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07910048798134252,0.1117603765730002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890814636147422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08616784738040689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902550624735616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15524201822630965,0.06952528694959657,0.0,0.0,0.04298751609710806,0.06375951699765202,0.08823525857588613,0.08282339639455874,0.0,0.0,0.0552489061044244,0.1146426221047906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13299922872197,0.0,0.14802679309781214,0.20884909947092006,0.07930252566454847,0.07858222877955674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05799893612879287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106007422124664,0.05948962676794064,0.0,0.0,0.17370749933797858,0.0,0.07466957975206842,0.0,0.20489534448105914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05010955976759096,0.0,0.07723254348401642,0.0,0.08860770217282399,0.0,0.14880974419939488,0.0,0.0,0.2374876177045879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07736130964521656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058811499811193275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05196571067297985,0.05012004240820517,0.0,0.0,0.04561055158595948,0.0,0.0,0.07474230076482763,0.08690499428980743,0.05310605985938671,0.0,0.07640930708241774,0.16285898784028574,0.09408870011581416,0.13511345902154634,0.25844393403218224,0.0,0.09227204266159073,0.062087178118074085,0.12548629301724487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07058113692399694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05694489253117992,0.0,0.0,0.16669514855283207,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ReaditSpecialist,2020/02/23,"I’m a new teacher, and I am miserable. This year is my first year as a full time teacher. I’m 25 and a Reading Specialist. I went for my masters right after graduating undergrad, and I was completely shocked and thrilled to be offered this job. I’m in a notoriously good district, but at this point, I’m breaking down from feeling forgotten. We had two days of new teacher induction in August and we were supposed to have follow up meetings throughout the year, but those have never happened. I had my first observation back in December and I never got a post observation meeting. I move between schools every other day, and I feel largely forgotten and invisible. At first it was great, I got little welcome presents and everyone was nice. Now, I’m being basically accosted in the faculty room on my lunch breaks by teachers who need things from me, I’m being pushed back every time I try to make a step forward, and no one meets me in the middle. I wasn’t even shown how to use the website to request a personal day, and as a result, I did it wrong. There is little to no turnover in this district, so most of the teachers have been there at least a dozen years, if not more. Flexibility is lacking, and mindsets are rigid and fixed. I feel even disliked by some coworkers, although I know I’ll never please everybody and not everyone will like me. I feel there is virtually no structure in place for new teachers, and especially not for new teachers who start off as specialists without classroom experience, like me. My SO lives states away for work and I recently got to visit him. All I want is to go back there, because he makes me feel loved and valued and treated with respect. I have no one to hang out with and I feel so lonely. The bright spot here is that I adore my kids and I’d do anything for them.

teaching,Thisisnotforyou11,2020/02/23,"Student teacher here! How do I go about finding out of potential schools use canned curriculum and to what extent? I know that the likelihood of me finding a public school that doesn’t employ canned curriculum to some extent is slim, but I’m trying to avoid applying to jobs where canned curriculum is followed to the T. I’d rather work at a place where it’s treated as a support and teachers still have the flexibility to be creative with lessons and tailor the material and content to their students. 

But how do I find this out? 

I can’t imagine me calling up schools cold and just asking if they used canned curriculum would go over well...

Any advice would be appreciated! I’m in Colorado and High School English if that makes a difference...

Thank you in advance!",9.064699248120304,10.28593662280702,9.082481203007518,58.952368421052654,59.96491228070175,11.777443609022555,39.96992481203007,11.491704259439757,5.142445112781955,541,27,81,15,7,177,90,114,0.07,0.77,0.16,0.9194,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,1,1,0,2,2,6,1,0,5,0,10,0,0,1,0,23,17,11,0,4,6,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,8,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,2,3,6,4,11,13,4,11,0,0,1,0,5,5,0,7,4,55,10,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19676076514908225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21816693798864564,0.0,0.2738552031437139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14079137470941108,0.2063109330328602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16076475749462454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17620621250862273,0.20605501577689167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16820540137974432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1898185990593596,0.0,0.2036212303943011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15556557461758128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22199345830855471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349633190209384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1998127417848022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13440533581487255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38893783007277855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13644265841345687,0.15313876446682612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1903445811819565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2037809633227788,0.16045304148116474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425193734669091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853796790938903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16613810940701634,0.0,0.15982540592030625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966535242664284

However, my personal life is really lonely.  I always wanted to get married but never found someone good enough. I am a perfectionist but they were no where near perfect. 

The man should be the head of the house and that is a whole lot of power to trust them with. 

From age 35-45 were my hardest years in my life since I wanted to be married since I was 16. It was really hard because I felt the ticking clock. Now I can't have any kids at all and all the dates I've gone on completely suck and never work.

teaching,dustymitts,2020/02/24,"Saving Grace (advice to new teachers) I work in a small district and teach 6th, 8th, and 9th graders. I’ve got kids that struggle, don’t want to do any work or are at that age where they “don’t care”. I’ve also got kids that love school and do everything on their power to be the best students they can. This is my 3rd year of teaching and I think I’ve figured out what keeps me going even on days I feel like I’m burnt out. 

BEING MORE INVOLVED 

I coach 2 sports and I’m a class advisor at my school. I also have 2 young children at home as well. There are days where I feel like I’ve taken on too much. But in the end, I think I’ve been able to do a lot with these kids because they see me more than just in the classroom. 

I try to go on as many class trips with my advising class and classes that I teach to interact with kids outside the classroom. I feel like I’ve been able to curb some behavior problems in class because of the things I do with the school related things I do with my students outside of school. I’m very lucky too because my administration allows me to attend clinics and PD outside of school to better myself as a coach and as an educator. These little “breaks” help me refocus and bring new ideas back to my classroom and students. 

My advice to new teachers is to do as much as you think you can handle. Be involved with your students outside of the classroom. Go to the basketball games on Friday night. Have lunch with them. Help work the concession stand. Be a class advisor. Yeah it sucks that you’re not making any extra money to do these things (except advising and coaching) but the kids see you and they get excited about it. They love seeing their teachers at their events, taking an interest in their hobbies and lives outside of school. You might not see a difference right away, but eventually something will click. 

Also try and limit what you bring home with you at nights and on the weekends. When you shut the academic side of yourself off when school is over and you’re just able to enjoy being around the kids and in your community, a lot of your stress will go away.",4.269681782020683,5.445815367541768,4.557715990453462,87.26217462211618,70.74224343675421,7.400509148766908,26.85449482895784,7.675431598112923,1.3557636595067617,1665,54,340,19,30,522,180,419,0.022000000000000002,0.8740000000000001,0.105,0.9827,1,0,1,0,0,0,34.0,0,10,10,7,17,19,1,2,22,1,28,4,0,2,0,58,59,32,0,2,9,0,3,3,0,3,1,0,2,7,16,28,1,3,8,6,1,8,4,4,1,0,5,8,44,15,64,46,9,57,0,0,5,2,37,31,1,6,19,221,60,30,0.2314412076385869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15077444633636686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18508345013117272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10492530510094764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06867724772793399,0.0,0.0,0.14496442210341745,0.059321334220301926,0.0,0.1410844120168582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08096108954296531,0.06823031342869564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865657864515026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950695484899706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08060226741076937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832940485930135,0.0,0.0,0.05095491162375725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933481133678139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170236286122732,0.16534164498114634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04030615953586261,0.0,0.1753778291543093,0.0,0.12340311753684075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10342010860591204,0.0,0.1547696012160827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08708965076778283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06857185981010534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130704835052565,0.07732163061357332,0.06812227551478615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13117535887894646,0.13925648397457724,0.0,0.051496267756395715,0.07821501947052738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818408489845916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11342394505401288,0.0,0.0,0.22352736053879632,0.0,0.14479459674095774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07381932629743197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06588317558335967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5465386691021091,0.2459049035917165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05939158294484963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08837170713059504,0.08065086716582982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058004994976846816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15375925437532104,0.14829818066843325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10475559185782142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06365441159530495,0.04550334023338665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06936448021291282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684919556123706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04968018320706389

I remember growing up and my family put so much respect and so much pressure on doing well in school because if not then you wouldn’t be able to have a good life. I just feel like being in the school system (first year transfer to a middle school) that the largest portion of the children all have this very over entitled and complete disrespect for educators of any kind. They argue and curse and even just completely ignore any form of adult, and I’ve noticed that the other teachers are just complacent and don’t do anything about it for fear of litigation.

teaching,EnglishTeacherMan,2020/02/25,"Group Project Advice New account, teacher looking for advice on how to run a “TTRPG project” for his high school class.  The group is one of the most academically- and inquisitorially- strong classes that I’ve ever taught so I’m looking to try some more creative projects as a reward for the effort they’ve put in so far this year. 

 

They’re currently reading “The Shadow Over Innsmouth” and a friend of mine suggested that I check out a tabletop game called “Call of Cthulhu” that has foundations in Lovecraft’s works.  I liked the idea and looked over Chaosium’s free ruleset and found a copy of Escape from Innsmouth (1997). 

 

I’m here with some questions and looking for some advice.  I’ve run some less-popular and older systems for friends so I have experience in DMing TTRPGs but usually capped my table at 5-6 players.  The class has 25 students and we could spend about three hours spread over three classes on the project.  Likely, I would hand out pregen characters to streamline the process/give more time for the actual project and I have a bunch of old dice (not the good dice, of course) that I could loan to the class.  They’ll get credit for participating and have some kind of informal writing prompt afterwards.

 

I was thinking of running the “Escape from Innsmouth” module where characters look for a missing NPC, learn about the town, attempt to rescue him, then attempt to escape. 

 

 

If you’re a teacher, have you ever done a collaborative project/TTRPG like this?  How did the students respond?  What went well/what would you do differently? 

 

I’m not really sure how to run something like this for a group this large but had the thought of a “Everyone is John” kinda situation where a group of 4-5 students is responsible for a single character.  If you’re a DM, have you had success in groups of 4-5 friends running a single character collaboratively?  What went well/would you do differently in the future?

 

If you’ve run Cthulhu games, what rules or elements do you suggest I streamline because I don’t think many/any of my students have played a tabletop before. 

 

Also, some posts I’ve read say that the game can be somewhat murder-y for PCs.  Any suggestions on how to take the edge off a little?

 

Any general thoughts/suggestions/tips would be very welcome. 

 

Thanks!

teaching,mariposa333,2020/02/25,"Un-teachable student. What should I do? Hi! I am an English teacher who does private tutoring, and I right now have a private tutoring student that I am just making no progress with. She’s 11 years old and has been studying English for a few years. 
The mistakes she makes are often ones of logic or merely just her not paying attention/following instructions. 
 
For example, she will continually spell words wrong even when they are in a word bank at the top of the page. If there are 10 words to fill in, I have to remind her 10 times to copy the world as it’s written at the top of the page, yet she just won’t. It feels as if what I say goes in one ear and out the other.  She fails tests all the time simply because she doesn’t feel like reading the directions and decides to leave it blank, not because she doesn’t know the answers. Today we had to do an activity where she filled in answers from a word bank, but one “answer” was a question mark because it was supposed to be unique to the student. She didn’t get this, and just wrote the question mark in the middle of the sentence. I asked her “do question marks go in the middle of the sentence?” And she just shrugged. She’s 11, of course she knows question marks go at the end. 

I’m at my wits’ end. I have no idea how to motivate her, and I’m worried I’m going to be fired because I can’t seem to make progress with her. Any advice/tips from more seasoned private tutors ?",3.704239578184215,4.8362210519031175,4.353613445378154,88.36078431372549,72.04498269896196,6.888844949744606,28.640797495468767,7.07126945348624,1.3776513758444555,1120,43,234,10,21,357,151,289,0.07,0.871,0.059000000000000004,-0.6465,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,1,0,1,6,13,4,0,0,24,0,25,1,1,5,1,51,43,15,0,4,11,0,3,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,10,11,0,0,16,1,3,5,9,3,0,3,7,5,29,1,35,31,5,36,0,1,0,0,28,18,0,9,14,157,39,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886572218414981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121879934022872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3178934958228159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11408914705943365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.230941247169322,0.0,0.0,0.08610927362841808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131839690372673,0.09313756349261147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06811382867291775,0.0,0.22227971256011425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14717377244296778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329774586143668,0.0,0.0,0.13804479864710004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369302384654485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610723521897136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13680316087119646,0.0,0.2650296995655224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5841845322680783,0.0,0.1304069733811307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11133671344003623,0.0,0.10367680297003204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11868549284286348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520415651604598,0.0,0.12357712095418047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13239878258278015,0.0,0.0,0.1425409801490378,0.0,0.16791019171123295

teaching,gratefullyanon,2020/02/25,"Soft Lockdown Insanity Please forgive this rant. My frustration is overwhelming. I teach at a high school in a district with high poverty and some violence. This year there have been a couple of kids who hurt each other by stabbing them with scissors or even pencils. Today, we were placed on a soft lockdown, which typically means there is a threat outside the building. We lock the doors and generally try to continue as usual. 

The students knew that the threat had been from a Snapchat account that said they would be shooting up the school 5th period. Every period wanted to talk about it for at least a few minutes, and there were kids that were legitimately frightened. During third period, a new post from that account was made that spread like wildfire. It said, “two periods left. I’m in the building”. And after that, I could no longer teach. Kids were scared, others were talking big about taking on the shooter. They were clearly upset, even traumatized by the threats, violence, and other events in this community. While I tried to move on and continue the lesson, it was not successful. 

These kids deserve an education. I truly believe that education can be an escape from poverty. But my kids are just not ready to learn, and I do not know what to do.",5.726491228070178,7.858488842105267,5.549122807017547,77.83885964912281,68.47368421052633,8.4,31.08771929824561,8.998388855275968,2.806419298245614,1008,42,170,19,18,313,139,228,0.214,0.732,0.055,-0.9914,0,2,0,2,0,0,30.0,2,0,3,2,8,11,4,3,19,0,22,0,0,1,1,31,31,11,0,3,6,0,2,1,0,1,0,2,1,5,20,12,0,0,6,0,2,1,4,8,0,2,15,4,12,3,27,12,4,29,0,2,0,0,16,14,0,2,14,126,32,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819998976477875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12897628711381645,0.17874057955739567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21339086567496085,0.0,0.13610414463379475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34135107481569205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1729315647787789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08877798159869424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755133312190699,0.0,0.0,0.07892012627304648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15285274780781494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1759640647306313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17169111131343118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15601602621945532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16877458001643875,0.17732205538612994,0.0,0.0,0.15471035643405207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3073224492058761,0.0,0.1617293970406344,0.3269735536997607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12145773289703927,0.2596789459767945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15312072502101054,0.0,0.0,0.21934967325515986,0.0,0.1578007913462162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779131315548513,0.0,0.09528028657179986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475315141404124,0.0,0.0,0.10402625540521264
teaching,Appalachian_Aioli,2020/02/25,"Random Question: Can you live in your classroom? I know we've all heard the stereotype that kids think we live at school. Some of us may have even experienced it. I got to thinking, though, can we?

I have keys to my school so I can get in at anytime. I already keep food for lunch and a spare change of clothes just in case. I even have a hammock I hang up when I'm on planning and I don't have anything to do. If I wanted, what is stopping me from moving my legal address to my parents house, quietly move all my clothes into my instrument closet, and living rent and bill free here at school? I could even use our showers.

I would never do this, of course. I'm engaged and I don't think she'll want to do that. I also don't want to sleep in this big, empty school at night.

teaching,justwantdarktheme,2020/02/25,"Am I Overreacting? I work at a very small school with only around 18 students in the secondary school. Year 9's write an assessment in a couple month's time that is invigilated, externally assessed, the whole lot.

I found out today that the secondary students will be going on a field trip when there are only five days left until this GIANT assessment. The teachers who were asked to okay it, ""didn't think about"" this assessment coming up.

My issue is that I think the field trip is a great idea and the kids deserve it, I just don't understand why it couldn't be done at another time? I'm not planning on drilling the kids until their assessment but we've been working on getting them into good routines, using planners, setting a little bit of time aside for revision, etc. I feel as though this will teach the students they can swan off whenever they want prior to a BIG assessment with absolutely no consequences. 

I am working on getting over it at the moment because it's a done deal and nothing can be done about it.",8.126153846153844,7.407426871794872,7.808846153846152,73.80865384615387,62.33333333333334,10.671794871794873,36.42307692307692,9.888512548439397,3.4877076923076924,820,33,148,14,10,261,123,195,0.018000000000000002,0.929,0.053,0.662,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,4,5,7,3,0,0,17,1,21,0,0,1,0,22,34,8,0,2,3,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,13,8,0,0,6,0,0,4,5,0,0,1,7,1,12,3,26,21,4,37,0,0,0,0,10,20,0,1,12,102,25,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14383736753227172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12211264205925045,0.12823780711963814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361910664117939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14975688531262954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816199634131885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517788054422201,0.0,0.08846493971350004,0.14141886457816538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42112539833923135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15298364101103756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06935855733869581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15040260891385895,0.0,0.0,0.14333398017590884,0.0,0.0779583151085487,0.11505381768357124,0.0,0.1512332086108463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15485109993634447,0.0,0.14317249226784212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14903836508519874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374829206895025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11661918739984126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10948981200110117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13162075082288388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2086517944220548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776518657074807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17578924853193367,0.1347713231951469,0.0,0.23995923197114685,0.0,0.1300235278954819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14280145084448453,0.0,0.11847303137985515,0.0,0.11318171062158128,0.08090791757456747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237768807071851,0.15314824118275094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2995897265287146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08833461779707635
teaching,rougepirate,2020/02/25,"Did teaching make you not want your own kids? I'm currently in my 2nd year of marriage with no children. When I was younger I always figured I would have a few kids, but now that it's the point in my life I thought I would get pregnant, I just don't feel like I really want them. Occasionally I'll see babies or kids and public and feel a little interested in having kids, but when it comes to making specific plans, any desire I have just flies away.

I can't help but wonder if teaching has affected my views on havjng kids. Before I started teaching, I feel like I wanted kids more. Now I almost dread the idea. I don't mean to say that I dislike kids- actually, I wonder if I get so much enjoyment working with kids at school that I feel I don't need kids at home.

I still figure I'll have kids someday, but I'm unsure if that's what I truly want or if I've just assumed I'll have kids for so long. I'm a little worried that if I wait till I want kids I'll never have them, but I just really don't want them right now.

Does anyone else feel like teaching decreased your desire to have kids?",4.3955900621118005,4.3837609565217415,5.541490683229816,84.59391304347827,69.86956521739131,8.136645962732919,26.86335403726708,7.7094869923839395,1.3379875776397512,860,24,186,9,14,287,115,230,0.149,0.763,0.08800000000000001,-0.6623,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,3,3,2,12,6,0,1,5,0,17,1,0,3,1,52,44,19,0,16,17,0,5,3,0,2,1,1,1,14,8,5,0,1,13,0,0,1,8,1,0,0,3,8,33,5,15,39,4,24,0,0,2,0,24,11,0,11,15,111,41,6,0.0,0.0,0.12206026875751845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12524979005203735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407677756779993,0.0,0.0,0.08505885068319627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745901031944386,0.12815948461599114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1175170005196302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10643406951656244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077455492439712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094585587359254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448848848461388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.316221631599756,0.2680720399837724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13069852319326014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383864661710441,0.0,0.12546567663035282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14120036331715455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08834787080738958,0.18332365798502803,0.2507265154621615,0.0,0.11069207414078464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16698405958863766,0.0,0.0,0.13624904716416114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09194836647809954,0.09274541121932348,0.09646959011101752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182412539418878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16025920600834365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10681783939705086,0.0,0.0994688252120635,0.0,0.12658787806382427,0.09967275509349308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853243588600243,0.0,0.09988923923916118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09929973697582983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4426533887635107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2712883640031808,0.09105990259746488,0.12702505271910478,0.0,0.17770682398343274,0.0,0.0,0.08054757203246518

The five-letter grading system generally isn’t effective, and it certainly isn’t inspirational. As educators, we often emphasize the quantitative grading structure over the qualitative, avoiding emotional learning because it is thought to be challenging to measure. However, by using qualitative measures, we have the power to assess and engage our students emotionally and empathetically, essential parts of the modern classroom, and preparing our students for adulthood. In order to teach emotionally, we must first actively teach our humanity, making us more agile and relevant educators. These nine rules (below) are reminders of how we can bring out the best in our students, such as our innate ability to collaborate, investigate, the power of discovery, and to take appropriate risks. A fiction writer, poet, and longtime mentor teacher, Antonio will discuss techniques of how to implement these rules with examples of creative activities, lessons, and more.

Product description:

Rules for the educational trenches and life in general. Quick start your school year in a hundred pages or less. Antonio J. Hopson is an educator, long-serving mentor teacher at a top-notch school, poet and writer who uses inspiration and humor to help educators tackle the challenges they face day-in and day-out, inside of the classroom. Antonio believes that honey is to the bee, what love and empathy are to humans—emotions that have evolved to hold us together through some of the most difficult and joyful times. This is why we are teachers: to pass along the best traits of our humanity. Research tells us that student achievement is more dependent on the skills of the teacher rather than the reputation of the school. That means, if a parent wants their child to receive the best education possible, it is more important to get them assigned to a great teacher rather than a great school. These nine rules will help YOU--no matter where you are in your career, where you teach, or what style you teach--be THAT great teacher.

teaching,fainthearted2,2020/02/26,"Bonus for Student Performance?  

Hi ya'll,

Throwaway because coworkers recently informed me that our principal/management company (charter school) frequents social media to see what employees are not being loyal...

So, my school gives bonuses based on student performance on NWEA, WIDA, Fountas and Pinnell, STAR, and M-Step. You could get a bonus of $1,000 up to $5,000 awarded in November for the previous year if you are still employed. That being said, I think it makes for an extremely hostile environment for the students and teachers. My fellow teachers and I get severe anxiety every testing session because of this. My principal basically shames teachers if their students are not meeting their growth goals and demands for students to retake the test if they score too low. We need to get 80% of students to meet their growth goal by spring in Math, Reading, and Language Usage. I had 30% meet their goal in reading and language for the spring and 60% meet their goal in math. \*\*We took the reading test the day after we got back from Christmas break.\*\*

I want to know if anyone else has experience with a school like this. I am basically miserable at this job, but considering staying if my kids perform well on their tests.

Kind of a side note about how our school works. I teach 3rd grade. We are given a schedule of what we must teach and exactly when to teach it - each subject gets a 42 minute block with exception of science and social studies (30 minutes) and language acquisition (1 hour). We must use the given curriculum. If admin walks in and we are not using the correct curriculum or we are not teaching what is on our schedule at the correct time, we are reprimanded. We are required to submit 6 full lesson plans a week - one for each subject area with written and approved content and language objectives. We are also required to use clip charts - of which I despise... but that's besides the point.

I just feel totally micromanaged and not trusted in my profession. I have a master's degree in reading and language arts (also defeating that my students struggled so much on that test). I have talked with many of my coworkers and almost everyone is looking for other jobs. We have had 3 teachers quit since the fall... The environment is just so stressful, and our principal is very negative (she will reprimand people over the intercom if she sees something she doesn't like on the cameras and students must be well behaved and silent at almost all times).

Thus, the market prospects are suggested to reach $40.9 billion by 2022. It’s not a surprise since new educational technologies were meant to introduce innovative solutions in the traditional notion of education.

Market analysis is the predominant thing to do while thinking of your next product idea. Without knowledge of market situation companies may run into serious problems as their products fail to deliver educational value.

I initially was really excited about UMass Boston's Teach Next Year Program because of its affordability. However, I have been having a lot of communication issues with their admissions office even though I have been accepted and haven't been able to find much real information about the program. 

Their website is down and it has been really difficult to get in contact with any people who work there. It also seems disorganized meaning that there's no central person or place to find this information so I thought I'd reach out to this community to see if anyone has experience or insight with this program.

teaching,TheWhenWheres,2020/02/26,"Advice for a student that breaks out in laughter every time I see her I had this student in an elective and she laughed a lot at me, with me, what ever, it was a decent relationship. The issue though would be that we would be laughing, she would saying something rude and I would call her out and she would immediately shut down. It seems that any time I was trying to be serious with her, she would act as if I was the worst person in the world. The other thing to mention, is that this is far from the firs student I have had this issue with, or teacher! I have had several students who can't help but laugh constantly in my presence (I'm a goofy guy) but it usually has taken a simple conversation and it was over. I see this as different because of how mad she has gotten every time I have tried to talk to her and with how rude her laughter sounds as I see her in the hallway. I really don't mind someone laughing at me, but the way she does has me thinking, ""I know I am funny, stop trying to be mean"". Any advice would be great!

teaching,DeandreWiggins,2020/02/26,"What's your view on phones in the classroom?  Hi all, I'm actually a student but I'm really curious about this topic. Would love to hear about your policies or just general trends of phone usage you've noticed in your classes.

I'm also doing a research project about teen phone use for an entrepreneurship class I'm taking. We had to identify a problem in the classroom setting and then create a prototype/concept and get initial feedback. If any of you are passionate about the topic, it'd be super helpful if you could fill out the survey I've made for the project. It's a super early concept, but any positive or negative feedback would be greatly appreciated! Cheers

teaching,pinktennisshoes,2020/02/26,"Advice on dealing with a student So, I have this student who has been on my radar since day 3. She doesn't do her work, or turns it in late, or does it partially. She stares off into space, or draws, or goes to the bathroom, or talks, or puts her head down on the desk, or does other work; anything to get out of doing what she is supposed. She makes any student not focus. I have tried talking to the parents; at first was okay but at a certain point the mom got furious (because her daughter was getting a D and the daughter had told a whole story about me) and went to the VP about me (It's was smoothed over). But since then Mom won't respond to my emails. Lately, the daughter wants to argue with me any point. Today, I gave them a warm up to write about dreams and she kept arguing that she never remembers any dreams. I told her to do her best and she finally wrote that she had a nightmare about me. I then told all of the students to put it away and had to confiscate it as she was writing on it when she was supposed to be doing a different assignment. I went to the VP (different one from the first one) and he came down on me hard. He said that I need to come up with a list of solutions for this girl and that while she was academically struggling all around, she was just having behavior issues in my class because she dislikes me so. 

Honestly, I don't know what to do.

teaching,teachingstudents101,2020/02/26,"VERY troubled student need advice I should start with this is a throwaway account. I am a new first and second grade english teacher in a diffrent country. For the last couple months I have been teaching this fery troubled student. From the start all the other teacher have called him a lost cause. The more I taught him the more it became clear to me he was having a very hard home life. I think he is being malested at home.  That breaks my heart completely and later I will share why I think this. What breaks my heart the most the is because of the country I am in there is nothing I can do about this. His behaviour in class is terrible. He never does his work unless you sit there and do it with him. He doesn't participate in group activities and never raises his hand. Thats him on a good day. Him on a bad day he tries to kiss other students and pulls up his shirt. Occasionally he pertends to pull down his pants saying he will show them his penis. Hesits in the back of class and literally just drools. The things he says and does are way to overly sexual for an 8 year old. Talking to him yesterday he admitted he does it when students tease him to punish them. The good news is I have been working with him one on one in class whenever I can. He was getting better. He was less distruptive in class. He stopped touching other students. He not only participated in a group activity but wanted to be the leader. Then he took two weeks off. When he came back all the work I had done with him was gone. He couldnt looķme in the eye anymore. He came in with a spinner that was obvously a drinking game that his mom gave him and one of the spins was kiss someone. Of course he went around trying to kiss girls. He never actually kisses them just wants to gross them out. His vocabulary, reading and writing all all far below the other students. I have been slowly getting him back to where he was. Yesterday was a really bad day for him. He was harrassing the other students the intire class. I brought him out in the hall talked with him. Instead of getting mad and telling him how bad he was or flat out ignored him and sayings hes not worth it like he's used to I talked with him, told him why what he did was not okay. He explained he does those things to get back at other students. The fact that he sees sexual act or non concentual touching as a good form of discipline kills me. After a quick talk about how he could do better we discussed what I was teaching in class and he got answers right that most of the class didn't. He then proceded to finish his work and got all of it correct. He is slower then the rest of the class but capable. I realized I cant keep putting him in the hall during class. My class is taking a hit from that. I decided I would tutor him. That was yesterday. I asked for permission to tutor him today and was informed that he is getting kicked out of school. On one hand I know he doesnt work in a class I am about to kick him out of my class but I am not ready to give up hope on him. The other teachers don't see the progress he has made. Is there anything I can do? If not how do I handle giving up on a kid with such a tough life.",3.04017972681524,4.644382657320872,3.9658099688473527,88.61954169662113,74.45171339563863,6.7453151210160565,24.65144979630961,7.395310329662975,1.000554181643902,2494,79,522,29,52,802,270,642,0.10099999999999999,0.841,0.057999999999999996,-0.9782,2,0,1,0,0,0,50.0,1,1,4,10,22,27,4,0,44,1,63,14,7,6,11,87,101,30,1,9,14,1,5,1,0,4,2,3,2,2,31,31,1,4,9,4,2,10,14,14,0,7,34,12,71,13,82,58,12,87,0,1,3,4,101,40,0,6,34,358,102,33,0.0,0.0,0.0745010025865035,0.0,0.0,0.07460274493920589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571300951040935,0.0,0.0,0.062824835884636,0.06796259339521679,0.07137159426079248,0.0,0.0,0.23481614949087726,0.1912328498181829,0.04653876329993994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504061977418266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795604369545296,0.1746350314927968,0.0,0.07842660356103655,0.0,0.0,0.08004552302927485,0.0,0.0,0.060954693835925576,0.0844734915757226,0.0,0.1477072306214715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26723756880136545,0.07812670261675489,0.0,0.07478832792302015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649384039125071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19943367144752186,0.14647277615138207,0.0,0.1921018749066599,0.12211898668512287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838947759223603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18093667415545894,0.0,0.0,0.15315907124085484,0.07582709415530807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06785830214236213,0.08446363232126537,0.0,0.04195681864329423,0.06223077614932231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784844271659008,0.037297957958899945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833387979312288,0.0,0.0,0.07223880182241052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08941349575721735,0.06093727437605523,0.0,0.0,0.05660831482243925,0.17664424113281707,0.07373377947616465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07325439380967981,0.0,0.08011047732812744,0.0,0.2069314344601957,0.05806326366523099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07674708587567536,0.0,0.0,0.07636493790019122,0.0,0.04890809942855865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06519759632033595,0.0,0.18213610243121672,0.0,0.07726448521744758,0.1216730105645759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468625904887401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10807374589737248,0.0,0.0,0.06382723492388663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057401395934211015,0.24545055532081206,0.06672826402973782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10143949203535364,0.09783666146073272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0723654488933634,0.07295022934305785,0.08482130198863172,0.10366550685770434,0.0,0.0745772664015926,0.0,0.0,0.06593694415407916,0.0,0.1259840496288224,0.0900596664169465,0.060598534385874585,0.061238774839307585,0.0,0.0,0.0707719106169414,0.1377776727023723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778977183975197,0.0,0.0,0.05423278470543901,0.0,0.0,0.04916321202150092
teaching,mcteacherpants,2020/02/26,"Future Teacher in St.Pete/Pinellas County Area **Hi there!**

I am currently student teaching in Montana. I am moving to Florida, specifically St. Petersburg, in June. I am hoping to get a teaching job in Pinellas County and I am seeking advice on basically anything. If you could give me any advice about the hiring process, what schools to avoid, what schools to actively seek out, what electric pencil sharpener is best, literally anything! I would greatly appreciate it. 

* What should I expect?
* How is the pay?
* What is the reading and math curriculum? Writing? (please don't say Lucy Calkins)

&amp;#x200B;

**Important:** I was born and raised in Florida. I am moving back for several different reasons, and I simply would love a job in a field I am passionate about. I have heard a million reasons why not to teach in Florida, so please, unless I will set on fire when I step into a school, I would love positive advice :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Again:** Literally any type of wisdom or knowledge about teaching in St. Pete, or teaching at all is welcome, and encouraged. I am just totally in the dark!

Thanks so much,

teaching,seattlegrace89,2020/02/27,"Career Change: Teaching Versus SLP Hi all! I am a former nurse (LPN) turned stay at home mom and I am currently looking at going back to school so that when my daughter is beginning school, I am getting ready for a new career. I do not want to go back into nursing. My reasons for leaving the field include: not liking the clinical component near as much as I thought I would, liking the administrative component too much (scheduling, charting, etc), not having the understanding and passion for science that I think is necessary in the field, being tired of always being in an assistant type role, and not having a creative outlet. 

I have found that I really want to work with kids. I loved working with kids in pediatric nursing and especially liked when I would go to school with clients. I love the school setting. I am around lots of kids with all of my daughter’s social activities and I find that I really enjoy watching and helping them to grow and learn. So I know I want to do something in a school setting. I am very torn though between teaching and becoming a Speech Language Pathologist though. I do lot currently have a bachelors, but have lots of college credits, so teaching would definitely be a quicker path. But I do worry that I am fantasizing it in the way I once fantasized nursing. So I wanted to get some insight as to what decision you would make in my position and if you could do it all again if you would. Thanks all!",5.6365235968149126,7.011117686346867,6.213959992231501,75.91582831617792,67.70848708487085,9.247698582248981,33.82035346669257,9.549672527348893,3.346737269372694,1147,53,200,24,19,373,141,271,0.06,0.84,0.1,0.9271,2,0,1,0,0,0,29.0,0,3,1,2,13,9,0,0,15,0,27,6,0,2,4,53,48,24,0,12,9,3,0,3,0,5,3,1,1,3,8,15,0,0,10,0,1,4,4,0,0,0,2,3,31,9,34,37,11,30,0,0,2,3,16,11,0,6,14,155,39,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08375334735150386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08960463678585659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15479556279016493,0.0,0.0,0.11116596954720596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10648005560208597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036513806645887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11225736627924728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09199720242454884,0.0,0.0,0.11036343916654004,0.0,0.0,0.10517657317169277,0.0,0.17161433227403566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746718581893121,0.0,0.10096556254989683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05531756967189293,0.0,0.0,0.10657952392897227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14752541694487162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452517642429673,0.0,0.0,0.2567208379003276,0.18169083764173768,0.0,0.06718825405494837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788637559029735,0.0,0.0,0.14798658559594438,0.0,0.0,0.0972136023472461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10719470471999812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12896483981115972,0.10349050447859244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5093431392542206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260549370480174,0.0,0.07748943637043475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072852525202626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266995912082583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06449590926842677,0.19778681814436455,0.07990913590144368,0.0,0.11568856315849894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10948415979102999,0.0,0.10478581021287528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08305123777542946,0.2374766263382129,0.07989556301692999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465566446284584,0.10222043390799387,0.0,0.35751350357963485,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,elbereth3,2020/02/27,"Internal Conflict Lesson Suggestions/Input Hello all!

I have a sample teach next Monday and I've been given the following objective for a group of 10th graders:

SWBAT analyze a section of a novel for internal conflict and explain how that internal conflict impacts the character’s decisions.

I'm a little nervous as the novel specification makes this a tricky one.

Currently, I'm thinking of using something from Fahrenheit 451, but I'm struggling to think of a way to structure the lesson.

Should I have students make a diagram of the character's battle with self? Look at how diction shapes those decisions?

Anyone have recommendations? Insights?

Gratitude and well wishes in advance

teaching,WhiteMambaOZO,2020/02/28,"Another student teacher complaining And before you judge, I am the student teacher that is complaining. I know what I’m about to say is nothing new, I just need to say it. 

It feels like I’m getting my ass kicked. My biggest problem is that I ALWAYS feel like I’m neglecting something. If I’m grading, I could be lesson planning. If I’m focusing on one class, then I’m not paying enough attention to the others. And I’m behind on grading and it feels impossible to get out from under. I just don’t feel like I’m doing a good job and honestly, I’m not.

Dear god this is brutal. I’m stressed and depressed every day. I know I could be doing better, and I believe this is a job I’d enjoy and be good at, I just don’t know how to get out from under this.

teaching,SlamminSamr,2020/02/28,"World War I Simulation Activity, looking for feedback before implementation I am teaching in a Competency-Based school in an urban school district. I am planning a unit on the First World War that opens with an activity that tries to simulate the trenches during World War I. What I am looking for is some ideas to help me to bring this into the classroom in a meaningful way without inflicting trauma on my students. As an overview of what I have planned, and how it is expected to be implemented:

1. Students will spend one class period doing an activity from the movie *1917 (* [https://intothetrenches.1917.movie/](https://intothetrenches.1917.movie/) ) This activity will be enhanced with ambiance including artillery and machine gun fire.
2. On the second day, students will be given the lyrics of the song *Great War* by Sabaton. They will perform an analysis of the song lyrics and decide whether or not the song is a useful depiction of life in the trenches.

I have been doing some research into the use of simulations to help teach history, but I am finding mixed information. Before I propose this to Administration, I wanted to see if there were others who have done similar lessons involving potentially triggering experiences, and what was the result.

Thank you in advance for your responses!",8.327545871559632,10.671697293577985,7.8567775229357775,63.00103784403672,62.30275229357797,10.404128440366973,37.9369266055046,10.550175099000144,4.6879165137614685,1062,53,151,27,16,335,132,218,0.049,0.8859999999999999,0.065,0.32,0,0,0,1,0,0,41.0,0,2,1,6,2,7,4,0,21,0,23,1,0,5,0,30,32,10,4,3,6,0,1,0,0,4,1,3,0,0,11,9,0,0,6,3,1,2,2,5,0,3,5,7,15,2,31,20,2,20,0,0,3,0,8,14,0,4,3,117,26,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3345822594193115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267899853543474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011888674417107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19231138649818216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17968777491216198,0.1672268699309958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21675091134362715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2635521120184449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22193615636452588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13886357236872351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3301870160279343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332204596594833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3979370369851339,0.15666381898767448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810017948021735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13347770492620034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3395965443979089,0.0,0.0,0.11595908749333275,0.1560510055253126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18951426278170266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,badbodylanguagethrow,2020/02/28,"Students think I hate them and are rallying against me. How can I figure out what's going wrong?? Grade 6 (11 years olds). I really care about these kids and their education. I am pretty interested in the subjects I teach. I think the lessons I am presenting are interesting (they work extremely well for other teachers). The kids are extremely well-behaved in their other classes. In my class, however they rail against me. I am an enemy! They say class is boring, that I am unfair, and that I hate them. I have tried the waiting it out thing, and they will gladly chat and criticize me for 40 minutes if I let them. They have almost no regard for me whatsoever. At this point substitute teachers have more success than me. When I return, I get a loud groan from my class. It is so disheartening. I really care about these kids, and if it means that I need to quit for their benefit, perhaps I should. I do want to figure this out, because it feels like some kind of personality flaw on my part... My best guess is that my body language is giving some wrong signals - the kids get the impression that I hate them! I am so flabbergasted. Now that some students are actively trying to rally the others against me, I can't see any way to right this ship. I so badly want what's best for these kids, but some kind of ineptitude on my part is putting a major wrench into things. Does this sound familiar to anyone here? Remember that these are well-meaning kids in general. My principal, coworkers, and parents are frustrated with me. Never in my life have I been so hated. What steps can I take to figure out what is wrong?",3.840074682598957,5.8379720129449835,4.740145631067964,82.2459017923824,73.20711974110031,8.248991784914116,26.447722180731894,8.950670267944501,2.120165944734877,1268,45,243,27,26,411,159,309,0.134,0.765,0.10099999999999999,-0.9569,2,0,0,0,0,0,48.0,0,0,12,6,11,25,5,0,10,0,29,2,1,1,1,39,50,16,0,6,3,1,1,1,0,2,1,3,0,7,28,13,0,1,9,1,0,3,3,11,1,0,1,5,51,14,34,46,10,26,0,1,1,0,23,15,0,8,8,182,79,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10608093862640904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07204102070916214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407384796548394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08845324991988388,0.06457841628745888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22234939504020246,0.0,0.0,0.11767249758885535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2160203472607651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09270647596755804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05356509975807498,0.07568165346267915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069577052118178,0.10162474507671262,0.06020662894369504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11670191824755255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4183647451006541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22063486515203048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10832810275687456,0.07482667281916261,0.05175563089673011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307936293405864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07855119175329975,0.08170540376658476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111634127563834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11763087394554712,0.22943962109375365,0.0,0.0,0.09250039493799167,0.0,0.0,0.10014502377455292,0.0,0.0,0.10777635509849308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1064962820044493,0.0,0.11267739611200107,0.0,0.0,0.1357323392703891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12000634957753036,0.09046990546312576,0.0,0.08424562099607509,0.0,0.0,0.08441834043318579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07965169203637848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14076011651680248,0.1357607337192507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14384899343717403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496917013243362,0.08408812573637837,0.0,0.0,0.28575116082956736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712364176223484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474775372900715,0.0,0.06822017060253913
teaching,imtheqt15,2020/02/28,"Just ranting/a bit sad 😭 I've have been working at a private christian preschool for awhile now and I'm an assistant teacher in a 2s and preschool class. The lead teacher in there doesnt do anything at all and the previous teachers that have been there in the past had nothing too,no curriculum, no books, no nothing and it's been sad and so hard on me. This school year though our boss encouraged each class to have a curriculum and read the books that are provided to help us build. 

Like I said the Lead teacher hasnt done anything and I have been for the whole school year so far making, building and creating the curriculum for that class. I am only an assistant teacher but I need structure to function. I cant just sit around and not do anything it drives me INSANE. 
I never told my lead teacher because I dont want her to take the credit for it becuase she has done that in the past. 

I have been working my ass off and a fellow coworker told me that the lead teacher I work with told our boss I dont do anything!!! like EXCUSE MEEE?! We have a male worker that I also work with time to time in that class room tell her that when I work with him the class room flows and functions better!!!! All the teachers there are backing me up and even a few parents r saying I have been doing an amazing job with their kids. 

I'm exhausted and tired and I feel incredibly hurt. I am hoping my boss doesnt listen to my lead teacher and listens to other leads and parents who have backed me up. 

I'm being paid minimum wages and I'm doing more than I should. I'm so exhausted and tired and I cant believe someone I thought I worked well with would say that about me. I almost cried when I heard a parent was backing me up since I am awful with communication skills. I cant tell if I am happy or upset. 

All I know is for now just pretend to know nothing and just keep working hard. I mean in reality I know it's for the kids and I know what I am doing is working because parents are saying their kids are learning. I am following DCFS policies and following learning standards from a book. I think I should be doing ok..... maybe just sad someone could do that to me.",3.5086924034869256,4.818205502283111,4.3498339559983386,87.51660647571609,72.74429223744292,6.952926525529268,28.341220423412203,7.348242739294969,1.4807753424657537,1702,66,350,18,33,548,187,438,0.131,0.787,0.083,-0.978,6,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,4,0,2,17,24,17,0,1,24,2,53,5,1,10,4,74,82,32,0,8,9,4,3,2,1,3,4,7,2,4,18,31,0,1,10,5,3,10,12,7,1,0,17,10,54,10,38,59,8,42,1,4,0,1,35,17,1,4,16,245,72,34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07874147059206976,0.0,0.0,0.06288428277563197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588392147816069,0.0700017121463009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1813960998557188,0.0,0.09587018238761064,0.0,0.0,0.08859457863976744,0.0,0.06954615856489453,0.08584891949594134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06278355075497563,0.0,0.0863767200420738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609415613590354,0.1843189805468237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051937594675559966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039760156555701115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370828884096387,0.14088280876534467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0527073005418764,0.0,0.0,0.0781021758113767,0.0,0.0,0.08418026225894316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07803298192239945,0.0698942917861146,0.0,0.0,0.17286268781197764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07683405786182088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05248939104800222,0.0,0.07899930325355416,0.08565643372349753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05830676496177475,0.06064806487579535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22635685600299105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05980536742811132,0.0,0.0,0.3492589006634926,0.0,0.1501317757529344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865615677543522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07479977529060693,0.18760083123515034,0.0,0.15916538740278696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504758289520443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13325415230782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05912364131862701,0.0,0.1374606970475268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050386054083475545,0.07725836746129174,0.062427308785380116,0.09170525835832403,0.18075844704765687,0.0,0.2254169845660469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945880750472632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04638088784995269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0707021981468706,0.0,0.0,0.08779303202518066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4579770162978174,0.0,0.0,0.05585996051924707,0.0,0.0,0.101276565363054

teaching,Kennabrea7,2020/02/29,"Quick questions about EdTPA I’m doing my student teaching right now and preparing my EdTPA in a first grade classroom which means I need to follow the early childhood handbook.

1) Do each of my lessons need to have a literacy element embedded into them? I’m particularly having a hard time thinking about how to do so with math.

2) My unit is going to be about penguins. My final assessment/ work product will be a small flip book where students will display information about a penguin of their choice for which we’ve gathered physical description, habitat, diet, how many eggs they lay, interesting facts, etc. through reading informational pieces, doing math exercises to compare penguin heights to their own, learning about Antarctica... my question is what is the best what to format/ structure this?

Would it be something like:

Lesson 1: Geography- habitat
Lesson 2: Math- height/ physical description
Lesson 3: Animal science- eggs and chicks
Assessment: Gathering information throughout about each penguin and then compiling information about favorite penguin into flip book.

3) Would it be best to keep the same central focus/standard throughout all lessons? I know that learning targets build off one another.

4) What would be a good central focus for something like this?",8.3118838028169,10.796228694835685,7.495771713615023,65.03267165492957,62.521126760563384,9.64424882629108,42.42048122065728,9.978442167317967,5.097000234741785,1044,62,138,23,16,323,133,213,0.008,0.887,0.105,0.9694,0,0,2,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,4,9,13,6,0,0,9,0,19,4,0,2,2,35,29,7,0,5,0,0,1,2,0,5,1,0,0,1,10,8,3,1,16,4,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,1,12,6,25,19,9,19,0,0,0,0,13,9,0,2,10,96,22,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18432281581457252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3689448525249552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19604346192162836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1925606537187541,0.0,0.14952012977610338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09990099515512513,0.14743765135227635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15746619794795416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15624317093444715,0.0,0.0,0.09660522265052984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17175647008239078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17821541796615809,0.0,0.19147819476946645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2606803391737645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11911447260441747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3938322718860076,0.0,0.17582962834387664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501169181189115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.270651234247318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11263404578112825,0.0,0.0,0.10249993233434383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12797143266798836,0.0,0.0,0.3746115943133742,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am currently in an education technology class and we are learning about Personal Learning Networks (PLNs) and I chose Reddit.

teaching,ahand09,2020/03/02,"""Emergency Teacher"" Help? Hi everyone! I've only just found this sub and I hope this is the right place for me to ask these questions.

First off let me be clear that the school I work at is not a very... conventional school.

I've been hired by the high school I graduated from five years ago, but so far I haven't been working as a teacher. However my colleague/boss whom I've been working on a festival project with has asked me to lead a class once a week.

The catch is that the class is four hours long. And I'd be dealing with 11 high schoolers as well, in a course where they'd be getting some ""work experience"" assisting me with the festival organisation and prep.

I'm just wondering about how I can lead a class successfully, get respect as a ""teacher"", and get them to work well and be motivated? The aforementioned colleague suggests that I lead with a short team building game of sorts just to break the ice and get everyone on the same page.

Any tips for a first timer would be appreciated!

PS: I've had many great teachers in my life and I wouldn't be who I am without them. I'm certain you guys here are just like them. I have so much respect for the profession.",3.740720076299475,5.256239497854079,4.398247496423462,86.58480090605627,72.47639484978541,8.096232713400099,28.395088221268484,8.680891452615391,1.9402982355746312,925,36,197,17,18,295,131,233,0.017,0.775,0.209,0.9937,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,4,13,12,11,0,0,20,0,24,1,0,5,2,34,35,14,0,3,7,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,8,11,0,0,4,2,0,4,4,0,2,4,5,0,20,11,25,20,4,25,1,0,0,0,17,13,0,5,8,123,28,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10836024650289383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312882025849347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22855972515398565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12602623807119182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2336151313594657,0.0,0.11957623079282725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2079581366215138,0.0,0.13403215373030852,0.0,0.0,0.2554658087974718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13477234744821615,0.0,0.12103889845548027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08193630326967796,0.2583109816515885,0.0,0.12141398814796607,0.12038384528086672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250008300045444,0.08634321077205644,0.05972131565914965,0.0,0.0,0.10818041228373844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12393430333749518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986200928682475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13018384757315324,0.0,0.0929706259354143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771697720717629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13693912907491512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10439408598066413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3711465959609052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10086253521160317,0.0,0.0,0.09805523955997687,0.0,0.2198206582252189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11783702274504475,0.1325663435862553,0.4449685256137611,0.0,0.0,0.08683728095884616,0.0,0.0,0.07871990491246597

teaching,mqyork,2020/03/02,"Student mental health and our learning environments Hello!

My name is Michaela, I am a Senior Industrial Design Major at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York currently conducting my capstone project centered around mental health and our public learning environments and how we may change the way our classrooms operate in order to best help our students. I am looking for individuals with first hand experience of learning environments like our wonderful public school teachers to help aid me in my research and hope that you would be willing to provide your feedback in my survey linked below. There are no right or wrong answers, only your personal experience. This 15 question survey should take 10 minutes depending on how much information you provide. I understand that this may be lengthy which is why I am appreciative of your contribution because your experiences are so important to the research for my project.

teaching,DClawsareweirdasf,2020/03/02,"Help: A few students derail my whole lesson Hello, 1st year full time music teacher here. I teach 6-7 grade and I love my job. A good amount of my students have natural musical talent, and most are eager to learn instruments (we are working on guitar right now). 

However, I have a few students who don’t seem to be on board with music class at all. They walk in and immediately say “I hate music class” (they did this on the first day before they met me and continue today). They yell at other students in the middle of a lesson. They consistently ignore me even if I am speaking to them directly. Some walk out of the room as soon as I speak directly to them. I’ve been called a wide variety of slurs. The biggest problem is the non stop talking. I get that kids will talk during class, but it’s gotten to the point where other students can’t pay attention.

I want to emphasize that this is only a few students — 2-3 per class out of about 25

However, as you all probably know, it only takes 1 student to derail a whole lesson. 

As we start our instrument units, I really need to have the whole class on the same page for about 10 minutes at the start of each day. I can’t have them work individually until they know how to care for the instruments, how to read guitar tabs, and some fundamental techniques. 

I can’t seem to keep them all listening for even 60 seconds. 

I think my plan for next week is to push through all the distractions, but then withhold instruments from students who are too far off task. 

At this point, all students know how to get instruments out, take them out of the case, hold, and play some patterns echoing by ear. I think I will hand out some tabs, give some individual practice time while I walk around and assist, and really hover around those 2-3 that are likely to be off task.

However, I am open to any advice you can offer me about how to manage the disruptions while still keeping the lesson on track — especially during those times we all have to be working together as a group. I’m sure we all struggle with this in our first year, so any wisdom is appreciated.

Happy Monday!",5.497203818079734,6.075797897810223,6.164781021897813,79.01938938798429,67.58880778588808,9.242784952274004,28.94637843907917,9.265573868473778,2.330600898371701,1660,54,321,30,26,543,207,411,0.053,0.8440000000000001,0.10300000000000001,0.9743,4,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,6,2,11,10,19,15,1,2,22,0,27,3,2,4,8,67,52,25,0,4,3,0,1,1,0,2,0,6,1,1,15,23,0,6,13,4,1,4,4,5,0,3,4,7,42,10,63,43,24,60,0,0,0,1,36,32,0,9,25,221,57,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10949574021077543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15239815801729253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1994997496812597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09534784454719288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11441743484496555,0.0,0.11424429683507245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14452830624897642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14801833868242711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906224391689781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11708490080837736,0.10749031458890923,0.0,0.0939837491052261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11928124440097244,0.0,0.11062797262082152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510597199753574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119413999378576,0.19919360952681534,0.0,0.0,0.1847422471377096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05474285856891961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10113114100203133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0830850036231063,0.0,0.0,0.11916838018752715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704409144531824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21185037368437554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208108121702261,0.10721845738721146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208214132529937,0.0,0.14356652837898207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09569164076839264,0.0,0.08910810351130928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20401553440241788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15862170774047682,0.0,0.08948472700680506,0.09368033762421522,0.0,0.1171408897667222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10560751286862484,0.0,0.16849804500008878,0.18012601454476904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14359656169654075,0.0,0.0,0.19601494941335876,0.0,0.10621202207399913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06609106572080535,0.0,0.08988120994871224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.375305561302072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2447251752220521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443153947169182

Overall, it was really cool to get a glimpse into this field and though I don’t think I want to be a teacher when I’m older, I for sure know that I want to be surrounded by kids, maybe through other things like volunteering",4.6509886264217,5.8533538188976415,5.5227821522309695,80.60041119860018,69.86614173228347,7.534208223972003,32.22134733158355,7.793537801064563,2.3013856517935256,513,23,95,6,9,168,84,127,0.031,0.763,0.20600000000000002,0.9693,3,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,1,11,7,0,0,9,1,9,1,0,2,4,21,19,11,0,2,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,7,6,0,0,4,2,0,2,3,1,0,2,7,2,11,6,12,10,6,13,0,0,0,1,5,3,0,0,9,72,18,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1845171680490124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2519007740292947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14880375444351088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2573283859640353,0.1523970293022949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2215399493850352,0.0,0.0,0.196261447779366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12054851593513365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12680487161716733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254490651815288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2082456213986791,0.0,0.15401612869388753,0.0,0.2318024007079796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16961536903067753,0.0,0.17795558261294125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2319504835243779,0.0,0.0,0.23079552882244966,0.0,0.14781352518178206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174632059303478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15328881193080549,0.14784444694740095,0.22669408861528115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21870798962276025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2721847081633065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.213891885278037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,aceofspaece,2020/03/03,"What are effective Web 2.0 Social media tools to use for Collaborative Discussion/Conversation? My college has used the software platform Yellowdig to create a sustained, web 2.0-like conversation among students. However, our contract with the company is up, and it's unclear if it'll be renewed. I'm interested in hearing if anyone knows of other technologies (perhaps some that might be free or open source) that allow for a networked discussion among classmates? Something similar to Yellowdig is what I'm looking for-- essentially a technology platform that mimics the look and feel of a social media discussion, but is perhaps private to the class.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

teaching,GlassOutside,2020/03/03,"How do I obtain a renewable teaching certification after graduating, when I want to move abroad immediately? (Florida) I recently graduated college with a BS in Elementary Education. I'd like to begin the process of getting a teaching certificate so I can work in public schools abroad. But I keep running into obstacles without clear information. The problem is I don't want to teach here, I got this degree for my dream of teaching abroad. However it seems like every path requires me to teach in a local school system here to obtain the renewable teaching certification. I see the 3 tests to take (GK, professional, and subject area). This seems to only give a temporary and requires us to work here to use it?? Possible I can just take all these and receive the actual certification? Or is the only option to be forced to teach here? Many thanks for any guidance or advice!",6.201666666666667,8.265997866242039,7.475557324840762,64.76942940552019,67.15286624203821,10.32887473460722,35.376326963906585,10.504223727775694,4.398647983014863,703,35,109,20,12,239,96,157,0.068,0.843,0.08900000000000001,0.3111,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,0,6,8,4,0,0,11,0,7,0,0,2,2,24,21,9,0,3,5,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,3,3,1,0,3,2,1,0,0,1,1,12,3,22,19,1,14,0,0,1,0,5,6,0,5,6,72,17,22,0.0,0.0,0.17229489414195426,0.0,0.0,0.17253018879947593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200653236591771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14875751830168135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09224413663559723,0.16937028083869268,0.0,0.0,0.14120936063380998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15693263953992848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17251439564932505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17900184552625892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876529454864379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26856024803482753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1990423335689604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16894192102994468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17432947692996653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35737173566263797,0.14069366684572798,0.3214630870636485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2654989085442709,0.0,0.0,0.16255065388377474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2123772329161335,0.15248920710671202,0.0,0.0,0.20827666948174087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1701953694389409,0.0,0.2570722879493985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,verysadgirly,2020/03/03,"How to up the rigor in this lesson I’m being observed on? I teach 11th grade AP US history. This is my first year teaching it and my 2nd year as a teacher so I’m still getting used to things. I have an observation this Friday and my scheduled lesson is 1920s consumption. Here’s how the lesson is going to go:

1. Bellwork- a 5 minute game of Kahoot to introduce the concept and topic of the Roaring Twenties
2. Notes- 10 minute PowerPoint of notes where students fill out Cornell notes while I present and show attached videos 
3. Activity- students will be in groups of 3 and be given “grab bags” of 1920s inventions. Students will have attached index cards of the history of each invention. Students will then work together to fill out a chart of information on the invention. Once the chart is completed, each student will individually fill out an exit ticket concluding 1920s consumption. 

Since this is AP, is there any way to increase the rigor of this activity to make it a little more challenging/difficult?

teaching,hplvr,2020/03/03,"March, April, May..and the kids Know it. So March is a long month. Today I was out for one of my classes, and I do have a student teacher. One class just lost it and was so disrespectful. I am so disappointed because they used to be the class I always looked forward to teaching, and to hear that they did not stop talking when I was not there just irritates me so much. First the student teacher is trying their best and being available and helping the students and the fact that these kiddos are mistaking her kindness for weakness just irritates the heck out of me. I am planning to address this tomorrow by having them clear their desks and to give a pop quiz and ask them why they think it was okay for them to be so disrespectful to the sub when I was not there.

teaching,eben34,2020/03/03,"Book These Students for Success Over the last month, I have plunged into the public arena of  education and have gotten to know my students pretty well over there.   They kinda like me. 

Unfortunately, every division of education  is suffering thanks to repeated budget cuts across the board (Thanks  Betsy).  Anyway, like any good English teacher, I am trying to get 21st  Century fifth and sixth grade kids into reading.  It's hard for a lot of  them to put down devices and pick up books.  And parents don't seem to understand or help much with it.  While my school certainly  has provided some books, there are some standards that are missing that  could gain their reading interests and some that my students have  requested.  There are also some books that can help my ESL/ELL students  as well.   

So, I heard  about this project I could create through Donor's Choose and hoped I  could find some other people that felt the same way I do about  education and ask them if they could help out.  Donor's Choose is totally legit and I created this project to get books for my students.

I call it the ""Book These Students for Success Project.""  

This project is small and I hate asking for anything, but if you feel  that you could support this project, I would be forever grateful to you.   Check it out on the link below.

Oh, almost forgot...add the  promo code LIFTOFF at checkout and their donations will be doubled up to  $50 for the next 6 days.  So anything would help!  

Thank you for your consideration and time!

teaching,MrDavidMidSchoolSpEd,2020/03/03,"Classroom management--One period doesn't wanna listen. I'll keep this post short: I'm teaching a low achieving ELA class of 11th graders. A few have ADHD and they're unmedicated. They constantly talk and disrupt the class; they refuse to obey the school’s policy of no cell phones. 

To be honest, I've picked my battles as I'm been told but I feel that more can be done because incentives aren't doing there trick. Any one have some ideas.

teaching,pinksapphire316,2020/03/03,"Teaching high school English without a English/education degree? Hi all. Maybe I’m overthinking, and I hope I don’t get ridiculed for the journey I’m about to embark on but I’m as excited as I am nervous. I thought I’d come here for advice or support. 

I was accepted into an alternative teaching program in Baltimore City and if I pass the (intense) summer training then I’ll be on my way to becoming a high school English teacher. While I’m excited, I’m also nervous because I have no prior degrees in English nor education. I graduated undergrad last year, studied Mass Media, most would call it Communications, with a concentration in film. I wanted to be a screenwriter. While I loved my area of study, I’ve always had a love for reading and writing. Being an English teacher was something I became interested in well into my undergrad career so it was too late to change majors. I really want this though. I’m afraid that because I didn’t study it in school and don’t have full, extensive knowledge on early British/American literary periods, notable works/writers, etc. that I won’t qualify— even if I pass the program. I failed my Praxis 2 by 4 points with only a week to study and I’ll be taking it again in about a week. I’ve dedicated hours to studying and I’ll continue at it. 

I guess I’m asking, how polished do I have to be going in? Am I setting myself up? I care most about the potential students I’ll be teaching and I want to give them the learning experience they need and deserve.",3.316827033218786,5.619970006872856,5.2387628865979385,76.6996792668958,75.73539518900344,7.884994272623137,32.42726231386025,8.735056554316923,3.1265289805269187,1196,63,208,26,27,410,161,291,0.051,0.7909999999999999,0.158,0.9849,0,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,2,1,12,15,1,3,14,0,21,2,0,1,1,34,45,22,0,8,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,8,13,0,0,4,2,0,5,7,5,1,0,6,0,28,10,35,31,6,42,0,1,0,2,9,20,0,7,15,137,36,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13361458872778398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10934589014916346,0.11377339155423913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12782755140944502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16670318828853947,0.15101162855879316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13962039500960996,0.0,0.13940911953952792,0.0,0.14464612390821358,0.11778397495421244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15249421894666648,0.09031131900269146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337517953236937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07143771455232001,0.13116742394151915,0.07770891249750372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15062758557485384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28893332160289265,0.0,0.13580741577593067,0.13465515117450536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11145621475695527,0.15424156882072368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24681500461199102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13736737948088604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013863056880391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10399213998284962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12925754233532996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13677070165543734,0.0,0.08759510921387274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4151454114995099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526428213656903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516378190943836,0.0,0.0,0.1028067253611156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13434016559698625,0.10855128415966064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2419472359710297,0.10853284629236187,0.2193590522980172,0.0,0.12294001697460573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13180640703632282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09713169709619562,0.0,0.0,0.08805201953551088
teaching,bookworm1230,2020/03/03,"Hazing as a new teacher? Just a comment- possibly a question. I am a new teacher and I was recently talking to a fellow student from my credential program. We were discussing the hazing, or passive aggressive type comments we have gotten at our campuses . Mind you, she was hired as a first time teacher at a different campus than I was. Anyway, I’m somewhat put off by the comments that I have gotten from fellow teachers. An example, on Friday I was walking my 5th graders out and they were walking very quiet and in a nice line and a teacher said to the students “wow you guys are quiet, what happened, did you get in trouble?” Now granted, this is something I have been giving more attention to, but why not just say nice line, or good job, or nothing at all? 
Then another teacher overheard me discussing a student who has been difficult for me, as well as the RSP teacher, and interrupted to say that the problem was not with the student, but me. She said this not looking at me, but loud enough for everyone in the staff room to hear. When I asked her what I should be doing differently, she told me I needed to get in that students face. She was his previous teacher. I don’t think that would help, as he does not try to misbehave but is very ADHD and not on medication anymore as it was apparently hurting his stomach. He is such a sweet kid, but has difficulty staying on task. Anyway, It was very awkward and embarrassing. 
My friend has received similar comments, and it’s so strange to me. Is this typical? Why not be more supportive or even mentoring? I worked as a counselor before switching careers to teach and I loved helping new employees and students who worked for us. I guess I’m just wondering if this is typical?",5.061839430894307,6.575480448170737,5.893048780487808,77.15418699186993,69.21341463414635,8.759349593495934,35.92276422764228,9.188382445141503,3.4968349593495933,1369,73,240,27,24,449,173,328,0.09,0.7859999999999999,0.124,0.9174,5,0,1,0,0,0,40.0,4,3,1,3,11,16,1,2,20,0,32,4,2,0,1,45,52,30,0,5,19,0,0,0,3,2,1,8,1,2,15,14,0,0,4,0,0,4,7,7,1,1,18,10,37,9,37,30,5,28,0,1,1,1,44,14,0,9,9,185,52,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14252032785018365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435037875882103,0.0,0.0,0.11760792309155695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11086423618639893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10091007627463996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2477994776476027,0.0,0.0,0.10377759265547562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12253361784113348,0.0,0.07832658366543511,0.0,0.0,0.1133163906383914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10087131475048017,0.0,0.0,0.0916211784138333,0.0,0.12391518997929835,0.11376089197887602,0.0,0.09946640467672956,0.0,0.0,0.13063859895014562,0.11742125623461727,0.10486741602722917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13365785458122556,0.0,0.15897473926012173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126951438471333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11768078451434967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099584469989838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10703074831655224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11946543432814034,0.0,0.0,0.11974057593228173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08793186770715761,0.0,0.3436005273845457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11378886097643474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13369071183112227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11347317565881225,0.0,0.11921419359148053,0.13284625660704613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11709183391300892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256096337943206,0.18861266481098365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129521850418576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639955882878454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13457282076915247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09531694163134956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07598672032067755,0.0,0.0,0.06914990611553737,0.0,0.0,0.1133163906383914,0.0,0.08051380493660057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.142647360167956,0.0,0.0,0.2935437882205509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10662530047982678,0.0,0.21401534610358536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286041660735488,0.17266767602532695,0.0,0.0,0.08424186561757706,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,mrtnz07,2020/03/03,"My First semester and first year of teaching Hello, I am sitting in my car as I type this because it’s the only quiet place I can be without distractions. I’m not sure what exactly it is the reason for this post wether some of you offer advice or simply a need to vent. Let me begin by explaining my teaching situation and we’ll see how this post unravels. 
       It is my first semester teaching as a credentialed math teacher (Which I am grateful to have this opportunity mid school year). The teacher whose kids I took over was promoted to a math coach at our campus (These kids had an amazing experienced teacher prior to me but now they have me a first time ever teacher coming in mid semester). I am teaching three different preps one of which is not a math class but a tutorial type of class consisting of reading and math tutorials as well as college and career readiness embedded in the curriculum. I feel like I’m sinking and I feel like I’m a terrible teacher; some days are better than others. Two of my classes are RSP classes in which at least 1/3 of my students are RSP and I have a collaborating teacher that is more like an instructional assistant. In one occasion she wanted the students to have a fun activity but she expected me to plan it so I left the planning for her. The activity was great however, the students didn’t get anything out of it because she would simply display answer to the problems in the class activity rather than providing an explanation because she was more focused about there being a winner rather than getting something out the lesson (the activity was fly swatter  bingo with system of equations found on teachers pay teachers) . I give my students plenty of resources, post video lessons on google classroom but still I feel like they just don’t grasp the content. If I assign homework I’m lucky if I get 4 assignments back. I’ve called parents, re-arranged seats, given detentions, etc for classroom management purposes (which I feel I spend most of the time doing) but still students continue to  not do their part. I feel that the responsibility  for my students learning all falls on me but there is no accountability on parents or students to do their part and when it is addressed the finger is still pointed at me as the teacher. Im not doing enough or I need to spend more time planning when I literately work until 11 pm planning for all three classes. I need to modify my instruction for a class that is RSP but I’m a general ed teacher. I’m expected to implement student driven and student centered thinking  but how do I have a students think for them selves if they are not self driven or motivated and regardless of how much I encourage them they don’t want it bad enough or they want me to give them the answers. They don’t want to do the thinking. When they are tasked to do the thinking some just shut down. How can I challenge or change a fixed mindset?
Every time I have someone observe my classroom I feel like everything g I do is never good enough and I feel extremely disappointed and discouraged with my self because I do take accountability for how and what I’m teaching and want to be a better teacher. What can I do differently is usually the question I get hit with. What about students? What about parents? Why is the system so broken and why does all accountability fall on us teachers? I got yelled at by a parent because I marked their son tardy and closed the door when the bell rang for class to start. It was my fault their student was late because I closed my classroom door when the bell rang because I should be standing by the door waiting for the entire hallway to clear out. 
 I got into teaching because I enjoy working with teenagers. I have worked in the classroom 6 years now at a different site as an instructional assistant and coach. I’m simply feeling disappointed and frustrated with my self and the system. Any advice? Any thoughts? Again, I wasn’t sure what direction this post was going to take it’s not a self pity post. I guess in part it’s a vent and in part is seeking any advice or thoughts anyone may have. I feel so alone in this.",5.5886120129870145,6.955428475765308,6.119017625231912,76.5811771799629,67.81377551020408,8.814063079777368,34.02495361781076,9.145386486771477,3.1381431632653056,3311,155,585,61,55,1073,307,784,0.068,0.8220000000000001,0.111,0.981,8,1,1,0,0,0,53.0,3,1,14,21,31,29,1,1,52,0,63,1,1,7,9,124,118,57,0,19,29,5,10,5,0,4,0,4,5,6,32,31,0,2,26,4,6,8,14,10,1,9,19,16,84,19,89,89,20,87,0,4,1,0,43,36,0,18,38,421,116,57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17257860726369706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06097063278864759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12009901850770326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04116264294134318,0.0,0.0484442526762976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0452667035187323,0.04915323887521205,0.2870884517944024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412986860669517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06011193225178929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06227570119863925,0.050710516341876406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03796569887044009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18451703707157308,0.0,0.0,0.051516745429249985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18248254855371066,0.0656546069611148,0.0,0.053250470553656934,0.04959975508662221,0.0,0.05290775046720364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2678938684051929,0.1682243849487253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20029610285395452,0.0,0.06454692873634267,0.0,0.0,0.12302669841597715,0.11294520834254372,0.033456665719135435,0.049376607390627034,0.09416599286325046,0.06490338970358943,0.06485094973913368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06358872913336353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0664069080647055,0.0,0.06396144853873546,0.060197642444228726,0.0,0.1438023414011615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04327556148364437,0.13095207340644874,0.04540347847447259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07978245033593469,0.04477260269130008,0.0,0.0,0.2614686719315525,0.2549979907640283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0615056790238577,0.0,0.055650326926516315,0.0,0.28190162059868856,0.0,0.0,0.05632977749706124,0.0,0.0,0.06594686393983254,0.0,0.05888503002283765,0.0,0.0,0.06052723862100427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0595786712702493,0.04691105026123613,0.0,0.2456532373919209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06617133402896386,0.0,0.0,0.04987959672194615,0.04532030865470009,0.0,0.0,0.041667851417393535,0.0,0.14103881601676044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110966858633749,0.0,0.08852447251005599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15088376697115136,0.0,0.09347097805877318,0.13730818064501382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06540573529575608,0.0,0.0,0.05750655591206792,0.0,0.07081227798686449,0.0,0.06483599581451324,0.0,0.1736125997948123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052930390083072494,0.0,0.10624041106613112,0.0,0.0,0.05674771088832585,0.0,0.12857221605420868,0.0,0.0,0.04181891904077446,0.0,0.0,0.1137293093731946

teaching,dopefruit21,2020/03/04,"Classroom help (long rant, sorry)

So this year has been a whirlwind. But to keep a long story short, I was teaching ESL in the first semester of the year and since January I have been teaching first grade. The former teacher had left in December right before Christmas break to move out of state. We met once to discuss her schedule and routines and processes that she had in place.

So in January when we came back, I thought it would be a breeze. 

Well was I wrong about that. Just about every single week I have either written up a student or called their parents to discuss behavior.  I have sent so many dojo messages to parents that I feel that they are sick of hearing from me. (My school uses class dojo to communicate with parents.) Or they get upset at me because of how their child is behaving. Some of the behaviors include fighting, punching, verbal abuse, cussing, and not following teacher directions. I even had a kid hit me in my face yesterday and the student is back in school today.  I have tried incentivizing them with candy and positive phone calls home and cookies but there is a handful that doesn't want it. The select few ruin it for the rest of the class. I have 14 boys and 6 girls. There are about 6 of them that makes me want to just quit altogether. They don't listen and they pick fights with each other constantly, which makes it really hard for me to teach the rest of the class. 

All of this has me upset every day and just angry at them and myself. I feel like it's my fault that they're like this. I don't want to punish everyone but that group makes it hard for me not to. I don't want to be this mean and awful teacher. I don't want to go home crying almost every day. And I know I'm not being myself around them. I feel like I'm constantly being watched by admin because I struggle to manage them. I know my anxiety has increased and my depression as well. I'm terrified of doing a bad job but I think I am which makes me think I'm a bad person which makes me upset then I'm upset at myself for being upset. then I get stuck in that spiral and I don't feel prepared for the next day.

Any advice?",3.6277468805704127,5.144535858823534,4.508962566844922,85.67408912655974,72.76470588235293,7.222103386809268,25.58467023172905,7.793537801064563,1.373486274509804,1680,54,332,22,33,543,200,425,0.195,0.7509999999999999,0.054000000000000006,-0.9958,4,0,0,0,5,0,40.0,2,0,11,3,19,20,3,6,19,1,34,3,2,8,1,65,73,29,0,6,13,3,7,3,0,1,1,2,2,5,23,24,0,1,10,0,0,6,9,15,2,2,13,10,54,5,50,53,9,47,0,2,1,0,37,17,0,4,25,231,77,15,0.0,0.10623307664446206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08761524046555891,0.0,0.0,0.089782077803636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060972240725942525,0.0,0.06859006649026958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07981688834422006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13788683928188736,0.14972560893827572,0.10931246406058497,0.0,0.07629451439657857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831068687804085,0.10254777012843456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937823791144961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09848789133513323,0.1734708895758192,0.0,0.07722449037226856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059219940026932434,0.0,0.22662861197369505,0.08567448679158103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18134024891977174,0.12810701314444226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525304163775844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368786145894804,0.0,0.05095615021992055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16063646262454784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10105394314448507,0.0,0.060097568949226125,0.0,0.17987366104537336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08897424954763515,0.07969440621296922,0.0,0.0,0.09855017419527133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741643735165803,0.0,0.0,0.13141083045025995,0.0,0.0,0.1586935101228477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29924552815069144,0.09090171319403112,0.0,0.09766661124207612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09529496291210582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09535499980111413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09548554722871463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986722519645841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07828812379232017,0.09367617939062513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536501915830801,0.0,0.0,0.057438836810074126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07656960992571593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18148250328565851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07416812391898453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10036763216038384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09373266216114301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11490170538919076,0.0,0.07118045233720953,0.0,0.0,0.08498770670378011,0.0,0.0,0.060873620124322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743791763066551,0.0,0.0,0.2644205429638973,0.0,0.0719202756913902,0.0,0.16123118369978034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06369227401694186,0.09802972363037524,0.0,0.11547689423045268
teaching,Flmedic216,2020/03/04,"BA Liberal Studies Hello Everyone,

I am in need of some advice from you all. I am a Career Technical Education teacher who teaches in a high school medical academy. I teach courses related to Emergency Medical Services. I would like to move up the ranks at my school, and in order to do that I was told that I need to have a Bachelor’s Degree. I spoke with an advisor from an out-of-state university’s online degree program, and told them that I would like to get this done quickly. He recommended that I go for the BA in Liberal Studies as it is the most credit-transfer friendly degree. 

Is getting a Bachelor’s that is not focused on education worth it, or would I just be wasting time and money?",5.346511437908497,6.2361944191176475,7.222450980392157,70.19575163398694,68.04411764705881,10.750326797385624,36.43464052287582,10.746095033038511,4.3614307189542485,555,29,97,16,9,195,86,136,0.059000000000000004,0.846,0.095,0.5711,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,1,1,2,3,0,0,9,0,13,2,0,0,1,15,21,5,0,5,3,0,0,2,1,3,2,1,0,0,9,4,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,5,1,13,3,18,12,3,13,0,0,0,0,9,8,0,3,4,72,22,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188000400162662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19688084355754476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18383602801249452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14863934005074764,0.0,0.20103072651601048,0.0,0.1093391581326486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20326964517451535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18798319089297494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38762355221420425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204479164421222,0.0,0.2853081571683469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3894160771451325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11218363033008932,0.0,0.0,0.3676720560249891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.410003086409218,0.0,0.0,0.0

I am on track to finish my sped (lbs1) endorsement by July, and I would like to get a job as a sped teacher for next school year. Preferably, I’d like to head out to the suburbs.

My question is, how soon can I apply for positions? Can I apply now and explain my situation? Do I have to wait for the endorsement to come through? Or do I apply in July when everything is finished, but the endorsement is pending?

teaching,Captainsassidy,2020/03/04,"I've decided to become a teacher. What advice do you have, now or in the future? I'm 24 years old and in my second semester of college. I started a bit late, but I've been working hard and doing excellent so far in school.

I started out wanting to be a physical therapist, but felt absolutely no passion in the decision. I think I was choosing it for the sake of choosing. Recently, I decided I'd rather be a teacher. It was something that has always been in the back of my mind, but I never gave it any consideration. As a kid, I always had close relationships with teachers and admired them. I adore reading and writing, and by this age I'm starting to love kids.

Since making this decision, I've heard a lot of negative feedback, especially regarding pay. To be honest, I don't mind that it's lower pay than physical therapy. What matters to me is that I would feel fulfilled teaching.

I'd love to hear any advice you guys have, whether it be with my education or the future career itself. It's all fair game. If you read this far, thank you!",3.801771844660194,5.363472902912624,5.641929611650486,77.54454490291262,72.39805825242719,8.645145631067964,31.80703883495145,9.188382445141503,2.995272815533981,822,39,153,18,16,283,120,206,0.07400000000000001,0.721,0.205,0.9877,1,0,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,4,1,2,4,8,0,0,11,0,17,3,0,1,2,37,33,14,0,4,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,15,9,0,0,10,3,2,0,4,0,0,1,8,5,19,8,22,20,3,22,0,0,0,3,16,9,0,4,13,106,34,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28879580151916495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459108553812275,0.0,0.0,0.20097561836618905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11362503845723745,0.0,0.0,0.16319896174362306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613251903485909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747163139885704,0.0,0.1418811619062418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14631428298759647,0.0,0.0,0.13237176469057288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16654610745807266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16668957304469753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12562769695899093,0.2667341110074998,0.0,0.0986367801926839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2984086029031701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11396836055489246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550584333653724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2956174530416915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459038020207609,0.15864832392211572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14954985205652918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12223582724044316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375959399502528,0.0,0.0,0.31377442038202924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360456007800175,0.1689864303068618,0.1715708943266618,0.0,0.0946842407995057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715783034734655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10757740132800693,0.0,0.0,0.10497067192625932,0.0,0.0,0.0951582226134985
teaching,extr0verted1ntr0vert,2020/03/04,"Suggestions for working with pessimistic student? How would you go about working with a student who is constantly negative? I’d say about 80% of what comes out of this student’s mouth is a negative comment. They assume everyone is against them, that they’re dumb, a failure, no one likes them, etc. 
If the student is corrected for anything, they get an attitude and make a negative comment such as the teacher is always getting onto them and singling then out or they’re so dumb and can’t do anything right so they should just give up and quit. 
This student obviously has very low self esteem. I have tried everything to be positive and lift this student up with praises and pointing out the good they do. As soon as a correction comes along, or any kind of misstep, it all goes back to the attitude and negativity. I’m at my wits end here.

teaching,whatshappncaptn,2020/03/04,"Gas Lighting, students, and a quick vent So I recently listen to a teacher talk about how kids aren’t that drastically different than kids in the past. However, the one thing she has noticed is gas lighting has become the norm. 

I can’t agree more. I’m tired of asking a student why they left their chromebook in their friends locker, only for them to say, “it’s not that big of a deal.” Or when I tell a student they need to get to class on time, they respond with “you’re making a big deal out of nothing.”

I love my kids. However, I really dislike when they acknowledging their behavior while also try and make teachers feel as if we shouldn’t actually be disciplining them for doing something wrong.  I see so many videos/blogs/Facebook posts from parents who are basically rewarding their kids poor behavior. One post was how their son punched their teacher, got suspended, was sent home, and the mom made their son a bubble bath and set up Netflix for him to watch. That makes it impossible for teachers to help encourage good behavior habits.",6.778197278911562,7.407095867346939,6.613673469387756,76.73727891156466,64.81632653061224,10.002721088435374,34.70068027210884,9.928628108626363,3.380576190476189,834,36,152,17,12,263,131,196,0.094,0.816,0.09,-0.2118,5,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,1,0,13,1,9,6,0,0,11,0,11,2,0,6,0,21,25,15,0,3,3,4,1,0,1,1,1,2,2,4,7,7,0,1,2,2,1,1,4,1,0,2,5,7,23,5,23,18,1,19,0,0,2,1,38,8,0,2,7,94,30,4,0.0,0.0,0.1497314324866441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12270273826422225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434419763024769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16945804098011005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3163716204632122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1603079948195877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07758186732614226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11854429665438325,0.0,0.0801639931683761,0.0,0.0,0.12869486277381134,0.1227168103472836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284493704219662,0.0,0.15390884913655936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16670869623313395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13848200819104872,0.14518488211523495,0.3072592256983104,0.15556005232701395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17970242464618835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11377087253526795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14722600958730114,0.17468793784557213,0.0,0.0,0.20794445062846886,0.11669501539056773,0.0,0.0,0.17037255409061092,0.0,0.1464720528902469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2938986074247784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982950501791495,0.0,0.15149956959180266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12201849003260122,0.0,0.0,0.12226865098656355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11812255258935755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12332606937119715,0.13410985374215173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193608089726962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08946978336337738,0.17635214586347026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417299299586903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13845215220056278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16775821270819807,0.0,0.0
teaching,elmint,2020/03/05,"Question about teaching rhetoric So, i am an English pre-service teacher. I’m currently working at the local high school in a classroom with a CT where I have to teach a 5 day unit on Rhetoric. 

Today, I brought some materials and ideas to my CT for this unit since ill be teaching in 3 weeks. She looked over them and, in one of the activity ideas i had, i printed ads that were for specific causes, some of which included imagery of guns (criticizing gun laws). When she saw it, she immediately told me that that was not appropriate in a school ever and i shouldn’t use anything to do with guns. While I understand her sentiment, the point of the unit is to teach rhetorical appeals. The best way to do that, i think, is to provide real-world examples that they have certainly already encountered or will encounter. 

My question, then, is would it be wrong to use such examples? Id be fine taking them out but the point is that they are alarming and controversial. nobody is getting shot at or dying in them, it is literally just the object in the form of art or other mediums. 

context: shes been teaching longer than ive been alive and is very traditional. i really like her and shes kind, but some things are just very... outdated.",5.36377118644068,6.435206775423733,5.962500000000002,78.5857838983051,68.11016949152543,9.289830508474578,32.97033898305085,9.516144504307137,3.0308610169491517,973,43,185,20,16,316,142,236,0.042,0.887,0.071,0.8218,1,0,0,3,0,0,33.0,0,0,5,2,8,7,0,1,13,0,28,1,0,3,2,34,39,15,1,2,8,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,0,0,13,9,0,0,6,1,0,1,2,2,0,1,8,2,25,5,29,25,5,26,0,0,2,0,15,16,0,8,9,132,38,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16647345200974376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12414171234019608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15831416452862426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15497076469838844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09728970120483828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565648094127761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13645797452226036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07881608323577677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593877468487931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3405963377771561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15709340848943545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07370066793827981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12668112564764727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022239940987416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852155413816344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3379867026811331,0.0,0.0,0.1717072626120145,0.09664227729165699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3053488437467896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12478972061501313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134250091011091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10022208624080232,0.09666249431742388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14299393883631356,0.14414946348426402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15704651502924347,0.0,0.260582460375963,0.0,0.24894415446135745,0.0,0.11974254636785207,0.12100765983897335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10982503378329862,0.0,0.0,0.10716384155261853,0.16493745799966525,0.0,0.0

teaching,Luigijosie,2020/03/05,"Starting mid-year with no lesson plans! Help! I graduated in December with my art education degree. I just recently got my first teaching job at a middle school teaching art and it will be my first time solo-teaching. I am extremely excited- BUT, I recently found out what I’m teaching- digital art. I have NO experience and know practically nothing about digital art. I start in 3 days and I have no lesson plans! This all happened very fast and now I am freaking out because I am unprepared. Also, I’ve heard rumors that this school is challenging to work at because of administration. I’ve already noticed it’s been challenging communicating with my principal and just getting basic information on the classes I will be teaching. She has practically only given me the class descriptions. I don’t even know which grade levels will be in my class (6th-8th). But I feel annoying constantly emailing with questions that go unanswered...

Any advice on diving into teaching a subject you don’t know without any lesson plans? Or on starting mid-year in general? Should I keep badgering the principal with all my questions?

teaching,Rabiid_Ninja,2020/03/05,"Switching Fields to Teaching I desperately need advice. I received a bachelors in exercise science about a year and a half ago, intending on working toward a doctorate of occupational therapy. After a year in the field, I came to the conclusion that I couldn’t do it for another 30 years. 

My wife is an intervention specialist and talked me into subbing this past September and I absolutely love it. I’ve been in a long term math position and even picked up a coaching job at the school. I’ve developed great relationships with my students and feel like I’m really making a positive impact. 

I’ve spent the last few months scouting out potential masters programs that would not only license me to teach, but also earn me a masters in the field. I would like to teach upper level high school science (Chemistry/Physics/Anatomy &amp; Physiology). But here lies the issue.. I’ve looked at private universities, public, online, you name it and the price varies greatly.

Program A is a private university and would take me nearly 3 years to complete and cost just over $50,000. I cannot fathom throwing this much money at an education while still paying back my current student loans. Especially considering that we are surviving off a first year teacher and substitute salary. 

Program B is a public online degree program that is listed as $15,000; however they want me to complete 34 credit hours in each subject I want to teach which is not included in the original cost. This would push the cost upwards of $35,000. 

My questions for all of you are:

1. Am I going to have to invest roughly $40,000 to achieve a masters in teaching? 

2. What routes did those of you who switched career paths after obtaining a bachelors in an unrelated field choose? 

3. Can you find a job while only teaching one (science) subject? 


TLDR: Wanting to switch careers and finish my masters to teach but everywhere I’ve looked is north of $35,000. What routes did you choose? How much did it cost you? Any advice?",5.262326007326005,7.509262192307691,5.869472527472527,74.59219413919415,69.93406593406593,8.58959706959707,33.012454212454216,9.21078282632365,3.3334186080586083,1594,76,260,34,30,516,205,364,0.016,0.9079999999999999,0.075,0.9535,5,0,0,0,0,0,53.0,1,6,1,11,9,6,0,0,28,0,22,3,0,5,1,44,36,18,0,9,6,1,2,2,0,4,2,0,0,0,16,16,0,0,6,2,11,5,4,0,0,3,6,4,27,6,43,25,6,50,0,0,2,1,18,23,0,1,24,168,43,26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2240703308263734,0.10163077215931053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168598284631972,0.0,0.12422379515919647,0.0,0.07796628804584352,0.12022107127317105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08815917621843619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13112965653057654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404177867845974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11734966976143713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07572558999349484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057970749939850325,0.08190635745540617,0.0,0.0,0.10478850212448397,0.0975216773851258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06515853507189905,0.0,0.0,0.2528052155458931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211345736546444,0.0,0.0,0.11290767182847558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11966536020918188,0.2275459089677879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345547949156376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11202490988514338,0.0,0.0,0.10146210614808156,0.19255512984917245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10347657441994153,0.0,0.07653011523422808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09151295465218524,0.0,0.16856265441151866,0.0850119110236755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07769016243245623,0.17439378013408716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10944689840451732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284348262010962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07344806164958621,0.0,0.0,0.12309175631806775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23206490294574406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09156005679182266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862029258263591,0.0921517485332974,0.0,0.0,0.13111286640887554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20287154914275501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08346694715853896,0.0,0.0,0.32577777186310997,0.0,0.0,0.3691558933629671

teaching,pepperquin,2020/03/06,"Considering Masters need advice Hi all,

I am a teacher who is currently teaching at an adult high school and has been overall teaching for almost 4 years. Before this I taught as a middle school teacher and then subbed in between jobs when I moved. Now that I am in a position I am comfortable with, have no children, and have time outside of work, I was considering pursuing my masters. 

I want to pursue my masters in Higher Education. I think that this would potentially open a lot of job opportunities outside of teaching should I wish to move out of the profession at some point. It seems broad enough that there is a lot I could do with it. It could also give me more insight to budgeting, counseling and other school stuff that happens outside the classroom. I could teach at a college level. I even found an accredited online program that’s roughly $10k, something my spouse and I could handle. 

I am nervous, however, that doing a purely online program would detract from me making connections in the field. I also wouldn’t have an internship experience, (not that I could quit my job to do I this anyway). The price of face to face programs is twice as much though and I would have to have my job pay for it through reimbursement. They require two years with the company after the last reimbursement check and I don’t want to be tied to the company that long either. I may want to even leave this school and go back to a traditional high school eventually, but I don’t want this to be my only option.

teaching,turkeyleg2273,2020/03/06,"The first step in fixing our education system: A revision to attendance policy in public colleges. What’s up reddit I thought I would post this everywhere I can, so here it goes! 


Before reading, I want to DISCLAIM ANY and EVERY political, religious, or scientific standing that may be attached to this petition. This comes solely from my heart and my passion for education and the improvement of the standard of living. I would love to consider any and all revisions/critiques/feedback of any form to either improve, expand, and/or further justify this cause. I will not respond to any negative feedback, bashing, or trolling and if so I advise others to ignore their response for the purpose of peace. If you want to reach out to me or interested and want to take over feel free to contact me at my student email csalampessy315@student.msjc.edu or leave a comment if this platform supports it, my name is Carlos. I don’t have any background in politics and journalism, nor do I have an abundance of research in teacher salaries, job requirements, job qualifications, and the board of education’s agenda and their funding (which I assume is subsidized). I am just currently an undergrad student attaining a BS in Electrical engineering who wants to change education for the greater good. Also, keep in mind that I’m addressing PUBLIC COLLEGE EDUCATION ONLY. 

All students who PAY for PUBLIC education should NEVER be withdrawn from, penalized, or fail a class due to attendance, and it is the student’s 100% responsibility to maintain their grade. Essentially all classes would be 100% hybrid (online with on-campus interventions/lectures). Every assignment a professor gives must be able to be turned in electronically and a student should never be withdrawn from a class or suffer their grade due to attendance. It should be noted that no percent of a student’s grade should depend on attendance unless the course obviously revolves around attendance or of the sort (public speaking courses, science courses that include labs, etc.). Other than that, the only time attendance should be used is in the beginning of the course where everyone must “check in”, then a professor may drop students within a given time frame.  

Furthermore, to compensate for the entire “Teachers get paid on student attendance” notion, ALL public college professors should not be paid based on class attendance (if they are), and instead be paid a fixed salary that depends on the class’ critique, not pass/fail rates. What this means is that if a professor is continuously reported for poor performance by the students, they can be put on probation or potentially fired. 

I am pushing this agenda because I am an independent student and tired of being flagged for not showing up to class even though I perform at a proficient level. I have a job that restricts me from attending classes some semesters and I have to go through a whole headache just to have the professor make an exception. Sometimes they cannot do it simply because they don’t want to and “that’s not how I teach”. With some emotional appeal, I find that to be completely unfair especially if a professor is able to choose their schedule. I also believe it puts students a disadvantage especially for those who on the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum (as with most if not all laws and regulations in life). I pay for my education and it is absolutely not fair in a PUBLIC, GOVERNMENT environment that I should be punished for learning a different way because the majority “depend” on a professor. Today there is an infinite supply of FREE resources outside of the classroom and a student’s attendance should have little-to-no connection with their grade, and should be solely based on the performance of a student. A student can show up to every class and still fail the course; vice versa.

So why is attendance even an issue? Well it is thought that a student’s grade directly correlates to their attendance in class. This statement can obviously hold true in the pre-internet era (before everyone had EASY access to the web via smart phone, cheap computers, a Starbucks with free WiFi on every corner, etc.). Very few students had access to these resources before this and libraries were the one of the few if not the only credible resource.
In order for this to work, however, 1 of 2 things must occur, with the latter to be far fetched. 1) A professor MUST provide at least 1 FREE online resource to students (as most do) that covers the ENTIRE course. 2) Every professor must follow ONE , FREE, AND SINGLE course guideline/resource that is provided by the board of education or the course’s department or whoever may be in charge, but that is another issue in of itself.

Some may consider empty classrooms to be an issue, meaning lecture times may be questionable. If keeping the lights on is the argument, all classrooms are in full operation during the day anyway and most classrooms (and bathrooms) have motion-sensor lighting and air-conditioning so that is not the issue. Empty classrooms can be viewed as a professor’s “waste of time” and it entirely would be unnecessary and costly for professors to hold lectures. This actually works out better because a professor can help more students during lecture times and have more flexibility with approaching a course than simply holding lecture times as “lecture only”. If this is the case then lecture schedules should be dubbed “intervention” schedules instead, because classes would not be solely lectures. This does not exclude the tradition of lecturing a class and does not remove the professor’s right to hold lectures. Instead it gives more options and flexibility to professors during “intervention” time. It also gives the student freedom to consider intervention time as extra help from not only the professor, but also other students who also need help. Even if just one student attends the intervention, the intervention may span from the entire allotted time, or just 5 minutes to give that one student the extra help they need. If no students show up after 15 minutes, a professor and the “intervention” may be dismissed for the day (of course the professor can still be contacted online at any time for help via email or PM through the school’s online class*).

Others may completely disagree and argue that attendance teaches a student time management skills and the responsibility of participation. It is stated that it prepares students for the “real world” and the workplace. This is a weak argument because part of most jobs is that a worker needs to show up to do the actual work. If the worker can do the work outside of the workplace, why and where would they need to show up? Jobs and careers are very dynamic these days and if a worker can not fulfill the job and/or if part of the job requires attendance, then that is the responsibility of the worker. Likewise, if a student can study, be prepared, and pass a class without attending a single “lecture”, which happens more often then not, they should feel not obligated to sit through an entire “lecture” they already prepared for. Again, maintaining the grade is 100% the student’s responsibility and if attendance and participation is not mentioned in physiology for instance, then it should not show up in the grade book . To compensate, there should be a course for this skill just as there is a course for all other skills (such as public speaking or leadership courses), if even necessary.

It is now the time to for us as a society to move beyond this work-and-attend mentality and move to an explore-and-create public education system as a nation. There will always be unintended effects and plenty of disagreement.

After my phone interview went well, they want me to prepare an activity and go teach it to a group of k-5th graders. I don’t know what to do with that variety of ages, up until now I only have experience working with 3-5 year olds. I have the most experience teaching music related lessons, and a year of my education was for music education in elementary school. I haven’t finished my education degree yet so I don’t have any experience student teaching. The type of activity they want me to prepare is something like Ice-Breaker Activity, Group Game, Team-Building Activity, Quiet Challenge or Activity

teaching,deohvii,2020/03/06,"AR Escape Room eLearning Platform. Hey you guys!   


I am still new here, I would like to share what I do as a developer in the eLearning field with all of you without spamming anyone.   


I work in Austria and we helped develop a new e-learning platform we called Escape-AR where all students can transform the class into a learning experience to reach one learning objective with teamwork and critical mind through solving complex puzzles and riddles.

teaching,STay19,2020/03/06,"Advice please! I currently work as an ESE teacher. The children have gotten increasingly violent and since I just had my first baby, I told my admin that next year I would like to teach gen ed as that is where I see my career going in the future. 

Last month, they had us fill out sheets to state what our top choices were for grade level and position next school year. I chose all 3 gen ed classes. When I went to speak with her about it the next week, she stated that she “lost” it. I told her my reasoning for moving out of ESE and she laughed and somewhat blew me off, stating “your position is so hard to fill!”.

A couple weeks go by and the district is holding its annual career fair for new hires and transfers and I wanted to talk with my admin about it.

Today, I went to the office and said, “hey just wanted to talk about next year and see what I needed to do to interview for a gen ed position” as I was told they were interviewing. There are 4 positions open within my school...

I was told, “if you don’t do ESE next year, you won’t have a position”
Basically saying that if I don’t take the placement, they won’t hire me for anything else. 

I’m meeting with a union rep after school tomorrow to discuss options and such, but I feel disgusted. It really threw me for a loop that I wouldn’t even be considered because they don’t want to fill my position. It’s neither my FAULT nor my PROBLEM that this position is hard to fill. 

I love my ESE kids with all my heart but I can’t keep coming home with injuries. I don’t want to explain to my daughter what happened to mommy daily. The school is in my neighborhood and my niece goes there, so it’s very convenient for me. They know this and they know how much I love the school as a whole. My very best friends teach there with me. 

So my question is... what do I do?!
Do I call their bluff and say alright, I’m looking for positions elsewhere? Or should I bite the bullet and stay? 

I’m so torn and conflicted.",3.5383503725524186,4.6467862261306525,4.4975896725004345,87.26128140703518,72.41708542713567,7.801212961358516,25.78443943857217,8.216663640201805,1.4318869173453477,1530,48,325,23,29,497,191,398,0.04,0.848,0.11199999999999999,0.9821,1,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,2,3,7,5,17,12,2,0,16,1,31,3,1,2,2,55,64,31,0,11,7,1,3,1,1,5,0,4,1,2,19,25,0,3,6,0,0,12,10,5,0,1,16,10,61,7,45,42,8,48,0,1,3,2,41,10,0,6,23,215,80,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08312187360486409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06999900703257729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05185317515993094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892676128538269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08685809638866725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327362058321922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09411979271594756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105861833048352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056182832389089984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04301004360111616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07235393022757701,0.0,0.0,0.06571890499019517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09668570571659127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07522029152836351,0.0,0.15239818633904112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10079920900960504,0.0,0.0,0.08532440040574345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07560726107751904,0.0,0.0,0.09349600685530032,0.06933710969525113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041557132377711366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07143089005252287,0.0,0.09285552473526246,0.0,0.1535440539276666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06789589877207676,0.0904077397981235,0.06253056173399238,0.06307260132974453,0.0,0.082153678165879,0.4523234884104297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933728375405045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139311215114514,0.0,0.0,0.09528921879641956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05449307344210505,0.08745818890435958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091370546028187,0.13528987525867772,0.0,0.4304378330598414,0.13556724505932938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07036439538537996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066507047040208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06395624693802368,0.13673967393724032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08062909348945775,0.32512260763814443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10231944701296966,0.0,0.0,0.1403705756136668,0.2006877418493372,0.0,0.13646365709620334,0.0,0.0,0.15770716784938607,0.0,0.09496899565743233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06192635148356145,0.0,0.0,0.060425801747627926,0.0,0.0,0.21910927266767316

The problem is that I’m not a education major. I’m human services (B.A) major. I have to pass this thing before I apply anywhere. As far as I know, to teach elementary school, you only need to pass the General Curriculum and Foundations of Reading, correct? And it says on the website that I need to obtain a MEPID number. How will I get that? Since I’m not an education major, I have no idea if I can even obtain that code. I’m so lost. Also, I’m going to be senior next semester so I won’t have that much time left.

I am finishing up my teaching degree and I am beginning to apply for jobs. The school district I am currently doing my intensives at told me that a big thing they are looking for among their applicants is someone who is passionate about diversity inclusion within their classroom. I think this is something I could definitely get better at, so I found an online workshop about diversity training and inclusion. There's a free version that is just the course, or you can pay for a different level and if you finish the course, you get a certificate of completion.

Would this be something that would be worth me paying to do? Do you think it would look good to them or would they not even care? I think I am going to do the course no matter what, but i'm trying to decide between the free course and the one to pay for. 

Any advice about this or related to inclusion of diversity when applying to schools is greatly appreciated :)",5.883627524308152,7.6124643821989535,6.596682872101718,72.06708115183248,67.48167539267016,10.273896783844428,33.53814510097233,10.451354775682146,3.936871054599852,831,38,139,23,14,273,105,191,0.032,0.831,0.138,0.9674,5,0,3,0,0,0,15.0,0,4,5,1,9,7,0,0,11,0,22,1,0,0,0,25,36,12,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,10,5,0,0,6,0,6,1,2,0,0,1,2,2,22,9,28,27,1,13,0,0,2,1,13,7,0,5,5,111,32,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13999807700052824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974259319119338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267073155334378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14606944374639444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15021188973317234,0.0,0.0,0.11438640666827413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14968269111353144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09462597693966468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15708399857875632,0.0,0.0,0.1497013575817384,0.0,0.08142148562547365,0.12016489517038713,0.0,0.15795149630744135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42650880507931216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24061505863852856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062300753657276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09708088797200436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604909371244092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28998609527553243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12138899021182285,0.33087997088366594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09517970034770598,0.2753975971490588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13689699800051774,0.0,0.09726834865922404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4070888048600502,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,fabbrunette78,2020/03/07,"Student teaching Hello fellow teachers,
I'm in my third year of University and I'm doing my field experience two times a week on top of university classes. In the fall I do my internship. I have to teach 10 lessons for the field experience I'm currently in and I just feel like my lessons aren't that great.. I feel myself getting very panicked in front of the class and I feel like I just don't have the hang of it yet.. I know I want to be a teacher and that I love helping children and everything, I just feel like when I teach a lesson it isn't my best work. Any tips on how to overcome nerves? How to make sure I actually teach students and it gets through to them? I'm in a grade 2 class, and for ex I taught a science lesson and had an exit slip for the closing of the lesson (it was an introduction to matter and I threw way too much material at them at once) and a lot of students didn't learn a lot judging from the exit slip. I just felt kind of defeated at the end of it.. I know I will be a good teacher once I get over this hurdle, I just need some advice for a freshly new student teacher feeling overwhelmed by everything. 
Thank you for all the tips! I enjoy this sub a lot.",2.7588157894736867,3.981869830645163,4.393268251273343,86.81319185059424,74.48387096774194,7.1565365025466905,27.568760611205434,7.669130373188453,1.4629645161290328,930,36,202,12,19,313,124,248,0.049,0.813,0.138,0.9423,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,2,9,10,13,0,1,21,0,13,1,0,3,2,42,35,13,0,2,5,1,6,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,9,11,0,0,14,0,0,4,4,2,0,2,6,6,29,11,33,26,7,28,0,2,0,1,9,15,0,4,11,134,38,15,0.0,0.0,0.13393304827514133,0.0,0.0,0.13411595404772195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09333250918373756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14403201641442664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155990016735185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2466970921692145,0.2685073509746576,0.0,0.0,0.3469804505742195,0.29414735718538776,0.13177842122605898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2151173161568312,0.0,0.0,0.11511607804984465,0.0,0.15131504713781033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919936160963066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1429213896148729,0.1508544696509005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011555159169832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500468845567007,0.12387056732356212,0.0,0.0916132839199836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10089216689171954,0.10176674002588053,0.0,0.1325537845564349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2923266590675375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12935345535559795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12635838503626395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08002969460298542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13407015039287612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11324295791350625,0.08095170018590561,0.10894009677094553,0.11009107934272737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991728229555208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838241930222754

Third year ENL teacher here. Just started my Master’s program in August and now its second semester midterms/crunch time &amp; I’m really struggling. I feel like I’m constantly drowning in work and can’t get ahead.

Maintaining the balance between lesson planning for work (I teach full time!) and getting graduate work done (6 credit hours/semester minimum) is incredibly stressful. 

I’m definitely a Type-A personality and even with organization/scheduling, I feel completely overwhelmed and stressed out. Being in “survival mode” constantly has taken a toll on my mental and physical health.

teaching,theboxingteacher,2020/03/08,"Tips for ""Lesson Plan"" Interview Question Good afternoon, everybody! I hope you're all having a splendid Saturday.

I have an interview coming up this Wednesday for a Special Education Teaching Position with the district I'm currently student teaching in. For what it's worth, I'm in California. It is very likely I will be asked a question about giving them an example of a Standards Based Lesson Plan.

My question is: How detailed should I be with this answer? My assumption is that I should basically take them from beginning to end in great detail, while also including the accommodations, UDL, and differentiation embedded within the lesson. The thing is, I feel like that could turn into a 10-15 minute answer, and I don't know if they are simply looking for a more concise summary of just my objectives with the lesson.

I know that different districts are probably looking for different answers, but I was just wondering how you all weigh in on this question. I've done a mock interview with my University, and I felt like this was the most difficult answer for me to provide.

Thank you!",7.907636054421773,8.817060137755101,8.359591836734698,64.21993197278914,62.41836734693878,11.839455782312925,39.29251700680272,11.538034831475384,5.148280272108844,881,45,135,26,12,292,118,196,0.039,0.8420000000000001,0.11900000000000001,0.8832,4,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,2,3,6,6,10,1,0,15,0,18,1,0,2,2,40,35,9,0,5,4,0,2,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,11,9,1,0,17,0,1,1,1,2,0,0,4,4,20,8,24,25,4,16,0,0,2,0,14,8,0,8,10,103,31,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11675131862981995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13648464669239313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12576087103600386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165642989848343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3050652340257753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1494025111016353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293073169890727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07381893379254706,0.104298115592136,0.1401770983880265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14005071142187905,0.0,0.1224528086518448,0.0,0.16095885846013822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14500494577270967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604689268378196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21397582611509688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2451963170478188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15740618358596678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6541865987128535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10976929021795363,0.0,0.0,0.1344116252614345,0.0,0.0,0.09699190115125883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15879950738629178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204603083380516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583242240555078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

What other steps would I have to take to become certified here?,1.8354725274725288,4.260899800000002,3.462197802197803,86.77923076923078,81.76923076923076,6.175824175824177,21.59340659340659,7.447530270364453,0.9492637362637364,257,8,50,4,7,85,49,65,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,7,0,0,0,0,11,10,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,11,6,0,9,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,3,4,41,9,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405398032774297,0.0,0.0,0.3454858778126242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694673275672502,0.32798654444248565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3312319456343737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35265832864140645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352022297580753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3392406969985303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4444376894014373,0.0,0.0,0.20144626975237634
teaching,DJBougieSnacks,2020/03/09,"Preparing for Coronavirus Hi fellow teachers...

I'm wondering what those of you who work in low-SES areas are doing to prepare for a possible school shutdown due to coronavirus. Friends of mine who have currently been shut down for a month (international school overseas!) are teaching online with a ""flipped classroom"" model, but not all my students have reliable internet access, and very few have access to a printer to print off math worksheets and email in. How would you keep students on pace with a long school closure, and what are you doing now to be ready for that?",12.607352941176465,9.613531205882355,10.666764705882354,64.00544117647061,55.568627450980394,13.729411764705885,47.068627450980394,11.698219412168324,5.521050980392157,461,22,74,9,4,141,72,102,0.0,0.943,0.057,0.68,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,3,0,1,2,1,0,0,5,0,11,0,0,1,1,12,14,5,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,5,1,18,11,2,12,0,0,0,0,9,7,0,1,5,54,11,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920251731454963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2209181270082543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2199544151883001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19838616786938654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2801970301163454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7546221237315486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2050755721718797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695363417610965,0.18094364730626394,0.0,0.0,0.17655916581042874,0.0,0.0,0.0

I meet with her once a week for writing. With me, we can come up with simple sentences. In the classroom, I can’t meet with her all the time (and she only wants to talk about non academic stuff) so she struggles. 

I’ve added reading to once a week to go over sight words/reading easier books.

teaching,Miss_Swiss_,2020/03/10,"I just accepted a position as a Long Term Substitute. Any advice would be great! This is my first post in this sub.

So as the title says, I just accepted a position as a Long Term Grade 5 Substitute. The teacher is going on medical leave and I will be covering her class for about 2 months. I am super excited but also super nervous!

I graduated last May with a Bachelor's Degree in Children, Family and Community Studies. I was the highest ranked student in my program. I have an SEI Endorsement from my college and I have a teaching license for grades 1-6. I'm also a member of a few honor societies. Despite all this, it has been *impossible* to get an interview, let alone a job. Everyone wants multiple years experience which is pretty hard to get if no one will give me a chance. As of right now, I substitute teach per diem. I finally got an interview (for a job I didn't even apply to!) and I was the selected as the recommended candidate for the position! Yay!

With all that being said, I feel 100% comfortable in the classroom. I thoroughly enjoyed my student teaching. But I'm curious if anyone has any advice for someone in my position. If someone was covering your class for two months (during important state testing dates) what would you look for in that candidate? I just want to make sure I impress this teacher/administration so this can be a great addition to my resume, and hopefully lead to having my own classroom by the fall. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate any advice :)",4.22613530778165,6.289253940766553,6.0131228222996524,73.2506017711963,72.31010452961672,10.079500580720094,32.16739256678281,10.317481424215053,3.937673751451801,1199,58,208,38,24,412,162,287,0.034,0.7090000000000001,0.257,0.9971,2,1,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,2,0,6,10,16,0,1,24,1,25,1,0,2,3,31,41,20,0,8,8,0,2,0,0,5,1,2,0,1,11,9,0,0,3,1,0,3,2,1,0,3,7,5,28,15,34,24,6,26,0,0,1,0,9,8,0,5,13,150,39,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3709267784099776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13104544506698038,0.0,0.2023697120281424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581313103146914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08847172183828611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357093071593691,0.0,0.0,0.1209034760340258,0.0,0.12376922564706933,0.11927988010895008,0.0,0.06397664946803734,0.0,0.0,0.13860586965568106,0.0,0.10762514157703386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13221191671841026,0.12137773890865153,0.0719091052379176,0.0,0.10119646033291953,0.2789964020726447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11334475079123668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256714247987287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511201747609423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10313767647482264,0.0,0.13397549203835035,0.0,0.1293840408944505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22394761517005726,0.10625213627920099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08445880657346824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274642282093061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20198780342300215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857390372595371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12117939948078275,0.12872504900057724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12656281580469433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10805471203007204,0.12035764993407573,0.10062060162355084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144145026294033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11925168488698976,0.0,0.0951337420066924,0.0,0.0,0.11649051255530575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377982981715707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12360003282054326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492596639973392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17976453932879932,0.0,0.0,0.08148025413936431
teaching,LostCausation,2020/03/10,"Second grade student teaching Need advice on how to teach Social Studies to second graders. My mentor teacher is great, but very chill and gives me full reign to do whatever. Being placed in 4th and 5th grade classrooms through my time in the program has hindered my teaching abilities with primary grades. I’m focusing on government and why it is important, but I feel like I’m soaring above their heads.

teaching,KazamatsuriBond,2020/03/10,"Carrying out tests online? Hello fellow teachers!

I think this is a commonplace issue these days, but due to the COVID-19 outbreak, my university is considering a switch to e-learning. However, the issue of how we would carry out midterm exams/quizzes/finals remains unsolved.

We are already using google classroom for several purposes, but its exam management is quite lacking.

We're looking for something with the following features.

1. The ability to assign to each student a random model from a previously made set of models.
2. Versatility in question types (MCQ, essay, diagrams which contain spaces to be filled in, etc.).
3. Exporting grades in an excel sheet.
4. Possibly some anti-cheat measures? I honestly can't think of how to prevent cheating in an online exam, but perhaps I'm missing something?

Thanks in advance.",5.190079787234044,8.572986319148939,6.174534574468088,66.49031250000004,75.87943262411348,8.064007092198581,37.18129432624113,8.841846274778883,4.525542198581562,665,40,84,16,16,219,107,141,0.053,0.8320000000000001,0.115,0.8435,1,0,2,0,0,0,32.0,2,0,0,3,2,5,1,0,10,0,7,0,0,4,0,22,16,5,0,2,3,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,2,3,0,0,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,5,3,20,13,4,14,0,1,1,0,5,8,0,3,2,55,9,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24749848591107074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14464200418892376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25013141381905585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4681799658352935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1883386594846828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21221909784315693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25284192860991245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.251244856647652,0.23854931857965556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533724883826782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3453233033663611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20648683165954013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2874190532980552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937058540549084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593220312818081,0.0,0.0,0.0

I want to offer online classes for my students who have to stay home due to quarantine. Ideally some kind of virtual classroom in which we all video call and where we share a virtual board and documents.

teaching,Throwaway47328191937,2020/03/10,"[ADVICE] I think my workplace is toxic Throwaway for obvious reasons. Wall of text incoming.

Context: I work in an urban school district that has recently gone through a big district-wide shift. The school that I’m at was an elementary school until this year, when they made us a middle school. This is my first year working here.

I’m a first year teacher with long-term subbing experience in the district. This year, I took an 8th grade teaching position. To put it lightly, this year has been hell on Earth. First, I was put in a position where I was told to make an experimental curriculum work with no training. Then, I was told that I had to train this 64 year old teacher on how to do her job. THEN, that teacher quit the school because of consistent gang issues, which led to admin putting the entire gang group into my classrooms. After that, they hire a new teacher which was no better then the last.

AND THEN the administrators put me in charge of the Student Council because I was the only teacher not drowning at the school. They gave me a $0 budget and told me that I had a month to plan a dance. I was supposed to sign a contract for this work, but I never received it. AND THEN after I pulled off the school dance (by some miracle), the school financial secretary went on maternity leave a month early. This caused the most incompetent secretary I’ve ever met to become our financial secretary.

This financial secretary was talking hot, utter nonsense and was not making ANY form of sense when I tried to work with her, so I got frustrated and asked my co-sponsor to figure out what the HELL she was talking about so that I didn’t anger her. Well, it turns out that now she has a hate-boner for me and is ACTIVELY trying to destroy all of my planning periods! She’s been on the warpath towards me that’ll for the last week because I’ve had a million other meetings I’ve had to go to, which means that I cannot cover for all of these classes that she wants me to do!

While this dramageddon is happening, my cosponsor got yelled at in the middle of the hallway (in front of the students) for venting her frustrations about having DAILY professional development meetings that are useless to all of us. Additionally, I’ve just come off the heels of being caught in the middle of a gang riot because of understaffing AND going through a whole union investigation regarding that. OH YEAH! And that’s not even mentioning that admin didn’t tell all teachers in my subject that we were sharing our classrooms with a mobile teacher until the DAY IT HAPPENED. Oh crap! I also forgot to mention that they decided THE DAY I was back to let me know that I was teaching an elective. They told me it was nine weeks, and then changed their minds LAST WEEK.

At this point, I despise my job. I love my kids, and I love teaching, but I cannot deal with this consistent workplace toxicity that permeates the building. My cosponsor has to step down from Student Council because she’s getting stress ulcers from this job, and I’m about to lose my shit on someone at this point. 

With that being said, I need to ask you all: is my workplace toxic, or is this normal? And if this is normal, how can I navigate this for the rest of my life without throwing myself out of a window. If this isn’t normal, what’s my next move? Thanks!

TLDR: I think my workplace is toxic, but I don’t really know if this is normal because I’m a new teacher. What should I do?",5.8325781698221455,6.493544823795179,6.178726333907063,78.92267068273097,66.8765060240964,8.733448078026392,32.827596098680445,8.704169506293173,2.6444367183017787,2729,113,507,40,42,878,283,664,0.10300000000000001,0.8490000000000001,0.047,-0.9903,3,0,0,0,0,0,76.0,5,1,6,13,18,18,9,1,46,1,50,7,3,9,8,73,90,35,1,10,12,0,1,0,0,2,2,2,1,1,51,25,0,1,8,2,1,20,13,12,1,5,37,4,73,6,86,48,10,97,2,2,0,2,44,34,4,6,43,367,124,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060331974620852026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04937375126614451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04198556849821207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11543782248497288,0.0,0.0,0.04747453321990528,0.0,0.22581813754326746,0.06818738753314088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05460433963682811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342436675084688,0.06531312456017982,0.0531838615479191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07963486148249148,0.06365161005120101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040778931836153984,0.05584769900969303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060393928520804524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575489805352618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032256794878312706,0.0,0.07017694970666788,0.0,0.09875882732485183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919360988024587,0.0,0.0,0.060955832835758963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06444090521497739,0.1838033704099942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06786178496841415,0.1509799248138819,0.0,0.06537413680502685,0.0,0.06313371095811908,0.0436090489309614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05463828424341981,0.0,0.06907168101196327,0.0,0.0,0.1114461881451699,0.05842023053899741,0.08242435226500547,0.0,0.0,0.0672533623083285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06234017309909965,0.0,0.09856114796087004,0.06562024201906101,0.0,0.04577970175198972,0.04761797921166512,0.11925846738429186,0.065661583503085,0.0,0.24196981396098216,0.0,0.0,0.0647861320513547,0.0,0.0,0.04695633321145522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11672921105369136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2482644970261537,0.0,0.06566848284617563,0.0,0.0,0.039552461720845054,0.06347938279695772,0.06096116657027096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05872922989578953,0.0,0.0,0.499876401602213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06337560216556333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052312414810404266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07072338478245747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992491408081351,0.053963804350849784,0.05684223725111109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07912147175077723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2359822759281731,0.06859582235286353,0.08383531643364428,0.06715579293572506,0.0,0.0,0.1485321254848342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036416069630262136,0.0,0.14857320112395206,0.0,0.05551200699431321,0.057233941173210214,0.0,0.06893091778716508,0.0,0.05951551308803708,0.0,0.22473862197985645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2385526427247035

Any suggestions for study materials?  I don't have any prior knowledge in this area, really.  I have a single-subject math credential.

teaching,678trpl98212,2020/03/11,"I had my first lockdown today. Not a drill. I have a tool kit in my classroom. I passed out hammers and wrenches and screw drivers. I was a drill sergeant. YOU flip the table up against the door. YOU here pass out scissors. YOU grab that chair. 

The kids are freshmen in high school. They were ready to fight. We were ready to fight for an hour and a half while we waited in the dark. I cussed a lot. We had a couple giggles. I was absolutely terrified I would have to make the choice between my own life and a student’s today. 

After an hour and a half, we found out it was a false threat. No gun in the building. Afterwards kids hugged me and told me what I meant to them. I tried not to cry. 

They didn’t let the kids go home after unless their parents were there. They were expected to go to class. I only had prep left. I have sat and stared and said little. I think this was a career changing moment for me. I LOVE my kids. We have a phenomenal relationship. I’m a really good teacher.

teaching,turncoat-yankee,2020/03/11,"National Board Woes! So, I jumped head first into becoming a candidate for National Board certification and am attempting components 2, 3, and 4 all at once (already passed component 1). I recognize now that this was clearly a massive undertaking and I maybe should have approached it differently, but here I am! 
Has anyone else attempted all three at once? If so, how in the world did you manage to do it?! Is it actually possible or have I set myself up for failure?

Many schools have been closing down and moving into e-learning days, which I think is certainly the best preventative measures that can be taken right now. However, the school I am at, e-learning is sort of not a realistic option. Most students do not have access to wifi or even stable cell signal at home. Most importantly, we are not a 1:1 school (we use laptop carts and there are about 70 laptops for the entire school). I teach high school history and I am worried about what I will do if my district or the state decides to close schools. Any suggestions for what I can prepare for my students so that they don't lose out on learning but is still manageable given the circumstance?",8.774843646041251,8.729518886227549,7.756846307385228,72.4993147039255,60.73652694610779,10.535994677312043,40.71124417831005,9.994966539143718,4.198926014637392,742,37,123,13,9,228,116,167,0.01,0.9079999999999999,0.08199999999999999,0.8281,2,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,2,1,1,3,8,5,0,0,9,0,21,0,0,2,1,29,27,10,0,1,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,7,10,0,1,4,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,5,1,12,4,18,20,5,19,0,1,1,0,7,11,0,7,6,89,19,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13153726284073028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153797457771344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14126266584095942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08681094703045955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08890723549171743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14222061613554188,0.13502267930400969,0.0,0.13256164750830152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11303671768096656,0.1505917868131826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273692311235617,0.0,0.1364712631905196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430668741803509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12849845304770022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143172050024432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495439438267868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8173821680622976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1074980271731774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862512945368638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11625798971844085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15028489134995687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13670083657539012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,kelsersann5,2020/03/12,"Alternate route to teaching when you have a low college GPA? (MI) Hello,

Through life experience, I've decided that I am interested in teaching. I know there are alternate certification programs in Michigan. The majority of programs require a 3.0 GPA or higher. Also due to life experiences, when I graduated with my Bachelor's degree, I graduated with a 2.74. With this less than stellar, my options may be limited. Would anyone have any information about how I can become the teacher I feel I'm meant to be?

teaching,notfungi,2020/03/12,"Free Software and Faith in Humanity I just got an email from some tech broski (maybe you've seen it, too!) saying that Peergrade and EduFlow are free for the next four months to help educators and their dealings with Coronavirus / COVID-19, and that kind of restores my faith in big companies and ""people of the world that run this show"" a touch more.

It's probably stupid, but to see that someone recognized that the world needs help instead of taking advantage of educators' increased need for tech help right now really hit me in the feels.

Anyway... back to grading!

teaching,saxysaxysax,2020/03/12,"Coronavirus concerns from a sub Posting here because r/substituteteach seems to have gone down for some reason. I sub in a district where one school had a known exposure to coronavirus. The student was in contact with someone who tested positive, and is now being quarantined and monitored for symptoms. The school did not shut down, and despite it being all over the news here, neither my sub company nor the school/district has said ANYTHING to us subs regarding the situation. Now, requests from that school are popping up like crazy. I assume either teachers feel a little sick and are playing it safe, or they are just scared of getting the virus. I personally am refusing to sub there for now, but obviously a lot of people are still subbing there as I can see the requests getting taken every day. I'm just annoyed and discouraged by how little this job seems to be valued - that we don't even get the courtesy of a simple warning while they expect us to put ourselves and our families in danger. If teachers aren't expected to come to work, then why make subs work instead? It is blatantly irresponsible to bring in random subs who might contract the virus and then go spread it at another school the next day. I'm considering taking a month or so off of work but honestly I'm not sure if that's an overreaction.",8.409485086342231,8.116612824489799,8.135510204081639,70.30207221350082,61.57142857142857,11.130298273155415,38.846153846153854,10.560738912317856,4.21852590266876,1062,49,179,22,13,340,153,245,0.11599999999999999,0.812,0.07200000000000001,-0.8833,1,1,0,0,0,0,21.0,4,0,2,3,15,9,2,1,18,0,19,2,0,3,4,43,37,20,0,4,11,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,10,10,0,3,6,1,0,5,6,4,0,1,6,3,11,5,31,27,5,31,0,1,1,0,14,14,0,11,12,129,21,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391906452771467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724973977750406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203970462886371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1017991659647014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15242899339544752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780549047968539,0.0,0.09956936083693528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11140691633231704,0.0,0.059753926881863186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.185228077826656,0.0,0.06716280787216647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11727260403596737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057735394842827636,0.2368891368448985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10047000203426444,0.0,0.0,0.07888417718783156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253672996855442,0.0,0.0,0.0943278878866278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12568275867883424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08007990737131819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08192916828078707,0.1031877446440298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131810595955068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11880069442276793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12150581090960948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11241354890625653,0.0,0.11831596117228335,0.5980080151134263,0.09417190231167977,0.2151681103383518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13283608807109473,0.0,0.0,0.10013113080366406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437643888537796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138058211123096,0.12283132660564007,0.08885452287878816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2843051642592149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663651268472757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581031569923772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Blood_Bowl,2020/03/12,"Arabic Translation Service Hi fellow teachers,

I have a serious need for an Arabic translation for a nine-page beginning-of-the-school-year document that goes home to parents.  This would essentially be a one-time translation, as the form doesn't really change year-to-year (it's a conglomeration of parent permission forms and such).

Apparently, my school district, despite having a large number of Arabic students, doesn't provide this sort of thing.  And Google Translate isn't going to cut it.  &lt;smile&gt;

If necessary, I'm willing to pay for it myself as long as it doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but I need to know that it's done well.  Anyone have any ideas for how I could go about getting this done?

Any ideas you have would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",6.846737588652482,7.831701617021282,6.8391489361702105,73.93333333333334,64.74468085106382,9.954609929078016,32.687943262411345,9.994966539143718,3.277870921985816,612,24,106,13,9,195,89,141,0.027000000000000003,0.866,0.106,0.9193,3,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,0,0,4,5,1,0,9,0,16,2,2,1,0,15,24,9,0,6,2,2,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,0,11,3,0,0,3,0,2,2,4,2,1,0,2,0,6,3,15,16,2,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,2,1,67,17,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22005609899638576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131327808828692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17116061444529754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12918237442361746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3311506404112836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453267040257377,0.0,0.18390683208889405,0.0,0.0,0.17838264118159294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16229638147856973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3653000349625439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08891983725143986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14318595789615984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23994203106217002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10963837386505733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3593146097484513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10365181112605017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32749601485572954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14896167224982576,0.0,0.0,0.107491266191294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454756496526759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22987302401063964,0.0,0.0,0.3125774274410043

It's usually pretty tough to interface with other tech teachers because the scope is so narrow, but I thought I'd give it a try. My computer engineering class is making mechanical drawings in TinkerCAD and I observed a student sharing a link with another, who simply copied/pasted into a new document.

teaching,MathGeek06,2020/03/13,"Phone Calls Our state decided to close all schools today, so we're off for two weeks. Teachers came in today for an inservice day to start working out the logistics of online learning.

Everyone else is long gone from the campus, but I'm just now leaving. Even still I couldn't possibly be happier.

I just spent the past hour calling home to check in on some of my higher anxiety kids. The ones I check in with at school normally, who I watch out for, and who  let's be honest here, watch out for me. They all had a rough week, dealing with the craziness that is the world right now. 

I spoke to one student and two parents. They were all so appreciative of the phone call and for what I do each day for their kids. Truth is, these kids do far more for me than I could ever do for them.

These relationships, these bonds, knowing that I am actually making a difference, THIS right here is why I teach.

I would highly recommend that each of you whose schools have closed reach out to check on your students, ""your kids"", if you're able to. I guarantee you won't regret it.

teaching,pbcapcrunch,2020/03/13,"Recording screen &amp; voice for Google Slides Hello fellow teachers! I am currently setting up my Google Classroom as our school decided to close. I’m sure a lot of us are in this predicament.

I’m hoping someone knows a free tool (Chrome extension or download) that can allow me to draw on, record my voice over, and record my screen as I go over Google slides and my computer stuff. I currently have Screencastify but I think the free version only allows a certain number of 5 minute videos to be uploaded. I love how it syncs up with Google Classroom, but I am wondering if there’s something free that does the same thing.

teaching,coldpizzaqueen,2020/03/13,"I have decided I would like to become a teacher - now what? Hello!

I currently hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Biblical studies.
I have been in the corporate world for 6 years, and I am currently working as an HR trainer. 
Outside of work, I teach dance at the YMCA and teach visual art as a hobby. I enjoy teaching. It feels like it is innate in me, and it transfers into everything I do.

When I was in college, I was briefly in the education program. I initially wanted to work with exceptional children, but the school I went to only allowed me to observe in traditional classroom settings, specifically 4th grade, and Kindergarten. I did not enjoy the experiences I had. Preferentially speaking: I believe I would thrive as a high school art teacher, or working in exceptional education (at any age level). I considered being a parapro after school, but I was determined to pay off my student loans as quickly as possible and turned to corporate America to help me do so...which honestly, has sucked my soul dry.

I live in the State of TN. 
What would be the wisest course of action to begin teaching/get my certifications? 

I recently read there are no longer alternate routes outside of an MAT. But I have close friends who are teachers who state otherwise.
Any guidance on this would be exceptional!

teaching,ac_slater10,2020/03/13,"PSA: It is just a matter of time before all our schools close and they won't be re-opening for quite some time People are still in the denial stage with this thing.  I have read around 30 academic papers on this during my evenings between grading papers and eating dinner with my wife.  Every single authority on this (CID, CDC, UCSF, WHO ) is predicting the same thing: 40-70% infection of the US population over the next 12-18 months.  A vaccine is not coming this calendar year.  Seasonality is not extremely likely.

You are going to see near 100% closure within the next month and that will remain until summer.  Barring a miracle, we probably won't be back in August either.  It depends on seasonality and other factors.  I'm devasted.

teaching,Save_my_grades,2020/03/13,"What is IB English? Hello,

I’m currently a 2nd year undergrad in Ontario and looking for some side jobs to earn some money.

Recently, I started to tutor. I tutor grade 5 English and math, which is very simple. I recently got an offer to to tutor someone in IB English grade 12.

I’ve been in the Ontario Education Curriculum and have some understanding of how to teach someone grade 12 but I’m not exactly sure what IB English (grade 12). 

How similar is it to Ontario grade 12 English?

teaching,throwaway_85510914,2020/03/13,"EA’s authority over regular students? Hello reddit! 

As if the recent year a new education assistant has arrived at our school for some of the disabled students. The new EA however, seems to think she is a normal teacher and regularly oversteps her job boundaries by policing other students. Today she was thankfully put in her place for trying to confiscate a phone off a fellow student which resulted in her taking the girl to administration only to be told she didn’t have the authority to do that. 

For future reference, what authority does she have (if any) over regular classmates who do not need the EA?",7.615530799475755,8.839340330275228,8.453499344692005,62.18963302752295,63.12844036697248,11.366186107470513,38.507208387942335,11.20814326018867,4.998634600262124,492,25,73,14,7,166,77,109,0.0,0.9309999999999999,0.069,0.6544,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,10,0,9,0,0,1,0,11,15,4,0,4,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,5,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,0,8,1,17,11,1,14,0,0,0,0,14,7,0,4,6,54,13,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16268415364981914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20935120619024453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23739820469032102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17738552317520115,0.0,0.4620983715586532,0.0,0.0,0.2343939584545753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18194469195599414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24994374128074826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2404915606997068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23621011084826704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2421128623268379,0.0,0.21778540487285195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17987069003404993,0.0,0.0,0.22025023334275026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1532885004028397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267614404707414,0.2285938848092993,0.0,0.16242101736163211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15405585050114193
teaching,Nomie-chan,2020/03/13,"Anyone else getting an annoyingly small amount of info on how your district will deal with COVID-19? I asked admin earlier this week if teachers will be paid should the school be shut down due to the virus. It's imperative that I know because well...as a first year teacher I have almost no savings and live paycheck to paycheck. I am the primary earner between me and my fiancee. Admin doesn't effing know. That or I'm being given the runaround. 

Additionally, I've heard nothing regarding potential distance learning or other backup plans to continue the year's learning. 

No. All we get is ""Here's how to wash your hands. Don't forget to cover your mouth when you cough!!"" Apparently there was a staff meeting today after school. They didn't tell us until 20 minutes before, and by then I had no way to cancel the after school club I run. I immediately responded and asked to get the notes emailed to me so I'm informed. Nope. Instead I was told to ""ask someone that was at the meeting when you get in tomorrow"".

teaching,inlovewithteacher,2020/03/13,"Need HS teachers advice please Teacher advice

… So I don’t even know how to start this… I think the best explanation is that I have super close relationships with most of my teachers. (In my opinion (they will email me spontaneously to see how I’m doing, or ask if I need help or anything, not in a sexual way in more of a Friend way in between classes we will also joke around with each other, sometimes in a big group of us, I even have a few of my teachers phone numbers, but that’s mostly because we have been on school trips and they gave it to me in case I got lost) I don’t know if that’s a thing that teachers just do to make students feel good ha ha Ha) it’s gotten to the point where I feel pretty intense feelings for my math teacher (even though I hate math) I am a straight A student with a 4.0, not the kind a girl that you would imagine would be writing this… I’m not ugly either, most guys who have asked for an honest opinion have rated me about a nine out of 10. 
There are times in math class that I catch my teacher looking in my general direction and will hold I contact for a couple seconds, but I don’t know if it’s something that is just friendly… Or more. In my state I am the legal age of consent in comparison to his age. I am 17 and he is 23. However, to make things even more complicated he is married and has a kid. I just don’t know what to do. I have serious feelings for him, way Way way way way beyond just sex. I feel like I’m driving myself insane. If I could get some advice on what to do with the situation it would be really helpful, I feel really lost and kind of hopeless…",6.0587815126050435,4.681663547619046,6.8331162464986015,81.2756092436975,66.79761904761905,9.453501400560226,32.56232492997199,8.124751697461798,2.19102787114846,1256,43,272,13,17,419,165,336,0.061,0.792,0.147,0.9757,1,0,1,0,0,1,27.0,3,1,2,4,18,16,1,0,18,3,33,1,0,4,0,63,63,19,0,10,17,0,6,1,1,6,0,0,0,3,17,15,0,1,12,1,0,3,7,4,0,2,6,8,39,12,41,48,11,35,0,2,2,1,26,20,0,13,5,193,56,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27910836265807465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07613777470837026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834804243155889,0.08475527354922083,0.17801318910950215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05803789139109655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991488474087418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601581240624754,0.1053458016901112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25153585015267393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888400447859361,0.06801658876881721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07355743709808765,0.0,0.049742231819098835,0.0,0.0,0.07985592340162258,0.07614650651912655,0.0,0.0,0.09427085330035677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09399815384885384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12763178323785587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19828888778849693,0.209295229255788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04651380225075972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995071133158363,0.0,0.20786147976576946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710411103681946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14119099840807206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450975446228623,0.09000230026258811,0.0,0.0,0.0968607276445294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12198531982835488,0.0,0.0,0.1022177231465305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09635554285227416,0.07586842098556272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701774100833006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07329574241171179,0.0941631112224978,0.0,0.0673886872132329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12650388201277055,0.06100541923868458,0.0935413415955144,0.0,0.0555165296658565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145234584887029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5290015538522251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20289901871382907,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,TeachingAdam,2020/03/14,"New around here Good morning everyone from Australia. I'm currently in a completely different career and after some traumatic experiences at the end of last year I've finally decided upon a career change. I've researched secondary teaching and I'm now currently 4 months into my university studies.

So far I'm loving it l, I've just joined Reddit and the teaching communities on here seem truly amazing. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier in terms of seeing the support, advice, tips etc. I look forward to getting to know this community more over the coming years and thankyou for having me.

teaching,Strayriffs,2020/03/14,"Planning To Move From NYC to St Pete Hi,

I'm about to get my Masters degree which will provide me with my initial certification in NY State for Students With Disabilities Grades 1-6 AND Childhood Education Grades 1-6. I would like to start working in Pinellas County for the 2020-21 school year.

I have a ton of questions (too many to list here).  I've tried contacting people in FLA but I've hit a lot of dead ends.  Has anyone on here transferred their certification from NY to FLA OR have a good knowledge of the certification and hiring processes in Pinellas County?  I'd really love to hear from you and would be most appreciative for any help you can provide.

teaching,GucciMilk,2020/03/14,"Questions about teaching certifications. I'm not sure if this is the right sub to be asking this question, but I'm kind of lost on how I should approach furthering my career.

Right now, I am teaching at a hagwon in South Korea for my second year. I've only had experience teaching English as a foreign language to kindergarten and elementary students. I have a bachelors in English Literature and a TEFL certification (obviously).

I made the mistake of not getting my teaching certificate with my bachelor's degree. Now, I'm looking towards working at an international school as an English teacher (literature, general, or second/foreign language as I am now).

The problem is, there doesnt seem to be a clear answer on the best method to acquire a teaching certificate if you already have a bachelor's, or you don't plan on getting a master's degree. I've seen some websites offering an online only certificate, like TEACH-NOW or some other, but I'm not sure if that's reputable or a waste of time and money.

If anyone has experience on what I'm trying to do, or at least some advice on how I should move forward it would be extremely helpful.

teaching,excited4elementary,2020/03/14,"Extra income from teaching online Hi everyone! 

With the increased school closures due to Corona I wanted to share an opportunity to keep teaching and of course get paid. Let me start off by saying this is NOT a sales pyramid scheme, it is a verified business in which Kobe Bryant actually invested in in 2016.

I’ve completed my first 6 months with VIPKID, a leading Chinese online education company providing children in China between the ages of 5 – 12 with a North American elementary education from the comforts of their home. The company provides lessons for you which are very easy to follow and therefore teach. 

The lessons are 25 minutes and based on your teaching experiences, credentials, and how well you do during the initial interview, your base pay will be between $7-9 per 25-minute class, or $14-18 an hour! On top of the base pay, teachers receive an extra $1 bonus per class for just showing up and doing their job, and then an additional $1 bonus per class if they teach 45 or more classes in one month.
So, hourly payment is calculated as such (base pay+$2) assuming you teach 45+ classes, which is pretty easy to do!

VIPKID also offers their teachers extra incentives as well? For each short notice class (classes booked between 2 to 24 hours before class), teachers receive $2, in addition to the base pay + bonuses. Also, when teachers teach a trial class and the student signs up for VIPKID, they get an additional $5 for every sign up! 

Let’s say Jim is a VIPKID teacher with a base pay of $7.50 per class. This month Jim taught 63 classes, 15 of which were short notice classes. Of the 12 trial classes he taught, 5 kids signed up. Jim would make $653.50 deposited right through PayPal or direct bank account. That’s not bad for someone who worked only 31.5 hours in a month in his pjs! I like to call that winning!

If you are interested in becoming an online ESL Teacher and have atleast a bachelors degree (any subject) please feel free to PM me. Typical hours are early in the morning or late at night as children in China will take them during peak hours their time.I’d also like to add you are not required to work a certain amount of hours at all. If you are unable to teach in a month due to brick &amp; motor schools reopening that is fine! If you want to keep teaching on the weekend mornings you can or supplement throughout the summer it is completely flexible!",7.547450110864744,7.473504782705102,7.431852771618626,73.91109623059869,63.257206208425714,9.965445676274946,36.887006651884704,9.490545024520769,3.5013545188470068,1911,85,333,31,25,611,238,451,0.012,0.843,0.145,0.9954,2,0,0,0,0,0,64.0,0,10,7,13,10,16,0,0,30,0,25,0,0,4,2,49,39,27,0,7,13,0,1,2,0,3,0,2,1,3,12,17,0,3,4,3,14,5,3,1,2,2,4,3,23,16,64,29,8,56,0,0,0,0,32,27,0,10,26,193,35,39,0.0,0.0,0.08788792705335946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21606864632331665,0.0,0.09758259088226576,0.0,0.0612455317375899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519835604678267,0.0,0.09946686341622743,0.07663648321344238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196379704715092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18885746083152366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07588147044198104,0.08605849871059318,0.0,0.08809832516942538,0.0,0.0,0.04553826396359099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660704564877821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941077910881096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09033994720505333,0.0,0.6208533713988782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08937305173006982,0.16010322818751346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10159432889648304,0.0,0.0,0.18418984601158694,0.0,0.08799989515644213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06011736250292352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35943480887890183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451747709094595,0.0,0.0,0.2050733167178228,0.0,0.0,0.061028624399275574,0.06849652627915456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09886148831615336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09162585582171004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0769128117813292,0.0,0.14324249722385965,0.0,0.18229594783564915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07630959341843897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06374664209909768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0677157289631008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052516119448879135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07431092588860433,0.10624229362970183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1619538573751742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13113302401243568,0.0,0.0,0.06397775681686797,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,FriendlyConcert3,2020/03/14,"Wages and Graduate school Hi all,
I was thinking about becoming a high school math teacher, but the lack of pay scares the crap out of me. I would absolutely love to go to graduate school specifically for math, not education. I mean, I feel like that’s impossible. I would be taking out more student loans that I would not be able to pay off due to teaching salary. Any stories or insight to this?",3.4583082706766963,5.767120394736844,4.325864661654137,83.38605263157895,75.3157894736842,8.027067669172935,27.962406015037594,8.841846274778883,2.273472180451128,314,13,62,7,7,101,54,76,0.152,0.7340000000000001,0.114,-0.0414,2,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,1,4,1,1,3,0,6,2,1,0,1,16,12,3,0,4,4,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,4,0,4,1,2,2,0,0,1,1,7,2,12,6,3,6,0,0,0,1,2,4,1,1,2,39,10,12,0.20912680609550116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14221339940868935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309641270737729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574079671934182,0.14940023206013767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11885158323321098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22095395249828925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216879405526384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18874510735682806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278003994619939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20937241536788948,0.634942477547921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15723733203167656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13400001317566748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44567304872715996,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,ql76,2020/03/14,"ECE teacher... remote learning help please So.. like everyone else, my school has been closed due to CO-VID19... however learning is still expected to take place, just from home. Easy to say, hard to implement, especially when you teach PreK 4 and 5 year olds. 

I sent home:
- 1 dry erase marker
- 1 sheet protector
- 1 name writing practice sheet (to be used with protector and marker)
- 1 alphabet writing practice sheet (to be used with protector and marker)
- name tag for name writing reference
- 1 sheet full of alphabet, numbers, shapes, colors, etc. for daily review\
- math packet (1 number a day)

I am planning on sending out daily emails that include:
- daily video update / instructions for the day
	- ex. Send me a video of you counting to 20... send me a picture of something at home that is a circle shape... etc. 
- daily YouTube videos
	- music and movement, letter review videos, read-aloud, etc. 
- link to a Pinterest board with optional hands-on activities to engage your child....


What else can I do?? What am I missing that I should include??

So much of ECE is hands-on or teacher-directed that it’s hard to even conceive what online learning will look like. ANY and ALL tips, suggestions, resources (I’ve seen the massive spreadsheet going around, which is great), APPs, etc are appreciated!

Thank you all and good luck during this crazy time of remote learning!",5.980627017058553,7.850942970954358,5.691417704011066,78.10502881512221,67.42323651452281,8.343107422775473,32.06108805901337,8.841846274778883,2.8425848778238825,1060,45,176,18,18,328,150,241,0.031,0.8440000000000001,0.125,0.97,1,0,1,0,0,0,76.0,0,4,0,1,7,8,0,0,7,0,15,0,0,2,2,34,24,10,0,2,2,1,2,2,0,2,0,1,3,1,10,12,0,0,6,4,0,6,0,1,0,0,3,6,12,7,26,17,8,24,0,1,3,0,21,9,0,3,11,91,22,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042722935501298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183755096216316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1715151215408362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2221662869240584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5932069329780734,0.08782841233071234,0.0,0.0,0.1270628465468056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557248065880427,0.11153271334182313,0.0,0.14660487103650618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23823809122939876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913001369716954,0.0,0.4001528386184564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992926139695282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11166510120449226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775156797382502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395343836366414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13893006486233989,0.14596608478551076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13301049871053927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10574667067423593,0.0,0.13457730725608374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10237027736148442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619361858555937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998028558432716,0.0,0.0,0.1224250667268486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07753850841863763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22969457100445265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856312272228724

teaching,caetywithac,2020/03/15,"Looking for a Teacher Support Group Hi there,

I'm a brand new teacher and have entered a very unique teaching situation. (Second semester seniors, mid-semester teacher switch, four AP English classes, all students are required to take AP English, the original teacher is still at the school but is now the principal and she still is the teacher of record and has control of the gradebook, etc.) The details don't matter as much as the fact that I am in desperate need of some kind of support group of teachers to talk to. I rant to my husband every day, and though he is absolutely amazing, he's not a teacher and he doesn't totally GET it, if that makes any sense. My best days are only ""okay,"" and my worst days make me question why I went through all the work of becoming a teacher when I'm so bad at it.

I like in the East Bay Area of California, though I am also entirely open to joining some kind of online group. The main thing is that I need real people to talk to, in-person or through something like Skype. Is this a thing that exists? How would I go about finding one?

TLDR: I am a new teacher and am looking for a support group of teachers to help keep me sane. How would I go about finding this?",6.484686489980607,6.003667042016808,6.771008403361348,79.1258015513898,65.55462184873949,9.171816418875242,37.63542340012928,8.384062270229773,3.0728528765352285,948,46,183,11,13,307,131,238,0.076,0.797,0.127,0.9136,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,4,13,12,0,0,18,1,18,0,0,6,4,35,35,19,0,5,4,1,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,10,8,0,3,3,0,0,4,3,2,0,3,1,2,15,10,29,32,10,22,0,0,2,0,14,7,0,5,13,125,25,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619025805557864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08179655312563733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043126658929878,0.0,0.13284310457986276,0.0,0.0,0.12622956979804545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349075933146947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23271771983447506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341473214261083,0.0,0.0,0.10134360094794452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21987293472125904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06284289412537193,0.0,0.1367191823333554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08062314805474187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069130419679929,0.0,0.25051243432036296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11752837954048745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20201482336905355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605796503428999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08842183244932153,0.17837661560266466,0.0,0.2323401090423897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08150686223524248,0.09148062873745502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08338907537874925,0.10502646123287927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13474446902439172,0.0,0.0,0.13690836796094585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121732800407505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13520311256200485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259971681550463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921162912143528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4094871111037159,0.0,0.0,0.09043783382114036,0.19335781100908975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15982133838885532,0.0,0.2363548401933629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099246058035804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11150353031336116,0.10853668334478876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08756744419426249,0.0,0.0,0.17089116008501093,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,jnoon22,2020/03/15,"Feedback on Online Course Platform Hello everyone!

I have been working on this project for quite some time now and I was hoping I could get some feedback from teachers. The website, called [Erbium.org](https://Erbium.org), allows teachers to create online courses with interactive content for their students.  Currently it supports five types of content: articles, videos, downloads, flashcards and quizzes, however I am looking to add some interactive games in the future. It also has a discussion board where students and teachers can ask questions and discuss ideas. If you want to learn more, there is a [Features](https://www.erbium.org/features) page which explains a bit more.

As a teacher, is there anything you would add or change about how the platform works? Is there anything you would really want to have on a platform like this?",9.417537313432836,12.136396276119404,6.543462686567171,72.01608955223881,60.11940298507464,8.345074626865673,41.01194029850746,8.841846274778883,4.194509850746268,687,37,90,10,10,192,91,134,0.0,0.9,0.1,0.8793,2,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,3,1,3,8,3,0,0,8,0,13,0,0,2,0,24,21,9,0,7,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,8,3,15,16,7,12,0,0,1,0,14,8,0,7,5,68,13,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16837245617172825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465205646205501,0.0,0.19683079782757407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22986019395011445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2149895968414208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2227282902441339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16810274652434995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20118440665387416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000087379654436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091183137229552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376792478719835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028614660836088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17680445338909626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358581592751681,0.22394011932132032,0.0,0.0,0.13488027457503274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389235391778132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277026080384322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2483693432454361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065579811866121,0.0,0.0,0.2991297137899773,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,UsefulThesaurus,2020/03/15,"Students and teachers - a lack of understanding? Hello! I work at the local university and have noticed that my students are not familiar with many aspects of our job. While we teachers/lecturers/professors were in their shoes, they haven't had the same opportunity. I was wondering whether you have some ideas on how to improve it? I have spent a lot of time trying to ""build a connection,"" but I am not sure whether there is a better way.

teaching,noisette84,2020/03/15,"What are you doing to keep your kids learning during closures? Hi fellow teachers. :)

I'm wanting to brainstorm together. I live in a state where we plan ahead for days like this through something we call ""Non-traditional Instruction"" (or NTI). Basically, we prepare and send home work for students at the beginning of the year in the event of snowstorms, illness, etc. that cause cancellations so that these days don't have to be made up at the end of the year. 

Right now, my school is using NTI for the next 3 weeks and taking our regularly scheduled spring break during the first full week of April. Answering questions, helping with work, and contacting families daily is how I'll be ""teaching"" from home, but because we were in such a hurry to create 10 extra days to use in addition to the 5 we still had, I want to provide a bit more for my kiddos to feel connected and know I miss them while giving opportunities to keep learning at home. 

I teach 3rd grade ELA - lots of them have internet access at home, but some don't. 

Things I'm considering doing:
- posting read alouds to ClassDojo 
- posting quizizz, kahoot, nearpod links to google classroom
- flipgrid reading fluency 
- flipgrid check in (mostly just to share/talk/connect in this weird time)

Of course, this would all be optional since we have at home work assigned through NTI, but I thought it be nice to check in and see what other educators were doing. 

Thanks for your sharing and ideas!",9.237477503628448,8.308455290566041,8.25660377358491,72.17404934687956,60.24528301886792,11.02177068214804,39.25253991291728,10.035473477838034,3.899911465892597,1152,50,200,19,13,357,169,265,0.023,0.875,0.102,0.9658,0,0,1,0,0,0,43.0,7,3,2,7,7,7,0,0,11,0,19,1,0,5,1,43,37,13,0,3,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,5,1,11,14,0,2,9,2,2,1,2,2,0,1,5,2,19,5,42,27,9,41,0,1,1,0,22,16,0,6,21,129,30,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06950937374380282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12448718636246565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643360056416578,0.0,0.0,0.11713641944559758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2206125898051784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10099345644554847,0.0,0.12716946529164674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749384696789724,0.0,0.057655123069829374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699071199612884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10938441654735513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07642942489834427,0.0,0.571888377035367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12872181266301214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2027036281490288,0.0,0.0,0.06266587208993275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0557074901826875,0.0,0.10068731140481578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694108210768868,0.0,0.10789444150710636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126826298311913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21841135003742432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277355514420566,0.0,0.2281143130175759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09737783663524348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11540070253884516,0.09086419756536257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943237331564327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08778301607812626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910615499728816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08573358638028583,0.09165002019639128,0.0,0.10498009654599216,0.0,0.0,0.07575400659901083,0.0,0.0,0.09052414484075376,0.0664896521394801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19696422378873396,0.0,0.0,0.13451133137922944,0.0,0.18293003879299533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2490375119701756,0.0,0.0,0.0810010115000718,0.0,0.0,0.14685839659399536

teaching,Jessiegirl07,2020/03/15,"Lesson ideas- help/suggestions. Corona teaching days. Hi all, looking for some collective brainstorming here for learning tasks amid this COVID-19 pandemic. 


I’m in Australia and our schools are remaining open.
I need activities which limit the contact and germ sharing across the class as to be honest, the students’ personal hygiene sucks even with constant reminders and encouragement. 


To give some context around activities I’m looking for, I work in a school that supports inquiry based learning, learning through play/ learning together etc.  The students are grade 1/2 but pretty low ability due to their family’s economic disadvantage (we’re always working at closing that gap!)


I’m sure there are other people in similar situations so let’s put our heads together!

teaching,kylo_wren_,2020/03/15,"Journal prompts for writing/documenting this pandemic?? We just found on on Friday that schools would be closed until April 10th.  So far, admin is only asking us to create a small, optional assignment that won't be counted for a grade but is still ""enriching and fulfilling""...(eyeroll).

I teach 6th grade and we were right in the middle of our historical fiction unit for Language Arts.  Last week we had a really great discussion trying to define ""history"" and when and why an event is considered ""historic.""  I know nothing like this has happened in my lifetime, so my thought was to assign a journal for them to keep during the next few weeks documenting what they are seeing, feeling, and thinking during this pandemic.  They are living through something that will become history, and my hope is that assignment could be something they would be able to look back on in the future.  I'm sure not all of them will take it seriously, but there are a handful of kids who I think might really enjoy something like this.

My question is, does anyone have any suggestions for good prompts to get them started?  I want them to notice the things around them, how adults are acting, how they feel, what people are doing, and what they think about all of this.  However, since they are only 12 I think they might need a little guidance to get them started.  Any ideas??",9.440609756097562,8.49818854878049,8.330203252032522,71.85189024390246,59.85365853658536,11.289430894308946,37.97967479674797,10.317481424215053,3.8816650406504083,1077,43,183,19,12,332,147,246,0.028999999999999998,0.8640000000000001,0.107,0.9675,1,0,3,0,0,0,39.0,5,0,13,0,11,8,0,0,11,0,29,1,1,2,3,42,52,15,0,6,4,0,3,2,0,7,0,0,0,2,15,12,0,1,11,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,5,5,27,7,27,35,3,29,0,0,2,0,25,13,0,5,17,131,42,7,0.12539838515108245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17055040399317986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08768146655531749,0.0,0.0,0.1116311487859857,0.11723056257856496,0.0,0.0,0.0964236178008079,0.0,0.0,0.1384926643486073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10012040678367214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973697189051757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268103826645645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374928568437402,0.0,0.0,0.13103096122791907,0.0,0.0,0.10517821597864173,0.0,0.1382521623242571,0.0,0.0,0.11088937785457556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1245488908940883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14155951329167168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114598464300442,0.0,0.0,0.06891567302794886,0.10221642059764736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12252663373544645,0.12568212525919306,0.11072907149332224,0.0,0.10530306113658287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2660557402056266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298131367235883,0.0,0.0,0.13336260522183885,0.0,0.0,0.12032313256561347,0.14276689262940806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19074224515009455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693545113458957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404748901378444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16066683307389693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10708953575388852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269098604731661,0.0999262775817566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10373084002813228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28961340990030826,0.0,0.0,0.1775152448637649,0.0,0.10014331236535208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818649397596495,0.0,0.09428397961202824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330911507690011,0.3214008873597761,0.0,0.09955231067441388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08513727215139992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508388174408244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396321652223735,0.0,0.20117404130841635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315253812774476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17815882991178728,0.0,0.0,0.0

Universities will decide who has passed but essentially everyone who passed the first 2 placements and the appropriate essays will become a teacher in August.

Unfortunately between now and August we have 1 essay due. We wont even find out what schools we will be assigned to for our probation untill probably June. Does anyone have any recommendations for useful things to read or practical things to occupy our time with?",10.690571428571424,11.683754961904759,9.440714285714286,58.546785714285726,56.52380952380952,11.952380952380953,41.30952380952381,11.538034831475384,5.354809523809525,521,25,70,13,6,162,75,105,0.059000000000000004,0.905,0.036000000000000004,-0.3527,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,5,0,1,1,2,1,1,0,4,0,12,0,0,1,0,14,14,5,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,6,8,0,0,2,1,0,2,2,1,0,1,2,0,6,0,16,6,0,17,0,0,0,0,9,4,0,1,11,52,12,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3352323237999888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17234589364388433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27221992215680746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21569799444804216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16279898749134944,0.0,0.0,0.23552404303630076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22528001496015546,0.20965740033349844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726957317746813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967395217521231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2657492047862769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465486275017537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24945286814596535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3275032786444378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14372559320111414,0.0,0.0,0.23552404303630076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21288124537068853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15872627911150855

I am still taking classes through my university, and have an upcoming assignment that I could use help on. I am supposed to gather any kind of student work in math (be that one student on an IEP or an entire class) but was not able to before the shutdown. I dont need any info about the students at all. Just what the lesson/assignment was. We are going to practice task analysis of student work to inform the potential next steps.

teaching,snifickle33,2020/03/16,"Help! I’m a substitute teacher and have no idea what to do Long story short, I graduated with my degree in elementary ed in December and have been doing subbing (mix of long term sub jobs) everyday this semester. However, with the virus, schools are closed and I only get paid if I work at the school. I was starting to apply to work at childcare centers, but our state is closing all childcare (including babysitting, but I don’t know how they are going to enforce this) this week for x amount of days/weeks.

For some context to help with any ideas you may have: the 7th graders are about to start a week on the Holocaust, then move into the Cold War. The 8th graders have another week or so of environmentalism and then will be learning about terrorism followed by globalization.

I have a K-12 special education license with an emphasis on teaching children with Mild-Moderate needs, particularly I would be interested in teaching kids with SLD (""specific learning disabilities""), but I'm completely open for wherever I'm needed!

Specifically, I would like to know what specific schools or districts anyone would recommend? I was advised to only apply for specific schools if I'm teaching in Clark County, and if that's the case *which* schools should I apply for?

Also, how does retirement work? I read somewhere that I have to contribute 28% of my paycheck to my pension. Is this true? Because after doing the math I'd only be taking home roughly $25,000, which probably isn't enough to live in Nevada, especially if I choose a job in Vegas.

Above all else, I want to thank everyone for reading this post!

I had been looking so forward to it. I was excited to basically have my own class for the first time, to have steady money coming in, to getting to know these kids, and now we’re shut down for several weeks, probably for the rest of the year. I have been looking forward to this job since graduation. I just started getting to know kids, and now tomorrow will probably be the last time I get to see them. I just feel defeated and angry. I know it’s to keep them and their families safe, but I was looking forward to teaching in class. I just hope I can effectively teach them from online after only knowing them one week! That’s assuming they can get internet.

I'm a bit surprised they aren't having us do this planning from home to help slow the spread of the virus.",7.8628333333333345,8.589296150000003,6.1320000000000014,80.78433333333334,62.5,8.266666666666667,32.66666666666667,7.793537801064563,2.3083666666666667,445,16,75,4,6,129,75,100,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.8638,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,3,0,1,4,3,2,0,0,5,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,9,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,7,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,4,2,16,8,1,20,0,0,1,0,5,4,0,1,15,44,11,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830486921761208,0.4147700091508722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22097081466895985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13053269475606508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33816218483385274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13566594906638002,0.0,0.2030259406864008,0.0,0.19932542683229634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16498483263184974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09888350639550697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699668978395086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12966405206325693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4096837272734365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802236864393105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19771756961352988,0.0,0.2434649629125571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.324709722186318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Muxika,2020/03/17,"Classcraft During the COVID-19 Pandemic Just like ""death by PowerPoint,"" I think my kids are going to experience ""death by Blackboard."" Life is going to get a little weird, and I think some levity is going to be helpful.

I'd been using Classcraft as a behavior and performance incentive (more carrot, less stick), plus I'd been using it for informal assessments and centers activities. I teach middle school, but it's also worked in high school. I don't plan on teaching elementary, but I'm sure it can be successful in higher primary grades.

teaching,ChazzyDos,2020/03/17,"Spanish written assessments while ""distance learning"" Hola a todos,

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but here it goes...

I am a Spanish teacher (Spanish 2 &amp; Spanish IB-1) and I have a question concerning written assessments while ""distance learning"". If schools are closed for the rest of the year in the U.S., I will need to give my students a written assessment which they will have to submit online. Under normal circumstances, all written assessments are done in class to avoid the use of translating services such as Google Translate and SpanishDict.

Does anyone know of any online platforms that can detect if a student has uploaded text directly from a translating service? Perhaps if sentences and paragraphs are copied and pasted into the document in chunks? I am thinking of English classes that use ""[turnitin.com](https://turnitin.com/)"" to check for plagiarism and would love to know if anything exists in a similar capacity for language classes.

Any information would be greatly appreciated. ¡Gracias!",9.148035714285717,11.520072970238097,7.780714285714287,64.21428571428572,60.36904761904761,9.885714285714286,43.76190476190475,10.125756701596842,5.316454761904762,841,50,107,18,12,255,108,168,0.025,0.899,0.075,0.885,0,1,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,1,0,2,4,0,1,13,0,16,1,0,2,2,30,28,14,0,9,7,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,6,7,0,1,7,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,5,0,6,3,21,18,2,15,0,0,0,1,5,10,0,6,4,80,12,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21972864697033492,0.0,0.2758155466053531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417992045687618,0.0,0.16688327096041794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17746755314639845,0.20753002373101925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1945397520471164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2235825587511469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22290201114551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18303069602149155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15037016186517502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19869635831680452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19359108189139834,0.0,0.0,0.21187794900518625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942218609456205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22717717285058944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17318609717777875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052396928793858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19113219127088435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12994305400491327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3503000927140709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2881199569404407,0.0,0.0,0.13059353864663342

teaching,ghostface923,2020/03/17,"Tips for First-Time Job Searching So, you’re a 20-something year old, about to finish your student teaching internship, and you’re staring down an immediate future of unemployment, student debt, and uncertainty. You’ve been so fixated on finishing your certification tests and paperwork that you’ve barely thought about *what exactly it is* that you’re going to do in the fall. This post is targeted for you. The reality of entering the world of education is that, while your options may seem limited to your finance and business major friends, you have a great opportunity to set yourself up for professional and financial success. Listed below are some steps you need to take to ensure that you’re in the classroom this fall:

**Work Your Connections**

One of the largest criticisms of public education is that it’s simply outdated; and those critics are true. The reality is that public education was designed to create efficient, rule-following industrial workers, amidst a sea of newly immigrated children. We no longer live in the days of $5 a day Ford Factory workers, and in fact, it seems like the opportunity for remote working is becoming increasingly available. Education, specifically public education, requires *physical* attendance, and as such, the nature of references are primarily based on the *personal connections* you have with people in the educational field. Luckily, as aspiring teachers, we usually have a mentor teacher, or a teacher/coach we gravitated towards when we were in school. Give that person a phone call. 

Don’t text them. 

Don’t email them. 

Give them a phone call. 

**Give ‘Em a Call!**

As millenials and Gen Z’ers, our first instinct is to communicate in a text-based medium which, while effective, devalues the nature of personal connection. Consider the type of person you’re more than likely reaching out to for a job connection. They’re usually old(ish). They’re constantly inundated with poorly written emails from kids reaching out to them about grades, attendance, etc. When former students reach out to them, it’s rarely to compliment them on the impact they’ve had on them as an adult, or praising their teaching abilities; it’s usually to ask them for a recommendation to a graduation program, or asking them for a reference to a job. A phone call separates YOU from the rest of these requests and adds an element of humility to the task of asking a professional to put their reputation on the line for their sake.

What if they don’t pick up? You may think-success!- I avoided personal contact and communication. Not quite. *The next step becomes leaving a voicemail.* Which sucks and is awkward. But, this all has a purpose. Leave a message which goes something like this:

“Hey Mr./Mrs. So-and-so, this is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ class/team. If you didn’t know, I’m studying to be a teacher, and I’ve been thinking a lot about what teachers go through, and I just wanted to say thank you for having such an impact on my life. If you have a chance, give me a call back, because I’d love to get together to pick your brain about teaching!”

And that’s it. Wait a few days, and in the meantime, reach out to other teachers or coaches who had a similar impact on your life. If you don’t hear anything after 3-4 days, then send a follow up email. The email should sound something like this:

“Hey Mr./Mrs. So-and-so, I hope you’re doing well!

This is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ class/team. I left you a voicemail a few days ago, but if you didn’t know, I’m studying to be a teacher, and I’ve been thinking a lot about what teachers go through, and I just wanted to say thank you for having such an impact on my life. If you’ve got some free time coming up, I’d love to schedule a time when we can grab coffee so I can pick your brain about getting a job and teaching. I’d really appreciate your advice.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you soon!”

This email is useful for a few reasons. First, it establishes that you made a *deliberate* attempt to contact the person in a more “meaningful” medium already, and that you care enough to reach out to this person a second time. The purpose of the email still seems to establish that opportunity where you can interact face-to-face with this teacher/coach who had a great impact on your life.

**Express Humility** 

Next, the tone of the email ultimately expresses *humility*, which is the key to all of this. As you are probably learning, teaching is stressful. Teachers are pulled in a ton of different directions and ultimately, they don’t *owe* you anything. By asking them to set up a time where you can meet face-to-face so you can obtain their advice, you’ve got a higher likelihood that they’ll respond, which leads me to my last point.

This email ultimately expresses the purpose of contacting the teacher/coach to *get their advice on getting a job and teaching.* You’re not simply asking for a reference. You’re establishing a genuine, authentic, professional connection with someone within the industry in which you want to join. Now, throughout the conversation over coffee, you should of course bring up the fact that you’re looking for a job; but the purpose of the conversation should be to learn *how to be a more effective teacher.* 

Are you bad at grading things on time? Ask for some strategies to grade more efficiently.

Do you struggle with coming up with creative and engaging lesson plans? Try to get some resources from that teacher.

Not only are you deferring to the wisdom and experience of that teacher, you’re displaying an ability to have serious self-reflection. Which, in the interview process, is something that administration seeks out. 

**Be Flexible in Your Teaching**

When I started my teaching career, I was desperate to get a job. I dreaded the thought of moving back home with my parents. I loathed the idea of being a substitute teacher for a year. I was willing to do whatever it took to get an actual teaching job, in a real public school. So when I found myself sitting in an interview chair, and my principal asked me if I was willing to be an assistant Girl’s Swim and Dive Coach, and sponsor a community service club, I didn’t even hesitate. I immediately said yes. That weekend, I was busy watching youtube videos on breast-stroke technique.

The reality of teaching is that we rarely are hired solely based on the merits of our pedagogy. As I’ve mentioned before, teachers are pulled in a bunch of different directions, because public school provides opportunities for athletics, fine arts, community service, and education-amongst all other things. As such, you WILL be asked to sponsor some sort of extra-curricular activity. And, as a first year teacher, you’re really not in a position to refuse, if getting a job is your top priority. 

So, what do you do then? 

You learn.

You ask questions.

You research. 

You do whatever it takes to become an “expert” in the thing that you’re asked to do.

**But… Know Your Worth**

Be upfront and transparent with your administration. If you’ve never picked up a baseball in your life, and they’re looking for a baseball coach to work with freshman, tell them you’re more than happy to help out and learn, but you’ve never coached a day in your life. Odds are, based on the fact that you’re in that chair means they couldn’t find anyone else willing to coach, and they’re not going to evaluate you solely on your performance on the baseball field. If they are primarily looking for a coach, then the job wouldn’t have been a good fit for you anyway, and no harm is done. You’ve gained valuable experience in the interview process.

What if the department chair wants you to teach a course you really don’t have an interest in teaching? Again, consider your position. You’re a new teacher, with absolutely no teaching experience. The only way you’re going to gain experience is by having a job, and having your own classroom. Unless the situation is truly awful, odds are you can stick it out for at least a full year. And then, come hiring season, you can take your experience and go apply for a new job.

Now, I say all of this with the caveat that you should understand your worth. Ultimately, you are a professional with a college degree. There are some teaching jobs that are simply not worth your time. I’ve seen fully accredited teachers take jobs as autism support staff in a contained classroom, just so they could have an “in” at a highly desirable public high school. Not only is the pay much less, but they’re being subjected to extremely difficult circumstances that they may or may not have any interest in maintaining in the future. In one extreme situation, a person at the school I worked at had to quit mid-year, because the conditions were so bad. Suffice to say, that person is no longer in the field of education. So, while it’s important to be flexible and open to various teaching experiences, it’s even more important to know what your limitations are.

**Explore the World!**

One of the more exciting facets of starting out as a teacher is that, simply put, you can go *anywhere.* When you’re doing research for jobs, don’t just limit yourself to teaching in a brick and mortar public school. On-line school is becoming an increasingly large presence in the realm of public education. Are you an English teacher? Consider teaching English in a foreign country. Have you had a desire to go live in Europe? See if you can be a teacher at an Army Base somewhere. Did you grow up in a Midwestern town and have a desire to go see the rest of the country? Try applying to some fast growing communities in the South or on the coasts. Be open to the idea of travelling somewhere new to teach, especially if you’re single, and don’t really have anything connecting you to where you grew up or went to college.

**Be a Professional**

If you were anything like me in college, you loved to party, and showed up to your minimum wage college job hungover once or twice. Teaching, and especially first year teaching, is a job that will drain you mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically. Gone are the days when you can crush cheap liquor until 2 am, and be up at 6 am for your job. It’s important that you treat yourself like the professional that you are.

So what do those steps look like? The first one, if you haven’t done it already, is cleaning up your social media. Taking out all the alcohol in your profile pictures is a necessity, but also spend some time restricting the viewability of your accounts. Principals may or may not spend time combing through your social media, but if you end up getting the job, kids will immediately search through your profiles. You’ll need to do everything in your power to limit their ability to know about your personal life and find the “dirt” on your college years.

Next, make sure you have some sort of professional-looking wardrobe. It’s important to consider every stereotype working against you (fair or unfair), which is primarily based around the notion that you’re some college kid who has no idea what you're doing. While there may be some truth to this, having a few well-tailored pieces of *professional* clothing will, at the very least, convey the notion that you take your job and yourself seriously. 

**Clean Up Your Resume &amp; Cover Letter**

Consider what your resume looks like. Is it full of unrelated job experience, spelling errors, and poorly formatted information? Take some time to fix it up. There are a ton of great resources online that will help you prepare a resume, but I’ve found that the best thing you can do is trim out the “fat”. Try to condense all your teaching-related experience to one page, and format it in such a way that it’s easy to identify your name, contact information, and most recent experience.

As a side note, you probably don’t have too much “teaching” experience at this point in your career. Think of teaching moments that you’ve had in your previous job experiences. Training new employees, in a way, is teaching. Working with kids at a summer camp is a form of working with youth in an organized, structured setting. While you don’t want to outright lie on your resume, you may need to take some creative liberties in linking your previous job experience to teaching experience.

Finally, when it comes to writing cover letters, make sure you do as much research as possible when it comes to the school to which you’re applying. Make sure you know the Principal’s name. Know a little bit about the community. Have a genuine reason for wanting to go to that school-other than wanting a salary- and state it in the cover letter. Your cover letter is your first opportunity to introduce yourself to the administration that you’re working with, and while it’s not impossible to overcome a bad first impression, it’s certainly less likely to happen if you have a proper cover letter.

**Persevere- You Got This!**

Getting a job is stressful, but here’s the thing- all of us have been there. It might take you awhile, and *that’s okay.* Ultimately, you’re going to spend a sizable amount of time of your life working, so you may as well take the necessary time finding the right teaching job for you. Just remember that you’re doing noble work, and making an impact in kids’ lives, so all of this stress will be worth it in the long run!",5.141668409805877,7.385519412201155,5.688722299467216,75.77465797557967,70.25309150865623,8.834455914984026,31.81408702571232,9.410407343244595,3.213177675513611,10578,479,1802,243,201,3407,731,2426,0.045,0.835,0.12,0.9995,38,1,5,0,0,0,428.0,9,118,24,47,65,69,1,7,194,3,186,16,3,16,20,289,309,140,0,39,52,1,1,9,1,26,10,8,3,18,114,96,3,10,44,14,17,46,33,15,2,14,39,19,181,55,329,225,63,279,1,0,10,3,261,130,1,62,103,1246,295,122,0.0,0.0,0.0223162509398657,0.0,0.0,0.06704018143647307,0.020271448938855803,0.024439355398392024,0.0,0.0,0.050471676545718464,0.01828784412623111,0.0,0.02477789223733492,0.0,0.01555129016038524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01599011079615366,0.023431369176287745,0.07527494955410995,0.020357716488052676,0.21378858702643327,0.0,0.0,0.035168762398109954,0.0572824541459437,0.041821076932216386,0.10102536530871703,0.0194593165168368,0.0,0.0239989656255422,0.0,0.024966360254895344,0.0,0.0,0.051057375068937386,0.11675592092649388,0.0,0.023315848857566882,0.0,0.0,0.0984954702729184,0.0,0.024712606669030374,0.0,0.018258549501072443,0.0,0.0,0.10323754297793232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047785202888240806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04680460772793985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01910360638302528,0.025723862022333517,0.020254606844957092,0.02362916114575342,0.02550430109850206,0.030208713331658588,0.0,0.019267605834429814,0.0,0.020552635387173484,0.2908057701565647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02505120468710556,0.06270388559675205,0.15561473451723956,0.0,0.0501480210353021,0.017668062261175992,0.0,0.1194779050849416,0.08774977825721705,0.14296297050928242,0.019180921498150583,0.05486982436692108,0.07563744586701229,0.0,0.0,0.020222442754108776,0.024343827596142814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05154867765987512,0.0,0.030656401061721895,0.04832342158575705,0.022938860880154604,0.04542694467086892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07744689011407083,0.0,0.0,0.5673337386996656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797508794281221,0.018640790976180384,0.0,0.04842864854779739,0.02484657387705356,0.0,0.1292209676422885,0.10055106702088107,0.022920135656292605,0.060579625014018375,0.020237806525621068,0.1152221339969812,0.0,0.0,0.03888377671823876,0.061918847515006065,0.021638624623773674,0.061059314626619475,0.0,0.0,0.024910382041459574,0.0,0.0,0.023045959558175948,0.024259749129291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02430548068145316,0.050432696258739286,0.050869866780396664,0.03527502606536489,0.08834573862945028,0.07296238021573939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047993059231414496,0.024354090212156225,0.07748106834868082,0.05217732583543587,0.0,0.0,0.025392642060584416,0.0,0.0,0.015854063012035534,0.1996779706159815,0.0,0.0,0.043236042674189484,0.02578067496255401,0.021901597297392654,0.0,0.04931198694298666,0.0,0.0,0.04597809875958005,0.025617831745144582,0.04864669778982016,0.0,0.026029235636313614,0.05860030775142034,0.04702502961796008,0.022579777379702067,0.0,0.02590542922626095,0.019529481076060864,0.021753076775518413,0.07274344999307793,0.0,0.2082962943975227,0.03644629390343135,0.062455573229921575,0.023856719361582842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05141005956105395,0.0,0.046622889749578914,0.019376313595507816,0.07042081896803383,0.022617423572909984,0.0,0.03237272989254998,0.0,0.01826272669841301,0.0,0.07858699433283174,0.02390700767133016,0.0,0.0,0.025950779254029752,0.06465956401718118,0.0,0.17194184124959694,0.0,0.019987981814609986,0.06316242626762081,0.0,0.0,0.07596371461058557,0.058612566609188975,0.0,0.0363098962696456,0.14668217049053564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025407623985013984,0.04657840937426516,0.0,0.0,0.023806801665662444,0.02750785882120153,0.0197509475156635,0.0755589060301864,0.01886881765566079,0.09441858712514063,0.05445559333405177,0.0,0.0,0.06168429003341915,0.021199227688078453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16648461105404405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10308545883599624

teaching,always2blamejane,2020/03/18,"Just got student evaluations as a TA and I realize I am a TERRIBLE teaching assistant in cadaver lab. What can I do? Out of 80 students, I received 6 very negative evaluations with comments on unprofessionalism and negativity. 

I didn’t realize I was acting in such a negative was towards the students. Once I joked about “Hope y’all fail lol I’m just kidding but yes this information is extremely difficult” 

I don’t really know what to do :( should I send them a mass message apologizing for my behavior and promise only good and great things moving forward? Or should I just take the comments and change immediately so they recognize that I heard their advice. 

I don’t want these students to dislike me or distrust me. We are all the same age so I thought it would be okay to be casual with them but apparently not. 

In my defense, not that it’s excusable I was going through a tremendously stressful time. I was on the verge of withdrawing out from my masters program, then I had some mental health problems, and then I broke my foot and was mentally off for a while. 

I felt I was improving and getting to know the students better, but clearly some of them are displeased with my teaching. I felt confident these past two weeks on my teaching, but what do I do to address these students evaluations?",4.270134680134679,6.709503534979426,5.567933034044149,74.81645622895623,73.32098765432099,9.027235316124203,34.09072203516648,9.573946990214177,3.768178600823045,1041,56,180,28,22,347,139,243,0.171,0.669,0.16,-0.5836,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,1,5,3,7,16,2,1,11,3,24,2,1,0,2,45,37,20,0,6,11,0,2,0,0,3,1,1,1,1,12,14,0,1,8,2,0,6,8,8,0,1,13,3,36,8,27,19,4,25,0,2,0,0,17,13,0,5,8,143,48,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18277218568964612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16542065076241508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978622878681373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591732280508169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772007199005443,0.0,0.10629848072705864,0.1568793015162343,0.1495920433546603,0.20621097683329034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19881353618171785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1857717667701648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20558330539360464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3769823090727549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19879268223324667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1991902558964549,0.0,0.14225146295912486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17854973270733254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1789709057650111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982186765069652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21425235453162206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406299272913079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124260291559363,0.0,0.0,0.14848794322676714,0.10906384931249702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182709764822806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15432662787044246,0.11032035139537688,0.0,0.15003127211280728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13286702258377533,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,mt098,2020/03/18,"Australian teacher wanting to work in America. Whether it be a major city, regional, rural or remote. Nowhere is off limits. G'day teachers,

Apologies in advance for this post being quite long, however there is limited information online about this topic and my specific questions. Therefore, my queries are targeted to any American teachers in the group. Given the current corona virus pandemic, this is purely for future reference (1-2 years). I have recently completed my masters in teaching for Secondary/High School. I am History, Geography and English trained. 

After substitute teaching for a few months in a Various Western Sydney public schools, which have a reputation for being quite challenging with a high turn over rate. I have honestly fell in love with the profession despite its many challenges. Teaching students from low socio-economic areas is incredibly rewarding, fun and quite moving, given some of the students immediate circumstances. Thankfully, my experience has been quite smooth...thus far 😅. Not to say that there haven't been any challenging classes, because there certainly have. However, they have been few and far between. 

Anyways...America has always been a country that I have been infatuated with after studying abroad in Illinois over 3 years ago. The warm hospitality that I received from everyone has stayed with me. Being open, laid back, and willing to meet people and engage with the culture helped make my stay pleasant. Since then, it has have always been my intention to revisit the country after graduating. As mentioned, I have found some information about hiring foreign teachers, but nothing specific about the application process itself. 

Here are my questions. What is the likelihood of me finding work as a substitute teacher after acquiring relavent working visas? Does each state have different governing bodies with specific rules and regulations? Is there certain 3rd party hiring agencies that I need to apply through, or do I just contact the school directly like many schools in Australia? How will the students treat a 28 year old male, with a relatively strong accent? Will the students challenge me often, or will they show pity on a foreign teacher trying to make ends meet in another country 😅. 

Thanks in advance",8.559293353705115,11.084651510695188,7.855649350649354,62.53204545454548,61.96791443850268,10.690450725744846,43.03628724216959,10.7630783206399,5.739918563789152,1851,111,235,50,28,578,220,374,0.018000000000000002,0.861,0.121,0.9872,5,0,0,0,0,0,57.0,0,0,2,19,12,20,0,0,22,0,38,2,1,5,3,45,49,16,0,2,7,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,13,16,0,2,7,1,1,5,2,2,0,0,9,2,20,18,48,32,7,46,0,2,0,1,19,20,0,8,18,170,33,23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09076748692569014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17040261953031666,0.0,0.0,0.13926498599759735,0.1073706740894848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0787358661630856,0.0,0.062419383786411174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373838521231605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735979789894352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06603666608534821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698156780707814,0.0,0.0,0.08960704575266087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069207472686984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09784334691757736,0.0,0.10016250714990203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09358768800494056,0.0,0.0,0.11227144782300744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686335863546717,0.21637306490620245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050025299066961015,0.0,0.0,0.09061684957792862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09241599189125912,0.0,0.13669966460661165,0.2076260551424676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173116014412311,0.10883027684063208,0.0,0.0759250112778219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825130272108472,0.0,0.10744691682994144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07098818942368249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09806664300805652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.229412926032626,0.4356411343790929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10110326372224204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0814290602276625,0.0,0.41451909882217053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470266645990787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21828008843274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18854415119293186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695198647228797,0.11137696710298878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060395555050802185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2236355645236304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.197818152981306

teaching,CurdNerd,2020/03/18,"Suggestions on how to host distance learning discussions First year middle school social studies teacher in NJ that has been doing distance learning since Friday due to school closures. 

I was wondering if anyone had tips on how to best facilitate discussion. I wanted to actually do something like zoom, but my school has banned live video. We can only do recorded. I would love to do something in real-time because I think it will help student understand the primary sources we have been examining. 

Any suggestions?",8.489924242424241,10.378439659090908,7.69590909090909,66.009696969697,61.5,10.412121212121212,40.80303030303031,10.504223727775694,5.010789393939394,422,23,58,10,6,131,67,88,0.042,0.815,0.14300000000000002,0.8658,0,0,2,0,0,0,8.0,2,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,1,0,14,1,0,2,0,15,19,4,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,7,3,9,13,1,8,0,0,0,1,9,5,0,2,4,39,9,6,0.0,0.0,0.19322456469369867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346503621850706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13844987701188652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207021646396344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20779429746465905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16842316737051388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327187475662591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967353651677958,0.0,0.17484226635533084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17870747181298358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505919176508126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22537332720845785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6011756622371393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16379199172237874,0.0,0.0,0.20184142042720069,0.0,0.3048682354204157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12687377126156654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20613045179462972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167886285803265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21472825094755266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14065725094998807,0.0,0.0,0.1275088913168459

Thank You :D For my internship, I’m developing lesson plans for secondary school students about how to recognize and decrease bullying. I want to talk to some educators about policies in their schools, what they think works, what doesn’t, etc. to get their perspective. I was planning on calling schools this month and setting up in-person meetings, but all the schools in my state are closed because of the coronavirus. My professor says I still need to meet with educators somehow. If I don’t pass this internship, I’ll have to wait to graduate. If you’d be willing to help out, I’d really appreciate it.

Every post I see is either someone demanding respect for their profession, complaining about some aspect of education or administration, or mocking others who have to step into one of the roles of teachers amid the coronavirus crisis. There’s a cartoon strip in particular that just serves to point out every negative thing in education. I’m a student teacher, and I joined this sub to learn more about education and the real and honest aspects of teaching that my school won’t teach me (like teacher burnout, limited resources, etc.). I am still learning obviously, and through my coursework and student teaching, it is clear that many aspects of teaching are thankless, and that there exists many struggles between administration and teachers, parents and teachers, and coworkers and teacher. But everyone seems angry, resentful, vengeful, or apathetic.

Does anyone like their job? Their students? Is anyone happy they went into teaching? This will be my second career, and I’m excited to get started soon, but I struggle to find anything positive in this sub that would encourage me or drive me forward. Everyone seems miserable. Most of the teachers I know have their struggles, but they love their jobs and are glad they’re in teaching.

teaching,LegendOfJeff,2020/03/19,"Decent replacement for tracing paper? Before the surprise shift to remote teaching, my plans for next week included an activity to practice reflections and rotations with patty paper (Pretty similar to tracing paper, but it comes in small squares). For the rotation, for example, students trace the prompt figure, then rotate the page 90 degrees and trace it again. 

I would love to be able to keep as close to this activity as possible. But few of my students will have access to tracing paper at home. And I don't want to send them to a store for such a trivial supply. 

Any ideas on how I might replicate this activity by giving instructions that use only common household items?

Thanks in advance for any insight.",7.832303149606299,8.956802968503938,7.697312992125987,68.15179625984253,62.622047244094496,10.129527559055118,37.13484251968504,10.125756701596842,4.176465354330708,575,27,85,12,8,184,90,127,0.019,0.87,0.111,0.9346,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,1,2,3,3,0,0,7,0,6,1,0,2,0,18,13,9,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,5,6,0,1,4,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,3,24,9,3,14,0,0,1,1,4,6,0,1,5,59,11,8,0.2400656350932173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32650572812957857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20427817379482105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2067952877687662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2302928321991065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24080540575395085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710048811307085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21338136682049655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21666860845979888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2546717015761684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2553125264068873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1825807332602175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2706379330431119,0.0,0.244233056043514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2210201829585637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20733963013172435,0.0,0.0,0.14159693146411131,0.0,0.19256617193589606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1705357393506614,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,major_oof_alert,2020/03/19,"Student teaching cut short I was 10/14 weeks into student teaching when our governor closed all schools for the rest of this month. My university and the state board of education said we don’t have to make up the rest of our time. I’m not stressed about that, but I didn’t get a chance to say goodbye to the kids, so that hurt me. 


Although, in the other side of this, is it bad that I’m a little glad to be done early? This is for a couple reasons. I was one week away from being phased out and was just going to have to observe the classroom teacher all day or observe other teachers. I’ve done enough observing over the past 3 years to suit me. 


Another reason is that I have been so stressed. Not merely because of the work of being a teacher. I also HAVE to work a job because simply not working isn’t an option for me, so I was gone from like 7 am - 9 pm on some days and would have to come home and prep, grade, etc. and even that wasn’t so bad except for the fact that I had to work on my edTPA on top of that (if you don’t know what that is, look it up. It sucks). 


So basically, I feel guilty for feeling a little relief to be done. Don’t get me wrong, I love everything about teaching and the kids. I know the amount of work that comes with teaching, and being free of that work is not why I feel relief. I really look forward to having my own classroom. I’ve been told so many times that being in your own classroom is a lot better and different than student teaching.

teaching,staygoldd,2020/03/19,"Is anyone else using the Wit &amp; Wisdom curriculum for distance learning? (5th grade) I’ve created a few lessons for Module 4 and I’m willing to share them if you’d like! Also, I’d love to find someone with ideas about how to make this more collaborative. Even if you don’t use this curriculum, I’d love to hear what you think. 

I’m using google slides &amp; adding a response journal section to the lesson. I plan to assign the presentation to each student.

teaching,blueyellowred3838,2020/03/20,"Teachers &amp; Parents during the Caronavirus, what issues are you seeing with the online learning? I'm a teacher, and we are closed until the end of the  month (for now). We had a spring break as part of the closure with snow days still left beforehand. However, no one really mentioned that and I'm already being asked to send  packets of work up to the school if a student can't get online. Students are stressed and confused (as well as I) and I honestly believed they were going to get a little break for a few days before having to pick back up on their education online after spring break. In fact, the same notion I had was even in the newspaper from the superintendent,  but principals are still already initiating online work! Some students do not have internet and I know some of them probably have no clue they are even suppose to pick up their work from the school this soon. It seems like there is a total lack of communication on things, and I'm really stressed for the kids. I'm not even sure what to assign to them, because for families who are going through a lot, I don't want the work to be difficult to complete online.. but I also don't want to come across as an ineffective teacher if I'm still getting paid. Parents and teachers please give me some inside onto what's going on in your world with this right now. Personally, at the rate things are going with this, I believe schools should be shut down until further notice with grades being forgiven, allow parents to determine what/if their kids are learning for now,   for the time being, pay teachers to complete some online teaching training/develop online curriculum in preparation for next year incase this happens again or extends on into next year, and administrators should be spending their time preparing for how to provide 1-1 devices for low-income families as well as internet access...",8.61794202898551,8.203038344927537,8.199782608695656,70.41213768115942,61.20289855072463,10.681159420289855,37.42753623188406,9.994966539143718,3.79627536231884,1499,63,249,26,18,477,177,345,0.075,0.867,0.057999999999999996,-0.4406,5,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,2,2,8,5,17,10,0,3,22,0,28,0,0,4,3,48,50,23,0,7,7,3,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,3,12,18,0,0,4,0,3,6,7,5,2,1,5,1,20,5,60,37,10,56,0,0,1,0,23,23,0,10,25,187,32,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21198999965550455,0.07681219121991954,0.0,0.10407154519820178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979500106169748,0.0,0.0,0.07385752206890282,0.0,0.058551981964397176,0.0,0.08173258318383579,0.2164338500864018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273969140022952,0.20141592463617908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12389028686502312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08507294371716442,0.0,0.0,0.19032293655741836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18109723768038224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15054852220841736,0.0921411608234761,0.21835267290275628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493784882683167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10025260400158524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05278728342333964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10436002027525028,0.0,0.0,0.04692581424313808,0.0962686378266102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165938182811769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07666723258696719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20430329794690216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10935504354200694,0.0,0.0,0.06508684781915904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3199608107014002,0.10401419954617634,0.0,0.0,0.08386829172149746,0.0,0.10543548553726577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10355954874598652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12306584673072332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08202728678600887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29162713558481645,0.07654045160392292,0.08744149757935586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23012008069505505,0.0,0.22005288301256015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905272150761693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127624433632926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201657282193464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11330709262253826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17272331094568924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27970596624048577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237077781823425
teaching,amiracana,2020/03/20,"Part time online teaching jobs I'm new to Reddit (longtime lurker) and I'm not sure job posts are allowed since I can't find the teaching community rules anywhere... I just read a long front page post of people losing their jobs which is sobering to say the least, and have recently by pure irony been tasked with finding American teachers to teach Chinese children online.

I'll keep the details short but basically through an app- think Facetime but with more features, 30 minutes classes with kids from the 4-12ish age range.  Likely groups to start and as time goes on 1-on-1 if the kids like the teacher.  Simple stipulations are 1) have a neutral accent, 2) be somewhat exciting to keep their attention,  3) no sensitive subjects are to be discussed with the kids.  If anyone has any interest feel free to DM me for more details.  And if this post is not allowed, I do apologize in advance.",5.325984990619137,7.3810208292682935,5.231219512195121,80.02672607879927,69.36585365853661,7.485178236397751,33.347091932457786,8.139509932561175,2.7103898686679173,712,34,120,10,13,221,118,164,0.059000000000000004,0.8490000000000001,0.092,0.8894,5,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,2,2,1,7,0,0,10,0,13,0,0,2,2,28,20,10,0,3,8,0,1,2,0,0,0,2,0,4,2,8,0,2,5,1,1,2,4,1,0,0,1,3,6,7,19,17,6,15,0,1,0,0,10,3,0,4,9,68,8,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201796593256601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11517884805366685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08328940179926454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011094963044312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4903894462154138,0.2928285125785809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609516478677833,0.0,0.0,0.14577555293204844,0.0,0.18428401680050266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15909146183399334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1783800354732638,0.0,0.11419887816760772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4732801628596197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16476857269104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1626450736368829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13099513318675135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13626139173370047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11659249222567372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15525041683769306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554848539791087,0.0,0.0,0.1921037735304543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm currently writing a conference paper that sort of overlaps with educational theory, but I don't know enough about edu to discuss it intelligently. (My background is in heritage/anthropology.) I simply am  not familiar with the correct terminology. I also just completed my master's, so I no longer have access to scientific journals and such.

Can you tell me where to look? Could you point me in the direction of some theories?

teaching,sarahmstevens44,2020/03/21,"Ohio Educators-OAE Exam (090) Hi!
So a little background--I completed my undergrad in Early Childhood Education at Northern Kentucky University in December of 2016 and have been teaching preschool at a non profit school in ohio since. My current school does not require me to have an Ohio licensure so I've been putting off transferring my licensure to Ohio from Kentucky.
I'm currently enrolled in a graduate program through Miami University and need my Ohio licensure to avoid having to student teach again (Ohio's licensure rules are really strict 🙄) I have taken the pedagogy and content OAE tests for Early Childhood and passed without any trouble, but the fundamentals of reading (090) test is killing me!! I've tried two seperate study guides including the practice test and study guide from the OAE site. I have taken it twice and failed by 3 points each time. I sincerely feel like I can't pass this. I need advice on study guides or things to focus on studying to hopefully pass next time.

teaching,LadyInTheRoom,2020/03/22,"Please help an almost Teacher Hello teachers of reddit. I am in a Transition to Teaching program. Last Friday I showed up for my very first field experience school visit, only to immediately and apologetically be sent home by my cooperating teacher. The school was busy preparing for the e-learning switch due to the covid-19 pandemic.

My program has very graciously allowed us to find alternative resources to complete our field-work dependant assignments. I need one publisher made assessment and one teacher made assessment. My mother teaches at a prison and let me use her education.com account to secure what I suppose would be publisher made assessments. But they are pretty generic. So if anyone here could post or DM a link I could view one of each kind of assessment, I would be so grateful.

The assignment is to rate and compare the validity, reliability, and fairness of each assessment. I do not need answer keys or anything, just blank assessments. My content area is K-6 generalist so anything in that range would work.",7.730234680573663,9.930496564971753,7.853333333333335,63.00860495436768,63.57627118644068,10.869882659713168,39.60408518035637,10.891193690592663,5.160531855714907,840,46,121,24,13,272,118,177,0.018000000000000002,0.8809999999999999,0.10099999999999999,0.9295,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,0,1,2,5,2,0,0,9,0,16,0,0,6,0,30,23,12,0,8,6,1,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,2,7,0,1,3,1,1,2,1,0,0,4,5,2,17,2,18,9,2,11,0,0,1,0,9,5,0,5,3,83,19,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14391175670208334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049022684403346,0.0,0.2365335941945212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506844784764884,0.0,0.0,0.22949256632382276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14058274557285708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135468056785113,0.12224555673242295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633043623609977,0.0,0.14415980994609173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14965907845884796,0.0,0.11714848868959506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14696030945624133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4079653339660966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2131285816780152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29215895626001176,0.10930320988518416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15775804400566698,0.0,0.0,0.13764110259893084,0.1462117963321863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2908984342693952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1728737848146193,0.12412529353524256,0.0,0.2371630554245017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2092552896492237,0.0,0.0,0.3062771746776399,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Flailed,2020/03/22,"""Daily Interruptions"" - Idea to keep connection with students A local teacher posted this (and put it in the middle of their Canvas lesson), and I thought it was very clever. Basically, he thinks of a ridiculous interruption, and he uses his students' names (could be current, previous, or siblings' names for those of you who may want to try the idea) and shows a fairly realistic reaction to it. It adds some humor that students may not be getting at home and may miss about the classroom.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89BiIWRiPD0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89BiIWRiPD0)

I would love to see some variations of these from other teachers! You could even have students (or maybe even students' parents to surprise their kids) submit their own interruption. This teacher has made three so far, and the school nurse followed by making a reaction video of some of the students' possible injuries from the first three videos.

teaching,WindrunnerX,2020/03/23,"Covid-19 and Preschool Hello I am a preschool teacher at a private school in IL and my principal has just informed me that I am to create a two weeks or more worth of material to send home to families so that education can continue amid this lock-down. I'm am currently creating a list of resources that we use, making copies of our circle time schedule, and gathering simple letter practice ideas/worksheets. 

My only fear is that worksheets aren't completely DAP and this was not something I ever expected to be doing. Should I put in arts and crafts ideas in there too for fine motor practice? What is and isn't okay to expect parents to do? How does one teach the social parts of Pre-K in all this mess? If anyone else is dealing with this I'd love to talk about what to do and bounce ideas off each other.

Thank you and good luck everyone",7.038062330623305,6.740257304878052,6.914227642276423,77.94676151761519,64.36585365853661,9.97181571815718,34.075880758807585,9.444778638647367,2.9935848238482388,674,26,127,11,9,214,116,164,0.046,0.825,0.128,0.9134,2,1,1,0,0,0,13.0,2,1,0,0,7,8,0,1,5,1,16,1,0,3,2,27,21,12,0,4,4,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,11,11,0,0,3,1,1,2,3,2,0,2,1,0,10,6,21,18,4,14,0,0,0,1,13,6,0,3,6,86,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13119474394723687,0.19224835391107492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967257134490148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19343753235279726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1641956332885775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15674017396381504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697214112153152,0.0,0.17928780237382774,0.0,0.0,0.17688017146941934,0.21113508597729846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15737452458598553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18820745009078246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4236212013602558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16934273624489776,0.0,0.12524399064764516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12714244513188375,0.1427005101277593,0.0,0.0,0.20834009318331656,0.20318420851291735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18861923381402906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18989083215952254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19126440588040186,0.0,0.14444617412044886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15080929508788374,0.0,0.17274381745288955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10940813268024156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1832865272747966,0.0,0.0,0.16205144136062472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15050487791303901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/teachers-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/teachers-coronavirus.html)

A few years ago, I was working at an alternative high school in DC. For our 200+ students, our school was able to buy and install cell phone lockers, one for every student. We had long since used metal detectors and wanded every student that entered the school every morning, so this was just another layer of the entrance process. As with most new practices, students complied with this system for, oh, about a month, before they started bringing in dummy phones to turn in or, in general, began to flout the system because they could already see that the adults were never going to be able to fully implement the process, nor could they keep up this level of zero tolerance for very long. However, for those few brief weeks at the start of the school year, the teachers were euphoric; they marveled at how much more of their students’ attentions they were able to seize, how much work they got done. For those brief weeks, teachers were able to exhale. After that, though, these cell phone lockers became more and more empty, just another costly investment that couldn’t accomplish the one thing they were designed to do: to get students to focus more on what was going on inside the classroom and less on what was going on in their social networks, their neighborhood beefs, or the world beyond. 

This failed cell phone locker experiment is symbolic of most attempts to repair the public education system: we believe that, if we can just get *one* thing working, it will have a domino effect and get other things working. Or, more to the point, we believe that we can only focus on getting *one* thing working at a time, because the systemic changes we know we need are often too unfathomable when we are submerged to our nostrils every day in things we cannot change. Even if we *had* been able to sustain the zero tolerance cell phone policy, we would have over-focused on that and left other things unattended. Still, it taught us something: you can drastically improve the ability of teachers to do their jobs when you take something unrelated to instruction out of the equation and, as a result, teachers felt more satisfaction in their work because of something that had nothing to do with teaching and everything to do with the environment in which learning is supposed to take place. 

As a teacher, I get frustrated with the default attitude by the public that teachers are saints, that they are all amazing and inspiring because they put up with so much and blah blah. That attitude contributes to this inaccurate assumption that teachers shouldn’t be held to the same standards because they’re working in substandard conditions. I honestly believe that most teachers would be more than happy to give up their savior status if it meant that the system could actually let them do their jobs without feeling pressure to do everyone else’s jobs as well. While I am flattered by all of the parents of children stuck at home during the coronavirus school closures who say that teachers should be paid a lot more for what they do, I want to warn them that teaching THIRTY of your child in a room for 72 minutes at a time, four times a day with about a 20 minute break to eat lunch is not just completely unlike what you are experiencing at home, it’s a common and absurd reality for most teachers. While I do agree that being a teacher in this country should involve a higher salary comparable to other fields that demand similar educational commitment, I also believe that teachers could accept modest fiscal improvement if it meant that all of the non-instructional threats to learning could be returned to systems built to manage them. I don’t want to be impressive because I keep a stash of food in my classroom at all times for hungry students, that I have to buy pencils weekly because even students whose parents amply supply them never have them, that I have students learning at so many different grade levels in a single room that I can’t use common resources and have to find my own, that I have to manage, even with a co teacher, the behavioral, emotional, psychological, and social outbursts of thirty individuals while also delivering cohesive and engaging instruction. I would like to be impressive just because I can engage my students in learning and make the exchange meaningful for them and for me. I would like that level of being impressive to be enough, because THAT is a full time job, and that’s the job being consistently shifted to the back burner because these other issues demand and require priority just to keep any semblance of order in a room with that many people in it. I urge adults to envision an office space, even if every person had their own cubicle, where thirty people could be in a 70X50 square foot room that only has four electrical outlets, and access to a bathroom that 270 other people use daily. You would lose your minds. 

I don’t present those figures to garner MORE adoration; I do it to illustrate that what the system expects you to do is simply not feasible, even in the best of circumstances. We seem to expect teachers to perform miracles because, even if we fall short, society can feel good about itself for doling out praise and classroom donations. It’s not a radical idea to say that we would give up all of our DonorsChoose projects, candy-gram fundraisers for field trips, the spirit crushing adherence to outdated curricula, all of our professional developments on Socio-Emotional Learning, if it meant we could have smaller classrooms for shorter periods with adequate support for students’ needs. Hell, I would give up my summers (which, let’s be honest, no teachers get summers “off” for anything) for longer school years if it meant smaller classrooms and shorter class periods, if it meant actual blended learning that did make use of virtual classrooms and teaching students how to actually USE the technology and access to information they have. I would actually love to host workshops to teach parents how to use technology better, how to, say, use free phone apps to restrict their child’s access to online gaming and social media during the school day; how much more teaching could I get done if I wasn’t batting students off of their phones in class as they play UNO with other classmates (UNO. seriously.) or reminding them daily to not use my classroom as a TikTok or Boomerang backdrop? 

And, to be clear, this is not an attack on the people directly above teachers in the hierarchy. Like us, school administrators and county school boards can only work with what they have. It’s the funding system, the privatization of resources, the repetition of dogma in lieu of actual improvement. It’s everything that glances up at how the government conveys the value of education to its citizens.

Public education in the US has always been behind the curve when it comes to innovation, and as modernity ramps up, it’s getting worse. It needed a major overhaul about 20 years ago, so it needs even more now, and no one really has the stomach to take it on. I wonder what it will take. I honestly don’t even think the coronavirus will been enough. Again, people will be so thankful just to have survived this pandemic that they will shudder at the thought of radical systemic change in education. We’ll be right back to where we started before this whole thing started, and that’s more depressing than being out of my classroom for two weeks.",15.541386158886164,10.480156664414416,13.14564291564292,54.73385749385753,52.55105105105105,15.562544362544365,51.14359814359814,12.364751094338914,6.278596996996996,6175,278,931,115,44,1911,502,1332,0.034,0.861,0.105,0.9983,11,0,3,0,0,0,164.0,25,7,31,19,48,37,4,1,73,0,113,7,3,19,10,190,180,73,0,38,28,3,3,5,0,17,0,3,6,7,95,61,3,6,28,2,9,11,19,9,1,10,34,11,95,29,193,101,41,147,4,3,3,1,104,74,1,24,54,718,190,69,0.1846750499122904,0.0,0.1802162090181784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0654813156369383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04075870196284783,0.05907382827744032,0.03073288710736477,0.0,0.0,0.025117073343531717,0.07745915677890658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030394366148756773,0.0,0.0,0.04201890596621223,0.0,0.05680148562880945,0.0,0.24766763193631916,0.0,0.06285794620608896,0.16645243275020266,0.03876101426755885,0.03266601483773484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11721702946166745,0.031816240650598925,0.03872565524863557,0.0,0.0,0.23591680033501755,0.0,0.0,0.07146007764464014,0.0,0.031812069976490845,0.0,0.0,0.0385892242155218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07559467754724053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03779373604740526,0.030854461443379062,0.08309382982766435,0.0,0.07632747732479019,0.0,0.1951618060083054,0.0,0.1555966945206959,0.03529298485331852,0.06638961077808271,0.036129527035596916,0.0,0.0,0.03735090164001675,0.0,0.03546340176619255,0.0,0.033757929989842686,0.0,0.044661960680205934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15437614623612214,0.10629428138925068,0.06297305202200996,0.030979334003606418,0.02954030156034592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039318004930046516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03902386591923111,0.07409765301808773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041695130525328514,0.0,0.0385505544048329,0.18326149121027727,0.09848860180081967,0.0,0.0,0.02029851555240012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04012999641632137,0.07553710026110218,0.0,0.05413374065403544,0.0,0.0,0.06537264311498604,0.0,0.041320828560708615,0.0,0.031400824678629764,0.03333528854823617,0.0,0.049308811936687215,0.07489260588632797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037293831094492094,0.0,0.029481172587448413,0.0,0.10860592853529376,0.10954736760072208,0.05697311333922244,0.035672062797672995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03544013822089637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12514059324842547,0.0842722183408563,0.0,0.0,0.12303587286534452,0.0,0.0,0.12803042685186622,0.03225022606693448,0.0385892242155218,0.0,0.03491552288369053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03712988655058022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023661513169745484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03154229671555328,0.0,0.08811660720240247,0.0,0.3364218177148879,0.02943242096415623,0.03362424590606864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03055302193335107,0.0,0.0,0.11295177402489133,0.0,0.08530312549745997,0.0,0.0,0.10457116067614766,0.0,0.029496346682888426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04191341162842272,0.0,0.0,0.11108212355240447,0.0,0.0,0.03400479481675677,0.0,0.0,0.1717658560994591,0.023666463026421482,0.03628845977847652,0.029322272245421374,0.10768550672126767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040174684705804695,0.036080137886006274,0.0,0.13328480796319714,0.2551999183290277,0.0,0.03047525138269415,0.0435704516815297,0.0,0.11850814848987952,0.0,0.033209009690608006,0.0,0.0,0.041236619620165636,0.0,0.03560403159418472,0.04005444278393448,0.21511301728860224,0.0,0.03763993061830539,0.20990057099465326,0.0,0.0,0.09513974186733316

teaching,milkpeche,2020/03/24,"I'm interested in becoming an elementary school teacher...but I've had no official experience with children. I'm not quite sure how to word this, so I apologize if it seems like I'm rambling.

I'm currently a senior in university, I will be graduating with a bachelor's in psychology this May. I want to be an elementary school teacher, but all of the positions (even for substitute) that I've looked into require a year experience working with children. I'm not sure what I can do to meet that requirement except for working at an early education center, daycare, nannying, etc. Is there any other way that I can get that experience? I've only taken care of my younger siblings and young children of family friends. Anyone who is currently an elementary school teacher or is trying to be one, what would you recommend or what did you do?

Also, if you also didn't graduate with a degree in education, which certification programs did you go through and which programs do you recommend? Any information that you think would be relevant to me is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",6.91897174254317,8.216116030612246,8.411428571428573,61.6104945054945,64.71428571428571,12.153218210361068,39.05651491365777,11.807384569943707,5.4154023547880685,866,47,138,30,13,301,110,196,0.03,0.8170000000000001,0.153,0.9765,2,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,7,0,5,6,8,0,0,9,0,21,0,0,1,3,29,35,11,0,5,8,0,0,1,1,4,0,0,0,3,15,7,0,2,3,0,0,1,4,0,0,1,5,1,14,8,22,22,2,15,0,0,1,0,15,7,0,6,7,100,29,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23920134413291624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20340776549104184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10457372582774918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16517394701203755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.152483320281867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16679557912410894,0.0987809823779904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4388863062613652,0.14098902135170402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155473606381924,0.0,0.07813735531983901,0.0,0.08499668480979608,0.0,0.0,0.16488711110767287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07306599162985011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255902059664159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101343688003526,0.11374483132938452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15907226979070455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4540789795841042,0.0,0.13615106809082236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28191138910269425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13769198415465705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09583008130444594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015393800475048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08821258847278972,0.11871137854513487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2177585420495389,0.0,0.0,0.21248199151908428,0.0,0.0,0.09630979910529876

“Calling ALL teachers; All of you who have a skill or lesson to teach kids of all ages, and us adults!!**   

Please consider taking 15-30min of your time to record or live stream simple lessons for fun &amp; learning. While we’re all stuck at home many of us are homeschooling and desperately need some new materials. Some of us just want a fun break to learn something new!! Post to your page and share your talents 🤩  (share in this post too)”

My response: 
Gimme a damn break. Thats like saying, “calling all chefs, help, I’m home and hungry and cant go to restaurants, gimme all your recipes!”

I know it sounds stingy, but people think teachers have the time to not only raise their own famlies and completely shift their work to their classroom and write new lessons, but then take even more time to give others their work.  

I dunno, maybe I’m an asshole but it fits into the overall picture of people just not having the knowledge or respect of what teachers do and how much work it takes.",4.658710217755445,6.256624753768848,3.9930452261306537,90.06380569514238,70.30653266331659,6.311691792294807,26.331993299832497,6.42735559955562,0.8619303852596318,822,26,162,5,15,243,126,199,0.052000000000000005,0.85,0.098,0.8428,0,0,1,0,0,0,27.0,3,5,4,7,5,9,2,0,8,0,7,2,1,1,6,41,19,17,0,2,10,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,2,10,9,0,0,8,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,2,2,15,7,20,17,12,20,0,0,0,0,23,4,2,7,11,94,25,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13183593289832038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2484896715073043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1275750075316806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08036587344859446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167227398455792,0.06915129461697007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08155688132316853,0.0,0.2441019675760156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06686996663718481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05944476452209237,0.0,0.1074421679597038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233604015047894,0.12223993135342133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944588582115365,0.0902212380720808,0.0,0.3525464179391044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09254010741733427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16870968421366192,0.0,0.0,0.13356374761151305,0.0,0.0,0.3495960210022682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676166661211592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09367215616231377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2744557062594644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07796509005358505,0.0,0.0,0.21285082319947474,0.1398487027647458,0.11533465380978115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4390838649621708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176767785776486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2657448075238463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

His wife answers the door in a robe and tells us he was arrested over the weekend for a DUI. We then hear a man in the background. We ask who was that? She slams the door.

teaching,hawks0311,2020/03/24,"edTPA Does anyone actually think the edTPA was beneficial to them? Kind of a long story but I was a para for 3 years, career firefighter for 6, in the Marines for 6 years, and ran several special needs and at risk youth programs for the FD during that time and now finishing up my student teaching (MA in SPED) now because they'd never let me do it when I was on the line with the FD. This is the most worthless thing I have ever done in any of my careers. This is nothing but busy work and how do I know Pearson has teachers or educators implementing it or grading it. 

For reference, there was a time in Iraq, outside of Fallujah, that we found an IED and was told to pick it up and bring it back to base. For the longest time that was the dumbest thing I've ever been apart of until this edTPA shit.

teaching,cjr34,2020/03/25,"Helpful Remote Learning Resources Hello everyone! 

Normally I hang out in the Computer Science and Fitness subs, but I wanted to come over and share some information I have found super useful.  My friends EdTech company (Pivot Professional Learning) has started an amazingly massive effort towards creating material geared at helping teachers, parents, and students in this new world or remote learning.  Their resources have really helped me prepare for the coming months and hopefully they can help you too (tons of content!).  They are open to feedback and if you share any thoughts here, I will help pass along.

teaching,DataIsKey1613,2020/03/25,"Looking for a path into teaching after Physics BSc Hello everyone, I'll start with this. I am looking to get into teaching high school math and possibly physics and have already completed my BSc in Physics in the state of Michigan. If this is the wrong sub for this, please kindly direct me in the right direction and I will be quite grateful.

Here is my current situation, I am about 1.5 years removed from undergrad and am working a job in data analytics, project management, and software development. I wear a lot of hat at this job and I've only been here for a few months, it is not a start up, it is a major corporation. I feel incredibly overwhelmed, but not by the workload, moreso the number of directions that I am being pulled in. I have always enjoyed teaching and even took the two introductory teaching course during my undergrad, in which I recieved a 4.0 and a 3.5 in. Besides that, I have had a lot of interaction with kids and special needs individuals throughout my life, I understand it takes a special level of patience at times. I always have enjoyed it though. 

Other relevant information is that my undergraduate GPA was not stellar (a tad under 2.5, I was a physics major that should explain it), but am currently in a MSc program where I am majoring in data science. In my first graduate course, I recieved a 3.75 and am on track to recieve either a 3.75 or 4.0 in my second course. 

My end goal is to get into teaching high school or community college math and possibly physics. I want to know what routes I can take to make that a reality. 

Thank you in advance and I wish you all good health during this crazy time.",7.029838187702267,7.289016919093854,7.6020873786407765,71.13510517799357,64.27508090614886,10.232362459546927,37.87864077669903,9.994966539143718,3.907532038834951,1304,64,227,26,18,432,165,309,0.019,0.8590000000000001,0.122,0.9821,4,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,2,0,5,6,9,0,1,22,0,26,3,1,1,1,39,44,18,0,5,9,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,18,17,0,0,5,0,0,4,3,2,0,3,5,3,28,7,39,35,8,41,0,1,2,0,7,25,0,5,11,166,46,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14569629905025594,0.0,0.21971592298272088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13842895814408562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693771469450293,0.0,0.0,0.08720331942026899,0.0,0.0,0.12615851408252188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06675737784904118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11230304028197202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.137958473191479,0.0,0.0,0.1107389120360456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14033970372136126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2789898875704103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620350476529537,0.0,0.0,0.13748695630316582,0.07255919471857793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09325535643798334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22174071533402667,0.0,0.0,0.22449115023203955,0.0,0.0,0.08812978657034806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10538357530542364,0.0,0.0,0.09789716834377782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10041332471128564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14492721407905834,0.0,0.2976837058827881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14042814334833728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11275128190269927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2672389856526687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14840512391566651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18690034721655127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1985374105753024,0.0,0.0,0.12155374229730807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12971694468526912,0.0,0.15397330174980814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14668808470920824,0.0,0.0,0.12897227600637629,0.13744591550346386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787359817951546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15182580714845662,0.0,0.0,0.096118034269869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443520087749591,0.0,0.08502177213164261

teaching,calloutmyname_,2020/03/26,"Any tips on teaching children online? Hi! I hope everybody is doing well in this quarantine time.

Recently, I had the opportunity to give online Spanish classes to children. I already have experience teaching online but only to adults and I know that it's a challenge with children since you have to keep the classes very entertaining and dynamic so that they don't get bored and are more willing to learn. 

The fact that they are online classes already increases the challenge a little bit so that they pay attention to you, and the truth is that I want to do this in the most professional and pleasant way possible, I want the children to feel good about my classes and that the fact that they are online doesn't represent an inconvenience.

Can anyone give me advice on dynamics, content, materials, anything, to make these classes as easy and effective as possible? 

All advice is welcome!

teaching,MmeSuf,2020/03/26,"Teaching in Scotland! - Please help? (CND to UK) Hello everyone!

I am a newly qualified Primary teacher from Québec. It seems like the timing was also terrible with schools being closed until further notice ...ha!

A few years back, I worked in schools in Scotland through a Tier 5 Govt Exchange visa. Fell in love with the country and its people. I brought my boyfriend from Scotland to Canada and now we're ready to move back (when borders open..!) . 

I did a little research because I've been trying to get as organised as I could, but I'm a little confused. I've learned about General Teaching Council in Scotland (GTCS), PVG Scheme and work visas. Though, I have a few questions:

1. How do the visas work? On the GTCS, it says I need a visa to be eligible for a recognition, yet, I need a job before applying for visas, but the schools won't hire me because I don't have a GCTS, and they are asking for a visa...
2. If I was previously on a govt exchange visa, can I apply for a Tier 5 Youth Mobility scheme, if I plan on teaching? What happens after 2 years? Can I apply for Working visa?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot more questions, but I can't figure out which yet. Let me know if you, or someone you know, have any experience with moving abroad to the UK to teach.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! And wash your hands.

TL; DR: want to move to Scotland. Confused about GTCS requirements and visa applications.",3.2526817042606524,5.4248509285714315,4.037011278195493,85.85985275689225,75.42857142857143,6.5385964912280725,29.12844611528822,7.492282038375204,1.804599498746868,1081,48,206,14,24,345,149,266,0.031,0.898,0.07,0.8185,1,0,0,0,0,0,63.0,0,3,1,6,11,7,0,2,20,1,20,4,1,1,0,36,33,20,0,7,7,0,1,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,5,12,0,1,7,0,11,5,3,3,0,0,5,2,22,4,35,23,4,31,0,0,0,1,11,14,0,10,13,128,27,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887261071718408,0.0,0.2408240092163147,0.2700762746062431,0.0755739029179227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038938747477868,0.0,0.0,0.17090804735858714,0.0,0.13549066670791696,0.0,0.09456556222188857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08873024894945128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619185501862176,0.0,0.1087088981790876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05806213829594236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09827409235507484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0744897643140008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028184658214496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215101837333164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11364049871089076,0.0,0.05429372024913405,0.222767897594339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09448086739041214,0.10030140956426828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35434874247399745,0.0,0.16480666379275813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265250744747557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07704527448007706,0.0,0.0,0.12199009965882505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24898764145074306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08837701520250346,0.0,0.33741603362404377,0.0,0.10117084347520096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09416219667126692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10231586407686566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918710547324892,0.0,0.0648022476131057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07545166460612968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06554882092419305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32362310016379403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2700762746062431,0.1431313576462062
teaching,kamikaz-eh,2020/03/26,"XR Educators: The Hive with Navah (8:30pm EDT March 26th) Hello there educators! First of all, a thank you for everything you're doing during the pandemic and afterward, it's not going to be easy getting kids back up to speed once everything is finally over with. I'm here because I'm a producer on a VR talk show called ""The Hive with Navah"" and this week we're doing a special edition on XR educators where we'll be talking with prominent members of the AR/VR community about the power of AR/VR in education. Our guests include:

* Bobby Carlton ( Writer for VRScout, Executive Director of Immersive Learning at Ready Learner One)
* Andy Fidel (Community Support at AltspaceVR and social host of WXRfund)
* Paola Paulino (founder of XR Pioneer Ltd. &amp; President of the VR/AR Association Shenzen)

 This dynamic trio recently discussed XR education at the Educators in VR's ""2020 Educators in VR International Summit."" Fast-forward to today where school districts, parents, and businesses all over the world are currently learning more and more about integrating technology in work and education.

They will discuss Virtual Solution trials amidst COVID-19 quarantine and isolation. Explaining the journey of adapting Fact-to-Face education events into virtual experiences, AR/VR for workforce education and more.

If you would like to join us - and we would love it if you did :) You can join us in VR (this is always the best way because you get hands and can give people high fives which is obviously the entire point of hands), or you can download the AltspaceVR app onto a regular PC and join us in two-dimensions, OR you can watch the livestream of the event on our YouTube channel. The great news is that no matter what way you choose to join us, we'll be taking questions for our guests from everywhere so full participation marks will be available :)  


Join us tonight at 8:30 pm EDT!!

teaching,Plastic-Camp,2020/03/26,"Best way to quiet down a student who talks a lot? It's an online class of four students. My training and experience is with software, not kids, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a kid who treats the entire lecture as though it's a personal conversation with him. The student talks about random things and has a hard time paying attention which holds up the class. These are real young kids (10-11 in this class). 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you do in a situation like this? I am worried that anything I say to him is going to come across as overly harsh. Is there any recovering with a student like this? In other words can I say something to him or coach him and then have him be a ""good"" student?

teaching,nadia_OmniEdu,2020/03/27,"Real-life scenarios for teaching Math and Physics Dear teachers!

I need your feedback about some scenario questions I created. I wrote them to serve as free teaching resources for K-12 STEM educators. The goal is to help students apply math and science concepts into real-life situations, rather than memorizing formulas and calculations.

You will find the examples (with answers and solutions) here -&gt; [Omni Scenarios](https://scenarios.omnicalculator.com/)

I want to make sure that they will be useful for you. 

Can you tell me what you like/don't like about them?",9.438238095238098,12.407856633333335,7.910952380952383,61.24500000000001,60.444444444444436,9.587301587301589,37.3015873015873,9.957137785484203,4.30615873015873,467,22,63,10,7,141,68,90,0.022000000000000002,0.794,0.184,0.9229,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,5,3,1,4,4,0,0,2,0,5,0,0,2,1,18,10,5,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,13,5,12,6,1,1,0,0,0,0,12,1,0,2,1,41,15,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2471001692212053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18121369556220135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26416423203306205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18046449793156846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20046529126653176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30286020550695264,0.0,0.0,0.615447843707301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038910817801064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2548070037184813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2363027574021506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335004805660271,0.0,0.0,0.1594627689966441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Could I teach one class while working full time?",8.224929577464792,10.272617690140848,8.063492957746481,62.54312676056338,62.23943661971831,10.75042253521127,39.55211267605634,10.793553405168565,5.121634366197184,340,18,46,9,5,109,48,71,0.0,0.922,0.078,0.4857,1,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,9,8,5,0,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,8,6,5,15,0,0,0,0,1,8,0,2,5,32,6,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15923734879008378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15898227233537066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19026907525061248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11316530677634955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42076548141310505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349298454219698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2156291222682972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12756229739560676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6045646031997304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12758898271724445,0.0,0.0,0.3483279501618463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2348939763567957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.289925569089567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,SydneyLou_Who,2020/03/27,"Virtual teaching demo interview Hi all! 

I am about to start my masters in education and join a teaching fellows program in June. The program will support me with a transitional teaching certificate and allow me to start teaching high school chemistry in September. 

I’ve had a series of interviews at my dream school over the last few weeks and they have moved along to a demo lesson.  Unfortunately, this demo lesson is now virtual and with basically zero teaching experience I’m nervous! 

I figured that most teachers on here have now been teaching remotely for a few days at least and might have some advice on how to prepare a virtual lesson! 

Any advice is much appreciated!",6.824166666666668,8.929467083333336,7.605,64.28666666666669,65.66666666666666,10.0,38.333333333333336,10.25414643259724,4.701583333333334,550,30,79,14,9,183,77,120,0.037000000000000005,0.853,0.11,0.8302,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,1,4,5,2,0,1,8,0,10,0,0,2,1,18,14,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,4,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,7,1,18,10,7,18,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,3,8,62,9,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4573207955758361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1591268453334351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15090952367137273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228895205342232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2472320159084683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19073981849529506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24823518227178365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24870312528826105,0.17201565003173805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4736374764520382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.331250354761901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2655384597708395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187699294794204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Any tips?",3.708679927667269,5.915655708860762,4.046871609403259,86.14962025316456,74.18987341772151,8.05858951175407,26.475587703435806,8.841846274778883,2.047541048824593,327,12,64,7,7,102,58,79,0.142,0.858,0.0,-0.8375,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,4,0,5,0,0,1,0,8,8,2,0,1,3,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,11,7,1,4,0,0,2,0,10,1,0,0,3,30,3,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18808492333738924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276030311648413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2420383588904381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2702475276908917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4645176491486617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20331924686407785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902257874803797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18374847734950067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5633421064094641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21953754301401845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20135464636060288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

My state is preparing for eLearning in the upcoming weeks, as many others are. I'm still waiting on instructions from my admin, which has me going insane! I'm sure many of you can relate. If you have started this new phase of education, what are your new expectations? How many times a week do you call/meet with each class? Are you expected to get through the same amount of material?

teaching,milkybqbes69,2020/03/28,"thoughts on becoming a secondary school teacher in Australia?? I'm currently in year 10, I'm living in Australia, and I've been thinking about taking education into a career pathway. Ever since I was young, I always struggled in math, and I was the top English student. However, My struggles in Mathematics have helped me discover the beauty in math, I'm doing higher-level mathematics, and I love it even though I'm just passing it. I feel like people should understand the concepts they're learning in math and its not just about getting an A grade. I know the real struggles in mathematics, and I know exactly how I could work with students to make them more confident and positive in mathematics. Next year I am required to take subjects that I would like to specialise in for my future pathway.

  
I also know what all my teachers lack when they teach this subject. Last year I crossed paths with a young math teacher who finished at my school with a very high ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank). He could have become anything he wanted, but he decided to do teaching, my mathematics teacher told me that he was passionate about numbers. (He's currently my mathematics teacher, and he inspires me, he's made me actually like math. He's legit the only decent math teacher in my school and he's quite popular)    


I would like to teach high school biology as well as mathematics since those subjects are my favourites. I also have a better chance of getting employed at my school since I've started this whole ""networking"" thing with my teachers. I've also tutored a couple students and I find it fun and they have learned a lot too.

Though like other countries, teachers don't get a high income, and many teachers go on strikes. My parents are telling me to go a pursue in different careers to do with mathematics and science such as (medicine etc.) and its something I'm not interested in. 

  
 It would be great if someone could give me a bit of insight into this stuff, (like what steps could I take towards becoming a teacher, or anything I should consider before making a choice)

teaching,DaniePants,2020/03/29,"Just a funny story to bring a smile to your face - tiny little kindergartener makes my day I’m a substitute, just finished getting my SPED certification and have been long-term subbing so I can get my foot in the door for a permanent position. After the teacher returned, i became a free floating sub. I have three kids, youngest is 5th grade, and I adore kids but I have to say that I am NOT built for classes that are younger than 2nd/3rd grade

I show up at my own kid’s elementary, ready for my 3rd grade assignment. I’m the first sub to show up, and they have 4 teachers out. So, with wild desperate eyes, she sent me to Kinder. Y’all. I was NOT PREPARED. I walked in, the admin that had been wrangling them quickly introduced me and left. Suddenly, i was food for a school of piranhas. HI HI HI WHATS YOUR NAME MY NAME IS BAXYDANEMILYLILYGAGEMADDY ARE YOU OUR NEW TEACHER FOREVER I LIKE YOUR HAIR YOURE SO PREEEEEETTY MOM?MOM?I MEAN TEACHER?

Right then, the announcements started and we did the fight song, then it was time for the pledge. They all tried really hard to not squirm out of their bodies while there was fresh teacher meat waiting to interrogate. I noticed one tiny bitty boy not standing for the pledge. I motioned for him to stand up, and he shook his head at me. I’ve always had an issue with forcing kids to stand because it’s clearly illegal. Teaching SPED high schoolers, I’ve learned to pick my battles. 

So, after announcements, I squatted in front of this young man and introduced myself. I thought maybe he was shy or concerned about a new person, so I took a moment to check in with him. I said, “are you feeling okay?” And he said, with a Very Serious Face, “I don’t stand for that because my mom says I am a young Black man in America.” I almost died. It was so hard not to squish him into a huge hug because it was soooo adorable. Go, you, young Black man in America! I said, “I respect that, and I bet your mom is awesome.” What i wanted to say is, “do you even know how adorable you are? Tell your mom i want to take you home and keep you.”",3.3511764705882365,5.228581386138616,3.8525334886429827,88.60559988351778,74.24752475247523,6.9311589982527675,27.22888759464182,7.724431198458867,1.4767541642399546,1616,62,331,22,34,507,215,404,0.077,0.7859999999999999,0.13699999999999998,0.978,0,0,0,0,1,0,56.0,2,14,4,1,13,12,2,1,20,1,29,9,7,3,2,45,51,22,1,2,9,3,4,1,0,0,0,7,2,9,12,18,1,2,5,3,3,8,6,4,0,3,18,14,62,9,47,33,2,52,0,0,3,1,54,19,0,3,22,207,74,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10579782273128632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08791309317953222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19321819528886272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11735844536686735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06813847809181135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965279679151213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0697838685670635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05342214164173748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986975100052448,0.12775796485188146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040033825443143,0.0,0.060045945470618436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892915425069896,0.0,0.10843210362437723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11162988849039207,0.10598018096065494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11027595519011768,0.0,0.09391066532939364,0.0,0.0,0.05806500648410285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11479403486947128,0.0,0.0,0.05161750201176075,0.10589366826833813,0.0,0.09350099854729964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07052526765900899,0.0,0.10614424925861624,0.11508883594289195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6187069681150514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.204083747139164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1202884653376289,0.0,0.0,0.07159429308647279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09225352370503337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06768504386826968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09022845333611296,0.301505165208307,0.25206234196567456,0.0,0.10692809846437196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07478287152373468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07943911228000644,0.0,0.0923467795902326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08387795273323344,0.06160804842967914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11738615102904408,0.07173253981724917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08717611219267545,0.1246356440633498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,banshee42,2020/03/29,"I hate my teaching job and looking for hope This is my 4th year as a teacher at a Title I high school that has a very diverse population. Many students are low SES, there are gangs and drugs. On the other spectrum there are many kids where Daddy pays thier way through and everything in between. I have many good kids. This seems to be the case for most of the high schools in my district. The amount of poor behaviors, apathy, disengagement, disrespect etc. from my students has me feeling completely drained emotionally, mentally and physically. I feel ready to quit, but I've worked so hard to get to the place where I am, I feel sad for letting go of my dream and idea of what it would be like when I got here. I knew teaching wouldn't be easy, but I expected much different battles.

 I've tried every trick in the book, have volunteered behavior specialist to come in and observe me and have diligently implemented their suggestions. The behavior specialists, my mentors and my colleagues are all out of ideas. It's not just my classroom, if anything I have less behavior problems than most, but it still feels like torture to me. I have called in ""sick"" a few times, just because I cant stand to see the faces of my students one more time without feeling like I'm going to fall apart. 

I didn't always used to feel that way. I found joy in just about every aspect of my job. I used to wake up feeling excited to go to work. I teach science, labs and experiments are my FAVORITE thing to do! Eventually the behaviors grew on me. It is harder and hard to let things go and let it roll off my back. So I looked for the minority of the class and was always able to find that 1 kid that was a joy to have. If I got up that day to teach, it would be for them. Its progressed to be that 1 kid didn't even feel enough to justify the effort to get out of bed. The amount of work I do that I put into making things relevant, fun, engaging all the while maintaining really deep rich content is hard! 

I try my best to have amazing engaging lessons with technology and life relevancy but at the end of the day dealing with the behaviors feels impossible. I feel so bad for the ""good kids"" or the kids that actually seem to care. I feel like I spend so much of my time policing behaviors so my classroom doesn't fall apart, that I never get to help the kids that need and actually want my help. Sometimes, I'll stop and help those kids. God forbid I stop circulating my classroom for literally 2 minutes to help one kid with an honest question. If I do, pencils are flying across the classroom. They break my rules. I stopped buying and replacing them, and tell them they have to figure out an alternative way to measure... which sucks because I teach science. Or they break my classroom scissors or shoot staples out of the stapler. Anther time they had a sharpie and colored some of my manipulatives. Maybe I would be more understanding if the kids were 5 or 6, but they are 14-16 years old. With the misbehaviors being so much I can't keep the kids that are following the rules physically safe -so now I choose to teach more book work and worksheets and less labs. I HATE THAT! I hate learning through book work. I hate teaching book work. And I hate grading book work. But I dont know what else to do? 

I spend 50-60 hours a week working. I never used to mind the hours because I love my content that I'm teaching but it feels like a slap in the face from the kids, and now I'm left feeling like what's the point of me trying to make things interactive and engaging anymore. I've always scored high on my evaluations and have stood out at my school for being a good teacher, but if I'm not getting that spark from my kids, and that's who I care about... what's the point? I can be the best teacher in the world, and if I dont have them engaging what good is it? Why should I work so hard? If they dont do the relevant engaging lessons, and they dont do the book work, why should I work 50 hours? I'll just do the book work and gain 20 hours a week back to my life.... but that option hurts my soul. It makes me feel so sad. I fight so hard not to be ""that"" teacher.

I really hate to say this, but I felt so relieved that school was canceled for the Coronavirus. Not because it's our way of keeping everyone safe, but because I don't want to teach those kids anymore. I'm grateful to go to distance learning. The kids that want to learn might have a chance since they dont have to be in a classroom with unpredicted projectiles flying around. 

I thought about maybe moving schools, but then when I talked with the perceived ""good school"" in the district, they have the similar problem but coupled with intense hover parents. I looked into the other school district, and I've heard nothing but horror stories. I used to be in middle school for a few years, but I was also an EA so my role was much different. The frequency of misbehavior is about the same in MS and HS, but the severity of the problems seems to be less... so maybe I need to go back to middle school? I've never taught elementary school before? Is that any easier? I feel like getting cussed out at by a 8 year old might be better than getting cussed at by a 16 year old that's a lot taller and stronger than me? But I also haven't been faced with an 8 year old either. I know elementary school has its own set of problems, but could someone please share your grade level and experience? Or is all of this because I'm still a newer teacher and it gets better, and I just have to grow a thicker skin? Do I need to leave the field entirely? Any advice would be appreciated!",4.310666061190894,5.427165374887892,4.921067151047287,84.91941193165694,70.58744394618834,8.156780382585003,28.912130328659817,8.506599889659798,1.94431895328376,4423,165,912,70,79,1418,398,1115,0.105,0.7340000000000001,0.161,0.9973,5,0,1,1,1,0,126.0,1,1,14,22,40,57,11,0,69,0,90,10,5,8,6,181,171,84,0,27,41,1,22,7,0,9,4,2,1,15,53,52,0,8,37,8,6,14,21,21,0,2,19,29,110,36,132,124,28,114,1,4,5,1,50,51,1,24,48,590,163,61,0.036067235278851965,0.0,0.07039283774184403,0.0,0.0,0.03524448488799968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05768591004352942,0.09003248711394707,0.0,0.0,0.04905391357563404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07153801168279111,0.0,0.0,0.029680261506885557,0.0321074860961072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320043289560214,0.030114634928417337,0.13191751117208048,0.0,0.03069056074490265,0.0,0.07570067650713784,0.06379707726271705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03682867977835939,0.0,0.07354590024402825,0.0,0.0,0.03106872958146568,0.0378158099820092,0.0,0.0,0.028796752552518,0.03990770982627083,0.0,0.046520765973861684,0.037183735865509805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07536516869336822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21135265566031305,0.0,0.041826542334112864,0.0,0.03012954702893404,0.04057078517155723,0.03194486513446797,0.03726709542276987,0.04022450127899472,0.023822068743484484,0.0,0.060776402579069924,0.03446378893635493,0.03241490543987608,0.07056135372511924,0.0,0.0,0.27355016784228997,0.15459864053871722,0.034630201965484816,0.0,0.032964799631810975,0.0,0.0,0.0395458618623358,0.0,0.0,0.13190549269072802,0.0,0.12298704587240845,0.1512574287675678,0.057692525714288574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16154579241433822,0.2136535668904982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967004301708964,0.11432104290220185,0.0,0.03582290271270186,0.14207584623352754,0.0,0.038610721326314025,0.08143103702171432,0.0,0.0,0.07158233149711954,0.06411643181040454,0.0,0.0,0.03964321853913455,0.0,0.0,0.03818999446264525,0.039187156661778806,0.11064357510773663,0.05095070982464064,0.1233444053157627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086218160673856,0.0,0.0,0.0306630736575409,0.0325520879980452,0.0,0.07222547884591654,0.10969954678899853,0.10870315681055873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036347290056811435,0.0765232739458656,0.03641762601861071,0.0,0.0,0.03833376319475446,0.10605427151694337,0.08023019385896979,0.08345182596472987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03460748498877312,0.0,0.15138598505255926,0.0,0.04888018410467148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040048396507639375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03768258434668411,0.03959099354869915,0.06819039059842145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13804589270136142,0.0,0.03625753329247466,0.040403557886875864,0.03836194432280322,0.0,0.0,0.046211188947948366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028682113126566988,0.0,0.4015216440399024,0.028740916876551774,0.09850276922173257,0.0,0.040745709734738934,0.0,0.029835189731191737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030559651409168918,0.0,0.03567141792760267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05760668136727659,0.0904614710310285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028989477514550725,0.031524353361462004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09584587395543737,0.0,0.0,0.028633356062133124,0.08412437974448599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07346185571651324,0.0,0.0,0.03754726390465395,0.0,0.12460204426489074,0.0,0.02975924637150018,0.06382016951193198,0.11451397029094999,0.05786192119720055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06509013987916427,0.0,0.0,0.03476752774652093,0.0,0.3150885221004383,0.0,0.0,0.10248451649024974,0.0,0.0,0.13935670205293313

teaching,Honest_Dictator,2020/03/30,"COVID19 can account Red for Ed as its victims You know who gets to keep their jobs: *teachers*.

At my child's school district, they only have to teach two, one hour class a week. So, they get a **much lighter workload** while they also keeping **full pay and benefits**. The fact they keep their jobs, benefits, and everything else while millions of Americans are losing theirs is going to be a major issue when teachers ask for pay increases again.

teaching,carelessannon,2020/03/30,"Middle school Science at home lessons I know we all have a lot on our plates right now which is why I’m thinking maybe there’s others in the same position as I am!

We are currently at home learning but my district has many families that are too rural for internet access and many with limited access. 
Therefore, we are asked to send home enrichment opportunities for those that are able. Most students (grades 6-8) have phones or their parents have phones and can get any messages I send. 

I have sent links to the PhET website with some worksheets and a few other websites with simulations and games. However, I want some things science related for students to do that don’t require the use of a computer.

What would you like them to know/do to support their kids (if they can)?

So far, 

1) Create a work space for your child and a designated work time where they are uninterrupted.

2) Sit down on Sundays and help them plan for the week.  

3) Talk to them about how best they learn and how you can support them

teaching,taylorgo20,2020/03/30,"Life Skills Curriculum Hi everyone, I have been asked to teach a life skills/social skills/ college prep class for 9th graders at my HS. My principal has asked me to find a curriculum for this class. Do any of you have this type of class at your school or teach this type of class? Any ideas or suggestions on curriculum I could use? 

What I’ve been doing now is coming up with my own lesson plans, and occasionally using a program called Habitudes which my school bought for this class. I haven’t loved the program and the curriculum it offers. I am fine creating my own lesson plans but my district wants me to follow some kind of social and emotional learning curriculum. 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated!",6.491742424242425,7.883957416666667,6.042121212121213,77.86651515151517,65.74242424242425,9.806060606060607,30.57575757575757,9.994966539143718,2.994766666666666,577,21,103,13,9,178,80,132,0.0,0.9079999999999999,0.092,0.8706,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,0,6,1,3,0,0,5,0,13,3,0,2,0,19,22,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,5,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,14,3,15,16,4,7,0,0,0,1,11,4,0,3,1,65,21,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3870975339443992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3547702858086205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19374996585678114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16344776222903468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15149524385381274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21343660128677533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18130864233796706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342269235760066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141980209118192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1975893071330957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680437731765645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171251480534857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394837638019788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3840623680520465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1934202399639418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3277560038439581,0.0,0.0,0.11191600077553868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13478878207373496,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,JM30000,2020/03/30,"Help a Teacher... Really need some advice. Need advice.


I was hired as a teacher a month before the school district closed due to the Corvus-19. 

I was also hired as an contract worker, using 1099 form and not W2 form, and paid when school is in session. 

After Spring Break, admin and teachers met to distribute laptops and (assume) train teachers on distance learning and the platform that will be used for online learning.  I wasn’t included.  I tried to connect with admin during the week with no replies.  Received a call end of the week telling me that he (admin) was very busy all week, etc., etc., but I can go in this week and collect any materials I might need.  And reason I wasn’t included was because Im a permanent sub.  Person who pays me said, no, I’m a teacher of records. Regardless, I was not paid the entire week because I didn’t attend the meetings. 

Later that day, I received a message saying admin was informed of my status and to download an app to join the team. 

My question is: Am I supposed to use my personal time to train myself on how the app works without pay? Or should admin provide me with the same training teachers received? 

Are teachers training themselves and getting paid? 

I really need some advice.",3.847922077922078,6.1997266926407,4.433333333333334,82.87000000000002,74.28138528138528,5.9584415584415575,30.48051948051948,6.868970318607317,1.9231610389610387,970,45,164,9,21,308,129,231,0.021,0.948,0.031,0.3036,0,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,19,0,18,0,0,5,1,39,33,16,0,6,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,2,5,13,0,0,6,1,5,5,8,0,0,0,14,2,19,0,22,15,8,26,0,0,0,0,18,6,0,6,14,109,24,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3478201099601855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09488160411600276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08068372336870143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446516727285491,0.0,0.10095947632614738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12115139423850665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07651721012937833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1050856281868668,0.0,0.26464453473905625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061987926037813626,0.0,0.06742956924869532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07952628229665352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12815863512909162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12586524124718165,0.0,0.0,0.09470254520091982,0.0,0.0,0.35189965735169104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2071951841660504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329112908648847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15201603761405358,0.12198841517231684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11286003996279192,0.0943524996253602,0.0,0.2401532880704733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10370231529322038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918375812566313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055322008975238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3074175780636436,0.0,0.09789583039881307,0.0,0.0,0.4758555335506875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11437104142929493,0.0,0.08637610233553497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,cheekyfish,2020/03/30,"Teaching Ancient Civilizations (Grade 6) looking for anti-racist/sexist/classist/etc resources/social justice pedagogy/curricular resources based in critical literacy and reflexivity...- HELP! Hi all,

As the title says, I am teaching a middle school (age 11-12) course on Ancient Civilizations at a pretty affluent (predominately white) school. I have always been committed to teaching through a lens of social justice, but am using this strange time we find ourselves in to dig in a bit more, and consider more concrete entry-points for infusing conversations (AND action) about race/gender/class/etc inequities into our curriculum. 

Selfishly, I have chosen to work at a school where I have a great deal of curricular freedom, is quite liberal and one that fully supports me to think ""outside the box"". I constantly struggle with the understanding that I am/have chosen myself over the needs of the most vulnerable in the community (that is, I chose to work with kids who have a ridiculous amount of privilege/support/etc instead of working with kids who need to be empowered to think differently about their realities, get the tools they need to be successful in the world and learn how to dream). That said, I have justified my decision by simultaneously understanding that with our current system, the students I am working with WILL be the ones creating/perpetuating/upholding the systematic barriers to success for their peers - and have committed myself to ensuring that in my class they are confronted with the realities of the 'status quo' and forced to question our role and responsibility in dismantling oppression and the fact that we continue to reproduce it.

Back to my question - while we frequently have conversations related to the thoughts above through the books we read and projects we undertake, I want to be more thoughtful in how to use my current curriculum to further these goals. I have spent a lot of time digging around online finding only a few ""one-off"" type lessons, but am curious to see if anyone who has worked in ethnic studies departments, ancient civilizations, etc might be able to either 1) point me to more resources or 2) know enough about these topics to think of possible ""entry points"" for more of this work. 

**Approach to Class:**

Currently, I approach my class as explorers jumping continent to continent exploring ancient life and looking for connections to our current realities. Ultimately, I don't care if they know when Homo Erectus first roamed the earth, but do care that they have an appreciation and respect for other cultures and see the interconnectedness of humanity. For instance, as students study Ancient Egypt and consider how the Nile River affected civilization, we look today to see how water affects communities, etc. This has led us to talk about Flint, Michigan and South Sudan where we have had conversation and action related to poverty, educational inequities, gender inequities, disability, forced migration etc. 

**Current Curriculum:** 

Right now, we start off the year with ""the rise of man"", learn about hominids and our move from hunter-gatherer to communities. Naturally, we do the Fertile Crescent and then move to Ancient Egypt and Ancient India (where we have looked at poverty, class divides, religion/mindfulness, and ethical consumerism). I am open to other cultures/communities but this is where I have been the last few years.

**Goals for Class:**

Finally, I am very interested in encouraging my students to act in meaningful (and ethical) ways, but recognize the struggle of being ""white saviors"" and/or the difficulty for students to move beyond the ""I feel so bad about X!"" to seeing those they feel driven to help as equals, when their primary experience engaging with them involves a kind of charity/resource support (we have moved to more ""teach-in"" experiences hosted by the students (and through expert panels, etc) or community events focused on educating the public to combat this, but still would be very open to hearing suggestions/critiques!) At the end of the day, I want them to really dig in to consider the STRUCTURES that create and perpetuate inequality (and their role in it), but also want them to think about what they can do themselves to help (as in my experience, middle school students are primed to want to do something about injustice, and some sort of action is very effective in building community, skills and confidence in themselves) - and DOUBLE bonus points for it somehow tying into Ancient Civilizations! 

**All of this to say:**

1) Any support/guidance/resources/etc would be greatly, greatly appreciated!  
2) Any resources/thoughts on where I, as a white educator myself, need to be aware/sensitive/etc when navigating these topics ethically - greatly appreciated!  
3) Other thoughts/feelings/critiques - greatly appreciated!

I am happy to adapt materials to be more age-appropriate for my students if the resources/sources you have in mind are a bit advanced.

teaching,Shadrach77,2020/03/31,"Time management app for the daily routine? Can anyone recommend a time management / workflow app or Chrome/Firefox addon? (PC preferred)

While working from home I find myself filling my time inefficiently. When I sit down at the computer with my coffee I have a general plan where I start with today's assignments, check emails, move on to grading yesterday's assignments, attending whatever meeting(s), and fill in any gaps with the trillion little things that educators need to do (there's *always* something more that can be done, right?). It's not that I'm unfocused, but I feel like my focus changes rapidly throughout the day without any rhyme or reason.

I am looking for something a little beyond a checklist of tasks to be done. Something highly visual like [the suggested apps on this page](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/5-task-apps-for-visual-thinkers.html), but more focused on a daily routine.

teaching,CoreValues492,2020/03/31,"EdTPA anxiety Hi all.

A couple things:

I just submitted my edTPA last week and gotta wait to get scores back. Unfortunately, I realized I made some minor errors after I’d submitted. 

1.) left my name on my lesson plans. Not students, CT, school, or district - just my name
2.) Forgot to include ONE instructional material that was briefly referenced in my commentary.

I followed all of the rubrics and used bolded language so I’m not really worried about content, just don’t want to fail on account of a few minor things I forgot.

Sorry if this has been asked before.

For someone who was planning on being on maternity leave during this time, is your district still counting this as “leave”? Or can you switch it, agree to work from home, and take your maternity leave once school is back in session?
Obviously all of this would be done to maximize time with your baby.",6.2936363636363675,8.327976242424246,6.185272727272729,74.22790909090911,66.87878787878788,8.916363636363636,29.86666666666667,9.3871,2.8250703030303037,296,11,49,6,5,93,51,66,0.094,0.87,0.036000000000000004,0.1926,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,4,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,2,7,12,4,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,6,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,10,6,1,7,0,0,0,0,6,3,0,2,4,36,10,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17094248959397007,0.0,0.0,0.14060235590425604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15559408747922818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871216859788208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18341605797780625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7744579694900473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19473204208732545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850565844445848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15493040724199486,0.0,0.0,0.20468850561484253,0.0,0.0,0.1460263156243692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748239238300955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2132456329145655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1331188642410706,0.0,0.0,0.12989323457293594,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Beautyiscelestial92,2020/04/01,"What can I do with an educational studies degree?  So I am almost done with an MEd and have been teaching for eight years. I have an undergrad in sociology and only worked once in the career because I enjoyed teaching so much, but it seems like now I have found another career path, and that is working and teaching online from home. I started with Online ESL and then found other opportunities. I plan to leave classroom teaching for good this year, but I am unsure of what to do  
My MEd program leads to certification, and the only class I have left is student teaching. However, I no longer desire to be in the classroom so I can finish the degree with the last class that I am in now without student teaching and possibly take the Florida teaching exam  
I have also gotten advice from some teachers to switch to educational studies but do not know what to do with it",8.751341463414633,7.637722548780491,9.025731707317076,66.86530487804879,61.3170731707317,10.639024390243904,38.79268292682927,9.516144504307137,3.772173170731707,694,30,117,10,8,231,87,164,0.04,0.862,0.098,0.8909999999999999,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,5,6,4,0,0,9,0,19,0,0,1,0,25,26,15,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,9,12,0,0,4,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,5,0,14,4,22,20,2,14,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,9,95,23,23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1729108278010716,0.0,0.0,0.17718713447838375,0.0,0.0,0.14150467072766074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18554464463287976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10786541559011437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810784956215718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3880271045216232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14841497784617588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774925427682353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724559397142016,0.14423564478024475,0.0,0.1873616135187928,0.19225373045147148,0.0,0.0,0.08644749990390371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3930970620105945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13007660587258382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18844307139515928,0.0,0.2691527501667244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1994814641098364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16108615216397493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12524419096043687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330423283487716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17057085732283078,0.0,0.2576394451507199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22789648544231714

teaching,M_Guerre,2020/04/01,"Online Teaching Struggles- Anyone else feel this way? I just need to vent real quick. My district is making it impossible for us to hold students accountable for their online work. We can't give failing grades (at all), and we can't knock off points for late work. I have about 100 students in my Spanish one classes (high schoolers). Week 1, I had 40 kids turn in their work (easy review stuff). I was like okay, not bad for week one, everyone is just figuring out how this works. Week two comes, and oh god, we now have 29 submissions. I feel like I'm not teaching anymore but hunting down kids. Emails, phone calls home, etc... Plus, my district already had laptops issued to every kid before this all happened. Anyone else having issues with assignments like this? I feel like nobody at my school wants to talk about it, or it's the teacher's fault if the students don't do their work. But if I was a student, I wouldn't care about doing my work if I knew I couldn't be failed or penalized for it being late. How else would you explain less and less students doing their work each week?",4.308928571428574,5.8843204047619055,4.250654761904766,87.96455357142858,71.14285714285714,6.583333333333332,26.458333333333336,6.9077264865688965,1.10897619047619,855,28,166,7,16,262,124,210,0.042,0.858,0.1,0.8453,0,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,4,1,4,9,9,11,0,1,3,1,20,0,0,3,2,40,34,13,0,8,11,0,3,4,0,2,0,0,1,3,9,11,0,1,6,0,1,1,7,5,0,3,5,3,24,6,21,24,6,19,0,2,0,0,18,9,0,5,12,104,33,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11405716123162055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10250249839800622,0.14453941457929145,0.2118031842747801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08629888491153563,0.0,0.0,0.08794930358247714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10553918402767327,0.0,0.10537948070699447,0.0,0.0,0.08903301417638795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25902485462638764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152705192924056,0.0,0.0,0.08708283836041103,0.0987621653758582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1567814088284131,0.1476767062376139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09914957548176974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09139836722536077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920248076319987,0.10367562692345132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2157559778683967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23318268531423295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20198028849482852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06899168573043336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07663800101095121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400749300972983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09770589423238783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1176430397756903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10460293182686584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1080513117516326,0.11831918394251878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08307454463985567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11242287585841768,0.1009648959840376,0.0,0.12432589933343882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609627121700853,0.08204007757683507,0.3316274157084713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5267165427271664,0.0,0.0,0.07342193849294029,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,hammnbubbly,2020/04/01,"Anyone have solution(s) for students/parents wanting miracles at the end of the marking period? The third marking period is quickly coming to an end. As is the case with every marking period, myself and my colleagues are tasked with tracking down (and documenting our efforts, or else) every student with late/missing work. Last week, I posted a video about submitting late work, as well as emailed every one of my students about submitting work. This week, I emailed every parent. Today, I got an email from a frantic parent asking me to respond as soon as I can with every assignment their child is missing, so it can be turned in by my deadline of Friday (knowing full well I’ll be getting work into next week). The email got me thinking about the mechanisms in place to help students/parents monitor school work:

1. Basic, common sense/knowledge that assignments must be completed to receive points

2. Posted videos on class website 

3. Emailed EVERY kid

4. Emailed EVERY parent

5. Parents/students have access to online grade book 

6. Parents/students have access to class website

7. A parent can ask their child about work and rely on them to be honest or face consequences

I know not every one of these is in play for all families, but, at least in my district, those mechanisms listed above are very much a reality for just about every student. So, with that said, how is it, that somehow, if I don’t respond “as soon as [I] can...”, the parent won’t have any clue what is missing from their child and the work may not be in on time? Does anyone have any remedies for this? I know distance learning has thrown a wrench into things for a lot of people, but this was happening long before distance learning. I touch base with everyone two and three times in every way I can. It’s so exhausting.

teaching,cookie058,2020/04/02,"Question about EdTPA Early Childhood I am in a Master's program for early childhood education and special education in NY state. I am in my second semester and close to my first fieldwork/practicum experience. Apparently for the EdTPA, you have to take in mind student interests, IEPs, academic levels, and pre-knowledge information before creating the lesson plans for the EdTPA. Is practicum enough time to get to understand a group of students and do the EdTPA with if I am not a classroom teacher yet?

My school requires 100 hours of general education practicum in one grade level for next semester, and for my last semester in 2021, 200 hours of special education in two separate grade levels that are different grade levels from the general ed practicum. So overall, I will be in three different classes.

This might change of course, if COVID-19 affects us still for another year, hopefully not.

Sorry if this seems like common sense, becoming a certified teacher and completing a master's program is confusing.",9.683103448275864,10.478758229885061,9.235080459770113,59.8429655172414,58.6551724137931,12.707126436781607,44.98620689655172,12.161744961471696,6.249969655172412,828,48,114,25,10,266,105,174,0.011000000000000001,0.895,0.094,0.9026,3,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,1,0,6,4,6,0,1,10,0,11,0,0,1,0,26,16,10,0,4,5,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,1,5,0,0,0,2,1,0,5,0,0,10,5,25,13,1,28,0,0,0,0,5,13,0,8,15,79,13,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18549086130009929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19536771445331147,0.15052545194369898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871324937170389,0.0,0.18547207186836406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3696373022531541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827808370061498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17303821437991898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15046763218815445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09242084964616558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17569762460792446,0.3484138191925541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14419383557741175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0864224415969686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18765868259389865,0.17861451476015958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18813088403112904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11986929571935108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19816398473806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17902817812660884,0.0,0.16103945854937174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19802056951211452,0.0,0.0,0.14126935998108428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300376372280984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314946984656567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17280167072833758,0.1841549561598048,0.21278408609481347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139152128470269

teaching,LearnCookFun,2020/04/02,"Cooking videos/activities to help students Hi, my kids and I have made free cooking videos/activities to help families find creative and engaging ways to have fun together at home. These are difficult times and it's hard to find energy to come up with fun things to do after work/online schooling. My kids have had a lot of fun co-staring in the videos. Educator friends have asked to share with their community (yes, of course :-) and been really excited about the emotional and educational benefits to students. Here’s how it works. Watch a short video highlighting a particular skill - like how to properly crack an egg - then help your kiddo practice what they’ve learned while making a YUMMY, kid-approved recipe. We hope this is helpful for families.

teaching,alloutofllamas,2020/04/02,"References in Job Applications I'm applying to teaching jobs at the moment but am getting caught up on the references part. Every school district is requiring surveys to be completed by references rather than submitting a letter. This makes applying very difficult as I have to ask 2 or 3 people to submit references for me every time I want to apply to a job. And I can't submit my application until all of them complete their survey. It's making me think twice about applying to positions because I don't want to ask my references over and over again to fill out the same survey. This will also be my first official teaching job so I don't have a lot of references to spread the load with. 
Any advice on what to do about this? It's frustrating that they no longer take letters.",5.903154362416108,7.035125389261748,6.772677852348995,73.04438590604029,66.91946308724832,10.792214765100672,32.3496644295302,10.793553405168565,3.8249377181208057,629,26,109,18,10,209,96,149,0.073,0.9059999999999999,0.021,-0.8569,4,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,3,2,6,2,1,0,7,0,11,0,0,2,1,22,22,8,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,1,7,0,0,2,4,2,0,2,1,0,13,0,29,18,4,15,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,2,5,82,20,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15751991191233758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12890923924006176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10961953579324736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30139500229286864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826423815222288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3380241235580085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716309689594447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13711414603258432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421881630325467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6398528784141905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13704398509004548,0.0,0.0,0.21520059288309412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17456071908262918,0.0,0.11175375225415872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16314004150011374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1212001359811946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10328857408430804,0.0,0.0,0.09399530826696352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13300446529188334,0.19015641760115276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have all the time in the world right now and I was wondering if there was anything I could be prepping for now that I won’t have time at the beginning of the year for.

teaching,gandalfthepinkish,2020/04/03,"Free tutoring for anyone who needs help! Hello! In light of the current situation, I realize how students (like me) are suffering worldwide. I am a grad student majoring in MechE, unable to go to my lab to work. It occurred to me that I could help out a lot of fellow students in my downtime, over Zoom or whatever-- anyone from high school all the way up to senior year. 

Why do I want to do this? 

a) I want to contribute in our fight against this lockdown, b) will end up learning a lot and gain valuable teaching experience, c) not waste my time playing NBA 2K and this will also be a good change from reading long research papers. 

I figured this is a good place to reach out to a lot of people and please feel free to share (upvote, so others see it) this where ever appropriate.

I want to make sure that I'm protected when I look for a job with another district.",3.0947505668934236,5.301393214285717,4.670952380952382,80.96849206349209,76.04081632653063,6.804535147392291,29.256235827664398,7.793537801064563,2.143479365079366,397,18,71,6,9,133,63,98,0.203,0.693,0.10400000000000001,-0.8767,2,0,0,0,1,0,15.0,0,0,1,0,3,6,1,0,4,0,6,1,0,1,1,14,15,7,0,6,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,6,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,13,1,13,13,0,4,0,3,2,0,5,1,0,1,3,46,16,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3707394813406931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2430616776216791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935426541022056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366929052378358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2372563087194039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22674410148862875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23002494398002865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2454418891684485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3893059045319353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1547277694368964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21846800769207075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2197185429820546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4101635308531077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646635047465493,0.0,0.0,0.14927108832835095

teaching,Daigina,2020/04/04,"Advice for a JHS/SHS theater group? Hi guys! Sorry if there’s a better place for this, let me know. I’m just kind of at a loss right now. 

So I work abroad, in Japan. I’m in a new position as an English teacher and one of my duties is to lead the English club, which puts on a play every year. When I came, they were in the middle of doing a pretty well known Halloween/centric Disney movie, no changes to plot or characters, re-written by the kids to cut down on time and match their English level. We even used music from the movie. No one questioned a thing. And everything seemed pretty cool. This coming year, they wanted to try their hand at High School Musical- a little bit of a challenge for my first time being truly in charge, but whatever.

But a senior music teacher stopped me and told me if I didn’t get permission from the Disney company to perform the show, especially because of the music, we couldn’t do it. I had assumed, because of the previous play, that this was the kind of thing that licensing wasn’t really a concern for- we make exactly $0 and perform only twice for a 50-ish person audience of parents, friends, and prospective students at what is basically an open house for the school where ALL clubs perform or put on a show of some kind, and no one pays to attend. Anyway after a lot of back I forth in emails with me and someone from Disney, we find we can’t do the play. Now the kids were told to choose again, and they want to do Sound of Music. Again, either the script has to be written by the kids or in extremely simple English. No one knows what the “rules” are with copyright or whether we “can” do what we want- which is to perform our own version of the play with most songs as-is, and I can’t find any sources that would help me on any account to this weird roadblock I didn’t know I would have. Is there anyone here who maybe has some experience or advice on my options?",5.381442066924651,5.521575348167541,5.714616435237879,83.67350899157752,67.7696335078534,8.318870931026634,29.697700887776012,7.893859768569023,1.8163456407921696,1501,50,303,16,23,480,202,382,0.051,0.852,0.098,0.9490000000000001,2,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,8,0,5,10,15,15,1,0,32,1,29,1,1,3,2,63,46,23,0,8,12,1,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,5,16,23,0,2,10,9,2,6,10,3,1,6,11,4,29,12,54,29,9,44,0,1,0,0,28,23,0,15,15,212,45,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20826967520764314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449367564957613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07451326452341607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194249961550902,0.0,0.12992300919949293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09424876404724428,0.11634222111252727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12188285202682675,0.0,0.0,0.11273245509060127,0.09179697532264314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038568638109054,0.0,0.0897862578049886,0.0,0.0957744431405792,0.10424177193426608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1947983673025662,0.09064478996303643,0.0,0.0,0.08233244995399723,0.0,0.055676216755417035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10551686705889897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142878966784573,0.11259258741853773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12296259138296547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3329155536341673,0.1756972816222603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897072040599314,0.0,0.0,0.10680689789095944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09059840726596206,0.0,0.0,0.07113347931720085,0.0,0.10705963989791524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10292188521914898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888468961859047,0.0810480705160909,0.0,0.0,0.118328676950999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09304912038249613,0.11133854882272252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21683139940470544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21425606606681166,0.11937805170189895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826876136601745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910065857564673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2157004980773411,0.0,0.09701347514869778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029283154048152,0.0,0.0,0.11929165542620646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08909375585196333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14159512546520708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427871553595946,0.0,0.0,0.2036563210104781,0.0,0.072351163020489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203861033763157,0.0,0.0,0.1885657574253908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581542572977657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07758115012894133,0.0,0.0,0.15140253170861476,0.0,0.0,0.13724972463448185

So I need help: do you know any app/platform that allows a teacher to, for example, register 16 questions and, at random, show 10 out of the 16 to each student?",5.6725714285714295,6.698090542857145,6.667619047619053,73.97571428571432,67.3809523809524,9.428571428571429,35.0,9.606745405546679,3.5498571428571424,437,21,75,9,7,146,72,105,0.043,0.899,0.057999999999999996,0.3479,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,2,4,1,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1,0,15,10,6,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,6,0,0,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,3,0,17,8,1,10,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,2,4,45,5,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18110669675800925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265316112411993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26369861872616224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35701729396833803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14636247824362775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2351653927954222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5924185994925454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29833929131386416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2981233772216605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2601558908450957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21362579766321488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,FunctionalERP_92,2020/04/04,"Delete if not allowed - I am a hiking guide and videographer, and would LOVE to offer free help to any teachers right now who could use nature/outdoors/environment videos for their students. I can work a lot of themes in, personalize to your class, or keep general. More info in comments. Hey teachers of Reddit - first off, thank you all for the work you do, have done, and continue to do.  I can't imagine how challenging and stressful this time must be for you and your students as well as their families.  

I'm out of work right now as a hiking guide/wedding videographer/drone pilot/aspiring documentary maker, but should be okay if things get back to normal by summer.  BUT, I have been searching for a way to help and be of service in this time, as I'm self quarantining.  So this has come to mind and I thought it could help:

\-I can help create videos for your students, either as something fun, educational, exciting, etc. 

\-I currently have access to a river, small waterfall, forest areas going through spring changes soon, as well as farmland areas.

\-I also have a backlog of lots of footage from around the United States (national parks, coastline, mountains, etc), and around the world (Spain, South Africa)

\-I can make them personalized to your class, or more general.  I can work in questions or topics into the captions, or a sort of quiz at parts during.  I also know basic spanish, so can work that in as well depending on student skill level.

If this would be of help to any teacher, please comment or send me a direct message.  As I noted in the title, I would not ask for nor accept any money for this - I just want to help in some way.

And again - thank you all for the work that you do. Stay strong, stay safe, stay healthy.",7.910823529411764,7.346927861538464,7.332959276018101,76.5395113122172,62.69230769230769,9.985520361990949,34.1945701357466,9.168548406835145,2.892793665158371,1365,49,250,19,17,426,179,325,0.018000000000000002,0.7809999999999999,0.201,0.9962,2,0,1,0,0,0,66.0,0,9,3,10,16,15,0,1,14,1,28,1,0,6,3,60,43,34,0,12,14,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,3,10,14,0,2,6,2,2,3,4,1,3,1,3,0,27,15,53,29,11,44,0,0,0,1,31,23,0,14,12,180,37,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15212072540515695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19403655705846867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16933819964668048,0.08891609835835487,0.0,0.0,0.07313461349892639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10061499918261904,0.08192984522187235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1518770488078036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733174165763947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2121481765305946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966233981639668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090150667533857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04969165710828773,0.0,0.054053865780599585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3825060462811623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08453917178414222,0.0,0.0,0.05227060782275685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16172021918063134,0.08584153801124933,0.0,0.06348743986463319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603516150311962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09318874574539136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10299612103304913,0.0,0.0,0.1660947978770456,0.0,0.10440349564727988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10654626979210187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1624488270771868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09922168600140913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07322122000206924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3041275345020152,0.0,0.0,0.10894951588975728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1751311606379847,0.0,0.0,0.06318763048979502,0.0,0.0,0.07550763941609026,0.11092016803872487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08214550722281087,0.0,0.0,0.056099028193131256,0.15098962828651674,0.0,0.0,0.25654907383333064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4154523566724413,0.0,0.0,0.20269272400569,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Some_Guy_You_Met,2020/04/04,"COVID closure policies - no penalties? I want to run something by the other teachers here:

In the interest of being flexible with students during this extended distance-learning experience, my district has issued a directive that (high school) students be allowed to submit work late (up to the date marking period grades are due) with no penalties.

In short, if an essay or project was due *this* week, and students had a lot of time to work on it, they can hand it in a week or so later, and there will be no points taken off, or anything else punitive.

I totally get the sentiment behind the policy. Yes, this has been a stressful time for the students. It's been stressful for everyone. And of *course* we want to be flexible. I have offered several extensions and alternative assignments to accommodate student concerns over the past few weeks.

But this policy also is letting students who would have *always* been late or negligent do so with no consequence.

I know I should not be the arbiter of what is a ""legitimate"" reason to be late or not, but this seems pretty fucked.

Am I missing something?",6.999778554778551,8.240786833333335,7.15606060606061,70.88486013986017,64.50505050505049,10.132711732711735,37.95804195804196,10.214889679676881,4.2947664335664335,875,45,138,20,13,282,124,198,0.10800000000000001,0.8170000000000001,0.075,-0.8253,1,0,2,0,0,1,34.0,1,0,1,2,5,5,1,2,14,1,25,2,1,2,1,28,33,15,0,5,10,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,12,8,0,0,3,0,0,1,6,4,0,0,6,1,9,1,25,17,3,25,0,1,0,1,4,10,1,8,14,111,21,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11634441763935373,0.12105529494684335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11972187793506645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12153417013526165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139017290371952,0.0,0.14231238790891335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13449867194153425,0.07600998341810693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537130430445804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15184869282011085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07995483075164893,0.0,0.4923407402623266,0.0,0.0,0.14876841735682084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12368626741009052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13888203258561901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13753048667840695,0.0,0.0,0.14801069499458244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14958295924907494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14723873349872418,0.0,0.13244421167801404,0.0,0.1643568027899072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22400314427359289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33330548337902194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16966711564849296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17162181544638574,0.0,0.3500982226042347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2118298360954904,0.0,0.0,0.10334847260892176,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Wolfy743,2020/04/04,"I’m a student teacher just looking for resources Hello! I’m a student teacher graduating in May and frankly this isn’t how I expected my learning to be going at this time. I’ve been given instruction to help out my cooperating teacher come up with ideas on what to do in the classroom, but being that I don’t have access to the kids online abilities there’s only so much that I can do. I’ve been looking online at different resources and little writing/reading ideas that kids could do from home, but I was wondering if any of you guys had specific resources you could guide me to. All my local bookstores are closed so that’s out. As well as my CT being new to this situation, she’s also trying to figure things out for her students that abide by the district. I ask what she needs and sometimes she isn’t even sure. 

I’m currently with 7th grade ELAR students. I didn’t think I could miss these kids so much since they’ve driven me to rethink this teaching thing all together. I just want to bring some fun and entertaining ideas to the table and thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask you all.",5.935747863247862,6.210099398148153,6.295555555555558,79.52038461538464,66.5925925925926,8.868376068376067,32.81908831908832,8.617729084823388,2.5515182336182334,874,35,167,12,13,282,125,216,0.031,0.873,0.096,0.9098,2,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,3,0,1,10,6,0,0,6,0,22,0,0,1,4,40,40,15,0,8,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,4,15,12,0,0,9,1,0,4,5,2,1,0,8,2,21,4,29,24,6,19,0,2,2,0,15,12,0,4,3,117,36,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11692049055381205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994247578744884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27336482416846064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12594309774458212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3501995997556227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15275363581245632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656735800451367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309195852918759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.144766437619465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09799846898327702,0.0,0.14665604367254936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.156516018372689,0.4951446612023636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1465363268625983,0.0,0.0,0.2455516049640288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21495573948181268,0.10840953034735494,0.0,0.1412061890345813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11119587580245684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14624507157176542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12094270564526798,0.16434111483532995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446009841813417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377969594028625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1942648836080134,0.09368258490806423,0.0,0.11607084067705005,0.08525360646853272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0992639415862757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623579566115692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13145630872597408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15855363485713608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,PinusBanksianaSavage,2020/04/04,"Can anyone out there give me a heads up on what's going on with the AP Calc exam this year? Or resources? I have a weird situation. (Also Posted in r/mathteachers, r/calculus, and r/matheducation - sorry if this is frowned upon.) Here's the story - this is my first year teaching Calc and my first year at a new district.  This is my second year teaching overall.  My   predecessor  who taught for 25 years in the district never took the time   to set the  class up as an official AP class because he didn't want to   deal with the  College Board.  I work at a small rural district and   there are only two  math teachers in the department.

Fast    forward to this year.  I have two students who elected to take the AP exam last fall.  I did my best to prepare them based off of the   publicly  available information.  I've been in discussions with my   principal  (who's also new) all year about getting the class set up as   an official  AP course, despite my school's guidance counselor putting   up resistance  because, in her words ""We don't typically have students   take the AP Calc  exam.""  Well yeah, it wasn't an AP class, so why would   they?  But  that's a different story, but still a huge source of   frustration for me.

Anyway,  now   things are changing by the minute and I find that I can't access a  lot   of the AP materials because I haven't been able to get my course    audited.  Our AP Lit teacher is getting constant email updates, for    example, and I'm sure similar emails are being sent out to AP Calc    teachers across the country.

teaching,dovagolda,2020/04/05,"I'm a nanny looking for any information to help out the kids I babysit who aren't getting the proper schooling in our district. Last week the 2nd grader I've been babysitting since she was 6 months old didn't get her weekly packet from her school since the shut-downs. I spent the week making an impromptu packet for her, but without actually knowing what I'm doing, I feel very lost in what to do next. What I want to know is: 

1. How to create a small lesson plan that I can carry from one week to the next, even if she continues to get homework from school.
2. Where to find what exactly 2nd and 3rd graders are learning. 
3. What are some things I can teach 2nd and 3rd graders that are NOT usually covered by the normal curriculum? And by this question, I'm looking for opinions from anyone on what you might have learned on your own at 7, 8, 9 years old, or wish you had learned in school at that age. My areas of expertise are history and psychology, and have found it extremely fun writing history for kids! One thing I'm planning on doing is writing some short stories about Greek Mythology, which I did in 2nd grade and found it incredibly interesting. 

Anything you guys can think of would be so appreciated, thank you in advance!!!",7.072519230769231,6.654942008333336,6.999166666666667,77.76403846153849,64.33333333333334,10.051282051282053,35.128205128205124,9.466822959209583,3.0746858974358977,982,40,190,16,13,313,146,240,0.013999999999999999,0.867,0.11900000000000001,0.9792,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,5,0,5,5,4,0,0,10,0,23,0,0,2,1,38,44,11,0,5,5,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,16,7,0,0,13,0,1,1,4,1,0,2,9,3,19,3,32,32,3,30,0,1,2,0,20,15,0,7,14,119,35,10,0.0,0.0,0.11521975510978255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08029197416488372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08255762381753369,0.0,0.09716194351928607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798443747640242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059699981532435414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10791427828921088,0.0,0.0,0.2589163707872567,0.0,0.0,0.1850608554547782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11690833669374068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914015289568464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977689430831066,0.09624319860516296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1982989302001253,0.0,0.12888787473202906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07881296120714572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12525411912752454,0.0,0.0,0.09424272945205517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511385866541055,0.0,0.115684000158675,0.0,0.0,0.24779021111178395,0.0,0.16001522379068672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13226595757830886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.477974510751106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19533823978449316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870343330077233,0.0,0.0,0.15688155897235587,0.0756547951228946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13003795115676575,0.09742051007378848,0.06964102729879977,0.0,0.3788360636900409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13577522327803868,0.11381572788464127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08387388029344786,0.0,0.0,0.07603351703825044
teaching,TriofoxAccess,2020/04/05,"Transform Collaboration with Triofox Secure File Sharing! Files have always proven to be a vector for the spread of malware. According to Verizon’s yearly Data Breach Investigations Report, 92 percent of all malware spread via email attachments. That makes providing access to a secure file sharing tool critical for your data security and your employees’ productivity.

However, secure file sharing does more than keep your network safe. It’s also a powerful tool for fostering a culture of collaboration within your organization. Support your workers’ ability to collaborate with an ecosystem that eliminates the physical limitations of the office and delivers the files – and sharing capabilities – required.

teaching,YourEmperor1871,2020/04/05,"(California Student Teacher) Should I take the CBEST if I already meet Basic Standards Requirements? Apologies for any formatting issues, I posting on mobile.

I am a student teacher in California. I was admitted to the program I am in using my SAT/ACT/AP scores as proof that I meet Basic Standards Requirements (BSR) for my credential and admittance into the program.

I have just submitted my EdTPA tonight (Yay!) and now the big stress on top of the pandemic and student teaching is applying for jobs.

As mentioned, I did not take the CBEST. My last semester of college was packed, and I was never told it was necessary. My undergrad advisor (it was a pre-credential program for my subject area) made no mention of it. The only question at the time was how to get my score reports (SAT/AP/ACT) to the program. Ultimately, since the program was also a part of my undergrad school, I ended up just being requested to screen shot my school’s test record on my student page and submitting that for BSR.

The issue has now come up in the past few months that many schools request CBEST scores during the hiring process, and I want to know how important those are. Most importantly I want to know if it will affect my ability to be hired. As I understand, the CBEST scores are pretty much meaningless and all that matters is that you’ve passed. I don’t see how it could be such a major issue. I will have a credential, but could the hiring process hit a wall if I don’t have a CBEST score to give?

I can take and pass the test no problem, but the next date isn’t until July. On top of that, the hiring season is starting now, and I have an awesome school I need to apply to by Friday. Oh yeah and there’s a MASSIVE pandemic. I know for a fact Pearson has already postponed some CSET exams.

TL:DR: I haven’t taken the CBEST, but I will be a credentialed teacher. How much does this affect my ability to be hired?",4.9040410815342685,6.167225760217987,5.701920980926431,79.32368843009853,69.32697547683925,8.806916788933137,32.09903584154265,9.162432508145574,2.887408383986585,1502,66,276,29,26,491,176,367,0.040999999999999995,0.88,0.08,0.8529,1,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,0,0,4,12,3,0,1,30,2,37,0,0,8,4,53,58,25,0,10,9,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,13,12,0,2,6,0,0,3,8,2,0,0,11,2,35,1,38,35,9,35,0,0,2,0,11,16,0,6,15,192,48,29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2656092748978593,0.09624053231941586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183930445592731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036672931449621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19217273629789575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053154638435068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10659070206548632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06287573924195043,0.11544670481787532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3768293999540821,0.11942468590248788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19841679461322126,0.0980979296422013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11387415258340662,0.0,0.1220118023067242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960589088586336,0.0,0.17693609302230934,0.08923492246489842,0.0928181381763458,0.0,0.12798917617600208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152844149269768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130322827328821,0.11488373070958005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11525805710051967,0.12243499399688465,0.0,0.11515472485449868,0.0,0.0,0.13481489381712305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4871856983763243,0.0959000607760262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09955133027853616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08518141165209492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13785576393021118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714553046650227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0701746326056111,0.0,0.0,0.11499561645039308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12528427349398524,0.0,0.10394017411783564,0.0,0.0,0.14196620010926775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm a spanish and technologically impeded teacher in Mexico and I work in an very poor región. I'm talking 120 US dolars a month per house, poor. Even though, my students manage, (there are worse regions in the world, I know). I made a little investigation and I found out that; though many of the don't have acces to internet (only 18.1% of them have acces to it), 47.9% of them have a smartphone. That got me thinking. Even if they don't have textbooks, mobile data and a lot of different tools to learn; there may be a way to make things still work.

Is there a way to have like a local wifi network, without internet? I only need the wifi to pass on files, digital tools and lessons to their phones. I usually handle 30 to 33 per lesson, so around half of them need acces to the network.

I really hope you guys can help me out.",2.665471311475411,4.553387989071041,3.959149590163936,87.04888831967216,76.21311475409837,6.760792349726777,24.005806010928964,7.645422480735847,1.0981150273224047,714,23,147,10,16,234,108,183,0.055999999999999994,0.879,0.065,0.1278,1,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,1,1,5,4,12,2,0,0,14,0,12,0,0,2,0,27,24,10,0,5,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,10,0,0,6,0,2,1,4,0,0,1,3,0,19,2,25,19,1,18,0,0,0,0,13,12,0,4,4,95,24,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14171801186363406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16632572601637727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2102946465942568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17454997578410927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12732342263027324,0.0,0.0,0.15762886894178024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21341117565475085,0.0,0.0,0.15811734797399815,0.0,0.1836905770811785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748984735872653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0777750257081967,0.15955601202919026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13534257473062414,0.0,0.15063491344642535,0.10626443147146346,0.16139955260219366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270685673035413,0.0,0.0,0.3541250015991029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2421511563309368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198490476574547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127133970080923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12795555236028766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057626145320039,0.1020062394394024,0.3128181268927123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19149294396815267,0.0,0.1753316806999351,0.13135320584442772,0.0,0.25272442930703776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534590685456394,0.0,0.2317928741989902,0.0,0.16223411883925734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,PenguinWaddle39,2020/04/06,"Any South African Teachers here? Guidance needed! Due to the outbreak I am currently assisting 4 parents with the teaching and assisting of their children with school work via skype.

I am in my final year of studies and have been student teaching on and off for the last year as part of my study requirements. 

I need help in finding resources that are caps aligned. I have found a few sites but they are either to easy or go off on tangents about fact that the kids don’t really need to know. 

I’m taking the key facts and prior knowledge building approach. The parents are stressed about the learners feeling the pressure of lockdown and too much info so so we don’t want to overload them. 

I have 2 grade 4, 1 grade 5 and 2 grade 6. All are at elite ish schools so the school will be sending stuff but I’m looking for more information and resources that I can use to be able to help them to the best of my ability.

Any advice/guidance or resources will be appreciated!",5.166886252045824,6.329462930851065,5.113829787234042,84.15653846153847,68.62765957446808,7.486743044189852,34.14238952536825,7.61054688173877,2.3621181669394438,773,37,147,8,13,240,114,188,0.047,0.8170000000000001,0.136,0.9551,3,1,0,0,0,0,13.0,1,0,4,4,7,3,0,2,11,0,18,0,0,1,3,31,31,15,0,4,5,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,4,10,0,1,7,0,0,3,2,2,0,0,2,2,14,1,26,24,7,19,0,0,1,0,13,9,0,2,7,96,18,11,0.16027531924598004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2179854263243023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16819905934725665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08104001714527871,0.0,0.0,0.17557377803825852,0.14648873815859734,0.0,0.0,0.17573361489561468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09108815747367192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21485833606369725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08808312389588004,0.13064577684737338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13459090179598765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782080116038628,0.3565263551390945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559335494348324,0.17356255202755427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10267647359307773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4866215393035441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18359483668249216,0.0,0.183476895002478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050709356338833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384264157541824,0.0,0.0,0.09453453588161144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1166823412809128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20642410152331225

teaching,WittyBoysenberry,2020/04/06,"The Differences Between a Good Teacher and a Great Teacher I was listening to an interview with Jay Maqsood, SpecialEd teacher, and he talked a lot about the level of work/effort it takes to be a great teacher. He specifically pointed out having clear expectations, as well as set rules/routines/systems in place. What do you guys think? What methods/experiences have you seen that separate good teachers from great teachers?

I know that during this pandemic a lot of students have been taking online classes and might be facing some academic difficulty. I'm not officially qualified to be teacher like many people on this subreddit, but I have liked teaching math for as long as I can remember. 
I'm a graduating A level student with the Further mathematics course as well (graduating high school equivalent). I'm also part of my country's IMO, APMO and IGO teams. So if anyone wants any help with understanding a concept they have difficulty grasping or anything mathematically academic that suits my qualifications, feel free to PM me and I'll be glad to help free of charge!!

Edit: I should probably clarify for US high school students that my coursework includes all of AP Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Algebra 1 and 2 etc.",8.524276729559753,8.89132331446541,9.11132075471698,61.20522012578617,61.13836477987422,12.349685534591195,40.937106918239,11.855464076750405,5.369872955974842,713,37,111,21,9,240,110,159,0.028999999999999998,0.782,0.188,0.9799,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,0,1,1,4,7,0,0,5,0,11,1,1,0,1,22,19,14,0,3,4,0,1,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,0,5,1,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,1,10,10,16,12,5,6,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,5,3,65,15,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15279108785074696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12992775554553912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335940095800561,0.0,0.15722658929744554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21308306669804375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660597696465544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25612777730813924,0.4037320146538077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10500190569809156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18668511059561607,0.0,0.0,0.16908261320575044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16243288447553145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19370545398899164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20268509698931267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20690000438971468,0.0,0.13245735898353905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20599563505393664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164344077628938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3867270423712485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14365378876947216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19890081628190126,0.22982236969680056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11269248844520267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17178641930039668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,caiasaura,2020/04/06,"Teachers Using Discord! Hey there! Delete this if now allowed, but I wanted to offer up my (completely free) help for any teachers turning to Discord or considering it during this time! I’ve been using Discord for 4 years as a moderator and currently work for Discord.Me writing articles about the platform. I know the ins and outs and would love to help out some teachers who may be unfamiliar with it. If you haven’t made the switch yet, feel free to talk to me about it and I’ll let you know how it can benefit you. I’ll help you set up your server/classroom, get it running and get your students in, teach you how to use the platform for your needs, and help you maintain the server should you want that. I’m not asking for a single penny in return for this, in fact I really do not want anything in return. I have had amazing teachers over the years and want to give back to the educators who inspired and continue to inspire me to go farther. 

I’m going to link this handy article that Discord itself wrote on the topic so you can see a bit easier how it can help you! Have a great day and stay safe ☺️

teaching,The1used,2020/04/06,"Frustrated with how schools are handling this crisis Across every social media platform I’m hearing the same frustrations from teachers everywhere- admin is Piling on work loads. Our administration has zero regard for the fact that teachers have children too, who also need our help and attention and we also do not have child care at this time! 

Students are complaining that they’re getting mixed messages. Some are being asked to do insanely hard work and others absurd work like “take a selfie in your covid 19 mask” for “face mask Friday”. 

Schools are moving to and from “pass/ fail” and all the while parents of students with special needs are complaining that their child isn’t getting a specialized education experience right now!  These same parents that have zero problem demanding this type of instruction or accommodation and pronouncing that a teacher isn’t doing the right thing with their child, well suddenly they’re not a “professional special education teacher” and “cant be expect to help their student with special needs”. 

Yeah. A lot of things aren’t happening RIGHT NOW for a lot of different people. This is a pretty hard situation. You’re going to have to try to work with your child’s needs at home. That teacher you accused of being incompetent did it everyday so I’m sure you’ll figure it out!

Can we please all wake up and realize schools have been barely functional during the last 30 years. They were in no way going to be great during this crisis. Teachers are doing everything they can, because they always do. But ultimately how things are rolled out, the logistics of all of it comes down to how well a community functions as a WHOLE unit. Leaving everything up to individual teachers... well that’s not a functional community. 

Rant over.

teaching,hello_conjug8,2020/04/07,"Super cool curriculum-generating software for SPANISH TEACHERS :) Hi everyone **-** ***if you're not a Spanish teacher, please share it with your colleagues (muchas gracias!)***

I’m a student at Northwestern University, and I created a program called [conjug8.com](http://conjug8.com/) which is designed to create curriculum for Spanish teachers in classes of all levels!

The program is super simple to use, and essentially converts existing Spanish content online into fill-in-the-blank grammar worksheets.

During this challenging time to be an educator, I am hoping that conjug8 will save you time, and allow you to bring relevant material into the (virtual) classroom!

teaching,Log69Dog,2020/04/07,"I'm not a teacher, but I'm looking for resources to teach my spouse. Hey r/teaching, I hope this is the right place to post this. I'm a 22 year old father and husband. My wife (21F) is from Mexico and learned English as a second language in 2nd grade. She's been teaching me Spanish for about a year now. The other day she came to me and asked for help improving her English. I've always been good at English, I started reading at a very young age and I did well in school. I always attributed my proficiency to my love of books, so I downloaded a few books for her to read on her phone. She agreed that she should read more, but she also wants some writing exercises, vocabulary building assignments, etc. She basically wants me to assign her homework, but I have no idea where to even begin looking. Then I started to think about how I'm going to teach my daughter when she gets older. The education system in our state is so bad that we're considering homeschooling, but that's not an option if I don't know how to teach. Are there resources out there for non-teachers to help others learn?",5.10248015873016,5.773684393518523,5.723439153439156,81.50833333333334,68.49074074074073,8.393650793650794,30.70634920634921,8.418075326091056,2.1875738095238093,863,33,170,12,14,280,130,216,0.040999999999999995,0.8240000000000001,0.135,0.9664,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,0,0,14,5,0,0,10,0,10,2,0,3,0,28,29,17,0,5,7,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,7,6,0,0,5,6,0,2,4,1,1,1,4,2,28,4,28,24,4,28,0,0,2,1,24,10,0,4,13,113,35,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888099984196094,0.2681989865173444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506644887203836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13456333640299115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18432611744939165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10393600148807387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17973796162942154,0.10644582136772897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08420036697646333,0.0,0.09159194118450696,0.1351748365476292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21604665881440496,0.0,0.0,0.16006998989425442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819320083813688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08857028758706607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27067057459870064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.145454778990772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16911215495180093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16837973583375698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15434841517351003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4836161127151655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13763126096788847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16310430335903667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2281422439609027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10326594725647148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13297532877640392,0.1901147611395235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14490377541085894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20756577682727548
teaching,lulubenefit,2020/04/07,"Choosing Not to Participate in School Pictures? Hey, guys! I searched the sub for anyone else who might have discussed this topic but I didn't see anything.

I'm getting ready to start a job in a school district in August. One thing I've always been concerned about is my privacy online. I prefer to not post any pictures of myself online and I usually opt out of any work-related photographs. This hasn't really been an issue so far and most people are respectful of this choice. However, I feel like asking to opt out of school pictures might be frowned upon as a teacher? I'm not really interested in having my picture posted online on the school's website. Is this a totally crazy request? How do you think administration would handle this if I brought it up? Does anyone share this sentiment or is it something I just need to come to accept as part of being a teacher?

Thank you :)",3.9912500000000013,6.301847529761907,5.073238095238096,78.63842857142859,73.70238095238095,7.575238095238094,28.46190476190476,8.447377352677275,2.3786519047619046,707,29,121,13,15,232,111,168,0.039,0.813,0.14800000000000002,0.963,2,0,1,0,0,0,17.0,0,2,0,0,4,6,0,0,8,0,16,0,0,1,1,24,28,9,0,4,7,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,1,10,5,0,0,5,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,4,2,12,6,24,19,3,17,0,0,1,0,9,10,0,5,4,85,22,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988212577036933,0.0,0.0,0.19595218210600784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2014814893368001,0.147622090272647,0.11856163114863155,0.0,0.13469088321657288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12410804588226955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608119709005472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12035636009106945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07284876087954903,0.1029273669044268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07527335665849612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14265712058890642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15037709914894884,0.14297242599684756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038787562040731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056820836214873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10682995104432877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09762909866799524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15601942467057095,0.0,0.09988361770678812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27596847192547136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18459655207941225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5832472631722491,0.11480929791675472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11091614425687414,0.0,0.0,0.10197718320716506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13264510668251334,0.0,0.0,0.09571717513663527,0.09231758432462266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15867850149901475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488847705450366,0.0,0.0,0.10234690351148,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,kmccurdy_UMD,2020/04/07,"Researching the Impact of COVID-19 on Teachers I am a School Psychology doctoral student at the University of Maryland and my lab is very interested in learning more about the ways that COVID-19 is impacting teachers. Given the impact that COVID-19 has had on the education system and the stressful experiences that have arisen, we are interested in identifying ways to support teachers through this time. Specifically, we are interested in learning about the experiences that teachers have had and the impact of expressive writing.

* Phase I of the study is completely anonymous and should take about 30 minutes to complete.
* Phase II of the study is optional and involves receiving follow-up surveys over the next three months and each survey should take about 20 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

During this quarantine, my friend has been assigned to work on an difficult graduate-school level research project regarding AI in Ethics. We are humbly asking for 2-3 minutes (as a former high school teacher, I completed the survey in under a minute) of your time to fill out this survey. We are planning to possibly transform how education is done in the classroom to hopefully revolutionize teaching technology for students,teachers,and parents in the future. This could have unprecedented influence on creating a positive learning environment in this quarantine.

teaching,RaichuRose,2020/04/07,"I'm a first-year teacher and I'm having a breakdown. Please help. Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously the situation is inconvenient and stressful for everyone. I've got the hang of Google Classroom, screen-recording, etc. The online format is not a problem for me. However, there's plenty of other things I'm stressing about since I'm a first-year teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I can't plan more than a week in advance because I don't have any materials or resources. My department likes to do the same lessons at the same pace, so I have to wait for them to share what they have with me. All of them have little kids to take care of, so planning lessons is not their priority.
2. Should I plan ahead anyways, I have to make everything (video lessons, notes, assignments, and assessments) from scratch with no help from anyone. I'm terrified that I'm going to forget a key concept in one of these, or when the time comes they'll choose to use their own stuff so I would basically have wasted my time.
3. My district has a mandatory class for all first-year teachers. This class has an online checklist I'm supposed to complete throughout the school year to fulfill state requirements to get a full license (right now I have only an ""initial"" license). Obviously some of the things on this state checklist require in-person class-time (observing others, inviting co-teachers, etc), which is impossible right now. Turns out the class is going digital. We haven't had class since January, now all of a sudden I have one week to complete 8 assignments, which require me to implement specific techniques into my classroom. There are also mandatory online meetings to attend.

So now I have no idea what I'm doing next week, no resources besides state curriculum to plan for anything, no one to go to for help (my mentor is technology illiterate -- I had to teach her how to make a powerpoint yesterday) because they're all busy with their small children (which is a good excuse!), and 7 days to implement 8 things into my online teaching and write a reflection for each. I also have students who haven't done any assignments at all since before the school closed and about 20 emails a day of students asking for help with the 5 problems a day I give them, so I spend most of my day responding to them.

I don't see how this is going to be possible, and I have no idea what's going to happen to me when I fail to do all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a dark comedy about teaching. It's an unfiltered expose about working in a Title-1 school district. So, if you're looking for a bit of distraction from being stuck at home (or worse, teaching online...which has to suck). Check it out. You'll either love the book or hate me. Either way, it'll help you pass the time...

teaching,NiharaNao,2020/04/07,"Getting a teaching certificate? Baccalaureate or Alternative Teacher Certificate? Other options ? Hello everyone, I am narrowing down my options to leave my current host country as soon as possible, and would like some insight of people in the teaching industry.

I've been in China for the past 7 + years as a teacher for Younger Learners of either English or Spanish, since I am Mexican national, I don't have a degree in teaching, but international business, and when I first came here, there were almost no restrictions on passports nor degrees.

Anyway, I wanted to leave for some time now and I've been advised to get an ""International Baccalaureate Teacher Certification"", many have told me I can almost go anywhere with that, but the problem is that the information on internet says you must have a teaching license and/or undergraduate program in your subject. 

Then I was told that I could go to Canada and be a teacher (they also told me about been a nanny, but I don't have patience to deal with only 2 or 3 children all the time) but I love the classroom environment and love to have many kindergartners to teach. But to qualify for the teacher Visa I must have a degree in education, that I could do an Alternative Teacher Certification online if I find a proper program that would be valid for immigration, but also... ouch, those prices.

So I am wondering if anyone knows how to get proper certificates or if you have done it yourselves so I could ask some questions and maybe get some guidance from you because people keep telling me how easy and cheap it is and I just can't find the same information (also, this always acomes from someone that didn't get the certificates, just know the friend of a friend and it was soooooo easy for them...) 

Thank you in advance, any information would be highly appreciated.",7.807042682926828,8.65723293597561,7.858439024390247,67.93168292682931,62.628048780487795,10.340487804878052,38.351219512195115,10.241411754978122,4.200128780487805,1465,72,235,31,20,474,169,328,0.025,0.857,0.11699999999999999,0.9882,1,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,5,2,2,16,7,0,0,21,0,36,2,0,2,3,62,56,35,0,13,16,0,0,1,2,5,0,1,0,1,12,12,0,2,10,0,3,4,6,1,0,1,12,1,28,6,35,33,7,26,0,0,0,2,25,12,0,17,11,180,40,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22381521741427648,0.0,0.0,0.26811398076910675,0.09299004249602542,0.0,0.0,0.07599799229507125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07814247593289826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447688405298557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06812549204786639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12781922644318292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2676844988404433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11521565012144712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11436530927006018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10678775963535178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20428613383225308,0.09505969659809048,0.0,0.0,0.17268499857511874,0.0,0.2919397945903837,0.0,0.12702715418337288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807647415328232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0993339722670966,0.0,0.0,0.12283647919115215,0.0,0.0,0.2366671846025825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054598394073225684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20172851889173204,0.0,0.0,0.2266063249989559,0.11227404124105414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08499556341034033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10668385978277163,0.15495524116751516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12598823100586914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693551161527984,0.0,0.0,0.12519242837764016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08887295033201745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092445815391144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469059583811458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09767977269244926,0.10289001824111332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303317818626556,0.0,0.0,0.32036327890605537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591665370198081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12119474241455548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23816501865588705,0.0,0.0,0.07196727571019604

I am teaching secondary biology to four classes of 10th-graders. I am looking for lesson plan ideas that are very inquiry based on DNA. More specifically, I am looking for inquiry lessons on how differences in DNA make people different, but also how it makes species different from one another and how it also makes plants/ animals different. I need a total of 3-4 lessons that are about 45-60 minutes long. I am stuck and have a few ideas but I feel that they are not very inquiry. I appreciate any help, advice or tips anyone can offer as I have little experience when it comes to writing inquiry lessons since I am not yet a teacher.

teaching,naughty_knitter,2020/04/08,"Anyone else have this much difficulty in finding a job (even without COVID-19 screwing everything up)? I'm an experienced, actively-licensed, dual-certified secondary teacher in the US. I taught for 6 years right out of college and had no issues finding work when I would relocate every couple of years or so. Now, though, I've been out of the traditional classroom for 8 years but have earned my MA, kept my certification valid, met my CCE requirements for my next renewal, and have been subbing for my most recent district (the one that shut down my program's funding in 2012) since 2017, as well as 5 months as the lead teacher at a residential facility for boys, and as an adjunct professor at a local university. 

In that same time frame, I have applied to 5 different universities across the country (at some of those schools, for more than one position); 16 different school districts; and roughly 40 full-time positions in the district where I taught and now sub. 

I can't get *any* breaks, it seems. I've even applied for custodial positions and have been rejected without even so much as the formality or courtesy of an interview. 

My references/recommendation letters are out-of-this-world solid, my skills are extensive, my experience in the classroom (and life, in general) far outweighs that of recent college grads, and yet I seem to be passed over for teaching positions in favor of those recent college grads who wind up quitting by Christmas break, and then HR contacts me to ask if I'm interested in a temporary teaching position...usually when I've already committed to a long-term sub assignment. 

Did any of you face these sorts of issues? If so, how did you handle the constant rejection? How long did it take you to find a position? Anything else you'd like to add, I'm open to it. 

I'd also like to add that I'm 36F, and my certs are in Family &amp; Consumer Sciences and English Content &amp; Analysis (FACS is my specialized area; English is my additional cert). 

Thanks in advance!

teaching,mp_sophie_hatter,2020/04/08,"I am the teaching piñata... I'm a middle school ELA teacher in the second week of online learning. At the end of last week our principal sent out a parent survey asking how everything was going for the kids. All the teachers got added to the form so that we could read the comments. 

Pretty soon after it went live my principal sent me an email with a comment that she had deleted from the survey since it only pertained to me. What followed was an incredibly rude, hurtful, scathing review of exactly what this parent thought of my teaching. She felt that I wasn't doing any real teaching, and was doing an injustice to the novel that the class is currently reading (To Kill a Mockingbird).

After reading the comment I went into the survey results to read what she had posted that remained public, and she took the time to point out every other teacher and how much she appreciated them and how it was obvious that ""some""  teachers in our school really care. 

I feel my content area has a lot of figuring out as far as trying to get things online. I have been trying to find meaningful ways to teach grammar, writing skills, and how to somehow transition class discussion to online. I started off this online thing kind of slowly, but was just starting to get the hang of it and felt that we could really move forward. I knew that I wasn't doing the best with the book, but in part because when we started it we were still in school every day, and once things changed it just seemed like we could not continue doing what we had been before. It sort of became a survival mode for a while. 

I emailed the parent apologizing for the situation and tried to explain my process as best I could. I have not heard back from her. Ultimately it is a good reflection on my teaching, and I'll be honest, it is a blow to my ego. But I am just embarrassed and hurt.

Sometimes I feel like parents think of us as teaching piñatas that they can (metaphorically) beat with a stick whenever they want more.",7.672055702917774,7.193943281167108,7.536566312997347,74.6030457559682,63.13793103448275,10.086419098143237,35.29562334217506,9.3871,3.2042266312997363,1575,62,281,24,20,504,193,377,0.073,0.8590000000000001,0.068,-0.6178,6,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,9,0,3,5,13,13,2,1,31,0,31,0,0,5,3,64,58,24,1,5,8,4,4,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,28,23,0,0,14,6,0,10,4,5,0,1,24,5,39,8,48,29,9,45,0,2,0,0,37,16,0,5,21,216,67,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060384093192029364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08301195482341016,0.0,0.0,0.06827838089940193,0.0,0.05412900967961503,0.0,0.07555856587378865,0.0,0.1863711321568127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0905330924795575,0.0,0.09393403355423112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28358443402530603,0.0,0.0,0.05726585430536555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07864659810729857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496283452105143,0.0,0.07980381291594013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08979550660976658,0.06343563667798065,0.17051551571056114,0.0,0.08115762384400624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09278413405745148,0.0,0.050464619422745764,0.0744775860593056,0.07101800030376319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901151793880688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09823924073846453,0.09246701481741117,0.0,0.07238031365051274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676214769075204,0.0,0.07840819388955574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549089409293185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437573316486683,0.06527502647487918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09456447907608853,0.0,0.06753310011074971,0.0,0.0,0.3943882851556775,0.09615704584476494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394059924183618,0.0,0.08504169613071477,0.09033710802680192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3552787542842151,0.10106890001861536,0.11376954605854095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2695978430671635,0.0,0.08083623320814291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07345268688307194,0.09981004133825383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782117745247997,0.0,0.18855007384130515,0.0,0.07091232814282566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17697567114822674,0.05689667300673689,0.0,0.07049383483707325,0.05177746295798024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09865524459233156,0.18085927169932287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10681024490198776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052373980415075724,0.07048186117888791,0.14245304348467394,0.0,0.0,0.1646289313766193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,PsychologicalGlass1,2020/04/09,"How to teach 1 digit x 1 digit multiplication/ 2 digit x 1 digit division? (TUTOR, NOT TEACHER)

I’m tutoring a 3rd grader in a few things including math, in which he’s learning 1 digit x 1 digit multiplication and 2 digit x 1 digit division. The only method (excluding memorizing times and division tables) that I can think of is with circles and dots, for example for 3x5, drawing 3 circles and putting 5 dots in each and then counting the total dots, or for 48 / 6, drawing 6 circles and putting 1 dot in each until you draw 48 total dots and seeing how many are in each. This method works fine for lower numbers, but it’s less effective for stuff like 9x9. Are there any better methods for this stuff? I’m a HS student for whatever that’s worth (no degrees or anything)",8.375485714285716,6.651452320000002,9.287142857142856,66.64500000000001,62.46666666666667,11.771428571428574,39.42857142857143,10.608840637214634,4.2578571428571435,608,27,107,12,7,210,88,150,0.012,0.878,0.11,0.9234,1,0,3,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,3,3,3,0,0,5,0,4,0,0,3,2,23,8,14,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,11,0,0,4,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,16,8,7,10,0,0,1,0,2,5,0,2,4,59,11,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17324374092724326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20964360069757187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22531218244546794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446157789458975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582839774777829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937544522262471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5122030228799079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20300863252003687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.583272454492534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692494700843691,0.16323822975455915,0.0,0.0,0.14855106542771282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18546639235946946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

States allowing it in schools and using it more at home have murder rates 32% higher than those banning it in schools.

There's an enormous amount of additional research showing how this leads to escalating violence and causes many other social problems but the for profit media refuses to cover it; so we base our political decisions on corporate propaganda.

Many within the educational community are already aware of this, but they don't have nearly as much power as corporations financing campaigns and educating the public isn't as profitable as propaganda to control the public.

teaching,throwawaypost2,2020/04/09,"Help me teach my 17 years old sister I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but if it's not, I'll be really glad if someone can point me in the right direction. English isn't my first language, so please bear with me.

I am a 19 years old, second year university student, enrolled in an engineering degree. I have a younger 17 years old sister who, for reasons I'm not comfortable disclosing, stopped going to school when she was in 7th grade, years ago. She never touched any book after that day. The situation now finally allows her to study. Today, I tried teaching her some basics and I'm sad to say that she is unable to understand the concepts that I deem too basic, so obviously, I came to the conclusion that I am not fit for teaching her. I have always struggled with teaching others. For context, I spent 20 mins trying to explain how one can find the value of `x` in an expression `x + 2y = 5` if we know what the value of `y` is, and she still doesn't understand it completely. I explained that writing `2` and `y` together means they are being multiplied, that `y` is actually just a variable that can represent any number, and she gave me a look that screamed that she's completely lost. I hope I have fully explained her educational background.

I have spent last few years in another city away from home, with little visits, every now and then. I am now home, in quarantine, until June. I have enough time on my hands to teach her something but I am completely lost with what to do and where to start. I have been looking for resources and ways to deal with this situation, with no fruit. I tried finding some apps or sites for it, but they are either too basic, even for her, or a little to advanced. I can't find something that will suit her.

She doesn't need a formal certificate/degree. She just wants to be able to work with computers. She understood computer science concepts fairly quickly - or at least, that's how it seemed. I want to be able to teach her Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, and maybe a little Programming. 

I want to spend these couple of months teaching her whatever I can, and then I plan on hiring a home teacher to continue teaching her, once we are out of quarantine. Any resources, tips, book recommendation, or anything else that can help me, will be truly and extremely appreciated.",6.474788377561302,6.359925316593888,7.047685589519652,75.90909640577763,65.48471615720524,10.27759489418878,33.77258985555929,9.943994293440598,3.201624185421567,1857,74,354,37,26,612,225,458,0.061,0.846,0.09300000000000001,0.9183,0,2,2,0,0,0,72.0,2,0,2,7,16,9,0,1,17,0,37,2,1,4,3,68,63,29,0,9,18,2,2,0,0,2,0,2,3,0,24,21,1,1,14,2,3,4,10,5,0,3,9,7,54,4,49,47,6,60,0,3,2,0,37,21,0,12,33,235,78,19,0.17110346066090096,0.0,0.08348614781705395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07583644704191349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07118589304116031,0.0,0.0,0.17453433095563214,0.08970844864425946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07040178458211856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08037866683620858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09784838825702412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690980846850804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09466136239072624,0.0,0.05517378854507661,0.08820007740682173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07146749293282782,0.0,0.0,0.08839780685040237,0.0,0.05650611102567741,0.0,0.0720810226192778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09371773884146672,0.2345781948652701,0.07277025811495948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04862101988719415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11468704297484507,0.0,0.25744608294948873,0.08497217180181336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0470169936185792,0.0697360786566584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25723592711128873,0.0,0.0,0.14368381344741926,0.0,0.1867796395062902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594821205104955,0.09319091467901804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06828657493864855,0.0,0.0,0.06343552401799016,0.06598276852772314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2693164488952424,0.0911098006955006,0.05797206656809675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938334943771685,0.09391010920038358,0.0808740379252869,0.0,0.08193490897403917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05480662912694168,0.08796142740026883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14612142051098367,0.0,0.06803416975379653,0.0,0.08658291848331412,0.0,0.07788308219456165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19232745873682705,0.0,0.0,0.07248770348313233,0.1317238033755201,0.0,0.0,0.06055395506023231,0.0,0.06832172235357299,0.07152507730915779,0.0,0.08943724381350429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063149337330908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04988590194447642,0.0,0.08109303705200434,0.0,0.0,0.1742520273939237,0.0,0.0,0.17812473683563468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15138188135340308,0.06790698143104533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062282678596758526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3305550564549111

That, and also the fact that so many millions of children are out of school now, is making me want to do whatever I can. Let's share and help each other out!***

I'm a teacher, and as many in my profession at the moment I am teaching online because of the coronavirus pandemic. I teach students between the ages of 4-17, and although my current place of employment is a private tutoring company I have also worked in public schools in more than one country.

[Due to the pandemic, it is currently estimated that 9 out of 10 children worldwide are not attending in person lessons.](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/02/824964864/nine-out-of-10-of-the-world-s-children-are-out-of-school-what-now) This is of course necessary given the current circumstances, and I'm not here to debate the reasons for stopping instruction in ANY way.

That said, the problems with online teaching are manifold:

* Lack of direct oversight leading to poor quality and/or non-existent work for the classes
* Difficulties using computers and programmes needed to attend online classes
* Overbearing parents who practically take the class for their kid by doing all the activities on the computer for them and not allowing enough time/space for mistakes (extremely necessary for true learning to occur)
* Students simply not attending lessons, with no way to check in on them in most cases
* Density of information transfer is lower and of poorer quality overall
* Problems collecting homework and having standards from normal classes still in place
* In the case of recorded lecture lessons (I don't use these, but most online teaching is in this form at the moment) are boring and don't allow for interaction between students, a fundamental part of any truly effective classroom
* Teacher talk time is exponentially increased!
* Students don't teach each other in the collaborative ways that we set them up to do in classrooms of the 21st century. They barely interact at all with one another inside or outside the classroom, so their socio-emotional development is impacted.
* Most kids under the age of 10 cannot type on a keyboard, it turns out. They really struggle to produce work that is of anything approaching the same standard as in a classroom setting, regardless of how interactive and intuitive the instruction app used may appear to be.
* For problematic students, there's no classroom management. You can mute them, sure, but they can just as easily leave the virtual classroom and not tell their parents, losing all instruction. Then the parents call you up as a teacher and yell at you, when they weren't watching their kid, either.

For young learners, the online platform makes it difficult especially. This is not a CMV about MOOCs or online learning full-stop; I love taking MOOCs myself and find it the perfect way to get knowledge as a working adult. However, for children, the issues come down to a lack of accountability and oversight, because parents are not trained teachers and they aren't able to balance the situation effectively (no blame, this is a crisis, but it does make it difficult for the kiddos to learn if no one is engaged in their learning on a deep level in their household).

My students are also a self-selected group of really quite well-off people, and I know for a fact that children from poorer backgrounds will not have the same access to learning and schooling during this period. I would love for my view to be changed, especially if there were ways to make the classes effective for the age of the kids I teach. I simply don't see how online classes can compare to in person ones for the vast majority of children.",5.871087533156498,8.490010246684353,5.8984562334217525,73.43447480106103,69.21220159151194,8.565729442970824,34.676923076923075,9.224526759843432,3.6798117771883296,3442,174,525,74,65,1084,340,754,0.115,0.8029999999999999,0.08199999999999999,-0.9712,11,0,0,0,0,0,133.0,2,3,16,18,24,17,0,2,52,0,48,2,0,21,8,122,77,49,0,13,19,4,0,0,0,3,0,2,1,12,30,36,0,3,18,0,3,9,22,9,0,5,8,6,42,8,117,62,20,91,0,1,4,2,55,46,0,9,25,381,72,54,0.07060762540873386,0.0,0.06890285712650986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16939467758859608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603121303316654,0.07403825163332799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0581040595518067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08608350618575795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07209827994809871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469350544541829,0.06082221726320254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06178920881157405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07942407505826184,0.06253739865859861,0.0729565516552183,0.0,0.0932713413321876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06453409045859544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377914010758994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0564713681686984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094653605933216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07369601648972686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03880410437571087,0.0,0.0,0.07476328037156685,0.0,0.14440216158682415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06234782682757632,0.0,0.0,0.07899187210125824,0.0,0.0,0.1274522772742606,0.0,0.23565569118763316,0.1431700997188646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05235465957460318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06918048148220345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19138221726666527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3136056486691545,0.07646117765479231,0.0,0.04895043712927272,0.12330371008766948,0.1475398809702378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202867762173544,0.0,0.0,0.13512392349611568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07509990088659249,0.0,0.0,0.09046610569682732,0.0725963986035841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06716402074723064,0.0,0.0,0.2858347458994097,0.05626513585068225,0.0,0.0736591522522231,0.0,0.0,0.05840735737717302,0.15873185860590525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11277468171800566,0.11806227288375995,0.0,0.14762884127256104,0.0,0.0,0.08012469657561437,0.06654685134080836,0.0,0.1061762941599304,0.11350346946845125,0.06171417676430005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1646874967492605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680082095466283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18294695445737091,0.0,0.0,0.08329241369313008,0.3362702792100861,0.0,0.0,0.06348473487737262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2570159611515911,0.0,0.0,0.05015763125862397,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,_EscVelocity_,2020/04/09,"The value of reading aloud I am a teacher and a leader in a school in Asia that teaches a US-based curriculum with all instruction in English. Depending on the grade level, subject, and exact course, students may or may not have English proficiency. Some are essentially native speakers, others are low-proficiency learners new to English. 

For as long as I’ve been teaching here, I’ve struggled with how valuable I find reading aloud. Lots of teachers here across multiple subjects use reading aloud as a strategy, across elementary, middle, and high school. It takes a lot of time to get through little material, and significantly calls out students whose proficiency is limited. On the other hand it ensures students actually do the reading (something a decently number are likely not to do reliably). 

Most of you are teaching in an environment very different from mind, but what do you think about the value of reading aloud at various grade levels? How much time, if any, do you dedicate to reading aloud?

If any of you teach MFL to secondary level and have a spare few minutes, it would be great if you wouldn’t mind filling out this survey about remote AfL in MFL teaching - it’s completely anonymous and should only take about five minutes to complete 👍 It’s for my PGCE, so all feedback, no matter now brief or detailed, is useful!",5.751585365853658,8.847544097560974,4.956280487804875,77.78490853658538,71.4390243902439,6.051219512195122,29.76219512195122,7.1686216300943375,2.0403853658536577,384,16,57,4,8,115,66,82,0.028999999999999998,0.795,0.17600000000000002,0.9119,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,2,0,0,4,3,0,0,2,0,7,0,0,1,2,15,10,6,0,6,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,4,3,8,6,3,7,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,4,1,37,8,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876373798320456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2817486505181651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5786008890247045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26365664159013824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314314642424479,0.0,0.30420653234776995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27405420334610986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.278603986012226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20985218601227512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2074600643601693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2383092336917429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960080730147531,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’m currently a junior at a mid-sized university pursuing my degree in Social Science Education. Before I get accepted into the college of education, I need to get through the interview process with the history dept here in order for the Ed. school to accept me for observation and student teaching. 

I’m a non-traditional student who’s worked in management and a business hiring department before, so I’m familiar with the interview process and how to “pass the interview”, but this upcoming one has made me a nervous wreck! So any tips and/or advice would greatly be appreciated! Thank you for anything you can offer me!",7.240837606837609,8.926782707692311,8.378717948717952,60.71850427350432,64.23076923076923,11.931623931623928,39.82905982905983,11.645159339076185,5.67134188034188,592,33,85,20,9,202,82,130,0.05,0.851,0.099,0.7383,2,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,0,1,4,5,0,1,11,0,5,0,0,2,1,15,13,8,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,10,4,17,10,1,11,0,0,0,0,11,5,0,0,3,57,13,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6225453483814262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2888233039718636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17475366522897878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36140436140430376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22189800937657192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2341269523192869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009395681255302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574617801759579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14390020329465336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21491901719525588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164736320799208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19551197417652652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15460014869887964,0.0,0.0,0.15085400175581345,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,rockyroadnottaken,2020/04/12,"Are teachers considered specialists? At my school, the Special Ed dept. head tells her department that SpEd teachers are specialists and are the most qualified out of all teachers. The Math dept. head tells GenEd teachers that this is wrong, and GenEd teachers are actually specialists because they specialize in only one subject and SpEd teachers are more general. I thought specialists were something else? Is the Special Head or Math dept. head right? Or neither? If someone could enlighten me, I'd appreciate it. 


I'm not looking to argue but my school mostly consists of people giving conflicting information at any given moment. I haven't been in education that long and I never know who's right. I was looking to leave this shit school after this year but now I might have to stay.",4.657717391304349,7.952445695652178,4.6186775362318855,77.3110597826087,77.55072463768116,7.797826086956523,31.81340579710145,8.660442795831766,3.355723188405797,638,32,98,15,16,197,86,138,0.095,0.82,0.085,-0.6616,0,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,0,1,6,2,0,4,0,14,5,5,0,2,23,21,9,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,1,4,0,0,1,4,3,0,1,5,2,10,3,11,14,5,17,0,0,2,0,8,7,1,6,8,65,18,9,0.0,0.0,0.13788043700604302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0960832842890858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08613018347056407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11281002311221937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11803118738809135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1355399906316127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5800246896191863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07765029045352348,0.0,0.0,0.1496076389214182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250388165698398,0.23729909100894025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498882953331652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897296374731794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09574299547355326,0.10745879773716584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979539593057631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24132488853297726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4289846022323954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14503402520618802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11971610255296887,0.10877334772538616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15059828313120704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2469905608153957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11216992448223824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15448042735864626,0.0,0.09098730114772044

teaching,TheSassa,2020/04/12,"I have social anxiety - Will I be good at teaching? So I always thought I wanted to be a writer. I chose a journalism degree all the way back in 2017 but I ended up transferring to a Bachelor of Creative Writing instead last year...then I delved in psychology for a few weeks, went back to journalism, and now I realise I want to get into teaching. I’m good at English and want to help people.

I completed an education support certificate last year and loved working with the kids; I barely looked at the clock.

I now want to transfer to a Bachelor of Education, and it will qualify me to work with ages birth to 12. I was 19 when I started uni, I’m 22 now.

I also have severe social anxiety, with panic attacks daily. How would I go teaching? What are your own experiences? I need some good advice because I’ve transferred majors so many times. I mainly want to work with primary children.

teaching,TasxMia,2020/04/13,"I got hired! + other thoughts and emotions.. ((For context, I was living with my best friend for two years but moved away because I was accepted into a teaching credential program in another city. We ended up dating my first year of teaching, and have been doing the long-distance relationship thing for over four years now. This past December, we finally agreed to settle down together and find an apartment in his city (San Diego), which is a plus because it is also closer to my family)) 

With this whole pandemic and telling my school I wouldn't be coming back next year, I have been having massive emotions (maybe even anxiety?) about EVERYTHING- job hunting, trying to finish my Master's Degree and Induction Program, having tearful moments of realization that I'm leaving the first and only school I've ever taught at, remembering that I'm probably never seeing my tenth graders or my classroom ever again, trying to learn how to teach online, etc. I've been stress crying almost every night and feel like I cannot concentrate AT ALL. 

But on the bright side...I applied for a teaching position down in SD, and I immediately got a skype interview a week later. I prepared by reading r/teaching for interview and resume tips.... and I got an offer over the phone two days later! I still have a huge amount of emotions and thoughts that I can't fully explain, but I just want to say thank you to everyone on this subreddit for posting advice....and also for being a place where I feel supported and heard, especially during this crisis and huge transition in my life.",10.138809970517288,8.48860004529617,9.63045296167248,65.33842133476283,59.0,12.31508978826052,40.54382203162691,11.051253699011982,4.6068190297507385,1251,53,201,25,13,404,177,287,0.053,0.8340000000000001,0.113,0.9067,1,0,0,0,0,0,47.0,2,1,0,4,13,8,0,1,13,0,18,1,0,1,4,42,35,21,0,2,5,0,2,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,11,20,0,0,9,1,0,2,4,1,0,6,12,6,25,7,37,20,5,49,0,0,2,0,14,21,0,2,26,144,36,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056155519969904,0.0,0.0,0.16869276601882754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110597194997686,0.08068623394664541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990949595504688,0.08110190251849493,0.0,0.12859020992096376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11068696411176733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085528729344024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158566749939758,0.06802108767568582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3559273641508569,0.09341739872987012,0.0,0.11762980556883178,0.06966364343730792,0.1908119715463485,0.08886519647519306,0.10078356879133447,0.09479195274487648,0.0,0.0994301602957992,0.0,0.10666020968473124,0.07534963123446464,0.0,0.11554005440997188,0.0964000260540292,0.1794298429724797,0.0,0.0,0.08148785259919199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25306816865708803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10466525958603842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11168023171145187,0.0,0.0,0.07449840146801479,0.05152857428384237,0.0,0.09313421926116153,0.09333991304267727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105961381693347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210065924857872,0.0,0.0,0.08134695480340079,0.0,0.11217128391363343,0.09897887011845916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08021664881045472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10068551075569744,0.0,0.0,0.11019639595497638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10101357499619784,0.0,0.11371727878198895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550112098917362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11323807741808943,0.11947987091640715,0.0,0.0,0.0838760278711809,0.0,0.2134877609341116,0.08404798957256912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08423053752361825,0.0,0.12081848244481425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11968903230171166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09218768259852488,0.0971049796976176,0.0,0.0,0.07007129460571039,0.0,0.0,0.16746689203232928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14321791495061614,0.0,0.20606276707668356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062210459565338674,0.0,0.08460374055426781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11775636737679558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716835302858944

I’m not complaining it’s just out of curiosity.,5.326852941176469,8.185126552941181,4.379632352941177,82.58709558823529,71.70588235294117,7.0735294117647065,34.154411764705884,8.07648339933343,2.8570294117647066,387,20,64,6,8,114,66,85,0.025,0.9329999999999999,0.042,-0.1803,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,4,2,0,0,4,0,6,2,2,0,1,12,12,5,0,2,7,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,4,2,3,1,8,8,1,13,0,0,0,0,3,8,0,4,5,35,4,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11910654908066452,0.0,0.14017631878710632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13098189181041553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17859953942794612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985600177174254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14906675882520096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1779925248482665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09361508554093204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8619720973605648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603472681218245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16054459395405996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16639863076724956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401044464591016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1096941676629091

The thing is, I do not want to teach. I had a pretty bad experience with my cooperating teacher and the school I was teaching at. I don’t really know where to go now or what my degree is even good for outside of teaching. I’ve done some research into this to see what the internet says. Sadly, most sites say teach another grade or do something else in teaching in general. Is there anything that I can do outside of just going back to school for another major or a masters?

teaching,nolanc44,2020/04/13,"Third round interview - What should I expect? I have applied for an opening at a high school for a social studies position. The first round of interviews was with two VP's of the high school and two other history teachers. Then they moved me onto the second round with one of the VP's and the Principal of the HS. I just got notified that they will be scheduling the third round with me this week. I made it this far and I'm so nervous. It looks like it may be with the superintendent and/or board members.
What kinds of questions should I expect? If anyone else has gone through a similar process of multiple interview rounds, how was it like for you? I know I have to do my research of the school. What other tips and advice are there to prepare for this?

I’d love to know the reasons you got into teaching - what are your favorite things about teaching? What are your least favorite things about teaching? What are some qualities you think teachers must possess? What makes your job enjoyable and fun? What makes your job more difficult? Is it all worth it to you?

teaching,saxtasticnick,2020/04/13,"If I Hear “Less is More” One More Time... I teach middle school, and I have received at least 5 emails in the past two weeks from admin about parents complaint about the workload their kids are receiving, claiming that some teachers are assigning multiple assignments every day and that their kids can’t keep up. The admin then says the same “less is more” empathetic copy-and-paste sentiment, all the while continuing to state their expectations that we assign 2-3 assignments per week, post at least 2 recorded lessons per week, hold at least 1 live chat per week, and take attendance with an open-ended question every day.

I don’t necessarily think the 2 assignments per week is a lot, but if parents are complaining about the workload then I feel like admin should either (1) change their requirements of the work we put out or (2) stop sending us these emails or actually determine which teachers (if any) are going overboard with assignments.

I’ve already had a panic attack trying to find the balance, and I would appreciate an end to the mixed messages.

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to talk about this somewhere.",8.655844155844154,8.63528451724138,7.76687863860278,72.2474787281684,60.9704433497537,10.92861621137483,36.18853560232871,10.436869588844218,3.76188078817734,899,36,153,18,11,278,128,203,0.098,0.8590000000000001,0.043,-0.8775,2,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,3,0,4,3,5,4,1,1,15,0,13,0,0,0,1,34,20,13,0,7,8,2,1,1,0,2,0,2,0,2,6,9,0,4,5,1,0,6,2,3,0,2,1,3,14,1,19,17,13,30,0,0,0,0,23,7,0,8,16,96,20,10,0.0,0.0,0.12801354084450975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14476127832552274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920744454324905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14923710149192926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13877189580978702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920153146696584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2323745101830268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.221050968920189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06632895562950238,0.09371559200235913,0.0,0.0,0.1198968775651285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455307350951487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1478502991132928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11659952525946335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06408831423502767,0.0,0.11583505255092813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152522779301142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09726890337142904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888915072200725,0.0,0.0,0.15391240804774847,0.2913215154581159,0.0,0.25045384010357785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12563494772239067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318729395760197,0.1469525216978305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043202398999762,0.0,0.13276197622615035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14684616922853388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967302534531638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09863163833834336,0.10543816055490424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08405536182853254,0.0,0.0,0.07649258126184544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906315442457965,0.0,0.12814458338983029,0.0,0.15779435435825415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5261266380312856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09550118707025726,0.0,0.0,0.09318707881736507,0.0,0.0,0.0

I put on a nice shirt and got prepared myself for the standard interview questions (I've gone on dozen of interviews at this point). I hit start and was given 30 seconds to read the qustion and then it immediately starts to record my response (given 2 minutes to respond). I stumbled over some words at the beginning and instinctively hit the stop button. And that was it - no start again or redo buttons. Is there even a point in answering the other questions?

teaching,somethingforchange,2020/04/13,"New Teacher - Beyond Frustrated I typed like 6 pages and erased it to keep it concise for you guys. I started in January and was finally settling in when Covid came. I teach middle school and it's tough. Especially my kids can be very, very challenging. Yet, I was keeping it together. I was handling the situation and my own mental state/emotions/patience whatever. The administration (because of or with their bosses) has made my job 1000x more miserable and burdensome and 95% of it is bullshit documentation to make sure those damned teachers don't think they're getting a vacation and 5% is about helping teach the kids at home. They keep thanking us for ""going above and beyond"" i.e. redoing literally everything because they jump the gun before they know what to do. They keep talking about ""uncharted waters"" but having a jumpy indecisive captain makes the uncharted waters so, so much worse for the crew than they already are. The amount of work they're giving leaves very little for the kids, and the implication is that as teachers we should be willing to go the extra mile on our unpaid fucking time. I am willing to go the extra mile for the kids, not for idiot bullshit decisions made by incompetent superintendents who were perfectly comfortable making us and the kids go as long as possible before a higher govt. power mandated closure. I'm not in a place to buck the system since I've been there 3 months, but I also feel like if it isn't during school hours, it isn't my fucking problem. If it's too much work for regular hours, why should I fucking do it on my offtime? They monopolized all the time set aside for the kids, why is it my fucking problem and expectation that I should be willing to do it all in MY time? Back when we were in the building, I didn't mind staying 45 minutes over at least, but likely 1 1/2 hours after school to finish everything up. But now all of this is because of gross incompetence at a higher level and I have to pay the fucking price. Fucking stressful, miserable shit. All this on top of the stress and demands everyone has from the virus, especially teachers with young children/old parents they now have to care for/watch/grocery shop for.

I don't know what kind of advice or words of wisdom I'm looking for. I'm just angry/jaded as hell that this is how it's all playing out.",6.682125420875423,7.30616317045455,6.936919191919191,74.35380471380473,65.02272727272728,9.700336700336699,34.47811447811448,9.633347757342033,3.30949074074074,1865,80,328,35,27,603,230,440,0.14800000000000002,0.7559999999999999,0.096,-0.9795,3,0,0,1,0,0,52.0,5,1,8,6,17,32,11,5,25,0,37,9,1,7,7,62,70,31,0,8,11,1,1,3,0,6,0,0,1,7,22,19,2,4,5,2,5,6,7,20,0,0,10,2,33,12,56,51,14,52,1,2,1,6,27,23,9,5,23,221,55,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07898015112320547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08919115123815148,0.06463482027607767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06214856768364139,0.0,0.14780844437473334,0.0,0.1375503221789831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092440976467733,0.08240532290689437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07723067217811322,0.14527856703943615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040866977560922425,0.05774058944726526,0.0,0.0885385998193104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4483221970439433,0.042227136609562524,0.07753362162008097,0.1837362734447144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08002833920060952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05417453690163608,0.0,0.08107293238573206,0.0,0.2387856960203861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08020522043888444,0.2873598799902253,0.0,0.08416562392349415,0.08883737132719974,0.0,0.0,0.08558080912912132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845938210107787,0.08100675173203686,0.0,0.07152658227709456,0.06787169545806769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529550015764877,0.16185168409536438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08145145178681258,0.0,0.08160906921007627,0.0,0.06451284256603533,0.0,0.11882968950018105,0.0,0.0,0.0780601980618567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08481105636372553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08974534366062999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08444374249962154,0.0,0.0,0.0911167703146901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546750577024837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24539421668345546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296454190362867,0.06685834113471048,0.09084941716407699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0572075517488073,0.08614749231217282,0.0,0.0,0.18516694184687096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617554171563133,0.0,0.0,0.06496316579339657,0.0,0.07441176120103679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051788672882314535,0.0,0.0,0.14138714709150887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19444232997785232,0.0,0.0,0.2000644739058792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14586194409206324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11768148109679315,0.0,0.08236642931933641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,steelmyrmidon,2020/04/13,"Unregulated Distance Learning Seems like a Lawsuit waiting to Happen. I see time and again posts on social media about teachers visiting houses, or giving phone numbers, etc. While at first glace it is warm and fuzzy, but as a man I find this whole thing very tense.

I don't even stay in the same room with a female student (or if its just all female I stand in my doorway so the cameras can see me). I cannot imagine giving my phone number to a student no matter what the work. As a man if I record a Zoom session people will think it is ""Creepy"" but if I don't and something is said or done--there is no due process. If there is word of smoke--there is a burning fire. Anyone else sometimes worry about how careers might end because of over familiarity with distance learning?

I try to do everything via Google Classroom and email--so its all recorded and regulated. Maybe I am just paranoid. Just seen and heard too many horror stories.",4.8139141521461974,6.145797939226519,5.030055248618787,83.79810454738633,69.60773480662985,6.6742031449213775,29.94517637059073,6.67199483983844,1.5543196770080745,741,29,139,5,13,233,120,181,0.139,0.802,0.059000000000000004,-0.9551,0,0,2,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,2,11,2,0,0,10,0,14,0,0,1,2,34,25,20,0,4,12,0,2,1,0,2,0,2,1,2,7,8,0,1,6,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,3,7,12,2,16,20,5,16,0,0,3,0,10,6,0,9,7,92,19,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12314314232648015,0.18044980839494704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735758066478192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.180225970428022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14712081421848644,0.0,0.1559849062506447,0.0,0.19641388481596506,0.11632176701974754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15828008554360712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16096518668946194,0.14980264712552366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378895734620185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15573720395091525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2032121393197973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08604050142882531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17855215488302012,0.17693038357254728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868293333246693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209541027155968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16866871953250218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675249323507422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28068042896254136,0.16032775176650982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1795262466062845,0.0,0.1355813140302607,0.17418144536979085,0.0,0.0,0.1877143026725558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11700244781530365,0.11284686710569647,0.0,0.0,0.10269360531498004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11956998022169035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14531265778735944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966252130269681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1282132338890882,0.1788525171835815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,glitterpiller,2020/04/13,"Am a newly minted Homeschool teacher. 1st grade kiddo need help with Spelling... Title says it all - unfortunately he inherited my ability to spell. I’ve tried repetition, working with blends, having him write endless lists, coloring in vowels/consonants, using laser pointer to spell out words... needless to say I chose well in not becoming a teacher bc he is now pretty shut down and frustrated with me. Would anyone happen to have any guidance? Strategy, app anything. I am particularly saddened by this as around his age I decided I was stupid and just couldn’t spell and that was that. I thank spellcheck every single day :) And thank you teachers!

teaching,marconono,2020/04/13,"What made you decide what to teach? I'm a first year in college right now and want to become a teacher. I enjoy working with students, and I just enjoy being in a school environment in general. However, I don't know what to teach. I understand that teachers study their most strong subject, but for me, I don't have one. I want to teach in high school as well, making it harder for me to decide. I've tried social studies, however, I find history boring (might be my professor) and I really would like to focus on psychology, but there isn't much of a need. Not the best in STEM subjects, and I enjoy English.

teaching,Teshercohen,2020/04/14,"Interview with esteemed scientist inventor, father, educator, and investor, Dr. Gordon Chiu on Covid-19, Dr. Wholesome Academy, and how to create capable scientists in a discriminating world (Podcast)  I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Gordon Chiu on my podcast to talk about Covid-19, and how it relates to discrimination, how we can create capable scientists despite it, and on creating an academy for education to empower the next generation to create a better life.

In 2018, Dr. Wholesome's Academy (DWA) was founded as a homeschooling resource for his own daughters. With Dr. Chiu's unique background as a prolific inventor and entrepreneur, DWA became a resource for other families looking to supplement their children's public and private school education with Dr. Chiu's philosophy and teachings. Today, the Wholesome Society's mission is to help identify and cultivate individuals to become the rising stars of society, the revolutionary pillars of the world. We want to make possible what others think is impossible.

Dr. Gordon Chiu is a visionary, an inventor, an entrepreneur, public speaker, lecturer, corporate advisor, father and an educator. He has a series patents and collaborations with multiple universities. He gave his first Tedx talk in 2014 in the field of graphene and his second Tedx on “inventing happiness”. Dr. Gordon Chiu is engaged in the research of high level projects involving data analytics. As one who is interested in blending technology, science and cutting edge knowledge to create breakthroughs around the world, his skills range from a former research scientist at Pfizer and Merck &amp; Co. to solid business links with Wall Street and Asia. Dr. Chiu has first hand experience in dealing with the H1N1 influenza in 2009 and predicted the current Coronavirus outbreak in his documentary, Germs: The Invisible Enemy.

teaching,electricmayhem2,2020/04/14,"Podcast? Hi everyone,

I'm an elementary school teacher at a private independent school - currently teaching online for the rest of the school year.

A colleague and I have been thinking about launching a podcast to discuss our experience, brainstorm ways to adapt to this changing climate, with chat with guests who are teaching at different schools or have a different approach to online teaching.

Do you think the teaching community, or even parents of school age kids, would appreciate something like this? It would obviously be cathartic for us to have a platform to share but we would also want it to bring something to listeners as well.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated!",9.593645320197046,10.799244275862069,8.471133004926111,63.84431034482761,58.82758620689656,10.766502463054188,46.74384236453202,10.608840637214634,5.583846305418719,560,35,79,12,7,173,78,116,0.0,0.877,0.12300000000000001,0.9082,4,0,2,0,0,0,12.0,3,1,0,0,4,3,0,0,9,0,12,0,0,2,1,19,19,7,0,5,4,1,0,1,1,4,0,1,0,1,5,4,0,0,3,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,2,1,5,3,18,11,1,9,0,0,0,0,13,3,0,3,4,58,10,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133859435487478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10954626487728107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09315399559040882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14491118579313522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2862387964747295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09047681316041813,0.0,0.0,0.13089433272866005,0.0,0.13399689351244745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06692359109953118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15210481202171286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.693176932220546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2109143547566183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755479678902627,0.0,0.10875020278404277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647752008292743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08079686690206228,0.1087317311296246,0.0,0.0,0.12316530273927832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3892387579840314,0.0,0.0,0.08821337356034496

teaching,PandaRae08,2020/04/14,"Why can’t you follow directions.. PARENTS?? 

Just a quick rant. 

Why can’t parents/guardians/care takers follow very simple easy to follow directions? 

I give STEP BY STEP instructions on how to do something and yet I still have every single parent doing whatever the fuck they want. I do not understand. Why can you not follow a diagram, a very simple “how to” worksheet?????????? I’m just so annoyed that I have to contact every parent through like 5 different platforms cause you can’t handle a simple freaking directions. 

Rant over.

teaching,potallegta,2020/04/14,"How do you respond when your student is convinced s/he just doesn't have the talent for it? I'm currently teaching in a coding boot camp and I've met many students who struggle due to its fast pace. Some are just so slow that they're still catching up to the materials from last week or two weeks ago. Like this older student, for example, who's struggled since the first week here. He just told me that he didn't think he has the talent for programming, and frankly, I do believe that. He's really slow and he struggled with even some of the most basic concepts, his memory is terrible to a point where he can't code a simple program that I've taught plenty of times. He also mentioned that he couldn't sit in front of a computer for long and wearing a headphone often makes him dizzy.

I sorta deflected when he mentioned that he didn't have the talent for it by saying that everyone can program provided that they work hard enough, but I'm not convinced with what I've said either. Maybe some people just are more talented for this and some don't, Idk.

What would be the right response when you're confronted with this kind of situation? How do you motivate and teach students who really fall behind from their peers? How do you do it while still being sincere about it and without resorting to white lies?",6.464117647058824,6.669918941176473,6.310588235294119,80.09764705882355,65.47058823529412,9.466666666666667,31.901960784313733,9.21078282632365,2.6383019607843137,1050,38,199,17,15,330,148,255,0.084,0.836,0.08,0.7747,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,4,2,3,19,14,1,3,12,0,22,1,1,5,0,34,30,18,0,2,9,0,1,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,21,10,0,0,2,0,0,3,8,5,0,2,6,4,11,9,26,20,8,30,0,0,1,0,28,6,0,8,21,131,32,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13697493381213294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357164237804605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740940200807911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15966311997421948,0.0,0.10206069930261208,0.0,0.0,0.14765293633131862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13143681801547782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13842187024761582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16091147674852455,0.0,0.12595651735944596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07549192184023927,0.0,0.0,0.1367476107756787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031450145081178,0.1566616314060605,0.1552386895242743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10712649294468864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14607377354866904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1979822285972836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13196142939004585,0.14698634816505932,0.12288254872804445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12782266563748249,0.17368984148329575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24680384596971905,0.0,0.0,0.4846216178188154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990118226880191,0.0,0.0,0.0901033524583063,0.0,0.0,0.14765293633131862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15094609663219696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3718460519089531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14895424209551109,0.0,0.11249427038318817,0.0,0.0,0.1097683993497181,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,barrel0fm0nkeys,2020/04/14,"Friend just got hired to the abusive position I quit 2 months ago. Do I tell them about it? Hi teacher friends! Keep fighting the good fight ✊

So weird thing happened. A bit of background: I am a public school teacher for middle school, though I’m currently unemployed since I quit my job at the end of January. I left for a variety of reasons, most of them related to a lot of abusive practices at the school and no longer feeling safe there. I got in contact with my union and representatives for Hispanic teachers and all that; I’ve been taking the last few months to physically and emotionally recover.

Cue coronavirus hitting. I’d been trying to hang out with my teacher friend (who is an activist and involved in our union), but now we can’t see each other since we’re in isolation. I’d been looking forward to telling them about the hell my job had been before I left. Today, they posted on Facebook that they were hired to a position at a certain school, and based on the description it was immediately clear that it was the same position I had been in.

Now I’m in a dilemma. I’m so happy for them that they got hired in the midst of all this mess. On the other hand, it feel irresponsible to let them go into this not knowing my experience, and the physical and mental toll it had on me, plus the toxic environment which the coworkers I’m still in contact with can verify has continued since my leaving. What do I do? Do I tell them what they’re getting into? I still have the letters I wrote to my union reps outlining the abuse; but I also feel bad shitting on their success. 

Any insight is much appreciated.

I, along with two of my friends, started teacherr - A Professional Network For Educators after coming across several problems  faced by educators globally with respect to continuous professional development, individual brand building and finding relevant  jobs.
We started our journey in Hyderabad, India in 2019.

I have the highest amount of respect for teachers because everything I have achieved in my life till date has all been because of the guidance of wonderful teachers in my life. This is our way of giving back to the heroes of the  Education sector - teachers. 

 Can you please take a look at the platform and post your suggestions? It would be very useful.

Insert sarcasm For those people who think that teachers sit back and relax and do absolutely nothing during this ""hiatus,"" YES I AM DOING NO SCHOOL WORK. I am answering questions, answering emails, sending emails, calling parents, making sure my son is being fed, take care of the house, doing all the necessary things in order to make sure that my house is actually prepared and cleaned, stressing out and trying to find out any other jobs that will pay me money, checking in on my parents, checking in on the kids, checking in on my students' parents, try not to flip out and turn over tables because my son's child care has gone down the toilet, try not to sit there and cry because I feel completely useless in preparing and protecting my own family, looking towards the government to have some semblance of normalcy that is apparently not happening. So yes I am not doing anything in dealing with teaching and I'm getting money. Notice the sarcasm in my voice. I'm sick and tired of hearing people saying how wonderful it is to be a teacher at this time. I would rather work a business job and know that I can get unemployment or any sort of financial assistance then literally stress out every single day about my kids, my personal family, my family life, and how the heck we are all supposed to survive in this crazy time.",9.658932291666666,8.306958695312503,9.231562500000004,66.87385416666667,59.703125,11.814583333333333,41.25520833333333,10.686352973137794,4.563886458333332,1110,51,180,21,12,358,151,256,0.128,0.7909999999999999,0.081,-0.8812,8,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,1,4,8,8,0,2,9,2,20,4,0,4,4,43,41,17,0,2,6,5,1,0,0,2,3,3,1,4,14,18,1,1,8,1,7,2,6,3,0,0,3,5,19,5,34,34,5,31,0,1,1,0,20,20,1,5,6,128,33,11,0.0,0.0,0.1054540373295966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469732830586752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08892675747432673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309388509655108,0.0,0.13174857550693414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11034454915398986,0.0,0.22035514857961952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1133021473609728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11870228614455122,0.06969178611040497,0.11140835334400633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09104785702540334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3056169359109672,0.0,0.054639971028398335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09876775315364923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693755931071089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555987871053448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1217950137073635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2493807117794212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144719860710948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059388676203434125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632819230163271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907458220503006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426597149552092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10368949827746868,0.12303060227678245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3599739890409301,0.0,0.0,0.14983475111496786,0.0943565665396776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12105544934206855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08593614706749493,0.0,0.10936566791718363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0862993640008897,0.0,0.2475719258378594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2036964630530753,0.0,0.08125003341517224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07179234915242194,0.06924249736037966,0.0,0.0,0.1260249730865843,0.12420268385998172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22010333788335468,0.11754166630603576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11718986675963075,0.2360137610417396,0.0,0.0,0.07676495489003526,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ChefMike1407,2020/04/15,"Is anyone missing their part time gigs? Hello,

I am one of many that work a second job. Unfortunately, that job is kaput for now and word on the street is Extended School Year will not be held (it’ll be my tenth year!) So, I am taking a pretty heavy decrease in take home pay. 

I am also missing my two students I tutor- (very infrequent I might add) so surviving this summer if going to be very, very difficult. 

Anyone have any ideas. I already offered to tutor via Zoom, but the parents don’t seem interested yet. I do not believe we are able to collect unemployment and private student loan companies do not seem to be offering any assistance. Just a few more paychecks left. 

Also, can we get a round of applause for those essential workers- I am having my students write a thank you letter a week for a bunch of different jobs.",2.9119575471698127,5.406907157232709,4.46424135220126,80.75598466981134,78.05660377358491,7.245440251572328,26.91863207547169,8.278499904357787,2.1648518867924533,654,27,117,13,16,218,110,159,0.076,0.8290000000000001,0.095,0.7159,7,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,1,1,3,7,5,0,0,9,0,21,0,0,0,0,18,31,8,0,1,6,1,1,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,5,5,0,1,3,0,2,1,4,3,0,4,1,1,15,2,12,23,4,12,0,2,1,0,10,4,0,4,7,83,20,13,0.14491708432135048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15991960614019354,0.231780279949367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970971735141733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20265878969505904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16327192847525593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1514075090866972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07571319532582531,0.0,0.08235971863534221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14536365139113686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635937488306757,0.0,0.0,0.4314235353479994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15745283613681335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469231778660584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15373412540801482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09819956681976773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609132723581797,0.15693108025324815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14743277338706035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466638260870928,0.0,0.2638541417222211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2179192245119728,0.0,0.0,0.13342018101878436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450231726010075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14156293410603138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3587153145298534,0.0,0.0,0.11624374377881275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550136334008732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18664370201941216

teaching,ariessunariesmoon26,2020/04/15,"Teaching certificate - Georgia teachers .. or anyone else input would be greatly appreciated !! Someone help me In need of some advice.

I recently graduated with my associates in Early Childhood education and I’ve began the elementary education bachelors degree (which requires a good bit more of core classes and an entire teaching program. However with my associates I had to complete a year of practicum and year of internship and honestly I don’t want to do that AGAIN with my bachelors. Ideally I’d love to stay with the pre-K - second grade age. Zero of my classes from my associates to my bachelors transfer for the teaching program  and I almost feel like it was a waste. Even though I’d like to teach pre-k let’s be honest an associates with early childhood will not make a lot of money. I’m currently working as a nanny (and have been for the last 5 years) because i make more than I would in any pre-k classroom. I was so far into my associates there was no way I was giving up on the program without finishing. 

Eventually I’d love to venture into child psychology and possibly school counseling. 


My idea is change my major to psychology and when graduating complete a teaching certification. - which I actually did during my advisement meeting yesterday. 


Also while doing this is like to work as a Georgia Pre-K teacher, which requires a bachelors. With my Early childhood education associates and psychology bachelors I will qualify for a job. (And also plan on going where I interned for a job) 

Can someone give me some advice? Is this a smart choice? 

I feel the teaching certification is the best route.

I haven’t heard back from anyone, and it may or may not be because of the one that shall not be named.

teaching,BucksPackBassAllDay,2020/04/15,"Might be a dumb question...but... Are you supposed to write your own essential question? Or should it be in the curriculum lesson plans if you're going through a big curriculum company who is very up to date?? I'm in my 5th year teaching and when I was in college, ""essential questions"" were mentioned here and there but we never learned about them in depth. I taught in SE Asia my first two years where nobody used essential questions. We wrote ""I can"" statements, but not EQ's.

teaching,HumanHobbit09,2020/04/16,"Adding a content area by taking an exam. How much does this affect getting hired if you haven’t taken many college courses in that subject? I really love Earth/Space Science and biology but my love for science grew for the most part outside of college. I did take one biology college course and a few Earth/Space courses but would have to go back for a couple semesters to get even a minor in those subjects, a couple years full time to get a major. I could just take the test right now and be certified. 

I majored in English and social studies education and have only one class left for my master’s in history (I sort of regret doing this after only one year of teaching, but I wanted to get it out of the way), but I honestly would love teaching social studies, Earth/space, biology or English. Probably in that order of preference, but I like them all. 

Anyway, I passed the content test for Earth/space, so I’m certified in that now, but I’m also considering taking the biology exam. 

Obviously the sciences are more in demand than English/social studies, but I’m concerned principals might take a look at my college transcript and see only a handful of science courses and consider me unqualified. I had a 3.99 gpa if that gives them any confidence in my ability to teach multiple subjects. 

I honestly have zero idea how administrators feel about this. Does anyone have any kind of insight or advice? I know it won’t hurt to have extra endorsements but I want to be prepared for what to expect if I apply for a science job and get an interview. 

I should also mention that I took a year away from teaching for multiple reasons (music opportunities, mental health—unrelated to teaching—and to work on my masters), so although I have taught social studies and English for 3 years, I have to get hired again. I got lucky for my first job. I only applied and interviewed at one place, which I realize is not the norm, and just happened to be perfect timing. 

tl;dr How do administrators view applicants who have content areas added by exam with only a few classes in that subject in college transcript?",8.06501700680272,7.783525331632656,8.517040816326531,67.24700680272112,62.265306122448976,10.629931972789118,39.074829931972786,10.07000556051586,4.162597278911564,1678,80,271,31,21,559,193,392,0.027999999999999997,0.843,0.129,0.9915,2,0,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,1,2,6,16,12,0,0,21,0,24,4,1,5,3,55,54,32,0,12,16,0,2,1,0,5,0,0,0,0,15,13,0,0,7,0,0,4,3,2,0,6,6,5,31,10,51,39,11,39,0,2,3,3,14,21,0,9,13,198,46,31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025557259266656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14772452649125098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12561934361502053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06458201222626138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0867776154410134,0.07102106646201478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07374394600165643,0.20439471382136504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16165410408219294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061004564589824124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046701258574940674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856350102336564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2895335858017895,0.08860253259818716,0.052491741057592994,0.0,0.0738707340908421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816758596510086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09817702556626093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887597371890937,0.1042660276716359,0.0,0.0,0.18331107228042887,0.0,0.0,0.09618133761207844,0.05076001819910378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035213378850183,0.0,0.0,0.04512365536765399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756124354392557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25008230513399804,0.0,0.0,0.09364108493438117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09307968286936824,0.09798202369246732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06789706979742947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503488996262344,0.3512292418311772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001959410539966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964991611535639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099582403907397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05916978687501116,0.09496403985074102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07887707606942229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360095963310985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2824558323156105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3472255519473467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077146408433781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261814341118444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089555989741384,0.07331305870488422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724100491638219,0.0,0.0,0.13122334951275616,0.0,0.0,0.2379137043877499
teaching,madisonroset16,2020/04/16,"How do I know if I am cut out to be a teacher? Hi everyone. So I have a question for you all, how does one know that she/he should not go into the teaching profession? 

A little backstory: 

I have been a substitute teacher for a few years now and I’ve enjoyed it a lot. I realized late in college that I wanted to become a teacher and it was too late to switch my major to elementary education. Anyhow, I  am graduating in early May and I guess I just am wondering if I should teach? I have interviewed for a few jobs and I have been rejected from a few and still haven’t heard back from others. If I don’t get any offers this year, is that a sign that I probably shouldn’t be a teacher? Also, does the fact that I don’t have an education degree really hurt my chances of getting hired at an elementary school? I am a very kind a compassionate person who enjoys helping students but I’m afraid that isn’t enough to become a teacher. What do you think? 

Any input would be great, thank you!",1.9097003647733213,3.916851955445544,4.153345492443981,84.22117509119336,78.95049504950495,7.420948410630538,24.492965085982284,8.371475516178862,1.6591841584158418,773,28,159,16,19,267,112,202,0.033,0.8440000000000001,0.122,0.9444,1,1,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,3,0,0,9,10,1,1,18,0,27,0,0,2,2,33,39,13,0,8,6,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,1,12,7,0,0,6,0,0,1,6,4,0,1,4,1,21,6,16,27,7,15,0,2,0,0,12,6,0,9,8,120,33,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12664175937373046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21538271354989366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12177033865640287,0.0,0.0,0.3497960152044024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2771667053157287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16362992375527802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15132134908824113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1654748586197936,0.0,0.09000057875315062,0.0,0.0,0.1745942851987007,0.1744532183275895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10614648013525224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16952942844321825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15714950832929894,0.0,0.0,0.16490929574695595,0.17406284963676089,0.0,0.3572776922365237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.158719982768995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13463341716779748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10730995677898313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382752900365812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707406499521948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774012978868231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014505321438803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1602704507580174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12646782333031986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579813661344745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10147175502976308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13066495146836385,0.0934058079280472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17173646106253945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11249557705770424,0.0,0.0,0.20395942920535076

I went from teaching math and science to Read180, Gate ELA. My new students (mainly read180) were upset that they lost their old teacher. She said she would gladly provide a reference, but I was just too eager to leave the situation.

teaching,Kelenus,2020/04/16,"Looking to help build online program to help teachers Hi Everyone,

I recently finished a coding project for a local restaurant and am looking to start research on building an online application to help teachers/students. This application will be web based, so no apps needed, and will work on all major web browsers. Is there anything specific that isn't currently available online or a program that isn't user friendly for teachers/students that I can build for anyone here (i.e. Quiz app, grades directory, learning games, etc.)? It'll be free for everyone and I'm hoping this will help teachers until schooling resumes back in physical schools",8.902895752895752,10.30235246846847,7.9222136422136415,66.50756756756758,60.351351351351354,9.586100386100386,44.68597168597169,9.606745405546679,4.992710682110683,528,32,71,9,7,163,74,111,0.048,0.804,0.14800000000000002,0.8861,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,4,0,11,0,0,0,1,8,17,6,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,2,4,12,11,3,10,0,0,2,0,7,4,0,2,6,45,8,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1401289985653146,0.0,0.1649176080225992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15410035360149238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2235064045272925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38299430976784415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15483369082369106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5373134476878149,0.0,0.0,0.199049035549586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3365822466854388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14859900138617002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978774026260342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4056444846288914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14184886766887356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14589843760901802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,mccl0215,2020/04/16,"Elementary Technology Teachers - Help I am looking for help or advice. I am the technology specialist for my building. I normally see \~900+ students. However, with distance learning that has been cut down to \~500. Students are supposed to join my classroom once per week and complete \~30 minutes of technology practice. My school is over 50% EL with the majority of the families not speaking English, or speak broken English. 

For 3rd, 4th and 5th grade, for their core learning I have asked students to do either typingclub, or [code.org](https://code.org). In addition, after they have completed 20 minutes they can move on to something else such as mathplayground, prodigy, code combat, etc. 

I have been using Google classroom questions to have the students tell me what they worked on for the week. I then verify using the analytics for the various program. Here is where I am running into problems. Students are saying they did the work, however they are not actually doing it. 

2 Questions 

1. What are you doing for students that are not doing the work? It is not feasible for me to email or call 300+ families each week. 
2. Do you have a different idea for students to do for distance learning?",6.345184873949576,8.767351966666666,6.365742296918771,71.42533613445379,67.42857142857143,9.131652661064429,37.59103641456583,9.627879704456738,4.248649859943979,963,53,144,22,17,305,119,210,0.051,0.9129999999999999,0.036000000000000004,-0.4696,3,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,0,2,6,3,3,2,1,0,10,0,27,0,0,2,0,26,32,8,0,2,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,7,0,0,6,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,3,5,20,0,29,29,5,14,0,0,2,0,19,7,0,6,5,110,26,18,0.0,0.0,0.14557278445183494,0.0,0.0,0.14577158603926826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1394580119273772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15232383392987844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.312813231117133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15585559283191466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12461614550501975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16636898986354928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812568676856852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999770335910152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168399842659062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526900181113734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1585488758740725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14615932835110693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15886596429337774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14273984134845302,0.0,0.0,0.3342191400166923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11862954259947145,0.0,0.15097254884968606,0.11887275557102085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11484181111086947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303850801895906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25767772850061804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35897633563089604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3258024181322965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,kaiikaii,2020/04/16,"Shitty district tech Vent post (not looking for advice):  
So last year, our district switched over from touch-screen laptops to Chromebooks. My friend who works for Microsoft was helping out with some of our tech issues and even he admitted that his phone is more powerful than our work Chromebooks. They were barely passable during a regular school day, but with remote learning, they're basically unusable. During my first couple weeks of remote learning, I had live classes constantly crashing on me, my audio cut out due to poor connection, and presentation mode lag to the point where students were getting information 5 minutes late. 

I'll be able to figure it out.; for me, it's just frustrating. But my coworkers are struggling and all of us are pretty much forced to use our personal devices. Is anyone else having to use personal devices or pay for devices/internet to do remote learning? Does anyone know if there are student privacy issues  when using our personal devices? Or for public school teachers, if that means those devices can be subject to open record requests?",9.133957219251336,10.002882609625669,8.014331550802144,67.88267379679147,59.80213903743316,10.436363636363636,40.52941176470589,10.230975488527342,4.592426737967916,876,44,125,17,11,269,131,187,0.127,0.8170000000000001,0.055,-0.9489,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,6,0,1,4,6,4,2,1,2,0,14,0,0,3,1,30,22,11,0,2,8,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,6,9,0,0,8,0,2,0,1,3,0,1,4,2,15,1,25,16,4,19,0,0,1,0,20,8,0,5,10,83,21,12,0.14470679842906078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14140580865133026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2023647161245,0.1482692156488502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15637664106985782,0.0,0.0,0.16011532009446108,0.0,0.0933239136919977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12663389446717732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12088396171666987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557747560007504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308752882025685,0.0,0.0,0.11180011350555852,0.0,0.07560332962633406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699391669860193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3020726031068173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07952707200689475,0.11795535447879067,0.16323557161246496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12777875416430692,0.0,0.12151726534193748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15762812574086082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10637614702298648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3790571843605289,0.0,0.0,0.13679469788623602,0.0,0.1385891122413643,0.1472188370354588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29290201107493524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512789649324604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17406446123201014,0.3749406371992034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607506512026745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21069654541201507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931864337895653
teaching,arct009,2020/04/16,"Considering switching major to teaching I (18M) will soon be going to into my sophomore year of college and I am currently a nursing major. However, I am not sure how much I am of a career and nursing. I am considering majoring in Secondary Education - Social Science. This is not the first time I have considered teaching; I was considering a career in teaching high school before even starting college. I have the courses for Secondary Education planned out already. I am on the fence of making that switch or not. What are some things I need to consider before switching majors? Any advice would help.

teaching,FamilyAstronaut,2020/04/16,"Ohio Teachers - any advice? First post here so please be kind! Constructive criticism welcome. But I am hoping that someone who knows the education system in Ohio might be able to offer some help. 

My wife and i moved to Ohio from another state around 2 years ago. She's a former teacher, but stayed home with the kids and then worked as a sub before we moved. She started subbing in Ohio this year, but obviously, that's no longer a viable source of income. As the kids are getting older anyway, she wants to get back into a full-time teaching role whenever things return a little bit back to normal and wants to use her down time to work towards that goal. 

She contacted the licensing office to ask what she needed to do and they just sent her here: 

 [http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Licensure/Out-of-State-Licensure](http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Licensure/Out-of-State-Licensure) 

We looked at it together and tried to figure out the best path. Here are her circumstances. B.S. Spanish Ed., More than 5 years teaching in another state, but teaching license currently expired. Current Ohio sub license. Good relationship with admins in the schools where she subbed this year. 

It looks like the easiest thing might be to first renew her certificate in the state we moved from, which would require 6 credit hours in school (like a couple undergrad courses) and then once she's renewed it, go back to Ohio with  an active license from another state and it would be easier to proceed. it seems like if she did that, she could get a ""one year out-of-state"" license and then once employed work on the real thing. 

But, because she taught Spanish, I wondered if the ""Alternative Resident Educator"" program might be an opportunity for her. That program was frankly pretty tough to understand just from the webpage. 

Any advise? Suggestions? We are just Southeast of Columbus if it matters.

teaching,specialk1502,2020/04/17,"Did Not Pass edTPA I just received my results for the secondary mathematics edTPA yesterday and as you can imagine, I failed with 35/75. For Task 1, I got 10/25. Task 2 was 12/25. Task 3 was 13/25.

It doesn't make any sense. My dad, who is an Oxford alum, said it looked great. Similar responses I submitted to professors got 5/5s. My observers said I was doing a great job in the classroom.

Oh yeah, my mentor teacher has been out the entire semester because of paternity leave so I've pretty much had to do this by myself. And, oh yeah, its a pandemic so its going to be really hard to resubmit reasonabily.

Am I making good points here or am I just blowing steam? Based on what you are reading in this post, did I get graded unfairly??

He'd been coming to class all semester before school closed. 

I get that there is a lot going on out there, and some of the post in this sub recently have made me shake my head and say, ""give the kid a break, you don't know their life.""

But... what? There is no penalty for missing work this semester, per district rules. There is no way he didn't know he was in my class.

teaching,DrinkACuppa,2020/04/17,"A few questions about PGCE course I am currently in the process of applying to start a PGCE in September. 

My fiance is from the United States and we had originally planned for me to move there after I finished. I'm realizing now this might not be the best idea to move before finishing a NQT year. 

Would I be in a better situation to get at least one year of teaching under my belt before moving to the US? 

We are also considering him moving here, but due to the financial requirements of the visa it would mean me working a part time job (for about 6 months) while I complete the PGCE, or waiting until I'm about half way through the NQT to apply. 

I would need to be earning at least an extra £350-400 a month in order to meet these requirements if we applied during my PGCE year - is this an impossible task to do between October and January?

We have created an augmented reality-based kids app, Celeste AR - 3D AR coloring book application for free (containing no ads) for parents to engage their children(of age 2-5) in these challenging times. The application uses augmented reality and games to help children learn name and shape of various things (fruits as of now). It would be really helpful if you could help us spread the word and provide us feedback on the application.Thank You.

I've been working on my binder for months but it was far from finished when we had to switch to remote teaching. I was lucky enough in all the madness to pick up everything I had gathered already to finish my binder but a majority of things I think I need are on my classroom desktop and across several classrooms in the school. Looking at what I have now, I don't feel confident.

teaching,tkcal,2020/04/18,"Online teaching advice required (and gratefully accepted). Hello colleagues

I'm in a bit of a pickle. The institution I lecture at has just informed me I'll be teaching all my classes online using Zoom. There hasn't been any guidance (I guess everyone is in chaos). One of my classes has focussed on an assessment task where students were required to moderate a group discussion - usually as part of a pair or a team of three.

Given that we're all isolating, how easy (or not) do you think this will be for them to do? I'm trying to think of a workaround but it's the main skill being assessed in that class (as opposed to giving a presentation). I don't have a lot of experience with Zoom but I think one important piece of protocol is muting ones microphone when not speaking - which will make any kind of discussion a little stilted.

This an advanced level ESL class for reference and discussion moderation an important vocational skill for the students post graduation. I can easily assess the tangible stuff, but the intangibles that make a group discussion a good one ...these are things I'm struggling to see working in an online environment.

Anyone out there got any gut reactions for me?

Hello friends,

I'm 31 year old male and I have a Bachelors degree in Education and Teaching (qualified to teach sociology and also hold a qualification to be a therapeutic and educational guide for distressed youth).

I worked for about two years as a mentor for at-risk youth and for a year I set up a treatment group for addicted youth and was good at it. But due to life crisis, I have been unemployed for two and a half years.

1. Over the last two years I have developed social anxiety - can you please give me tips on how to live with it and be an educator? Is there teachers with anxiety here? Or should I give up and pursue a career different path?
2. How best to explain the unemployment period of two and a half years in my resume (unfortunately, I treat my father who is ill and confined to the home). Would I be exepted to be an educator again or is it lost?

Additional advice will be gladly received.

Thanks.",3.851141304347826,6.008597266304352,5.761304347826088,74.2396739130435,73.6195652173913,9.165217391304347,27.80434782608696,9.673873057562805,2.882854347826087,763,30,140,21,16,263,110,184,0.105,0.782,0.113,0.5362,5,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,1,0,3,7,8,0,1,15,0,18,3,0,2,0,25,24,18,0,2,3,1,0,0,1,3,3,0,1,1,4,15,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,6,3,0,12,6,26,12,1,23,0,1,0,0,13,7,0,2,14,102,16,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13841137784627475,0.0,0.1240694341119232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015344420279624,0.0,0.13756730676297918,0.15427724934513162,0.0,0.0,0.2913852894745683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13324269209745576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13265215623451432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09809340188058063,0.0,0.0,0.24359417960711044,0.0,0.106492823782517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273569713382912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349400933550114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08967964428523026,0.0,0.0,0.11211305866354143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13859808385497635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1332291673267032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13937023568724058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588511288580347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689297845331215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4961082462903932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243255778502957,0.0,0.0,0.09019280609849907,0.0,0.15427724934513162,0.4905705734771087

I am an English summer camp director and I am looking for some support in taking our program online, as it seems many of our programs will be unable to go ahead in person as planned in June and July.
 
My team and I need to brainstorm around 50 fun activities that can be run online (Zoom style). They should be 20 minutes in length and engaging for students. 

Ideas like Yoga and Dance are welcome, but hoping to find some things a little outside of the box. Accepting all suggestions, long and short, fully though out or still in the seed stage!

teaching,MediumArmadilloBed,2020/04/19,"Depressed About Teaching in a Deeply Conservative State Far Away From Home Long story short, I left my super liberal hometown in California in order to attend grad school in a deeply conservative area. I received my MA last year and, unfortunately, could not find a job in my field. Even though I missed home, I decided to stay where I had just finished my MA as I was in a relationship and had a great friend group. Fast forward a year, and I have just about earned a teaching credential. Student teaching was rewarding in many ways, but also a bit of a grueling experience as I faced huge culture shock at a rural, and staggeringly conservative school.

I really do not want to have to teach in such a school again, but I fear that may be my only choice given current openings. I have an MA in International Affairs and it is exceptionally difficult to have worked so hard to learn about other cultures to have to listen to the most outwardly hateful, racist, and willfully ignorant young adults I have ever encountered. The schools here are so obsessed with standardized tests that I will have little autonomy in how/what I teach. The fact that I have specialized knowledge and speak 3 languages will never be used here. In fact, having an MA actually disadvantages me as school districts with tight budgets will want to hire somebody they can pay less. I just felt a real sense of disillusionment in the sense that I thought I would be able to really ""reach"" my students. I naively thought that giving my students a different perspective would get some of them to genuinely reflect upon their own beliefs at least a little bit. But I can say that even after 12 weeks, they were every bit as racist and intolerant as when I started. I just really do not want to have to face students (and co-teachers) that hold beliefs that make me cringe. Disagreeing politically is one thing, but having to listen to hate speech (some of which implicates my ethnicity) is another. Any teachers in rural/conservative areas? Is it this bad at your schools? Do your administrations make an actual effort to stop such egregious behaviors?",9.130052356020943,8.878569047120422,8.786748691099481,66.08514921465972,60.09947643979057,12.037905759162307,38.4717277486911,11.407655852321104,4.535980732984293,1704,74,283,42,20,548,208,382,0.18,0.782,0.038,-0.9955,3,0,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,2,4,5,21,16,2,2,21,0,37,2,2,3,4,60,55,23,0,6,12,4,3,0,1,7,0,5,2,1,14,12,0,7,10,0,2,3,4,11,0,1,9,8,38,5,52,35,9,52,2,3,0,0,23,30,0,4,17,204,52,23,0.09444217277066964,0.0,0.1843238743539357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07552537144368728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0642239160441547,0.09903085271478557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887315301642635,0.0,0.07885526941131711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30931917707182666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07540439012783942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08134290501990636,0.0,0.0,0.09867196955352966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247563288193651,0.08542835218750193,0.07957160381680073,0.0,0.0,0.0923825670018498,0.0,0.10627370085395303,0.0,0.0,0.09067929637027623,0.0,0.08631843494817204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07296578840868052,0.0,0.04934213731574208,0.09059753778565424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412282888982197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0846016364692941,0.18648418637523145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1894663992661428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09371928380856888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07698297583698281,0.0,0.0,0.1026116970494006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18931173593045572,0.0,0.08357835098018232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608176735982438,0.09574953990430107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283962581601144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06399646045204804,0.07182752811938882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749586863593788,0.18150622262080612,0.0,0.0,0.10139554955919927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07510420641848968,0.0,0.5734831252253108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06684665597827552,0.1006627902426014,0.0,0.0789578852768414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274318309589716,0.0,0.09278895523808096,0.1499530717736873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08156771444402497,0.0,0.0,0.16711332123738967,0.0749638008240583,0.07575581433258705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06875502657789648,0.0,0.0,0.134178019715943,0.0,0.0,0.12163532571209568

teaching,huff_le_fluff,2020/04/20,"Transition to Teaching Hello all!  I have a BA in psychology that I completed about a year and a half ago.  I've been working in early childhood education during and since then, and from my view of teaching (even the little ones) it is something that I would really enjoy and excel at.  I know I don't want to be a 'preschool teacher' forever; I have aspirations of finding fulfillment in a more advanced setting.  One problem for me is that my degree is, to be frank, not worth much on its own.  To obtain a teaching license in Indiana I would need to go back to school for a second Bachelor's degree in education, go back to school for a Master's in education, or go through an alternative route such as an approved transition to teaching program.  Most of these programs require much of the payment upfront and I have other things that have to come first on my money list.  I'm having trouble finding a program that I can afford to do, especially because I barely make enough to save any money.  There are a few programs that begin as an 'internship', which is mostly just throwing you in a classroom.  These programs are much less reputable than the traditional license route and it seems many 'real' teachers see them as an easy way in.  So, do you have an opinion on any of these alternative routes or know of any other way I can earn my license without such a large monetary investment?  I know everyone has to pay for school, it is just difficult and frustrating because I did and am paying for school.  I have earned my degree and some experience so I don't want to do a T2T program and have my future coworkers not see me as a 'real' teacher.

teaching,bunniesandbabies,2020/04/20,"I have severe social anxiety and have been very low energy lately. What can I do to raise my energy and communicate well with new children? I’m an 18 year old elementary education student and I work at a preschool part time, for children that young I’m energetic and it is easy for me to engage. But, for older children it is significantly harder for me to keep high energy and have open conversation. I’ll be leading a multiage group of six children from ages kindergarten to sixth grade as first responders childcare, it is more of childcare than teaching but I thought this would be the best subreddit to post this on.

Despite these roadblocks, I know I want to be a teacher I love kids and want to see them grow into awesome adults. I just need tips on how to get back my roadblock of social anxiety and low energy, if anyone could help I’d be so thankful.

teaching,talkinglikeajerk,2020/04/20,"Possibly interested in teaching, but have numerous questions for English teachers! Hello, everyone!

I just wanted to maybe get some advice from all of you about teaching. 

I've been debating between nursing and teaching for a while now. I took a semester of nursing pre-reqs, and then switched to education this semester just to explore something different. With that having been said, I've been really surprised with how much I've taken to my English class. This shouldn't have surprised me as I've always had a love for reading and writing, but I've totally been geeking out over this class! I feel such a sense of satisfaction when it's time for peer reviews and I'm tasked with critiquing an essay. Also, I'm one of the few students making an A in the class and I feel so proud of this (I was seriously anticipating hating this class!). 

So, now, when I consider a future that is absent of this, I feel disappointed. I'm at the point where I'm strongly considering if maybe teaching English would be a wise choice for me. I catch myself fantasizing over teaching English/literature/composition in a way that would be engaging and helpful.

So, my questions to all you English teachers out there:

1. Do you recommend this route?
2. Have you had any issues with English teaching jobs not being in demand?
3. Is there any advice you would give to someone considering this route?
4. Who is this route NOT for? (likewise, who is it for?)
5. What are the expectations vs. reality of this job?
6. Do you consider yourself to have a good work/life balance?

Additional information: I'm in my mid-twenties, in the Houston area, married, and have a baby on the way. If I were to teach, I would prefer to teach grades younger than middle-school.",3.890753356040874,6.47705095652174,5.061588859947907,77.27408435183334,75.14906832298136,7.6330995792426375,31.194550190342607,8.558390810932622,2.8565673011420563,1376,67,235,28,31,453,168,322,0.033,0.8240000000000001,0.14400000000000002,0.9893,3,0,1,0,0,0,56.0,0,6,0,2,16,13,1,0,18,0,29,1,0,2,3,45,46,21,0,10,9,0,3,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,18,14,0,0,8,1,0,3,3,4,0,1,11,4,22,9,44,27,6,28,0,1,0,1,17,15,0,5,8,168,40,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741134468860766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11216282270148847,0.116704383929173,0.0,0.0,0.1907580345719149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14653786423137508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13402079797902033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21275322831869772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327806925894519,0.13454651560926675,0.0,0.11764023590743528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13847394811313246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940107662012392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463910203498569,0.2783652489910293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12658668544651105,0.0,0.0936220944561294,0.0,0.28181238469346503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10310443610852532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09504122270431883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13258743226664085,0.15811777785234096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3142380589197836,0.0,0.1402941431050608,0.0,0.0898517053624104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334157529309152,0.0,0.0,0.14194674996269852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883861276486468,0.10797606565713053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178451100999712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15582978532770966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272673347031878,0.22265766695706427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10210817515333534,0.0,0.0,0.3985358866340025,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,dnewport01,2020/04/20,"Remote Teachers: We're running our companies apprenticeship remotely for the first time. We could use some teacher knowledge and wisdom. Also posted in r/Teachers  


\*\*\*Background\*\*\*  
My company does programming mentorships. They are are usually around 10 people (14 this time) with little to no experience and we pay them a livable wage while we teach for three months to write code and skills related to a career in programming. At the end of the program we permanently hire any of them that graduate the program (about 90% do) as a junior. It's a great program and changes people's lives. I know because I came into the company almost 6 years ago through this program.  
\*\*\*Background\*\*\*  


So I am helping coach our new apprenticeship, which was delayed from starting in and in person classroom at the beginning of April. Instead, we are starting remotely in mid May.   


In person, we would normally meet M-F, 9-5, with an hour for lunch. Our plan for mornings is to start with a 9am warm up exercise which is usually reading an article, doing a small programming challenge, or writing us an email about how their week is going (we like to check in a lot to try to catch areas they are struggling with early). Then at 9:30 a 30 minute group call to talk about the schedule for the day and review homework. We would then use the rest of the morning to do a lecture (on Meet, Zoom, or something similar) on a single topic. That usually takes an hour or two, and would have a break in the middle.  


After lunch, we would normally let them work on their own to do homework for the rest of the day. Traditionally we don't start putting them in pairs and groups until 4-6 weeks in. However, doing this remotely, we were thinking of having them pair with a different person each afternoon for two hours for a homework assignment and then work individually for the rest of the day on a second homework assignment.   


Every other Monday would be reserved as a catch up day, in case anyone falls a little behind. Fridays we do one on one's where they each talk with a coach for 30-60 minutes about how things are going. We also plan to work in some end of day meetings that are just times for everyone to talk and ask questions with no topic set.

I have some questions:  


1. I'm looking at different meeting/presentation tools, mainly Google Meet/Hangouts and Zoom because I am more familiar with those. Any recommendations or advice on this?  

2. Have you used Google classroom and was it worth it?  

3. We have always seen these groups bond really closely (they are going through something together that is really difficult and scary) and they become a great support network for one another. We were hoping not to lose that and thought pairing them each afternoon for a couple of hours would help build that. Is this logic sound? Any advice?  

4. Do we have any blindspots here, in relation to remote teaching?  

5. What have you found to be most difficult with remote teaching?  

6. Did anything surprise you about teaching remote?  

7. Lastly, what advantages have you found with remote teaching that we could take advantage of?

teaching,MikeThePikerrr,2020/04/20,"Assignment ideas Good day. I don't know if this is the most appropriate sub to be posting this in, but alas.  


I teach English as a foreign language. My pre-quarantine, classroom classes were going well. Progress on the students' side was somewhat slow, but it was legitimate progress nonetheless. I've been teaching through online means for a couple of weeks now, and I fear that my students haven't really grown at all.   


I've been arranging speaking and writing activites for them. They have the bad habit of memorizing scripts instead of learning words for the former, and using a translator for the latter. I want to make activities and assignments based on giving opinions because I know it'd be useful for them, but I'm at a loss. I can't really come up with anything. I'd appreciate any and all suggestions. Thanks in advance!  


In case this is pertinent, they're basic level students. Teaching on video conferencing apps isn't quite an option because I live in a third world country with an overwhelmingly terrible internet connection.",6.066290322580645,8.398902940860214,6.184709677419361,72.80706451612905,67.9784946236559,9.261075268817203,36.593548387096774,9.725611199111238,4.0961832258064526,841,45,132,20,15,267,122,186,0.105,0.753,0.14300000000000002,0.7609,0,1,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,3,5,3,8,0,2,12,0,15,0,0,3,2,30,27,10,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,8,0,0,6,1,0,4,4,5,1,1,5,1,12,3,24,19,4,23,0,2,0,0,7,13,0,5,5,85,18,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138559030016248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17109180440594293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17359574907161293,0.2534794043052973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17909562567230372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23004790851662305,0.0,0.13408442831556752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339559910717493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19944573841868402,0.11815976077785605,0.1743846253621646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2347045199628734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22852324905379126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18358789859094451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878120645898362,0.0,0.0,0.22647439750729215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1991198306039191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22113734655559114,0.0,0.0,0.2663843005228997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914151351332176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3591341097349102,0.0,0.0,0.12263041052559967,0.0,0.16677246091189052,0.0,0.18693561045795887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Are there steps I can take to do something about this situation? Is there another subreddit to better aid me in this? It was a preschool I worked at. I was forced to resign due to the difficult work environment. It was taking a toll on me physically and emotionally. I had only been there for about four weeks. I researched Glassdoor and it seems they have had problems with a toxic work environment in the past. Especially the classroom I was working in.

teaching,sept16,2020/04/20,"Advice on how to deal with a colleague So, it's my third year teaching and my first year at my school. I teach 6th and 7th English. 6th is going fine. I am having issues with 7th because of my colleague. There are four of us in the 7th grade English dept. Three of us are new this year and then there is R. She has taught for many years. We had another teacher until November but this teacher, B, retired and was head of the dept. Since then R has been in charge. Before B left, I got along fine with R. Now, I am having issues with R. 

I get that we are all under a lot pressure but it started even before then. She would make up the tests that all of our students would have to take and I would say things like it seemed a lot or we hadn't gotten to it and she would brush my thoughts aside. Then I'd give the test (she has my kids for homeroom) and she'd hear from my kids and would chide me. One time, she put punctuation on a test and we had never even studied it! It was a test on clauses. I brought it up and she again brushed it aside.

She has taken me aside and said that I was a loose cannon. When I was hired I was told that I had 85% autonomy.

So, we started studying poetry and I have two master's degrees in creative writing. She said that I could teach it however I wanted. So I had the kids write a sestina. In the middle of the meeting, in front of everybody, she criticized me teaching it and said that we should only have them read and respond to poetry. This really upset me because I am passionate about teaching writing.

This is not the only issue that I've had with her.

I feel like it came to a head last week during a meeting, we were talking about having enough grades for the kids. I joked that I was not worried. She then said that she doesn't even want to ask my students if they had a good week because of all the work that I give them. They just complain. Then she said that she didn't want to do narrative writing as it would be too much work to grade and I said that I wanted to. She asked if I wanted to grade it and I said yes. Then she said, ""Well, you'll do whatever you want. That's what you always do.""

Thanks for reading!

teaching,amnaas,2020/04/20,"Am I making a mistake by going into teaching? I'm a junior in college atm, majoring in History 7-12. I've always thought that I wanted to be a teacher (since like the 4th grade) but ever since I started college, I've been having doubts about whether this is really for me. I'm completely incapable of doing any work at home, and working on assignments such as designing unit plans is making me realize that I don't have the drive to put in the effort it takes to pull all of it off. Teaching a classroom, and engaging with students in lessons all day sounds really fun, which is why I was originally set on teaching, but I severely underestimated just how much goes on behind the scenes. I had thought that I wouldn't mind the paperwork part of teaching all that much, because I've never had a problem with grading assignments or papers in the past (frankly, I enjoy it), but the whole ""lesson-planning"" and ""unit-planning"" is extremely exhausting and difficult for me, more than I can put into words. 

I've talked to some teachers already about this, and I've received mixed responses. Some say the workload never changes, because every classroom brings a new challenge (understandable), but others say that after a few years under the belt, things get tremendously easier. Obviously I understand that more experience will make managing the work easier, but I'm still worried about how much ""designing"" I'll have to constantly be doing. I just really enjoyed the idea of being in the classroom with students and teaching them history, but I don't know if that's worth the mental drain of having to work outside of the classroom. I hate the idea of taking work home, which sounds insane as teacher-in-training - i know - but I always figured I'd get stuff done in school, either by coming in early before the school day started or during lunch breaks. 

TLDR: I guess my question is, does the behind-the-scenes work get lighter over the years? I'd appreciate brutal honesty please, I'd rather know now than later if I'm making a mistake. If it's relevant, I'd be teaching in New York, so I'd be working under the state-wide regents exam curriculum.",9.266890789473685,7.974262107500002,9.081526315789477,67.44957894736842,60.425,11.821052631578945,40.30263157894737,10.771109862388434,4.464775,1713,77,284,34,19,558,202,400,0.10400000000000001,0.7859999999999999,0.11,0.3778,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,0,0,1,11,13,14,2,1,27,0,27,2,0,7,7,67,55,24,0,9,17,0,0,1,0,2,1,4,2,0,18,12,1,0,13,0,2,8,5,8,0,0,7,4,22,6,48,41,15,48,0,0,0,0,6,19,0,10,20,187,40,32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950294811432653,0.0,0.15005447788965387,0.0,0.0,0.0613175279223379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10993150304942907,0.0,0.07672657197987702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09538609294011356,0.07767199616747253,0.09453973456786326,0.09743988658394924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630217279902075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07890687656510857,0.09227346450530534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815623788343131,0.07597067166548087,0.0,0.0,0.08820188771700947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14132762694783754,0.0,0.05124471606626399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09933053502425764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902251691781136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18089228970963533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2035780439261053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14866239913498933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04405167099811588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24075212994699896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086842661487046,0.0,0.09104426690924053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19885219998798004,0.0,0.13908668498991125,0.1741701890763476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09764346919586067,0.08607583376274437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897770332442153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08627887423526923,0.0,0.18128806841301454,0.10100911867390326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17329234277738045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434108836024461,0.0,0.1825102428603935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10186450019010684,0.0,0.1491762794085652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12764315684658042,0.0,0.07200851136586504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032211173207596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13559066216508914,0.07247385447490162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05990380404044497,0.0,0.0,0.14316709773975644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18773673577185127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05318359251156712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08136285524611066,0.100669673588125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4595051135413395,0.09157027345631504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11613084252860525
