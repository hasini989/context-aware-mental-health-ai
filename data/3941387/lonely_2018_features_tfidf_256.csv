lonely,TTKolos,2018/01/01,"My parents the only reason I keep moving... Hey there, it’s my first time I post here and my english is not good enough since i’m not a native english speaker but anyway it is understandable.

Hmmm... I don’t know why I am posting here but anyway, tell me is it worth it to keep living if u have an impossible crush which u will never have it and u can’t imagine ur self with anyone else except her because of a 
stupid, 
ugly, 
lonely, 
depressed, 
without a specification of what the heck am I gonna do with my life,

Yeap that’s me a total loser in life ! 
I just can’t imagine my life with anyone else my friends. Even if I will find someone I will never ever love her deeply. I can’t imagine how I will grow my kids thinking that I never wanted to have them with their mom.

To tell you honestly one night  I was so idiot that I thought I could end all my pain suiciding.
Wrote a letter to my parents let it to my room.
Then went to the top of a flat and was gonna just jump a sec before my mom called me. 
Thinking that she saw the letter. 
I couldn’t do it before hearing her voice one more time and with that sweet voice she has, said me “Hey Kolos please when u come back home buy a pack of eggs” 
Oh God what a stupid dump idiot I was. 
Asking my self what am I doing? Do my parents deserve this you stupid idiot stupid moron stupid stupid stupid!!!!
But... I am sure that after my parents will be gone I will do that, I lost interest in life I hate doing everything and my parents are the only reason I keep moving.

lonely,whyareyoualwayslying,2018/01/01,"Why do you feel lonely? Hello,

I am interested in learning more about loneliness. It is a very dangerous and common feeling. The reason I want to learn more about you guys is because of the fact that there is a difference between solitude and loneliness. The interesting part is what do you think caused your loneliness? Moving to a new city? Not having family?
(English is not my first language - please pardon me).

I feel that I have a hard time meeting new friends and keeping them because I'm either way too werid for them, or my past scares them off. :( I personally don't think I'm that bad of a person.

lonely,eightbitter,2018/01/01,"I wanted to see fireworks [sorry, long] I live in a downtown area. I wanted to just walk around, have a few drinks and watch the fireworks at midnight. 

Some time before midnight, I couldn't take it anymore; watching couples or dates or whatever walk around and be happy while I was alone. I know that's a shitty side of me, but it is what it is. I'll work on it sometime, maybe. 

As I was walking back to my place, I came across a woman sitting on the sidewalk, the contents of her purse had been vomited on the concrete. She was picking at it like a curious vulture. 20$ here, a driver's license there. 

I asked if she was alright and she said she was. I kept walking. Something didn't seem right though, and I went back, asked her again, and she said no. She was pretty incoherent. I said I'd help her get back to wherever she was. 

Most of the next few hours was us sitting on the ground, talking about things. Something about dogs, her mom being nearby, being in a mess of a situation. I don't know; it was all rambly and incoherent. 

She wanted me to call her mom, but she didn't have her phone and couldn't tell me the number. I tried to walk her into the hotel nearby because that's where I thought she was staying. She refused. She just walked away every time I tried. 

eventually I had to pee, and my place was close by. I figured I could at least get her water and food and maybe call the cops while she wasn't paying attention. She seemed averse to getting any kind of help, except when her feet hurt, in which case she was fine with me carrying her. 

She was light, but I'm out of shape, so it was a bit of a struggle for me. I made it a few blocks but she had to walk the remainder. We got into my apartment and I could finally pee, thank fuck. I changed and came out to her crying with my cat in her arms. He's super chill and good for a cry or two. Really, the best cat in the world. 

I got her water, and tried to feed her, but she wasn't having it. She kept saying that she had to go home. I said I'd walk her there if she could just point me to it. She just kept saying she needed to go. So I agreed. I slapped on some shoes and followed her outside. 

No, there was something in the middle. There was a part of me hoping that she'd just sleep it off. There was that shitty part of me that thought she'd wake up in the morning, see me sleeping on the floor, we'd have breakfast and laugh about the night. That ""nice guy"" part of me that thinks I was right in bringing her to my place. Now, I'm pretty sure that was fucked up. I should've pressed for a number of anyone she knows. I didn't. My loneliness told me that we'd be cool tomorrow. She'd like me tomorrow. I'd have a ""chance"" tomorrow because I was good, because I helped, because I didn't do anything to her in a night where her vulnerabilities were strung out like pearls on a string. 

I'm an asshole. 

Even more of an asshole because I didn't notice the ring. 

We sat outside of my place and I finally got a number out of her. I called. They were worried. The family was in town and everyone was freaking out, wondering where she was. Someone was coming to get her. Frantic conversations. Her drunken incoherence sputtering into my phone like hesitant diarrhea. 

I had to keep her from walking into the street. I had to tell people my address over and over and over. Now I was exhausted. Now I saw the ring. It was a fucking glimmering rock of Gibraltar. I don't know why I didn't see it before. The asshole part of me? The asshole part of me. 

I'll call him Henry. Henry finally arrived. He was tall, burly, handsome. Everything you'd want. I thought about him folding me over like a thin green twig. He carried his fiance to the taxi. They thanked me. She said that I should come with them. I said I have to sleep. 

Instead, I'm sitting here, writing this, and stewing over the fact that I'm alone, instead of the fact that I helped someone find a missing loved one. The asshole part of me? The asshole part of me. 

I hate that I look at every interaction through the lens of my loneliness. She wasn't someone in need, she was someone that could stop the constant ache of me being alone. This other woman? She's not a server, she's someone I should ask out. That one? That's not a coworker, that's a possible girlfriend. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I do know that I'm not dealing well with this right now. I know that I need a friend, or I'm gonna break. I know that I just wanted to see some goddamned fireworks. 

My new year didn't start with a bang, but with a whimper. 

Cheers. Good luck. Happy new year.

lonely,D0lmi0,2018/01/01,"No time Hello. I apologize in advance for the grammar mistakes in this text.

So I'm 17yo kid who goes to upper secondary school. I've got some ""friends"", but I don't have any real friends. It's hard to try to manage my time as I play sports and I have trainings 5 times a week and games on weekends. I'm also kind of a nerd, I go to ict school and I like computers and coding. That takes up so much of my time that I haven't for the last 4 months gone outside the house for anything other than to school or training.

These holidays are hard as fuck for me. Because we have break from trainings and no school I don't see anyone else than my family. And it hits me hard. In school and trainings I try to give everyone the picture that I would be social and cool and all. But when I go to bed it's not unusual for me to cry myself to sleep over my loneliness.

I've never had suicidal thoughts because in my opinion suicide is selfish way to push your own problems to someone else. But lately it's been lurking in my mind, the idea of ending my own life. It's scary to be thinking suicide even tho I don't have balls to do it.

It has been nice to share my feelings.

lonely,Notaclichehopefully,2018/01/02,"It's my birthday (!) Hey

I'd like to make new friends (I'm 27m) regardless of gender and someone to eventually meet if we get along. 

Photo - https://imgur.com/a/uSKVh

Preferably in London, not too worried about distance if effort is two sided. A quick summary about myself : 

• first and foremost. I'm willing to talk to anyone ! Whether you have something you'd like to get off your chest , talk about your past or want advice, I'm happy to hear you out . I'm far from boring , just very open minded and can be interested in anything given the chance.

• I adore animals , dogs/bunnies especially. Happy to share derpy pictures. Thinking about going vegetarian, just not sure how. Interested in advice.

• I do competitive athletics which is important to me, I'll be a certified coach this year. That said , I love training as much as being a slob and watching brainless TV covered under 5 blankets with my puppy and food which would be worthy of a triple heart bypass.

• very much into music, I play guitar, bass and piano. Currently enjoying a lot of 80s glam and pop for some reason. 

• I have a sense of humour which wavers between being dark and being exceptionally dad jokes.

• somewhat tattooed , pierced. Quite old fashioned , laid-back and very loyal.

• as evidenced, I have a bunch of mental illnesses however I'm very good at compartmentalisation so I tend not to share too much of this with people unless trusted.

Anyway feel free to message me on here and we can take it from there.

Thinking how crueler it would now be alone again, waiting maybe full year for another opportunity and socializing event like that, brings tears to my eyes. I hate those days after such good events, full with feelings like that, it's like tasting nice, happy life and then being forced again into painful darkness.",10.430105263157897,10.55578969473684,8.34,69.11000000000001,57.31578947368421,10.968421052631578,36.89473684210526,10.355215969177356,3.842747368421052,451,17,70,8,5,133,75,95,0.188,0.536,0.276,0.8875,0,1,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,2,0,1,10,16,1,0,0,0,4,4,1,1,0,18,10,7,0,1,1,0,2,3,0,1,2,0,0,1,7,8,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,4,1,0,0,4,4,12,9,7,6,17,0,2,1,0,6,5,0,4,14,45,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21918911221879256,0.0,0.0,0.17609653298779426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22191681681697129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13648649275175687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13978233353751254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2070187687616486,0.0,0.0,0.2140171295914103,0.15119145030970166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17750865036687893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22528844517568916,0.0,0.20894486865766132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20841696768328608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22408996469852344,0.0,0.0,0.14948343049821944,0.31018120795268983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21261490882664472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2251936141147109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14672044449841634,0.18479074154731168,0.22111260069066468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20268697609308844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21573432320364566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13560659213295753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902844809224816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503387995048597,0.0,0.0,0.13628542799820634

During all of this I changed locations at work and it really sucks(I work retail at a management level). Two days ago the girl tells me she’s not interested in me in a romantic way. Since then I’ve felt so empty. Over the last two years I’ve gone through so much. Ended a relationship that lasted many years and got promoted at work. I can never find a balance of a good personal life and a good professional life. I know many people if not everyone doesn’t want to get up and go to work, but I don’t want to do anything. I don’t want to be social with my friends, I don’t want to go to work more than ever. I can’t find a balance. I just want to stay in my room and never come out. I hate my job and my dating life has been non existent for nearly two years.

lonely,CandaceSSH,2018/01/02,"Another lonely birthday like always I posted this post in r/depression: https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7nltdi/my_birthday_yesterday_and_my_depression_became/ but it seems that no one cares, maybe because there are several new posts everyday in that sub and my post is kinda long for someone to be willing to read it all. Therefore, I decided to repost it here hoping that some lonely soul will give me some warm attention I've always badly needed.
This is my first post on reddit (actually this copy can count as the second post) even though I've used it for quite a long time and I haven't even made a single comment, either. The reason for that is because I've got severe cyber anxiety (scientifically discovered yet or not). Despite having many ideas and experiences to share online, the fear of being attacked, mocked, insulted or looked down prevents me every time. Like many of people here, I've also got social anxiety and depression, accompanied with a naturally boring personality, which make it nearly impossible for me to make friends and maintain relationship. In my secondary and high school, I used to have a number of close friends who valued me, wished me a happy birthday every year and even gave me small birthday presents but not anymore since I went to college and suffered from depression for the first time. I didn't contact them anymore so they probably thought I lost interest in them and let me go too, while it was just my depression which kept me from maintaining relationship in my life. Throughout these years, I've only got groupwork mates, fake friends (been bullied and stabbed in the back by them) and some regular acquaintances, all of whom don't care to be my close friends inspite of my kindness and will to be friends with them. Yesterday was my birthday and I planned to turn the internet off that day because I didn't want to stare at the truth that no one would care about me, no one would wish me a happy birthday although they all got notification of it on SNS. Today, I turned on the internet trying to trick myself that today was just another regular day, no birthday ever happened in order to be less hurt but it was in vain because I still feel like sht knowing that no one cares just like previous years, no messages of birthday wishes from anyone, even one college friend who treats me quite well (but he probably doesn't consider me a worthy friend, which I've felt so far). I'm not the type to show my misfortune and vulnerability to anyone beside my parents because I'm really scared to be laughed at or attacked, it took me much of my courage to share it here for I couldn't keep it in my chest any longer. I didn't intend to make it this long at first. I have longed for someone's empathy even if it comes from a stranger on the internet because I need to feel that I'm still connected with the world, to feel that someone still considers me a human being with the need of being cared for, not an unworthy person for anyone to give a sht like I've been. Although I have wanted to take my life and nearly attempted to do it many times, I couldn't do it because I've still got my parents who love me. Maybe in the future after they've left me, I might do it but not now, so I need a reason to keep going. Thank you for taking your time to read all of this post. :)",11.76921757770632,8.325798898713828,10.510104501607717,65.87074088960345,57.60128617363344,13.324866023579853,42.154608788853174,11.038039088145766,4.492912968917472,2673,101,476,46,24,843,269,622,0.16,0.669,0.172,0.9018,2,6,0,0,0,0,67.0,0,2,6,8,28,51,5,2,25,0,41,4,1,10,6,89,97,33,0,15,18,2,5,5,8,6,2,0,0,3,39,22,0,4,12,3,0,5,19,19,1,9,22,7,58,32,78,58,11,75,1,8,2,1,39,28,0,11,39,326,97,6,0.0,0.0,0.04924763277106945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0403577211122994,0.08398367419356638,0.0,0.0,0.03431867785492858,0.10583620997763582,0.07721285515840144,0.0,0.10009761906309196,0.1058612093822997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11482494619878428,0.0,0.038805315020479375,0.04213708466842859,0.21534565865309008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25726775643842154,0.0,0.0,0.04347207568767073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06509291775710667,0.0,0.17386550837186412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16666191205826544,0.04564947575580136,0.08503972993211244,0.0,0.0,0.04936552847646535,0.0,0.056788391750362724,0.07655152792542387,0.036052991186779564,0.0484553691510118,0.0,0.0,0.12877931400624748,0.0,0.0,0.2729298801360476,0.0,0.0,0.09682336130291352,0.05736209407113825,0.0,0.20181174755537964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044627004651092025,0.10744420153076867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053320204341438894,0.0,0.05012422326427081,0.0,0.0,0.05402500271058404,0.05697008298088387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971317508096817,0.0,0.05255267614326814,0.02773484819064217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054831564191209305,0.051605005378220124,0.07129139632277287,0.123275934074708,0.0,0.0,0.1786436380468013,0.04237881292182402,0.0,0.055089708508742084,0.0,0.045547624647225136,0.04775224306332522,0.1010595388116872,0.15349411016018594,0.10139995903740713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053536555914207036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03709838944569943,0.1496798917264297,0.0,0.04874047285805251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17098567367019088,0.038381742355143765,0.0,0.0,0.11207326128896804,0.0,0.0,0.03498683875038107,0.0881301021024227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3383280088558783,0.0,0.10882198048067808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10735381649605508,0.1009595116234165,0.0,0.03232987525761094,0.10377510971329394,0.0,0.10836340776396224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05052536894972686,0.05107438641267235,0.0,0.045942441126901414,0.0,0.1140246544611285,0.0,0.04174607856911275,0.0,0.0,0.05144383255279746,0.12827928566227065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16120916730420354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07588845168177367,0.0,0.0,0.04646240359606836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049582686006281206,0.04006444546312071,0.14713594073107442,0.0,0.09567192195235162,0.0,0.05606969284272241,0.03426316851794872,0.1097852479454497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08717301241620795,0.0,0.0,0.059532425406450526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0453750837076198,0.0467825793421132,0.0,0.0,0.17410056970792226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07169933752837247,0.0,0.0,0.09749553941921263
lonely,LappingitUP21,2018/01/02,"I'm gonna miss High School now that I am recently graduated. I know it is a stereotype to hate High School because of all the horrible people and that it is a place that brings out the facade of friendship and love, but it is more than that. 

High School gave me a purpose and a domain to make friends. Of course there was the loneliness and the sadness but this last year of HS makes me really sad. I really got to understand different types of people this year and really reach out to other people I usually wouldn't talk too. I became close with my teachers who I miss dearly. But I never made any close friends or stuck with a friend group I was particularly fond of. I sort of jumped around and enjoyed company of the many different types of people. The last 3 months in 2017 was one of the more life-changing moments. Last day of school party, exams, graduation, going out to pubs and clubs since I just turned 18 and the NYE party I went too. 

It doesn't sound very lonely but it isn't how I felt in those moments but how that all the people I knew and became acquainted with, will be gone. That all the memories and the people I became close with, will be gone, off to university or the army. Currently I am unemployed, and sitting on a deferred university offer, I feel no purpose, I feel so sad. My family is broken apart and I feel the instability at home, with no one to be with. Being told by a person ""I wish we did more things together"" and knowing they're off to the air force permanently, makes me feel sad. I wish I took the opportunity to find and ensure stronger friendships, but I left it all too late for anything to really survive. My 'best friend' is going to leave this shitty rural town, even though I selfishly want him to stay, fuck that, he needs to leave and go live. My father wants me to do University in this hellhole, but I refuse too, I am taking that offer from the uni in Sydney and will do so happily. I guess the nostalgia is hitting me and the present realisation that I really do not have anyone that I can be myself with, I have no one to love. 

In the end, I came up with a shitty resolution. I have 31 days to find employment, to go through a strict schedule ( I guess which will keep me busy) and if that doesn't work ... I'm going to the Australian Defence Force as I fit all the requirements needed, exceed really. But in the end, I just want a strong connection of friendship and love, as corny as it sounds, I would love it. Right now though, I am confused and lost in this world of limbo. Sigh.

lonely,royalcork,2018/01/02,"it hurts so much I dont really know why, maybe its the way i look or act but all girls just seem to hate me either if im at school or in public, they give me looks like they are disgusted by my existence, they always avoid talking to me or even being near me and if im with a friend they would wait for me to go away and than start talking to them and it just makes me feel like there is something wrong with me, i feel like a creep yet i haven't even done anything. I feel like its because im not the best looking person or because im fat but i dont think people who are nearly adults would do something like that. Its not that im not at all popular or anything because i have some friends at school and dont have trouble talking to new people and they often want to be my friend none of the boys at my school have ever done anything. Its been like this for 5 years at my school and it makes it so hard because ive never really talked to girls (and if i once or twice get involved in a conversation with a friend and a girl is talking too they just brush it off as if i havent said anything) .

 it just makes my confidence and self esteem so low and it just kinda stinks you know, i didnt think i cared before but realises now just really hurts me and makes me feel all like empty around my chest. Its so hard to have a crush on a girl because they all avoid me. Also its not just me my friends have pointed it out to me before and its just so embarrassing because they all have someone except me.
even though i have friends and family i just feel so alone and want it to stop.
i wasnt always overweight but noticing no one really care about how i look i kinda let myself go, i want to lose weight and make myself look and feel better but its hard when theres not really any point in changing my self for anyone if no ones going to care.",2.7332148541114054,3.7696414461538525,3.784571175950486,91.88192307692309,74.28205128205127,6.71264367816092,22.166224580017687,6.953978226594392,0.3991158267020336,1444,34,328,13,29,467,163,390,0.16,0.6729999999999999,0.16699999999999998,0.7218,0,3,2,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,9,3,31,31,2,3,10,0,28,4,2,6,7,90,64,43,0,10,32,0,10,7,6,2,2,1,0,9,21,21,3,4,11,0,0,4,16,12,0,3,6,18,51,19,39,53,10,32,0,4,5,0,36,18,0,16,16,230,72,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062261676916511875,0.0,0.0480744585267487,0.10004206260080738,0.0,0.0,0.04088069915143958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042034255815052615,0.0,0.19788021023492547,0.05351566812626213,0.0,0.0,0.05648062611750826,0.0,0.0,0.21987563046187744,0.0,0.10230797008005124,0.0,0.06308765919516651,0.05316740158350499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18387571566917804,0.0,0.06359437995698246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12303835036794485,0.2113652600032017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11911744704720605,0.054378041388498416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056671678700376274,0.0,0.18237765428675146,0.17178651140892615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786711830744259,0.0,0.03140794263786506,0.05766840320870779,0.10249531699610663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16155542644781395,0.0593517523477197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287100797882232,0.0,0.3246760553197208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06607597120642925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061472318615924386,0.0,0.20558626858394324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2524100008712053,0.06725402828485026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20063829478940234,0.0,0.0603942441620201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04419191509485194,0.0,0.046364890413106666,0.058060063264435975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06844205876641722,0.0,0.06402119855022463,0.08147183191689822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833532361159333,0.052490661287485835,0.0,0.0,0.11365742872992332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19255810343232024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05718374347766051,0.0,0.0,0.24336096327568466,0.0,0.054727024214945234,0.1254274541729767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050935789802167834,0.09255991896941318,0.0,0.0,0.04255016200583086,0.0,0.0,0.05025936991162679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415933862244248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703935420572881,0.0590633146857077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063732925442716,0.04771699979536962,0.0,0.07320465874598225,0.0,0.0,0.05424501802537049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540885692756872,0.06572701924544841,0.0,0.038712503557124016

lonely,echopark30,2018/01/03,"In A Relationship But Still Pretty Lonely For the past couple months I've felt pretty alone. I have a family, a partner, and a child but in November I expected my partner was cheating on me. I did some snooping and found out while not cheating per say, she was seeing and talking to a man, flirting and calling me all the names under the sun. It made me feel like crap but we didn't split up as it was just flirting seemly plus we have a kid.

I'm a nightshifter who doesn't get much days off and I work alone so I already had it pretty bad but this destroyed me. Now I feel I can't trust her when shes out. Shes always on her phone but when I'm trying to contract her, it can take a while. I'm not trying to sound needy but I just find it weird how a person who when shes with me has her phone on her all the time but when I need something she doesn't answer back. Its silly I know. 

I don't have much friends due to my job and the ones I do have are pretty pally with her. So I feel I can't talk to them. I would love to meet new friends but due to working the nightshift for the past 8 years, my social skills have dropped off and I've become quite a boring chap. I find it hard to talk to my family as my parents are quite a tough pair, not very loving and have my two sisters to deal with. I rather not add to the problems and I've always been a bit independent. Plus I hate the awkwardness if I did tell them and then we would visit, and no one spoke to her. 

So here I am, quite new to all this reddit stuff, more a lurker on certain subreddits and hardly give any input. How can someone who has a partner and a child, plus family be so alone. It gets me down to the point I weep. The family doesn't understand how hard nightshift is. I already miss a days sleep on Sunday to try and spend time with the family but I struggle to sleep during the day as it is so I'm pretty tired but I've never let it stop me from doing things with them. I've clueless where I've gone wrong with her and I really don't want to get on at her for my sons sake. Poor soul shouldn't see his parents fight. 

Sometimes wish I could just run away but then I think about my kid who I adore and my dumb dogs. 

Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this. I really do hope I've posted this in the correct place, as I said I'm a bit of a newbie at this reddit stuff. Chat rooms and forums were my areas when I was more social on the interwebs lol.

lonely,SimoL15,2018/01/03,"Need someone to talk to (17/M) I'll try not to make this too long winded:

Basically I've been an introvert my whole life, never really had many (if any) friends and was picked on and bullied for a lot of my school career (For my glasses, perceived awkwardness, lack of awareness occasionally etc.).
Through these struggles however I have come to live with my situation and accept that socialising is difficult for me regardless and stayed away from 99% of any unnecessary interactions with others.
I'm sick of it now and just want a proper friendship with somebody. Gender, race, religion etc doesn't matter to me.

I’m lonely, really lonely, I fell for a girl at work someone younger and I should have known better. I asked her out and she said yes... we went on 4 dates and I was serious about her and she kept having to cancel because she was busy. We became close, and then she told me she couldn’t commit because she was too busy but that she still wanted me... I thought that meant when she became less busy I would have a chance, that she wasn’t getting rid of me because I was a let down or not fun or a bad date. I thought that I should stop talking to her but I broke my rule about that because I was lonely... she was kind... she complemented me... (and I know that doesn’t she wanted to date me again), I tutored her so she could pass her exams despite the pain of wanting her and knowing I never would... then I found out she has had a bf for a month and been dating him for longer... was she too busy... was I not enough... am I not what she wanted... why not tell me rather than let me find out.

Guess it was wrong of me to assume anyone gave a shit.,6.00062015503876,7.4320005348837235,6.465116279069767,74.2401550387597,66.90697674418604,8.524031007751939,28.286821705426355,8.841846274778883,2.399905426356589,185,6,30,3,3,60,39,43,0.242,0.758,0.0,-0.8883,0,1,0,0,0,0,3.0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,2,0,4,1,1,0,1,5,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,3,0,0,3,1,6,0,6,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,2,2,2,2,22,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.2799264765465551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29709248401643834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2005738054665943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17486250628989988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2290282289107845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2935495070997959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.316000160529936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3116658751686872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22123818609078852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19886727434034132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18376493566953947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2944497750145157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29240980685299345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31362797119664365,0.0,0.1847234834311225

lonely,The_humanoid,2018/01/03,"Talk to me? So I've decided the girl I've liked and been friends with for over a year just likes that I like her. After I told her how I felt over multiple messages she just said thanks and told me to send more like that because it made her happy, but I didn't. And after she asked if I wanted her to send stuff like that I replied with only if it's the truth. Then she just started a new conversation. We still talk, but she can tell I'm sad and I just need someone to talk to

lonely,justafren,2018/01/04,"Feel lonely :( Recently my ex bf broke up with me and now I feel so lonely. He was always with me, always someone to hold in bed and someone who’s protective and warm arms would wrap around me at night. He broke it off because he felt like he was the parent in the relationship and that I didn’t do my equal share. I feel so guilty that I messed up so many chances to change myself (don’t worry no one cheated) and ruined a relationship with someone who, to me, was the perfect man and someone I wanted to spend my life with, and now I’ve moved back with my parents and back to a bed with just me. Alone. I keep thinking it’s this horrible dream and I’m going to wake up in our room with his arms around me but now he’s gone and I’m alone. I don’t know what to do. I’m not good at socialising so this is only going to make me feel more lonely. I miss him so much but I have to respect his decision and try to move on. The loneliness of sleeping in a bed by myself is so difficult.

lonely,poodlepaws,2018/01/04,"Los Angeles is such a huge city, so why does it feel so lonely? I've lived here for a few years now. I moved here from Indiana. A couple things I've noticed is that people are much more impersonal than in smaller cities or towns. I'll often smile or say hi to someone only for them to ignore me. I feel myself starting to become as cold and impersonal as the city itself. If someone pays attention to me, I immediately assume they want money or are crazy. That's not who I am. I want to be nice to everyone. I can't help but nod and smile at them. It's such a welcome surprise when they respond. 


Is that normal for society? To be generally antisocial? Isn't that an oxymoron? I just want people to feel each other.",1.5936781609195378,3.846832965517244,3.967586206896556,83.83436781609197,81.41379310344827,6.625287356321839,22.77011494252873,7.793537801064563,1.2494735632183909,560,19,112,10,15,194,93,145,0.075,0.775,0.15,0.8649,0,2,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,4,0,10,5,0,0,6,0,10,0,0,0,0,22,17,12,0,5,7,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,10,3,0,1,5,0,2,1,3,2,0,0,0,5,14,3,17,15,4,9,1,1,0,0,10,4,0,6,4,79,24,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308585865519807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312890959535216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1829246505025743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1997383117428408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31707743337618394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14010923684864102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1845784183255816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22216713192533602,0.15366201598604282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20480623785494145,0.0,0.2379834570579187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15897768058046985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2898318905855025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662300353480398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3542229898859581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14795339057642162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388710704932212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3698761310602268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18861818522883336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13460926795515832

lonely,anadite,2018/01/04,"Stuck in a loneliness trap Sorry for my English. I really need to vent because if I don't I would go crazy because of this chronic loneliness. I was a hermit and social recluse since I was in grade school. It all started because I had traumatic feeling since I was bullied in my childhood. I felt that I was meant to be in my house forever. I never go out because I have no friends and I'm afraid of people.
Strangely I felt comfortable feeling this way. I go out when I have to buy something or go to school. As soon as I got home from school I spend my time sitting on a computer and using social networks to fill the lacks of social interaction in my life. At first it was nice and fun, but as the times went by I became sick of it.
 Now socia medias only give me fear of missing out and I even became lonelier than before. I am sick of people posting their pics of their holiday places or when they post their pics of social event. It makes me feel so jealous of their social lifes. I keep comparing their life with mine. This crap now gives me chronic loneliness.
Now I am 22 years old. I feel like crap everyday because everyday I wake up and realize that I'm still lonely as forever alone meme you see on the internet. I really want to start over. I want to forget my social media and only use them as tools, not totally depend on them as my main sources of social life.
To be honest, I subscribed to this reddit sub a long time ago but never posted anything because my English is bad but today I had to let my thoughts out before my mind went crazy of this loneliness.
Do you guys can relate? I am a hermit, I want to break free and start living just like normal people. Where do I start when I have 0 real life friends and don't know where to go? :(

Thanks for reading my pathetic short biography.

lonely,wateranemone,2018/01/04,"28F (US-West Coast)-Lonely and tired of flakes. Hey everyone. This is my first post though I’ve commented a lot here on reddit. I’m in graduate school so I don’t go out much right now. I’ve had good luck in the past making friends online but it seems like everyone just disappears and doesn’t want to put effort into developing friendships or romantic relationships. 

I’m getting older and feeling more adventurous than ever before. I’m really happy with my life and I have goals and a 10 year plan. Now I’d like to start developing my social network so I have people to share it with! 

If anyone is interested in developing a healthy relationship (friendship or otherwise) I’m game for chatting here on reddit and even getting together irl for coffee or lunch or just to hang out. :)

Some stuff about me: I like to read and learn new things. I’m interested in science, the paranormal, spirituality, yoga and about a million other things. I’m an animal lover and have cats, a dog and a horse. I’m sarcastic and sometimes witty, and sometimes a total ditz lol I like myself and I get along with almost anyone.

lonely,erratic_hoe,2018/01/04,"I (22 F) have been so lonely, especially for the past year. I want to make friends, but also push people away that try to be my friend. I’m not sure why I am like this. I have extreme mood swings. Some days I will feel like the happiest and most content person ever and other days I contemplate suicide and go to bed crying. 

I hardly have any solid friends. I spend my days off home, thinking of fun things to do but never actually do. I get sad a lot about my ex boyfriend of almost over two years ago. I haven’t had an serious love interests since he and I. I also haven’t had sex in about over a year. I’m beginning to think maybe I am asexual but I am not sure. 

I’m sad because I’m lonely, and would love to have friends and a love life. But as I mentioned, most times I push people away and I think about my ex almost every day. I loved him very much and I’m not sure if I’ve moved on completely. 

I just wish I didn’t feel so lonely all the time. Wish I had a nice person to hug me and tell me everything will be fine.

lonely,Any0nymous3,2018/01/04,"So lonely it hurts I have mood swings. Sometimes I feel just fine, but on some days I just feel so lonely it hurts. I haven't hugged a girl in probably 6 months now, and I've never kissed one either. I turned 19 a few days ago. I feel so lonely that sometimes I'll listen to ASMR while I hug a pillow to fall asleep, just to make it seem like there's a girl holding me.

Since I moved for college, I haven't been able to make friends. I can't relate with a single one of them, and they care more about having someone to smoke weed with than talking about things that actually matter. I haven't physically seen a real friend since I graduated high school.

Any words of encouragement would help. Thank you if you took the time to read this.

lonely,Spudnik5000,2018/01/04,"No one special I feel like I have a lot of friends, but there's something missing. I've never had a best friend or someone I can talk to about my life and such. The people in school are just not my type of friends and all real friends (that I have met through theatre), I'm either too scared to lose them if I happen to do trust them and get personal with them, or just don't know them too well. 

The worst part is that I feel like it's my fault, that I'm too scared or shy. I have never seen myself as a shy person, but who knows? I just really don't know what to do at this point, it just gets so tedious to not have anyone to talk to, to get advice from, maybe you would say a close friend? 

My thoughts are all over the place and I don't know how to get more personal with people, I am just very alone.

lonely,JackAss987,2018/01/04,"I would like someone to talk to I am extremely lonely and isolated. The last two online friends that I had, removed me for no particular reason (or atleast, they didn't tell me why).

I can't help, but feel even more depressed and internally confused than I already am.

I know, that for a friendship to exist, I must have something to offer. Maybe, what I am hoping for here is to find someone I have a lot in common with.

Anyways, if you are interested. Please PM me.

lonely,e_lisa_beth,2018/01/04,"18F. Terrified of my next birthday. What on Earth should I do. My last birthday was SO incredibly lonely. I had a mental breakdown which triggered one of my Bipolar episodes after months in an abusive relationship ft alcoholism, rampant drug use etc. 

I turned 18. My only friends were people I used with and my family had me back home 25 miles away from them all. I did ask them to come to a quiet birthday lunch at my Grandmothers, but naturally as they learnt it would be a family party with no alcohol or drugs, they nicely declined. And one of them was a 'friend' I'd had since I was 11, so that was 7 years. 

I was fragile, upset and too depressed to even make an effort. I kinda sat there feeling so empty, only my grandparents, mother and stepfather were there. Ended up sinking a couple of beers just to get through it without breaking down in tears. I'm an incredibly small person. Doesn't take much to get me drunk when I've gotten sober. 

Since then, I've moved away, cut and dyed my hair, lost a lot of weight (I have an eating disorder and contamination based OCD with has now become disabling), literally changed my name, closed my personal Facebook (which had 30 friends. Most of which were primary school friends from eight years ago), changed my number etc. Nobody knows where the fuck I am, what I look like or what I'm doing. 

I start an access course in September at a technical college near where I now live. I'm hoping I'll make some friends. But my 19th birthday is May. I'm so fucking scared. I have NOBODY. I don't want it to be like last time. I'm so broken worrying about it. I almost want to cancel my birthday....it's just another day.

I just don't see point in reacting to something that barely has any importance. So what could be causing me to lose the will to get out of bed every morning? exactly that same reason I don't get upset. None of it really matters. I mean, there's no seriousness to anything. Nothing is deep. People are so consumed by issues that are completely meaningless that none of them realize how much more thrilling life could be. Every moment could be filled with suspense. Every second a painting beautifully crafted to amplify every emotion.

I don't care if i'm happy, sad, angry, or whatever else. I just want to feel something. I just want something to be important. I want  an adventure. I've escaped to a world of television and movies to find stories of more meaning... If it's done right, I feel with the characters.

What's even more depressing is I've never seen anyone like this. Even if I had, it'd be nearly impossible to tell. And the only way I'd ever find someone like this is by putting myself out there. Chances are almost nothing. I'm losing hope that there's anyone out there who sees things the way I do. I'm in a world full of people, but not a single one I can *really* talk to..

I now lie here, in the dark, desperately wanting something more. I'm debating running away. Just to feel fear. Having to make it on my own, with nothing, my life on the line. Anyone else feel like this is the reason they're depressed? or am I really just alone?",2.2361260623229446,4.882294563739382,3.729936968838527,84.03909808781872,82.11614730878188,6.3628611898017,25.255594900849857,7.6454224807358475,1.6934861756373936,1443,58,260,25,40,475,180,353,0.179,0.7240000000000001,0.098,-0.9862,0,1,4,0,0,0,58.0,0,0,1,2,20,24,2,4,16,0,34,6,1,7,4,59,62,16,0,11,16,0,4,3,0,1,2,0,1,0,21,10,0,0,13,2,0,3,11,15,0,2,8,8,23,9,42,44,11,37,0,7,4,4,6,21,3,9,14,182,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801815993267146,0.08293153752682969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05445242408659789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16796682820860126,0.08204430874597295,0.06589330264473886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523127221073556,0.0,0.06685765733275886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176354315741531,0.0,0.0816398174580648,0.08225708592913546,0.0,0.0,0.08395507604683307,0.0,0.0,0.19179545948628374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27586722413716314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194253733689906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337815275290525,0.09007141076650936,0.07092096091412586,0.0,0.0,0.1057749969604572,0.1448613273327943,0.2698600137247493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09010444994000608,0.1619493727076896,0.05720420739958549,0.0,0.17543223841032732,0.14637064557252472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480525004855963,0.1255046010247364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07080833921540057,0.08523925735325331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07953061227285645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357546711412597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11311593537208052,0.11735895194360108,0.0,0.0,0.07086213504798611,0.0,0.17916253614609506,0.0,0.0,0.07226905954571028,0.0,0.053449386838579326,0.0,0.0,0.17444606500058088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05886290968336012,0.0,0.061757277343780864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23049677122381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054259575236432094,0.060899167524446976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665377252414957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07569492007545718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08049553787922226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20518740094078747,0.16465687599121714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838195254396247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12761571750939976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06784564073180195,0.24657660293298286,0.07919430011508456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09172341542018213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643596895174253,0.06998738054395527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595909417357214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589989464849367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18891665284070688,0.12711652994839126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1445069574353699,0.0,0.0,0.07718756883187775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Jax_Gatsby,2018/01/05,"I write songs about girls who don't exist. The main reason I'm alone is not because I'm ugly (which I might be) or because I don't know how to talk to girls (which I do). I'm alone because I haven't come across a girl I genuinely relate to, I'm generally not on the same wavelength with most girls I meet. The same goes for guys really. Because of this, I find myself writing songs about imaginary girls with qualities I find attractive.

The most recent one I wrote was inspired by the movie 'Before Sunrise'. I really like that movie, I've watched it more than twice. Anyway, since the song was inspired by the movie, I decided to put clips from the movie in the song and I think it worked out well.

lonely,montane_fog,2018/01/05,"Scared of staying positive I've been lonely for quite a while, through middle, highschool and now college. Been trying to improve my life recently, ditching bad habits and taking on healthy ones. Working on socializing more (my biggest weakness). Trying to stay positive in spite of how I may feel, hoping that that and working on myself will eventually improve my life. It's been difficult from time to time. But I'm scared shitless that It'll eventually lead to a heavy comeback of depression and apathy, worse than before. I also worry that staying positive is only a facade instead of the real thing and I'm lying to myself.

That's pretty much it, I wanted to express how I felt and this is the only place I could think of.

lonely,WoOtbeans,2018/01/05,"Just need to vent I suppose. =| So maybe this belongs in 2me4meirl but I thought I would try here. Some significant life details in a paragraph. I'm 31 years old so I'm not that young. I'm also not that old but getting there fast. I've spent all 31 of those years alone for the most part, short of a few week ""relationships"" here and there. I'm by no means a virgin but I haven't racked up huge numbers(experience) either. I'm pretty average in most ways, 5'11, 245, sounds big but I have a lot of moosle so it's just a bit over what I want to be nothing crazy. I work as a firefighter/paramedic and make average yearly income. I have some shortcomings as we all do of course. I'm shy and don't find bars/clubs a place that I can manage. I'm not looking for a unicorn godsend but I don't want a trainwreck to mess up what I've built for myself by myself either. I feel like I've just missed the boat and I'm out here treading water. I see all these people that are are younger than me and have been without a relationship for less than a year having problems. I wonder if I have been alone for so long what would happen if I get did find someone then they leave me. Could I even handle something like that? Is that fear what is keeping me from trying anything? I'm not looking for any real answers here just needed to vent I suppose.

How do I cope with the fact that I'm half way done on a good run and will be alone my entire existence?",0.8483809523809498,3.105824695238095,2.41714285714286,93.76285714285716,84.5873015873016,4.8698412698412685,20.11111111111111,6.18269132825596,-0.02423174603174605,1189,35,261,10,35,387,171,315,0.108,0.8009999999999999,0.091,-0.5104,1,3,1,0,1,0,38.0,1,0,1,1,18,7,0,1,16,0,26,3,0,3,4,59,54,24,0,10,19,0,1,2,0,3,1,1,0,0,17,9,1,1,9,0,1,1,9,4,0,1,6,5,26,3,32,42,15,28,0,1,3,1,5,14,0,10,13,170,43,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3490231394109645,0.0,0.08983106608252524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638893706789228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243884791831354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12263636667160495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968716900038004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495362112542598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419357100905964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098812799272917,0.0,0.12640361327271468,0.05679793254143289,0.08024929417496958,0.0,0.0,0.30800551731483805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1173766302140827,0.0,0.0,0.09421791954977644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099333938918956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998449607294048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11894231758418695,0.0,0.0,0.07934271259229714,0.10975851237423027,0.0,0.0,0.0994094067523688,0.18865950996024644,0.0,0.0,0.09549980554854276,0.0,0.0,0.07498181974481792,0.0,0.11285159530822292,0.12236139808834165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665840373826802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778463124290062,0.0,0.2357449924420501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12164353450354963,0.0,0.15575235356122755,0.0,0.1173619943605973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428101831403588,0.0,0.1074856035062948,0.0,0.0,0.12583643651513118,0.0,0.0,0.12785727887791162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24120292661434414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08951326940189233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09517769809384903,0.0864778975400024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08917827242877907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15253076093013246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13251147719314732,0.1783262502891299,0.0901051584833344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10828308265110152,0.12181818587154047,0.08177831128748513,0.0,0.0,0.1595934495325507,0.0,0.0,0.289349943552672

lonely,dudel630,2018/01/06,"Depressed and regret my life choices I'm 23 and still currently live with my parents. I just need to get some stuff off my chest as I found that I been feeling increasing depressed and lonely these past few weeks and need to share to some things that I never talk about to anyone irl. 

I got fired from my job a few months back and now stuck looking for minimum wage or volunteer work to past the time.  All my friends are gone as I pushed all of them away as I felt that I can no longer relate to them or their interest. I thought that perhaps I could live a life as a loner but I was wrong and part of me miss them yet know my decision to end our friendships is already set in stone. 

I have always struggle to form and maintain relationships due to my social anxiety and the few friends I once had were from my childhood. I also had a few girls that were interested in me in the past but I just couldn't bring myself to make anything out of it and remain a virgin, and found myself increasing craving a romantic relationship. Yet considering my circumstances I find it difficult to imagine anybody would be interested in me even if I found the courage and maturity to follow through this time around. 

I am tired of life and the series of poor choices I made. I want to make positive changes like going back for grad school but I had a 2.6 gpa in undergrad or move out some where else but don't have the money or resources. My shitty personality resulted in my getting fired in my last job and despite having a lot of time to reflect, I am still fearful that certain behaviors of mine are to ingrained to change. I want to be a good person but I feel more like a parasite as I can't pull my own weight and still stuck with my parents. 

I apologize for the long post or if my writings seems incoherent as I hadn't had much prolong social interaction for a long time and my thought pattern are a mess. If anyone read this I'll be happy to lend an ear to your own personal issues though I'm afraid that I won't be able to provide any good advice considering my track record.

lonely,Sionicusrex,2018/01/06,"Mixed up mind I think I'm writing this more to get my thoughts out of my head than anything else, as everything is a bit of a jumble...

I moved to a new city for work last summer and bought my own place. I spent the first month or so doing work on the apartment, but began feeling very alone - this, along with depression and anxiety is something I have struggled on and off with over the years - luck shines on me a bit as the old lady upstairs introduced me to her granddaughter (my age) who happens to also live in the same block too and we hit it off really well, so well that we start going out. We go into full blown couple mode and I have a fantastic three months... then not long before Christmas she tells me that she needs to be by herself, that we had gone too fast and that she no longer wants to see me. So that was that, we had never said a bad word to each other and it hit me pretty hard...

So now a month or so later while I think I'm over her I still find it odd seeing her about (we haven't bumped into each other for a month now) I really miss being with someone and am really feeling the void... I'm on the outskirts of a totally new city, all my family lives a hundred odd miles away and the couple of friends I have even more so. My job has me lone working a lot so I don't really see anyone that way and ironically enough the only person who actually asks after me up here is my now exs Gran who I bump into sometimes.

My evenings and weekends just feel so empty, Iv started going to the gym again to pass some time but it doesn't really help with the loneliness as everyone is just there with their headphones in. my flat feels so quiet and empty I just feel in a void there waiting for the next day, I occasionally see my ex from my livingroom window and feel an extra jab of loneliness as I think back on stuff. Iv not spoken a word outloud today and while I hopefully will tomorrow (Iv joined a writing group) I doubt that I will see anyone outside of that between the weekly meetings 😞 I can feel within myself that I'm closing up again and that the negative little voice at the back of my head is piping up again 😔",4.414168297455966,4.8069275890410985,5.381947162426616,84.33832191780824,69.91324200913242,8.357599478147423,26.14514024787997,8.306716005460428,1.4982482713633396,1676,46,351,23,28,552,226,438,0.121,0.804,0.075,-0.9654,1,1,1,0,1,0,36.0,6,0,1,4,32,11,0,2,30,0,22,5,2,0,3,74,62,36,0,3,9,2,8,0,1,2,3,3,1,1,23,35,0,2,12,2,2,6,8,6,2,2,9,17,52,5,59,47,15,76,0,3,6,0,29,30,0,7,39,259,75,4,0.0,0.0,0.0839623505035897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911119656386535,0.0,0.06880592903437173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582014650662593,0.0,0.0,0.1203219385617795,0.0,0.07080335442132568,0.0,0.08043551905716563,0.0,0.08083714453686187,0.13231845990639074,0.0718395681793744,0.0,0.0,0.07321346037690578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1878661694716567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19040261638647366,0.0,0.05548849831452358,0.0,0.07410588049106677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187514154309985,0.0,0.0,0.08890202550471461,0.0,0.1136568406516783,0.0,0.0,0.08221463487430553,0.07732694800754586,0.0,0.08111058600373422,0.0,0.30452985590845205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863874080818416,0.07318533766193032,0.0,0.0,0.06647407041126559,0.0,0.044952199951542836,0.0,0.14669505853437007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07608463586175633,0.0,0.07707468475594655,0.0,0.1766031401844466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05767060735378171,0.0,0.0,0.08545685072820808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538114103407722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07013385132761142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623439791697579,0.1519492894067523,0.07614244030087328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314788891999552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08687558502747016,0.0,0.27470431872135104,0.09144660066932728,0.0,0.06379735849890747,0.06635913242113001,0.1661953858713212,0.09150421304722008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09028420749941198,0.0,0.0,0.06543708038803818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512656046878732,0.08989318959978873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08753332203435701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27559622314592674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184347190212074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34281256644795144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07290117134626953,0.06623757616004247,0.08509547820706881,0.0,0.12179870630244287,0.0,0.06871142757514839,0.0,0.0,0.0899473913876105,0.0984948889024442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07520250330128972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1653923258038523,0.0,0.068305923014489,0.050170449754470894,0.0,0.08155558950068277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099177571815059,0.05074845314434656,0.06829432098182757,0.06901586957166435,0.0,0.15472007355557466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18791381183748565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05540675556464729
lonely,friendlyreaperx,2018/01/06,"isolated from society no way to change it i dont know where to start other than saying i dont have a life just an existence. i literally wake up alone, spend entire days alone in my flat, and literally dont speak i just sit in silence all day every day. im literally a social outcast and i dont even know why im a nice person, im funny friendly and generous. but i have no friends not one person in the entire world wants to hang out or talk to me. i have a phone but i might as well not have it as i never get any messages if anyone. I've been to uni i have a music degree but it doesnt come in useful at all. as i cant drive due to a disablity and every band that needs a musician isnt interested in me due the fact that i cant drive. ive even looked at normal jobs as a way to meet new people but i have really bad eppilepsy and brain damage from being hit by a bus. which makes it insainly hard for me to find a job. every interveiw i have goes ok until they find out im epileptic then they literally shoo me out of the office like they think they are guna catch a vrain disorder. im just starting to give up i know my own luck i slip through the cracks in life. like when i was at uni i was the first one there and last to leave everyday. even when i had a sezuire i was at uni the next day instead of resting and recovering just so i didnt let anyone down. i helped nearly everyone on my course with their performances. but it did me no favours as the people who did jack shit and the minimal effort on the course are all now working in the music business. im starting to see a pattern in my life and just want it to end but i just meed to find the balls to kill myself and then at least il be free of this pain that i feel everyday. sorry rant over no one will probs read this anyway.

lonely,whataredo,2018/01/06,I haven't received a single text in the past month and I'm in college Seriously what the hell. I know age doesn't really matter but it is also true that college aged peer groups like mine have very active social lives and it just makes me feel worse. I didn't think it'd get this bad. Is adult life usually this lonely? I'm about to graduate next semester and I still have no friends. I have no lasting relationships with anybody and I feel like I'm going to drown in the loneliness of the real world. ,2.1867647058823536,4.414367088235295,3.5429019607843166,87.82905882352941,79.09803921568627,6.825098039215686,21.964705882352945,7.908726449838941,1.05544,401,12,82,7,10,131,70,102,0.267,0.586,0.147,-0.932,0,2,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,0,4,8,1,0,5,0,9,1,0,1,1,15,19,6,1,0,2,0,2,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,7,5,0,0,4,0,0,2,5,4,0,0,1,2,8,4,8,17,1,14,1,1,0,0,6,4,1,0,10,47,15,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18711461211022007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19536445656208407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23661576288962835,0.16715615439622833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807732280480936,0.0,0.12224547470657955,0.0,0.13297685902636264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12858990096807704,0.19072583672849303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652677802670358,0.2286227066461813,0.0,0.20660961015121956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15618421030404905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18676149266464606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2488415689035812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2233614485646533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26632173240302426,0.14989429288057754,0.0,0.0,0.2512081511524692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23851427950539636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868576196658976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14992564993120175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2576971401644851,0.19305892330705576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23844674445077235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Ginmuskets,2018/01/06,"Came home after 3 weeks away Came home after not seeing my family for 3 weeks. Christmas and my birthday passed. I came home expecting someone to say happy belated birthday or that they missed me. I asked my mom if she forgot it was my birthday and all she said was “yeah” and went back to talking about herself. 

Earlier today my grandma asked if she will ever see a wedding for me before she dies. She wants it to be a big wedding. I don’t even have anyone to invite if I did get married. No friends. No father to walk me down the aisle. 

I don’t even know what to say or do anymore.

lonely,tmg323,2018/01/06,"Same old same old. First post on this subreddit.  Not sure what to say exactly; just thought I'd preach to the choir.  

I'm leaving home to go back to college tomorrow.  Even though the semester doesn't start for another week, I am still looking forward to it because I enjoy being at school more than home.  Maybe it's the different environment?  Not sure.  I have my own place; family can be overwhelming at times.  When I'm at school, I feel independent and I like that.  Still...it's just me on my solo journey. Always has.  I stick to a routine for the most part:  wake up, go to class, gym, eat, sleep, repeat.  I wouldn't classify myself as a boring person (although anyone boring would say that about themselves).  I'm funny and I suppose I'm attractive enough to not scare people away.  I've just lived life watching from the sidelines it seems.  Life has just been, well, lonely.  To cope, I've basically told myself that I can do everything on my own.  Work hard now and things will begin to change.  If I say it enough times, I'm hoping I'll start to believe it.  

Except, the truth is, I really can't.  Instead I'll sit up in bed and stare out my window or into my laptop screen (like tonight).  I'm depressed and pitiful and I'm sad (oh boo hoo cry me a river amiright).  This past summer was especially tough because there was truly no one around.  I was living up at school working.  I could hardly go home because I needed to be able to pay rent on time.  My few close friends were all on vacation so I didn't really have anyone to hang out with.  Just me in a dead college town.  At least the bars were open.

Talking to my roommate about this has been a hit or miss.  He has a good heart and gives the best advice he can.  I need to make a strong enough effort to get out of my comfort zone and change things up for me.  Even though I would love for things to fall neatly into place, that is just not how the universe works.  Easier said than done, yeah I know.  Honestly, I'd give anything to have friends that would take a bullet for you.  The really good ones.  Also, gotta shoehorn in my hopeless romantic side:  I'd give anything to have someone to love.

lonely,Tientienn,2018/01/06,"Lonely data scientist Hi, 

Recently I've been feeling very isolated. I don't feel connected to the few people I talk to, I feel completely abnormal.

I have a few interests such as data science, technology, foreign music and foreign languages. I also like watching tv shows sometimes.

I think I could be a good friend. I wish someone would want to be my friend.

lonely,KPZ605,2018/01/06,"8 Year Relationship Done So my girlfriend of 8 years broke up with me. And holy shit is this whole heart broken stuff sinking in. I feel like shit. Can’t stop thinking about her. I hate bed time because it’s when all these thoughts run through my head. 

She said she didn’t love me any more and that we need to move on. For me this is so difficult to understand. We have traveled the world, shared so many wonderful memory’s. 

It just sucks going home to no one now. Not seeing her car parked as I pull in. Her side of the bed empty. 

I have no one to talk to.

I don’t know why, but posting this is harder than I thought. Maybe there’s a part of me that still doesn’t want to accept that I am lonely.
It’s always difficult for me to express how I feel, People simply don’t understand this burning feeling deep inside me. I want everything to change, but still I do nothing... it’s like I’m just letting time pass and hopefully something will change, but I know that’s not gonna happen...
I’m unhappy, I’m an outcast even in my family. 
Here I am... I don’t have many friends like I used to. Can’t explain how that changed, and the few I have... well we’re not even close anymore.

lonely,Shouldbemore,2018/01/06,"It wasn't always like this It's weird how loneliness feels like the color has just been sucked out of your world.  All of a sudden things just seem like a different shade of grey.  Days feel longer and the things you used to think were fun just become tedious.  Even going out with the people I consider friends has become reliving the same forced conversations over and over again.  

I don't remember always feeling this way.  I'm not even sure what would make me feel better anymore. 

But it's nice to be able to vent here.  Thanks reddit.  I'm sure I'm not alone feeling this way, even though it really feels like I am. Good luck to me and to the rest of you.  Maybe one day we won't feel so lonely anymore.",3.0177659574468088,4.866925049645392,3.3868262411347523,91.70875,75.09929078014184,6.68581560283688,20.26063829787234,7.492282038375204,0.41747234042553183,556,12,118,7,12,172,89,141,0.182,0.6679999999999999,0.15,-0.2512,1,3,0,0,0,0,12.0,1,3,0,1,11,16,1,0,7,0,10,0,0,3,3,32,27,7,0,1,6,0,7,4,1,2,0,0,0,0,10,7,0,0,10,0,0,1,5,3,0,1,3,9,9,13,14,21,3,12,0,1,2,0,6,5,1,2,8,71,19,0,0.1320369311171039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13675044038236964,0.0,0.0,0.2197306078948998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618903125728001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2916488336080204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11677593570568315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17030579485551306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379504903891253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26162744319867604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4673328774708352,0.18865441994457066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020114054493054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750396307461218,0.11074631337126048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.258026300403249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881356768042399,0.0,0.132648844276893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947164166758527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09153778303653913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08458623907246639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14957210389423295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12020146312868772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2488864899699515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12156186645147235,0.0,0.0,0.1754389400721974,0.08460393404223297,0.1297256144344387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140375149942557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20960954021499276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09379524754096656,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,inakar,2018/01/07,"Recovering from a ""friend break up"" and feeling alone on winter break This is basically just venting, but advice is appreciated. 

At college this past semester, I fell into a new group of friends. It felt great because I could just go to their place to hang out literally whenever I wanted, to stave off loneliness. However, I found as I spent time more with them that it was always shallow. No one was really close to anyone else, and no one was really supportive of the things I care about. It didn't help that I had feelings for a guy in the group, and thought he liked me too, but that fizzled out (like most of my romantic relationships do) and he's pursuing someone else in the group. Anyway, I came to the realization at the end of the semester that I needed to stop spending time with them.

Now I'm on break and I'm incredibly lonely. I've fought off the urge to message that group's group chat all the time, but I keep wanting to. Despite that, I've been actively reaching out to other people for a few days now and no one wants to see me - they're busy or tired or whatever - and I don't know why I keep taking it to heart. It's not like they NEVER agree to see me. I guess it just sucks that no one seems to reach out to me first. Now that I'm away from that one toxic friend group, it feels like there is isn't much left. I have friends, but really just a couple, and one of them is super long distance. I just feel alone. 

I don't know why I crave affirmation all the time. I feel like I spoiled myself with lots of attention from bad friendships, and now I miss it even though it was bad for me. I just wish I could be happy with what I have. Better yet, I wish I could be happy being alone.

I haven't talked to a human in a week(over the phone or irl).",3.1628983516483515,3.63527839423077,4.386978021978024,90.07230769230769,72.75,7.865934065934066,26.395604395604394,7.957251820313856,1.2061335164835163,379,12,90,5,7,125,72,104,0.102,0.805,0.094,0.2003,1,2,0,0,0,0,11.0,3,0,0,1,4,5,1,0,7,0,7,0,0,4,1,15,15,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,4,1,12,3,13,11,6,17,0,1,0,0,18,5,1,4,12,55,12,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14440675619277527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.348668290477627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1094459134475796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19889341006389769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208878526663127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08580812565886455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3933418047557132,0.0,0.17732808544530862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13572887384197446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1684063770964467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383325131388191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15018389727580114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14427742257922255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18377435986168528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3644000777864825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12011832247148088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4092082037596815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19791311238339132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14657093737094692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13612739787684544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12354751831868765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21856936691877932
lonely,UnexpectedPleasures_,2018/01/07,"Nothing makes sense anymore. Might as well confine myself to avoid making a fool of myself. I'm a college student that's dorming over at my good ol' university (won't be specific as to which). At first, I made a genuine effort to put myself out there. But I've realized that I'm not the kind of person that goes out to get drunk or high every weekend. I grew up friendless throughout most of my life, which probably contributes to the situation.

I stay in my dorm room all day. My roommate and I get along, but we're not friends. Since he has a girlfriend, he's never in the room, which is a plus. But this means that I literally spend days alone. Isolated even more. But at least I get the room to myself.

I listen to music all day. Working on an assignment? I plug my phone into my speaker and play music for hours. I have difficulty sleeping, so I usually play music to help me sleep (Selected Ambient Works Vol. 2 is great for this). 
I'm sick of it all. This is all I ever do. But whenever I do something else, it's always alone.

I'm friendly with my neighbours, but I don't even consider them friends anymore. For a couple months, I started talking to a therapist and she told me that I had depression. She said, ""You should put yourself out there more and express how you truly feel."" I wanted to make the effort, so I did.

Me: ""Guys, I've been seeing a therapist lately and she's telling me that I've been showing signs of depression.""

Them: ""Okay?""

And that was it. They moved on to a different subject. I felt like a fool. I don't share my feelings with anybody now.

People tell me that we should hang out, but they never call me. I'm alone all day. Sometimes I'll go out and catch the OWL bus in the middle of the night and ride it around town. Most of the time I would just take walks around town. Nowhere specific to go. Just a walk, stop by a restaurant, and maybe catch a movie.

People keep telling me that I look exhausted. I hate this. 

I was about to kill myself once. I got really bummed out about this stupid thing and I told myself that I had enough. I was going to jump off this bridge that was nearby. I took the bus, but it was really late at night and the bridge was closed. I was exhausted so I just gave up and went back to my dorm. This wasn't the first time though. I just don't have the balls to do it.

My dreams are becoming more and more draining. Never have they felt this way before, but now they're starting to feel real. I can feel my senses while I dream. A few days ago I had this weird dream and by the end of it I took a kitchen knife and slowly sawed the skin on my left forearm to the point where I started to bleed. I felt it on my left forearm. I wanted to know if I if felt the same in real life. I went to the kitchen and took a knife from the cabinet and I pressed it against my left forearm. Before I sliced myself, I stopped and put the knife back into the cabinet.

I'm starting to watch r/watchpeopledie constantly again. I'm disgusted with myself, but I live with it.  

Porn is no longer enjoyable. Masturbation just feels like a simple itch that I need to scratch. I no longer believe that anybody wants to have anything intimate with me. Yesterday I woke up at 3:00 AM just to jack off. My dad asks me when I'm going to get a girlfriend. Jokingly, I tell him: ""After I get my degree."" My sister tells me, ""You're a handsome guy."" I don't believe anything she tells me. I don't like looking at myself in the mirror. I don't like any of it. Sometimes I just want to skin my face off. 

I feel insignificant.

I used to be with this girl for a little while and how we met made me believe that she was genuinely into me. She was the one that approached me and she said she wanted to see me. This made me happy and I had a feeling that things would get better. She told me that she liked me more than just a friend, but we should take it slow. Two days later she tells me she's seeing someone else. Was I not good enough? Doesn't matter anymore. I just told her that I was fine with it and that it was understandable. I'm neither attractive physically or characteristically, so I don't really blame her.

I'm watching myself slip away, but it's alright now.",1.330692488262912,3.5787017640845096,2.7827511737089203,91.97281220657278,82.41549295774648,5.805446009389672,21.67323943661972,7.077834269779791,0.5848219718309862,3261,104,699,43,90,1060,335,852,0.107,0.789,0.104,-0.2373,1,4,1,0,0,1,120.0,3,2,5,7,34,38,4,1,46,2,52,19,9,9,9,131,130,51,1,13,28,2,15,5,7,7,7,4,8,4,50,46,3,5,15,10,1,22,19,12,1,4,43,27,132,26,95,78,18,116,0,2,8,1,63,48,0,7,49,475,182,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046589068581815316,0.0,0.0,0.1633012144387442,0.0,0.0,0.04373206528411628,0.0,0.0,0.035740914524819985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563688057358324,0.0,0.0,0.0865007182724617,0.09357466774987938,0.04913418460134051,0.0,0.0493795182635249,0.08082697434432108,0.0,0.0,0.05804564941395385,0.08944515357463467,0.1776429748603273,0.0,0.04648285364356138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053667102176904964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05679600557471886,0.0,0.0,0.058153894024494376,0.0,0.2033715068711868,0.0,0.09053542650741632,0.0,0.0,0.054911420029008284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08781012453755126,0.0,0.04655036106415957,0.108611931240906,0.0,0.06942748993533364,0.04754128401996777,0.04428197571546176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18602262199851546,0.03754710137196389,0.20185383765839893,0.0,0.0,0.08941079595040867,0.0,0.0,0.1624232321777335,0.0,0.1647548035901222,0.0,0.11947859470738935,0.08816550507417184,0.04203504837786461,0.05794484915673851,0.0,0.10408041183367288,0.0,0.055948455230877166,0.0,0.05188966802402237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03522819646104718,0.05552990339164883,0.0,0.0,0.051758568339756984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04671553688451039,0.05814710664033194,0.0547305672446629,0.028884237403634168,0.0,0.1185743391323044,0.0,0.17131169131611082,0.0,0.07424585857002539,0.12838474259866411,0.05267644040721438,0.0464092513063032,0.0,0.08827015636820199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14919358300246668,0.10524765417405256,0.0,0.052801091057413006,0.057250544883561086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055755221019044135,0.0,0.0,0.041950909452227625,0.05586032403493915,0.0,0.03897073365481029,0.12160679388594575,0.0,0.0,0.09864334062780072,0.0,0.0504303560202431,0.0,0.0,0.05597204139498016,0.035614334406751685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07287353076694635,0.045891197493407934,0.0,0.0,0.04968384261603265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056665893704045726,0.0,0.0,0.15850446626923206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964392361396682,0.1010090755592224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998847036706443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256446116413474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0434761220170608,0.05907685232342212,0.1051909488534726,0.0,0.044531814459180315,0.04046134509655964,0.1039614584197301,0.0,0.14880192705452688,0.05601932120453666,0.0,0.08788087686213195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07903342536809531,0.042243742137687584,0.32156311118520986,0.0,0.0,0.12204665857334203,0.06983375920284418,0.0,0.051637494601412336,0.0,0.06129342282273365,0.0,0.0,0.2008838430681362,0.17518000907224826,0.0,0.0,0.05134105819536325,0.05471422979485485,0.0,0.04539282076671427,0.057884680824168526,0.0,0.1549989292202292,0.04171771144983223,0.0,0.0,0.04725552060035692,0.0974426915037433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765249981450167,0.0,0.0,0.07467070569910537,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,maybenotathrowaway78,2018/01/07,"Alone vs Loneliness, with a nihilist's outlook I am happily alone. This is a good thing because I am severely introverted.

I am a mid-30s guy, healthy and fit, make ok money, have had a couple of nice, long relationships, and have tons of interests and hobbies.

My outlook on life, however, is severely dark. This is the hard part to talk about to people. I have accepted that we all die. I will die. When people around me die, I chalk it up to inevitability. I work in a school with 4500 students. Statistically speaking, chances are we're gonna lose a couple throughout the year. I have no other emotion about that. 

I understand that others will, and I step out of the way. I'm NOT so untactful that I would try to explain my cold logic to them. I just let them do what they need to do.

As for myself, I see me as a creature clinging to a ball of rock and water hurdling through space without a destination. We all are. The universe doesn't care if we cry or yell or hate or love. We only do those things to amuse ourselves.

And on that point, I am selfish. I don't feel the need to amuse anyone else. If nothing matters, then the only things that will matter are the things (to me) that I deem so.

I want to be able to say that to someone, and them feel the same way. But it's like when you first meet someone and your jokes get a little edgier, a little darker each time.. just to see how far down the rabbit hole you can comfortably go. And then the other person hits you with a glance that has that hint of unapproval.. 

You know those videos where the baby gets an implant and hears his mother for the first time? Or even better, the one where the old guy gets glasses that let him see true colors for the first time? Then the realization hits; he has missed out on this for 50+ years, and you can see it on his face. The sweet devastation of beauty. He knew it was different, but he just didn't know how. Then in a single moment, he understood. He was fulfilled.

That's how I want to feel about someone. And that's how I want someone to feel about me. I can't say that after 35 years I know what that feels like, but I know that it's missing.

So all that to say this: 

I am happily alone, but I am horribly lonely.

And it feels bad.

lonely,PM-ME-UR-TATTOOS,2018/01/07,"I’m so scared I just moved back into my dorm room after winter break. First semester was awful because I cried multiple nights in a row. I have no true friends here, and all my friends are 200 miles away in my hometown. I am so scared that this semester will turn out the same as the first. 

What’s the fucking point of being so far away at a school i don’t like that much studying something i don’t know i will really like if i’m going to be miserable doing it. I just want someone to open my heart to. I don’t need a girlfriend, i just need someone to be 100% myself with.

lonely,skin-and-atmosphere,2018/01/07,"I don't know if I'll ever be happy Hi there Reddit. 

So a little about me: I'm a 24 year old male. I'm a single father to a 5 year old boy with mild autism. I was married at 18 and divorced by 20. I'm graduating this year with my bachelor's degree in psychology. I want to be a clinical psychologist and work with children and adolescents. So I plan on going to grad school eventually.

When it comes to romantic relationships, I've had bad luck. I haven't been the most emotional available person until recently. My serious ex girlfriend left me at the end of October, right before my birthday and it left a void in me for a while. It also hurt my son a little too.

Without sounding too full of myself, I'd like to say that I have a lot to offer a romantic partner. I'm a really compassionate person and I tend to put a lot into my partner. With my career goals and family oriented mindset, I'm also a lot different than most guys who just want to use people for their biological needs. On top of that, I've met quite a bit of people that have considered me attractive and have pursued me in different parts of my life.

Yet I feel like the fact that I'm different is a burden. Nobody wants that in a partner at my age. And I worry about finding the right person. I feel so alone all the time and I just don't feel like I'm going to meet the person for me. And if I do, I feel like my depression will push them away.
I need friends unlike the ones I have. I need people that make me feel valued and not like an option. Most of my friends have their own issues and I'm typically the person they come to with their problems. Yet when it's my problems, I don't seem to have much support.",2.847289610527433,4.14918671633238,5.004119707099651,82.20802186140295,74.38681948424069,8.150313063780112,25.24684283137005,8.735056554316923,1.7678767059322924,1320,43,273,26,27,460,170,349,0.075,0.782,0.14300000000000002,0.9605,3,1,0,0,1,0,32.0,0,0,5,5,18,19,0,0,25,0,18,2,0,2,3,55,48,23,0,10,6,3,5,5,6,1,2,2,0,12,12,20,0,0,8,0,0,6,6,7,0,1,4,7,41,12,42,41,13,41,0,2,0,0,32,19,0,11,21,182,53,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09186426120504436,0.0,0.1418633366176201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333458473405203,0.0,0.07405903085767497,0.0,0.0,0.07547536905723153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683512021728152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528107518654519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763953602326745,0.0,0.0,0.2780112410688305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09977318463539372,0.07856000108788842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08023231697774827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08361647409594666,0.0,0.2242415840837271,0.1900973649095666,0.0,0.0,0.08106826195809591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13705553517613164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081810662279286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08782485334121908,0.0,0.09442055020250877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09495292268823988,0.0,0.0,0.09257754975086332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04874603912792005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19274102783166247,0.0,0.0626499408027493,0.21666653679265988,0.17779716939222692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262233153673825,0.0,0.0,0.059206528423523065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06520315276551758,0.1973050783063554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861470239482698,0.0,0.060103983852726514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09605116823828436,0.0,0.18447584053447996,0.3872378691153038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697437981839534,0.0,0.08916587510734532,0.0,0.09434112102358476,0.0,0.0,0.056822137747990574,0.0,0.08757846296855291,0.09522833654231284,0.0,0.15149502197947878,0.0,0.0705361199348062,0.0,0.08976699715077792,0.0,0.08074722520239781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065331122118104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051720451287130056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660649600333623,0.0,0.0,0.15694893577362104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550159802186202,0.0,0.06457311823250099,0.09007700989951184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17135559375191114
lonely,theCurlGurl,2018/01/07,"I don’t know how to be alone I could use some help rebuilding myself after a breakup (4months).   I have been jumping from relationship to relationship for the past year without pausing and being happy with myself.  I need to learn how to take care of myself and appreciate myself without seeking a significant other for support.  There are people making passes at me and offering to care for me, and I don’t know how to stay strong on my own when seeking the comfort of another is so much easier and will probably hurt less.
Any advice will help.  I currently want my ex, expect myself to settle for unfulfilling relationships, but need to be by myself.

lonely,futurefamousguy,2018/01/07,"Mr. Charisma I’m mr. Charisma. That’s what my colleagues think. That’s what I thought until tonight too. 

Every day, day in and day out, I entertain. I love to tell jokes and make others laugh and have all the eyes on me. I am always the center of attention and on a good way at that. Right?

I was wrong. Today I realized that I don’t have anyone. The same people that laugh with me or at me during the day are nowhere to be found at night.

I sit alone with nobody to talk to. Nobody to open up to. Nobody who enjoys me legitimately as an individual. I’m entertainment to them. I’m as distant as a person on a TV screen. I’m there when they want me and gone when they don’t.

lonely,throaway_13579,2018/01/07,"Not sure what I’m doing wrongb M(19) I am lonely and don’t know what I’m doing wrong
This is a basic story of mine, sorry for any errors and for it being butchered I’m lying in bed typing this on my phone

I don’t have gf, I have asked 5 girls over the past year or 2 so not from lack of trying

I don’t have any friends to talk to, I have moved around a lot from school to school and have had trouble with keeping any friends, and I was homeschooled in middle school and the first half of high school so I don’t relate well to most people my age

I have a hard time trusting my father, he got sick when I was younger and should have died ten years ago, I am thankful he didn’t but he take medicine that makes his mood swing, when I was younger and starting homeschooling I stayed home everyday with him, he told me I was a piece of shit what would never amount to anything and that I was worthless, he would hit me if I talked to much or I walked the wrong way, or if I didn’t , he had threatened to kill me over nonsense reason, because the medicine would affect him so badly, sometimes it would be nice when he forgot to take his meds because we would have a good day without him yelling at me or calling me names

I am the oldest of three but it still always hurt the worst because my other siblings never received the same treatment from my father like i did

I no I’m not that horrible, I am 6 foot 2 exactly, I have a slight pudge but I’m not considered overweight, I have been told that I quite good looking and I have been in several gifted programs when I was younger, I have competed in national
 Competitions and have gotten to compete once in an international competition out of country.

I’m am 19 and in my first year of college, I have since gotten a nice part time job with much better pay and hours then my last job, and for the last year have been taking Brazilian Jujitsu.

There have been two major heartbreaks for me

First with a girl I know that liked me(she told me, this is why I know) but her mom didn’t like me, but her mom honestly seemed crazy and would bitch about her husband, eventually her mother wouldn’t let her talk to me and that ended

Second was a girl I was best friends with, we told each other everything, we rarely would miss a day when we would talk to each other, I asked her out because for reasons I’m not going to go deep into, I honestly felt that she led me on, but she never would give me an answer until after a couple days she just said we weren’t good for each other and that I deserved better, I was hurt that we spent so much time together and did everything thing together that we “wouldn’t work out” that I stopped talking to her, I had been friends with this girl since pretty much birth


I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I have no one to talk to, I feel so separated from everyone else, I honestly don’t know what to do, I try to go out of my way and be friends with others, and actually ask girls out and don’t get upset(other than the girl who was my best friend) when they decline, I just feel so lonely and have been for the better part of these last years

lonely,aroundbutinvisible,2018/01/07,Third wheeling a week trip away from home About 6 years ago a very good friend of mine who I also really really liked invited me out to visit her at her place for a week with her and her girlfriend. I thought it would be fine but turns out the only reason I was there was to help hide the fact that she's gay from her parents. I was ignored the whole time. Also the crushing heartbreak of someone you really care about completely ignoring you for someone else. It sucked. Loneliest I've ever felt. I just felt used.,4.741890756302522,5.745745990196085,5.01638655462185,85.0508823529412,69.49019607843137,8.181512605042016,27.31652661064425,8.418075326091056,1.7558526610644265,409,13,81,6,7,129,72,102,0.21600000000000005,0.649,0.135,-0.9132,1,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,2,0,0,7,9,1,0,7,0,5,1,0,2,2,16,12,4,0,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,4,4,0,2,4,0,0,2,0,4,0,1,6,2,15,5,15,4,1,13,0,1,0,1,14,5,1,0,7,55,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533627670881521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2767117819486187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1625484215267187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763950425345085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18139750518031167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14452750492086974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15649728767215276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3322331185510952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13366695817514884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451124290685772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159648358134386,0.0,0.17354295635412245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452385924931964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13158176463719912,0.0,0.0,0.1921069313711342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1807584391948012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325035636111656,0.17788291025386693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2931813190007314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13735047211950635,0.10088341766149403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18818500372037894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14942493616275213,0.0,0.14275122099472648,0.0,0.0,0.2775560844817401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1931592860893192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229012126130988,0.0,0.0,0.11141265207411273

My interests are completely different from almost everyone I know. I have very little in common with family, coworkers or even friends.


Nobody wants to spend time with me. I wanted to run DnD for my parents, but my mom isn't interested and DnD with just one player kind of ruins the point.

lonely,garvix,2018/01/08,"Can't sleep Hello friends,

I get these creeping feelings of loneliness and sadness overshadowing me during the evenings. I am mostly okay during the days as long as I keep busy, but when it gets dark outside and it's nearing bedtime, I feel so sad, alone and unworthy.

I always compare myself to other people. I try to tell myself that I am good enough as I am whenever I catch myself making comparisons, but I'm never able to believe it.

Is there anything that I can do so that I will have an easier time falling asleep? I have tried hypnosis videos on Youtube, ASMR, watching a stream, listening to gentle music, doing nothing. Usually these things work, but when I get like this I can't relax with anything. :(

Right now it feels like I will be crying myself to sleep.

**tl;dr:** I am sad. Give me a hug. :(",2.65068181818182,5.179128792207795,3.8715422077922064,84.44874188311691,79.25974025974024,6.1876623376623385,25.209415584415584,7.413659706084162,1.4870272727272735,630,24,113,9,16,205,101,154,0.226,0.643,0.131,-0.9507,0,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,1,7,10,0,0,5,1,15,4,3,1,1,14,26,13,0,0,3,0,3,2,1,2,0,1,0,0,12,4,0,1,3,2,0,2,3,3,0,0,0,5,22,7,12,23,2,13,0,3,1,1,5,3,0,1,10,82,34,1,0.1762402971034904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182531796506591,0.0,0.0,0.14664604550594273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2900614957393153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19856246292763385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193591690761383,0.1136604116357474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18210333890893535,0.0,0.11640505407502685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2673371689318429,0.12590610346520995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361628163591973,0.0,0.2762348435596865,0.16906575217154646,0.0,0.14782199954614714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15665047381808994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17220421384700124,0.0,0.0,0.15596711697786889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11764176684491508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359273819958929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16910731829789702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12218283128866735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15050825076575758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3527351514766531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15404178777399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170862222419537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276713452797114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2393111860326683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1941037882178658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283050353031489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i just want to say every one has a great friend that her/his name is ""Loneliness"", for start your relationship with he/she, in the night before you go to sleep, start talking with he, no matter if you feel loneliness is there or not, just start TALKING loud and tell how was your day to he. he listen too good, play a movie and take two glasses of wine and food, very soon you see he is your best friend... he is always around. just start talk to he, and you feel he is near.",2.8096581196581205,4.069014980056984,3.7677492877492864,91.20410256410256,74.4131054131054,6.567521367521367,22.68660968660968,6.937597516519254,0.5054660968660971,1322,34,291,12,27,425,157,351,0.08,0.667,0.253,0.9972,0,0,1,0,5,0,73.0,5,9,1,2,17,28,3,0,12,0,31,16,4,4,0,61,71,19,0,7,9,0,7,0,5,0,2,5,0,1,10,22,2,3,12,5,0,2,7,4,0,4,10,20,53,24,32,59,2,35,0,1,6,8,68,9,0,2,22,178,63,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0666168347847166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06009823443802394,0.0625316593893773,0.0,0.0,0.05110526289602499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061842876809143625,0.06690033060632583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045811357325199566,0.0,0.06394797319795299,0.0,0.07886634709255648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766214618350624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254985414396249,0.09693236693757214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06277902453094622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2532718639779088,0.0718100092572592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1899930399542547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0686866603987045,0.06392340953692338,0.0908728979207144,0.08239920200489069,0.29030741417867323,0.0,0.039263300257790325,0.0,0.08542010010304163,0.18909930153217333,0.0,0.16570850460858766,0.0,0.07441131375349433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260205793216803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106162759728134,0.0,0.07532105351048078,0.0,0.1330125555197195,0.12621583994269436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4069603161973128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2115723921484333,0.0,0.07210941959990716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10184853672169214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16136811754509736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05976309839118842,0.0,0.0,0.05988562403218998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06216569091534022,0.0,0.07520528177455907,0.0,0.1910256171754922,0.0,0.222978807379352,0.08412540144068419,0.21276908279097914,0.0,0.060015692556374435,0.06282960824146783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528047399644481,0.0,0.0,0.0565042058199856,0.24161413622017966,0.06568529394421029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048153731855697934,0.0,0.0,0.08764231494350097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05102260180775312,0.0,0.07341161554811595,0.0782348503107774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062007452557609186,0.2659560718593699,0.059651372646988166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,1miserylovescompany1,2018/01/08,"25yo single jobless hopeless I am a 25 yo single woman and have been single my whole life. I try dating, I've actually dated several guys but after about 3 dates they tell me they aren't ready for a relationship. They always tell me that I'm missing that special spark they are looking for. Just recently, I've been crushing on this seemingly super sweet and romantic guy I met online I've known for 2 years. He helped me get over my first heartbreak when it seemed impossible! I thought he was perfect.. He told me he loved me but as we talked more and more I realized he just told me what I wanted to hear so that I would give him what he wanted.. he told me he didn't want to commit yet he got mad if I told him I was socializing for the night.. he became controlling and nasty he called me a dumb fuck and a teasing little slut because I refused to show him naked photos. I eventually I blocked him. It's been 3 months since then and I still think of him.. 

Men always say thing to me like, ""I don't see you as ""wrong"" or ""not enough"" there is nothing wrong with you you just aren't the one for me"". I have no friends, I just lost my job and I am starting to lose hope.

lonely,optical-ilyushin,2018/01/08,"How to make socializing less stressful I'm in the middle of my 2nd year in college and... it's been a pretty bad time, to be honest. My depression has worsened, I feel bored and trapped on campus, and I've been isolating myself a lot and just spending any free time curled up in bed in my dorm.

Which I realize is unhealthy! So I've been trying really hard to talk to new people. But it's so difficult and moreover just... unpleasant? I know a lot of people say that once you're brave enough to start a conversation and open up it gets easier, but I don't feel that way at all. I try really hard to talk to people but I never know what to say, and I'm constantly worried that they're judging me. Its all incredibly stressful and uncomfortable for me, even if I've gotten to know the other person a little bit. I try to start up conversations with people in my classes or in clubs/groups I've checked out, but they never go beyond cursory small talk before the other person gets bored with me.

And I feel really guilty because I have a little group of acquaintances that I guess I'm pretty friendly with, but being with them just... isn't enjoyable? I mean I'll hang with them because it takes the edge off the lonely desperation a little bit, but I don't really feel all that much better being with them. And they're not bad people! They've all been pretty kind to me! But I just feel kind of... empty I guess, like I can't connect to them at all. It's strange, there's nothing wrong with them as people but socializing with them just... isn't fulfilling, at all. I don't know what's wrong. I can't connect to people right. 

Outside of my parents the only person that I really feel like I 'click' with is my best friend from high school, who I only see a few times a year and miss pretty badly. Being with him is really comfortable, I feel like I can be myself around him and after seeing him it takes a long while for the loneliness to creep back up on me. But even though I've tried putting effort into my other friendships and acquaintances in college none of them feel fulfilling like that, I still feel pretty alone and I don't understand why. I'm just... not really bonding with people and I don't know what to do.",3.4178619582664567,4.955476667415733,4.721829855537724,83.85494382022473,73.3370786516854,7.782343499197433,23.276083467094693,8.418075326091056,1.3679746388443008,1747,47,348,30,35,579,182,445,0.146,0.6809999999999999,0.173,0.9723,1,4,0,0,0,0,55.0,0,0,8,3,17,28,0,2,17,0,25,0,0,2,8,80,59,32,0,1,19,1,11,4,2,0,0,2,2,3,22,30,0,0,17,0,3,3,14,13,0,0,5,16,50,16,58,49,16,49,0,3,3,0,28,29,0,6,20,232,72,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814656773447257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04474468841389903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058573897836258125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050594365457036015,0.16481497907310705,0.0802193274498655,0.0,0.055988991608637836,0.0,0.0690506207585389,0.05819271360350009,0.14366808141489545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07110393246457278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05667145767465785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798660703031695,0.0,0.08691751304680029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2994236210768595,0.09401177189055528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10167027077502673,0.0,0.06875315913002912,0.0,0.037394345971478685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14496715670845434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11788362019288773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06951887655778323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13703634675479667,0.18080346010748988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285817194338799,0.19783972604875588,0.0,0.05822888891086416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1118776934691388,0.0,0.0,0.04392047186370927,0.0,0.0,0.0716729783330519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04836887608031529,0.0,0.10149447626587264,0.06354782315328797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0631346622415264,0.0,0.0,0.07007239701068786,0.0,0.10008422292508697,0.0,0.0,0.07306055287302096,0.0,0.0,0.3649266921274027,0.17235602614678072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33469954893729714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06614485620304067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2950618146433033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05619087140817863,0.0,0.10464993484539567,0.0,0.0665907793891863,0.10486448698028956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13414492645212125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931438933497194,0.0,0.05254612365154675,0.0,0.15074207299596792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09894335495872092,0.15865708288538388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06464590056334676,0.0,0.1151014940085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1786892613857918,0.0,0.0,0.06849772023256817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052227147094051414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05937218491690272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06682075244402848,0.0,0.0,0.1438788992143923,0.0,0.08474311571672202
lonely,DeathIsNearMe,2018/01/08,"I am a sad man Born ugly with an agressive face... People think I'm mean and never dare approach me.


The small percentage of people that do see past my subhuman face are repulsed by my social skills. 


I've never been a talker... I am a very slow thinker. I always pause in-between sentences which creates awkward silences. People are uncomfortable by it...


Everyone leaves me... 


I'm not diagnosed by anything but I wonder what would come up in a brain scan.


I spend a lot of time in video games. Even the people online don't want to be my friend for my personality; they only want me for my skill...


You see, the real world doesn't want me and virtual world doesn't, either. What am I but a defective human?

lonely,TheBlondeMan95,2018/01/08,"Dreams suck. Had a dream last night that some girl just randomly picked me up outside my house and we just chilled the whole day and eventually kissed. It sounds silly that such a simple dream could mean so much but what really got me was the feeling I woke up with. I was so happy just before I woke up then when I realized I was awake I was overwhelmed with sadness. Not like a need to cry but just  longing, my heart just ached for something more. Its not even like a lustfull thing I just want someone who's easygoing and silly and just makes me happy to be alive and  close to them.

 I'm 22 never had a gf never kissed a girl. At this point I really don't even talk to any girls. I don't know, it sounds silly writing it out but I feel like at this point I just need to put this out there. I've never really expressed my feelings like this to anyone.

lonely,shizuphren,2018/01/08,"i know youre out there. somewhere. You know. I dont even want to explain with what went wrong in my life. Its just the normal stuff. Family - Grief - Friends - Boyfriends - School. Theres always something that is not right and i learned to accept that thats alright you know, maybe you have, too. But is it really? Theres something missing. Someone. That I can play games with. That can make me happy. That can give me one more big reason to live. And i want to be the same to that person. That is all I need and all I ever wanted. I know its hard to find a person like that. I've been looking everywhere. Irl ( even tho im shy ( it was no use ) ), 9gag, random descriptions of YouTube Videos to find some discord servers, ingame chats, a website called ""discordservers"" and so on and so on. And all this time i was sure that i am not the only one who's doing that, right? It's destroying me. I feel so empty, so alone.

lonely,cassandraisntreal,2018/01/09,"Will getting a pet (not like dogs or cats, more like fish) alleviate some of my loneliness? I've been pretty isolated my whole life (I'm 17) when I was younger I coped by talking to and playing with my stuffed animals and imaginary friends. But now that I'm older, that doesn't cut it anymore. In the last 3 years I've relied heavier on fantasies but now even that's failing.

So I thought about getting a pet, something alive you know? But it's a pretty big commitment to be responsible of another living thing's well being so I want to get a sense from anyone out there if pets could help with loneliness.

Also, dogs and cats are out of the question- school keeps me too busy, I would otherwise be leaving them alone for most of the day and it's rather unethical to subject them to loneliness too. All I'm really left with is fish, turtles, small rodents.

Fuck. This is pathetic. But I can't find any other solution and the loneliness is suffocating.

lonely,purealt1,2018/01/09,"I just go from class to class to home to gym I am in third year of university in a very intensive course (pure mathematics). My class is small and there are no girls in my class. The guys in my class all live on campus, while I commute and they are mostly in a group of their own, sure I'll chat to them from time to time but it doesn't go beyond that.

After university I would go gym some days, and if I'm not at the gym I would be doing assignments.

The point is nowhere in my day do I get to interact with new people (I am not really looking for male friends, I have a few gym buddies).

There are 4 places I am usually in that are in public.

1.In between classes, approaching a complete stranger who is likely on their way to class just seems beyond pointless to me

2.The library, the only floor you are allowed to talk on is at the entrance and its mostly people just coming in and out.

3.The train station and on the train. People just have their earphones in or are already in a group of friends.

4.The gym. People just come here to lift, mostly in earphones/headphones too. I do recognise regurlars but I never see any of these people outside of the gym.

It just feels like I do my day schedule automated with no meaningful human interaction ever.

lonely,morbGeno,2018/01/09,"It's been over a year and it still hurts I messed things up pretty badly, I'm exactly going to explain how, but he left without a word and disappeared from my life completely. 
Actually, he kind of disappeared off the face of the Earth to be honest. And I still don't know how to cope with it? I keep telling everyone I'm over it but   I'm not? And I feel stupid for not being able to just accept the fact its my fault and  move on. I want to fix it, and have him back in my life, even if its only for him to yell at me about what I did. I just want something, anything.

lonely,fntastk,2018/01/10,"A guy who said he liked me started ignoring me, and now I'm left with the worst, most awkward crush ever that I wish would just disappear Basically what the title says. He blamed the ignoring on depression and the loss of someone he was close to, which makes sense, but why the hell do you send snapchats to other people and interact with other people on instagram but all you do is occasionally view my story? He leaves me on read or never opens my messages when I *rarely* get him to respond. He acted like he was going to meet up with me at a cafe (I only asked because he has been very depressed lately and I thought it would be nice - I knew he would never do the same for me) but flaked out and ignored me when the time came. 

Come on dude, we're adults, not five year olds. Tell me straight up you don't want to hang out. Tell me straight up you don't want to be friends. I'm a big girl, you're not gonna hurt my feelings. 

And if all of what you told me is true, at least put the effort in to send me a snapchat, like my photos, and whatever else once in a while because you're clearly doing it with other people. 

Also, the fact that he's not even that attractive and doesn't really have anything going for him right now - he is sick and needs help before he can do that - makes me feel worse about myself, because damn, he lost interest fast as hell. I must be pretty boring. I'm not trying to be rude, but I probably wouldn't have even gave him the time of day a year ago. But I'm glad I gave him a chance because we had that vibe I *never* find with other people. At least I thought we did.

Just when I thought I had a connection with someone and actually made a friend, everything goes wrong. I'm too exhausted to try this again anytime soon. Welcome to my life.

lonely,HotPie007,2018/01/10,"A mess It’s so depressing. I don’t know why people don’t associate with me much. Why don’t I have any friends. I’m not douchey or judgemental. I’m always kind and nice to everyone. I laugh and joke just like everyone else. I used to be really shy at school but I still had some “friends”, ever since I left school only one of them hangs out with me and even he’s half the time busy doing stuff. At uni I meet people and I click with them quite easily but outside of uni they’re like strangers, I don’t hear from them. It’s so crappy. My parents always try to get me out to do things but I feel embarrassed while with them only because I see everyone else with their age groups.  I guess my situation can be summed by Tommy Wiseau (a renowned artist), “It’s tearing me apart.” ",1.4091249999999995,3.5104036625,2.69125,93.57875,81.125,6.5,20.625,7.6454224807358475,0.6049375000000006,606,17,136,10,16,195,98,160,0.094,0.764,0.142,0.6929,1,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,5,1,6,11,0,1,3,0,11,0,0,1,1,23,20,11,0,0,6,1,1,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,5,11,0,0,2,2,0,1,5,3,0,2,1,4,23,8,17,17,2,12,0,1,2,0,12,6,0,3,7,79,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24168040003958385,0.0,0.0,0.0987590966036126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08852881302708067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12508349396440402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24263644865486156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959208273854947,0.13136581208427905,0.0,0.4163108399876124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07343095377488297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2244034867402792,0.0,0.07587492644397227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599835191753627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636809803011861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512311995803192,0.07981276444636681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15778917147617175,0.0,0.0,0.14190080321449494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067582918722524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840933112406056,0.22090281083029792,0.0,0.0,0.16125699954273695,0.0,0.0,0.20136373566662225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544664100831291,0.0,0.0,0.09303590561518696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2939542299981092,0.1157268311288286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12013297900510235,0.16324083038207002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159781839096793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16624975993691446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09648212787780988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08468282284037211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09859935700069516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12542919034982322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2620889117178233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Uniqueusername9898,2018/01/10,"Hollow loner I’m my second year of university, and I am pretty much friendless. I have been since high school (even though I haven’t moved towns). Two of my friends from high school and I occasionally chat in a very slow moving group chat, but I have not seen them in person in over a year. As lame as it is, they are literally the only people I talk to. Nobody tries to talk to me, and I don’t try to talk to them. I barely talk with my parents and siblings even though I still live with them, and any conversation we have is as superficial as it gets. Despite all this, I don’t necessarily feel sad. I just feel hollow. My life has become so mundane that I pretty much live on autopilot, and my personality is so bad that I legitimately cannot see myself being in a serious relationship. Tonight I realized how truly far I have sunk. Oddly enough, I cant bring bring myself to care either. I don’t want to join some fucking club or try to meet friends with similar interests. It would end up the same way anyway, with me having vapid friendships barely hanging on by a thread.",4.950804828973843,5.6910813474178426,6.132303822937626,78.19531690140845,68.85915492957747,8.714822266934942,26.95137491616365,8.841846274778883,1.8838050972501683,849,25,168,14,14,285,127,213,0.087,0.772,0.141,0.8993,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,0,4,0,10,9,1,0,6,0,20,2,0,1,1,25,31,17,0,2,5,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,0,2,6,11,0,0,3,3,0,5,7,5,0,2,2,4,31,4,28,27,7,24,0,2,2,1,20,12,1,2,6,119,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08362530072062843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10267663549812048,0.0,0.13581311369061866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253783353124992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891685325905306,0.12706313664080385,0.0,0.16244393299138507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12435686033609443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19001600568232566,0.11368580079978692,0.06424788965516562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2598537240500265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08685888893340919,0.0,0.0,0.21717337948997945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2613999366205117,0.18079740640136951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09352588582224848,0.0,0.0,0.1365460554402675,0.0,0.0,0.08525342742318302,0.21474913229491954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25021383697686755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13202610251595134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2489088269038849,0.09799290786788813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10172385978872084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982057434709716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3953615274590235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2416390890895752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25047011861008,0.0,0.12012595335021473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10146492891739907,0.07253217909919922,0.09760959426334646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735590991625139,0.0,0.0,0.1583801069360573
lonely,Carrythefire511,2018/01/10,"People who have it rough socially and in life, how do you keep positive? As a sophomore in college, it has just been rough still. Sophomore is kind of better and I did transfer to new school and have a friend to hang with, but other than that my nights suck. I have done my best to do clubs, but my social ability just isn't good. I have only been out drinking once my whole two years, which was ok, but haven't done shit, like looking for girls and whatever. I have done what I can focusing on school, and improved my grades from last year, play basketball, lift weights, and watch YT videos and sports. I think I get something to laugh about a lot but I still feel my life sucks and everyone has it better. I mean all these punks keep complaining about girl problems but even see the pain I am in, is much worse than their shitty problems. Complicated stuff to explain but going back to school next week and just kind of thinking about what I need to do to get better or if I can make my life better.",6.2672727272727276,5.896684919191923,5.673434343434344,86.44681818181817,65.96969696969697,9.01818181818182,29.11111111111111,8.296473431620573,1.6972262626262626,786,22,167,9,11,239,119,198,0.15,0.665,0.185,0.8099,0,0,2,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,5,11,20,3,0,4,1,24,7,1,2,1,36,40,19,0,4,11,0,4,1,1,0,4,0,0,2,11,11,2,2,5,5,0,2,2,7,0,1,7,7,21,13,24,33,5,17,0,0,3,0,10,5,3,3,11,115,32,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838627749962453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11445497180791515,0.3858297186468692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33482818436227,0.0,0.10684029578974624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203513448614017,0.0,0.0,0.10421444491932667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055145569265795766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426186359678581,0.0,0.11396191378858064,0.0,0.061983060643401235,0.09147693544692344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938805499206344,0.0,0.22714482552338786,0.0,0.08890096510598103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23110343231963,0.05328271097040817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0915855173652188,0.0,0.0,0.09272152886736627,0.0,0.0,0.07280045151990236,0.0,0.0,0.11880166498697745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08017391136151995,0.08086889047731834,0.0,0.10533380044327144,0.1159898208521528,0.10234831066057916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161486187418458,0.0,0.08294738546496963,0.11605080461630575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07561060603179401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20871727290102896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3311329729087443,0.08690915280074661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195168239029184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22235214696971053,0.0,0.08396208586067459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17419583010509826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12485113131077052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13976643334378525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10653877981786404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748382266772675,0.1328094473605288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12176503183070668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11114459410252543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14046609304483168

lonely,CamelliaCollapse,2018/01/10,"I feel like I'm just too negative. I would like some friends to try to be positive with. Hello, the alias I go by online is Elysian. I am currently 16 years old. I play Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively, I would say I'm a skilled player but definitely not a top player or one of the best in the world but among competitive players, I would be in the upper echelon. I love music, some art, video games, personal discussions, reading, writing, learning.

Also, something about me that I really dislike and I wish wouldn't exist. I ***strongly*** prefer girls as friends over guys and I actually don't know why. I have never felt comfortable with letting dudes completely into my heart and soul. This obviously SUCKS a lot because I can't really have a lot of good friends then and I currently have no real friends. I would guess it's because I grew up around mostly women in my family because my dad wasn't around for quite a number of years.

Anyway, I hope to really meet some new interesting people and maybe make some friends.",2.6630489510489497,5.405752687179492,4.1447668997669,81.13379370629372,81.1025641025641,7.442890442890443,25.78671328671329,8.438071523408619,2.222230769230769,814,33,147,19,22,269,127,195,0.085,0.632,0.284,0.9923,2,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,6,7,17,1,0,9,0,16,2,1,1,2,40,28,11,0,8,5,2,2,2,5,5,0,1,0,4,3,10,0,0,5,5,0,2,8,1,0,1,2,3,22,16,21,18,8,22,1,0,0,1,18,12,1,10,10,97,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.1202219594188141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09852015288436193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21934191115536186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252982289607772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12928706884064156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12916912910144598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161386445292556,0.0,0.062291824438073524,0.08801156521639142,0.11828790737569687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.475906340607085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07001537898944199,0.10333133339376206,0.0,0.0,0.13571477390867845,0.12198384987300355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459883809780665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12236186789300335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06770554453169801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12597671224580442,0.0,0.1203751206685593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20947442468123006,0.11118960189247623,0.0,0.08223458394694662,0.0,0.12376738814160718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0950166935197904,0.11898389466217894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292739455845754,0.0,0.08348109975857376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08540890336787584,0.10757038422319402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13103458424325884,0.12322978411729753,0.14022452601039254,0.2367683926638869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09797075813291804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09484264251002332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08364229960601552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11116563000082327,0.0,0.1416698322909983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35006088056096685,0.0,0.0,0.15866894337924453
lonely,buttpiracy_,2018/01/10,"well this is just tragic. this is the sort of thing a tragic romance novel could be written about (or a Smiths song):

two people who are very similar to each other, yet the thing that stops them from being together is that similarity.

there was a lot of hope put into her. it's the first time I have ever felt like the fantasy could become reality (yes, we did speak). she's very quiet and shy around me, and I tried hard (though clearly not hard enough) to make it real. though she is partly to ""blame,"" it's mostly my fault, since the last time I saw her she was very obviously wanting to talk to me, but I didn't because of one very stupid assumption.

there are three lessons to be learned:

1) never count on other people, and never assume the other person is more competent than you are.

2) take opportunities when they present themselves.

this is extremely painful. it's a loneliness and sadness so severe it physically hurts.",6.067488443759627,6.64389092090396,6.418787878787877,77.70272727272727,66.34463276836158,9.148228043143298,29.085259373394965,9.095868883498916,2.2816146892655365,731,23,137,12,11,236,118,177,0.188,0.722,0.09,-0.9653,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,1,1,2,4,12,12,1,0,10,1,19,1,0,1,5,31,26,10,0,4,4,0,3,1,0,0,1,3,0,1,16,8,0,1,4,3,0,1,4,7,1,4,7,7,16,5,15,14,6,15,0,4,1,0,13,3,0,6,12,105,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547508523513892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592160775619988,0.15566783153775587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22507367722323693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14563868253780998,0.0,0.0,0.1274970418391059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13533378260517598,0.0,0.0,0.11989171335137976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2525264296543569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399948210766749,0.0,0.0,0.1508895319586179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11489278956995515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06886088685248691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11983036508167365,0.0,0.0,0.09408499612015056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21741814239435805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09551114105421273,0.0,0.14998038163376656,0.0,0.0,0.1526347521406858,0.0,0.195433501485874,0.12307181111065985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416933442459928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604315769889366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592330021300689,0.0,0.11659501971976888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784023154951535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10597660694872764,0.11329000193825235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18728138926848248,0.0,0.2769646611520922,0.0,0.16437776671765586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09569557060067836,0.0,0.13768734226969745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.465192941461737,0.08313576450946507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12673067653330333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,MegaManXLIV,2018/01/10,"I don’t know what to do anymore... Two years ago my whole life fell apart... the woman I thought I was meant to be with left me and turned into an emotional nightmare for me. Then two months after that the only person I ever talked to about anything passed away. I did have friends but after those two events my life spiraled into a very deep depression and everyone just turned and ran away from me. My biggest fear is that I would end up alone and never accomplish my dreams. At the ripe age of 24 it’s starting to look like that’s the case. Friends... I’m ok with the two I have talked to for three years over my PlayStation. I’m just more lonely in the relationship department, I’ve always wanted that relationship where it’s actually something. Where you grow old together, but like I said it just isn’t gonna happen for me... I’ve thought about ending my pain quite a bit lately and honestly it’s about my only way to not feel pain anymore. I’ve always just wanted my better half but she isn’t real.",3.4803544776119395,5.100116721393036,4.162111318407963,87.59749533582091,73.32835820895522,7.015049751243781,24.005286069651746,7.6454224807358475,1.0367435323383083,795,23,162,10,16,253,116,201,0.14300000000000002,0.7609999999999999,0.096,-0.9223,0,3,1,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,0,3,10,12,0,1,9,1,11,4,0,0,2,28,28,9,0,3,8,0,1,2,2,2,4,1,0,2,10,9,0,0,5,1,0,5,5,5,0,6,7,3,22,7,26,18,3,36,0,2,1,0,11,14,0,0,18,104,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.1065590611215026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679522659597564,0.0,0.0,0.11309361141400145,0.0,0.0,0.18171881505861592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2165851982661557,0.0,0.0,0.0898585964558828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20518554266112232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0965745503873901,0.11921320994066835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404992834702433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12283024567635704,0.19342961276064385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09877358572419674,0.0,0.1043409843829776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12287530114693322,0.055212528224921065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16872835239757314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09656122434130206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06001099377264661,0.0,0.1231772857255548,0.0,0.11864123555337715,0.0,0.15425602878232825,0.10669481601230578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09169672250817723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08715881020898078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08421830505246228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11458231371005928,0.0,0.0,0.16609620399761252,0.2323834320947641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09534530299386401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161428605797867,0.0,0.12428839049130305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344702139274746,0.0,0.0,0.10386993065947103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406403446597634,0.0,0.0,0.07728914037993176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755344211399604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17337806723622864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375467060607805,0.4266725661596149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900977274040344,0.12881267587188228,0.08667430914101132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12191288160173623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756935369434992,0.0,0.0,0.1406366500543594
lonely,Andarann,2018/01/11,"I've always felt extremly lonely, and I have no idea why No one around me knows this. I've never told that to anybody, because I've always wanted to seem like the independent dude that doesn't need anybody. Even if in truth I know that it's no the case.

I have very good friends, people I can count on and that really like me (I think), a family I can count on. I frequently go out, see my friends, I'm in no way an introvert and I really like seeing new people. I also have hobbies I really like too, that kinda involve being alone (programming/3d modeling).

But, every time I get home, I feel like shit, almost sick. I don't want to talk to anyone, I feel lost, nauseous, I waste a lot of my time oversleeping and watching shit on Internet. Not all the time, but when I have to stay home for any prolonged bit of time, I feel like useless trash, constantly being down on myself, even if I know it's not necessarily true.

I don't think I'm depressed. My parents were, and I don't feel my case is similar. But I really suffer from this. My gf broke up with me a month ago, and immediately, the issues came back. They were basically gone for the year I spent with her.

I'm really unhappy and sad, and I don't know what to do. Please help, I really need advices.",3.263717105263158,4.420197000000002,5.060049342105263,82.78264802631581,73.140625,8.670723684210527,24.41118421052632,9.134995656068208,1.7651437499999996,976,28,205,21,19,334,135,256,0.168,0.7120000000000001,0.119,-0.9293,1,3,0,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,1,1,7,20,2,0,9,0,17,3,2,1,4,45,45,15,0,6,7,1,5,6,3,0,1,0,2,0,10,13,0,0,13,0,1,3,12,9,0,1,8,8,35,11,23,35,3,28,0,7,3,0,10,10,2,6,19,123,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09981001166785301,0.0905409343363165,0.0,0.10227844134797047,0.10578622112877743,0.0,0.08168130947029098,0.16997730033290126,0.0,0.0,0.06945869264222015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07141865270666198,0.0,0.0,0.09092624199393624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07853934409378532,0.0,0.06226358710741425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115104100981393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682093296376675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11037703838777446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797301980960738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134924994182517,0.0,0.08605734301159458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962884880658768,0.0,0.20658018244723805,0.14593765204247575,0.09807040373037262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15782619879458695,0.0,0.053363926730473465,0.0,0.05804850755387009,0.0856701738051546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06846227923542338,0.0,0.2049094668037287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153036110627061,0.0,0.10660760801903073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2245338592699651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29940262563517306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11149785977284353,0.08683576307774185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815271619219588,0.0,0.0,0.1514710100152328,0.07877665351720851,0.098647434431911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06921269755137224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341436640111875,0.0,0.0,0.14162201058900287,0.0,0.0,0.11211903197322708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3926009407773071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627846886064242,0.09298440665331337,0.0,0.0,0.20969045456754706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10886763434297762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08209625131895322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308943569019762,0.0,0.0,0.2382345876391837,0.0,0.0,0.09759913322005254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08427618496922015,0.1204896195602915,0.08107396623324993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09216545001929648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06577480184534575
lonely,EtherealSleeper,2018/01/11,"Observer I dont know if this belongs here but I feel like a very temporary observer, not even a background character in life. Its not because I want to or dont try but all my trying of understanding or doing are fruitless.

Im 26 and am nobody. Never had a friends. Have no future prospects or job. Very distant family. Never had gf or know what love is. I have many illnesses and am poor and ugly.

I feel like I only observe life barely surviving feeling miserable and depressed, sometimes suicidal. The only good feeling is a feeling of calm serenity but thats very rare. I always felt lonely. I cant imagine what is it like to have a good friend, good job, gf/wife, caring family, or having a purpose. I tried talking to people but people dont understand and dont care at my age. I think Im just too different/awkward/putanywordhere I dont know, understand I probably am not capable of understing it now. The only time i dont feel lonely is when I have depression and panic attacks of my future wage slave until I die of my bad health or suicide.

Does anyone feel like an observer who is not allowed to intervene, waiting just for the end? or im just too weird?",2.6372727272727268,4.888512347826087,4.750750988142293,79.62276679841898,77.69565217391305,8.007905138339922,28.280632411067195,8.841846274778883,2.661608695652175,920,41,167,22,22,317,124,230,0.275,0.5489999999999999,0.17600000000000002,-0.988,5,4,0,0,0,1,28.0,0,0,0,1,9,22,1,2,10,0,24,5,0,1,3,47,44,20,3,2,19,0,8,4,3,0,4,0,0,0,8,6,0,1,16,0,2,0,14,9,0,0,3,8,19,13,13,41,1,12,0,5,0,1,6,2,0,8,14,109,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598236803760503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055447072266845816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021303167237206,0.0,0.0,0.0662105976029557,0.048339383103705794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.161699386958512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13659866721235278,0.0,0.08229890375344844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06939429790353288,0.0,0.5576206652813565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07023457584415438,0.0,0.0,0.05237564431360325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495103745006933,0.0,0.2806684986927518,0.16995172617905205,0.0761386074477079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225310240184458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995344411325426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08429016755385123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2569666528438497,0.0,0.15738224811633955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307404786719068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112021180193717,0.15496417617642227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07156962734888599,0.0,0.0,0.08039582268375306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12231915991048907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1809293252041812,0.0,0.09303922954261801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10995062995597447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549675916902459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842784426726189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734784921281861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06373680554316201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081101779023886,0.0,0.0,0.04623935728508867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16151460509397156,0.0,0.0,0.2476563425781843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962877010949211,0.046772071370516435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,asupportmainow,2018/01/11,"I just want someone who feels the same. I am usually a fun loving happy guy! Always ready to give something new a try! I love making people happy but I struggle finding friends to share that with. So basically I think I have something to offer to about anyone! Be that gaming buddy or just comedy gold. Just looking for a constant texter who also wants long term. I have been ghosted 6 times in the last 2 days... If you Pm me know that I am not looking for something casual, sorry if that comes off rude but I just want someone really committed to a relationship!

So recently my friends found a new guy. So now I am the guy who is on the sidelines, and feeling pretty bad. So what better time to look for a new friend! I don't know what I could have done to make it different. I hope this time I can find real friends. Hopefully what lies ahead is appealing enough to make someone want to befriend me! 

**What I am looking for in a friend:**
I want someone around my age (15-18)
I would like someone who I can laugh with and talk on the phone! I am a calls guy so if you are good with that that is perfect! I prefer long constant conversation as I usually am free (and will be for the next six months yay not being able to work!)
Someone who is caring like me always makes for a good combination, I have been told I am a good listener and I always am ready to help :) I hope to find a true partner out of this. Someone who wants to put the effort in. When the conversation slows down try to start new things! (I know its impossible to always keep it interesting but I will try my best.)
Someone who can just occasionally ask how I am doing. It feels nice! 
Just need a real soulmate. 


**About me!** 

I try to always be happy and to keep the mood light! It hurts me when the people around me are hurting.  
I usually am always available and try my best to help!
I like

lonely,Mini464,2018/01/11,"I don't know what I want Ever since I graduated high school, things haven't been the same. During school I had friends but I never actually went and hanged out with any of them. I never went to all the parties and hangouts there was. It also hurts that I've never had a love life but tbh when it comes to meeting women, I always been afraid. Going forward I actually finished my first semester of college a while back but I haven't seen or talked to anyone I've known in months. I barely even made new friends either. So these past months I've been feeling sad and lonely. Somethings I've noticed about myself is that I don't talk as much I used to and I go days without speaking to people I know. A lot of times I just don't want to talk to people or a person. I don't know if I'm pushing them away or not or what's wrong. I also believe I get anxiety attacks (if that's what it's called), sometimes when someone says something that hurts me personally (like love life/people ignoring me). My heart rate increases and my stomach gets a heavy feelings/ starts to hurt. Funny thing is I don't remember getting these attacks before; I think they started a year ago or so.",2.635515370705246,4.5759428227848105,3.847715491259799,87.57746835443041,76.46835443037975,6.033273056057867,25.20976491862568,6.868970318607317,1.0001992766726948,927,33,185,9,21,302,135,237,0.188,0.7340000000000001,0.078,-0.9808,0,2,2,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,3,1,13,15,2,1,8,0,15,5,2,2,5,42,39,23,0,4,14,0,2,1,2,0,1,2,0,3,14,8,0,1,8,1,0,9,12,10,0,1,10,5,29,5,18,29,6,33,0,5,1,2,17,5,0,8,22,121,43,4,0.0,0.0,0.19497846082982245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855644981630209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15978202204468087,0.0831258611211581,0.0,0.0,0.06793629063323585,0.0,0.07642419953992748,0.0,0.0,0.06985329211285367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22730423793951585,0.0938605334720909,0.07681791153172167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08500862428633398,0.11255452310528696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10201036821265122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08605609985419325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06442805573113065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598384787982199,0.090366419863567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10102616951122807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08497597081934917,0.0,0.0,0.15436694966427456,0.0,0.1565828738398323,0.0,0.11355239006062735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118383488173653,0.0,0.10555117869272164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32083913323722324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16470937912990266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14112644550895906,0.04880671522828055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08493248884189937,0.18032959654027225,0.09452899895655767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15948048418827931,0.0,0.07343892961325303,0.0,0.2311500587561765,0.09648527089776752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373826016692752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09536706806592568,0.2077768895175574,0.17445987445309166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11316866644139505,0.0,0.0,0.07944550113570091,0.0,0.202210841216728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0826393644434017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08464602346488073,0.15381775964253244,0.09880491234986696,0.0,0.1414212688394103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2408905744122845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13273993193210626,0.06401270117872837,0.0,0.0,0.05825323501304585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628262329796715,0.0,0.0,0.11784871700508212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852189597858756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09630126109897068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1092263580271432,0.0,0.06433314369341801

lonely,CMWDanny,2018/01/11,"I'm pretty lonely myself, and thought it'd be a great idea to work on something productive together as a team :) Why not make a board game? Hello, I am off work for the next few months and have nothing to do really other than staying home, thought it'd be a great idea to make board games with other people who are interested online as a hobby. Who knows, maybe we'll release something on Kickstarter/Amazon.

Is anyone interested in working in a team environment that will be making board games/card games?

If we get enough interested people, it might be a good idea to work on a very projects simultaneously as some concepts of games might interest people more than others.

Waiting to hear from you :)",8.061494002181027,7.753437221374051,7.922311886586693,71.59572519083972,62.28244274809161,10.233805888767725,33.9814612868048,9.606745405546679,3.117311014176664,560,20,98,9,7,180,84,131,0.018000000000000002,0.757,0.225,0.9822,0,2,2,0,0,0,16.0,2,1,0,6,0,8,0,0,9,0,15,0,0,3,0,19,25,6,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,9,4,0,1,6,6,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,5,7,20,13,4,9,0,1,0,0,13,6,0,4,2,63,14,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939197404520883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13878857440084522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07017671095835176,0.0,0.0,0.11266133122551705,0.0,0.29617677971301565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15138852032308672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13473401701812565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4548931468370194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738188168851221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2689791391233173,0.0,0.1349425992327367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849848097617761,0.0,0.0,0.10721302625177492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285095540170129,0.0,0.0,0.1288837632958056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.279361944801459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13665183564433234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860488986691354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20681235809485995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14316735997697608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2132703191967672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1108281536913256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12120300252674455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39114654448107744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,melaniedarkrai,2018/01/11,"I secluded myself... The sad reality is that I don't really have any friends, and my mom and sisters lives nearly 2 hours away (I don't have a car and to bus/cab there costs roughly 100 dollars, one way), not to say to say that we're all that close. I'm the youngest of three, and it's always seemed like they were closer to one another than I would ever be.

My mom was always my best friend, but I barely see her anymore. My dad lives with his girlfriend just one town over, but I never really talk to him, I'm only renting his house with my partner.

My partner has a normal sleep schedule, he wakes up at 8:00, and I wake up at three in the afternoon. I've tried my best to fix it, but it never works, since I work, I only see him for a couple hours a day. By 11-1 am, he's asleep, and i'm up for 4 more hours.

His brother is my only friend, he lives in the city about an hour and a half away, but at the same time, they're brothers, so I always feel like a third wheel in skype calls, or if he and I were going to play a game, Brandon and him would start going on their rambles, and I'd just be sort of forgotten, it just feels like that.

I was never a big party goer, not to mention I was never invited to them. I lived a lot of my life just being by myself. Now, it's killing me, I wish I had someone I could talk to, or a friend that could come over. I want to make plans to go hang out, or grab coffee, but all I do is sit in my room, playing on my computer. 

I just want to not live my life like I have been, I wish I had a reset button, and try to make myself more social. Because lately, all I've been feeling is lonely. My partner doesnt get it that well, because he says I have him and his brother, and my family, but I just feel like I'm a third wheel in my own life",4.220260186548845,3.086375567010311,5.605405007363771,87.78269759450174,70.3917525773196,8.421404025527737,26.465881197839966,7.07126945348624,0.9932912125675016,1352,31,327,10,21,460,184,388,0.045,0.809,0.146,0.9879,1,2,0,0,0,0,57.0,0,0,3,5,12,17,1,0,18,0,30,7,4,2,8,64,53,24,1,10,19,7,6,5,8,2,3,3,2,3,12,18,0,0,5,3,3,6,10,3,1,8,9,11,56,14,44,37,10,48,0,2,2,0,41,24,0,7,21,219,68,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19981422332000107,0.0,0.0,0.05443407127871834,0.08393528186233237,0.0,0.0,0.07938419064311128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504118320754708,0.0,0.0,0.09759068043885204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16800682027064867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173598532827747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895259999874001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278205441139764,0.08856945197264239,0.0,0.05162309194876569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724062514188773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546030918975304,0.0,0.16189478880672695,0.17155478136728292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2473735749414794,0.0,0.041820766859542315,0.0,0.1364760756765196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31531701253298444,0.09236241552227656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08855911466151854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029545150100338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16961671565834505,0.19553232821903546,0.0,0.3534107237022337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805230471675361,0.0,0.0,0.1068627441947478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18749797529266346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2469458499452437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842815145525073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16272386228071742,0.18263592566063144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10255912198273284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19096753876102499,0.0,0.0,0.12757270552627598,0.07287093417734686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06621493479568047,0.0,0.08010387652209612,0.08159688609994836,0.06782277383412562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056657019073139976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12867599507034527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046675506086061885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869205190391153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442648990349498,0.06353684310646805,0.0,0.0,0.07197102846617012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18409805609271152,0.0,0.0,0.11654898200035944,0.0,0.0,0.11372486044347448,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,woobwoobzoob,2018/01/11,"I like weird things [35/m] here. I'm really lonely right now. There is a girl I care about but I don't want to bombard her with things plus there's bunch of reservations jammed in my mind.  I consider her a friend, but I don't want to overwhelm her.  

So...I'm looking for someone to talk about things... I'm interested in ""armchair"" philosophy ( that is, I don't really know much actually philosophy, but I do enjoy ideas ), the nature of love (in all fields), esoteric nature of feminism and anarchism that people don't usually talk about.. I'm interested in the radicals too (Camile Paglia - though I don't necessarily agree with their ideas as I feel a bit of a traditional feminist )... PM me and I'll give you my email. I'd like an email friendship.  We don't have to talk all of the time. I'm not looking for anything real-time. Just someone to inspire me, and let me share ideas without reservations. I genuinely want a friendship where I can share ideas. So throw them at me, I'll see if I'm interested, hopefully I will be.  I also like songs (like metal, rock, punk, prog)...bands like The Manic Street Preachers, and the foo fighters. I like interpreting movies and lyrics too. 

Edit: going out tonight, but I'll contact you when I get a chance.

Edit x 2: 
Just came up with this... not sure it was me, but I like it.

I can't see you. I never will.  I can only hope you'll see me.

lonely,Maximqus,2018/01/12,"Tired of finding people just to see them disappear, again and again. It's almost like a ghost movie where you're in a dark room and the TV switches on and the same thing keeps on repeating over and there's just static in between... whizzing eerily past your ears.

I'm 20, half my life I've been on the internet, made some amazing friends, but the problem was, as always, they never stayed for long enough. Sure they made an amazing impact in the little time that they stayed, that's why it hurts. Now all I have is their memories of one or two who stick and I'd do anything to talk with them...

Fast forward to 2017, where I'm literally with no friends except one who talks to me occasionally. She has literally no conversation skills, but I'd not blame her. I don't have, either.

So all I do face is this emptiness, and my mind wants to recreate the past because obviously I can't go back and change things. So I meet people on the internet, and real life - and there's one recurring pattern; they always seem to be the busy people. I was the only person putting time and an effort into the conversation, however much minute it might seem. But that's what I thought at the time - but I realized soon I was everyone's last priority. This pattern followed me right from high school when I was isolated because I was ""different"".

Met people on here, and most never responded back. The ones who did, mostly stuck around for 2 days and then disappeared. 

I used to pride myself of being alone when I was younger, maybe I didn't even realize it. But now it haunts me day in and day out, when I see everyone with someone dear to them, and I merely a subject of time. Constant nightmares and panic attacks keep me awake at  night... Always feel this constant pressure at my chest. 

Well whatever it was, every time I decide I'm okay being alone, the loneliness gets the better of  me and I desperately search in this forum/real life for that imaginary perfect person who could seemingly solve all my problems, however unrealistic it sounds.

I've tried venting it out to some of my peers and therapists alike, and the best they have come with is to just ""chin up"" ""it will get better"" and all other platitudes.

So yeah, I question my existence. 

And I'm sure no one will really help me. So all I can do is cry, but the tears won't come out. 

But all I wanted was to know someone out there was worth living for. Anyone?

Pretty sure you'll just abandon me like the rest, won't you?

Thanks for reading all this. Peace.

lonely,LordDurand,2018/01/12,"I've given up. I don't know if I'm better off this way. I've posted on here many times before, always telling the same tired tale of wanting things I cannot have. But these days, I just, I don't know. It feels like I've been pushing against the current all my life. I always knew I couldn't live like that forever.

The only thing I've ever wanted is a girlfriend. That's all. I've pushed so many people out of my life because I didn't value the relationships I had with them. How could I? My only focus, my only interest, my only desire was a romantic relationship and nothing less. I don't value family or friendship. I care not for fathers or brothers, including those not related by blood. Maybe that makes me an awful person. I'm sure it does. People should value those in their life. There are many who have to carry the burden of having no family or friends, and I should feel glad to not be one of those people. But I just can't feel that way. Nowadays I can't feel at all. 

I was always very desperate for a girlfriend. Maybe that's what put them off. But even still, I did my best. I traveled far out of my comfort zone and did everything I could. I did more than I was physically capable of, and I went on like that, pushing myself every single day in the hopes that my efforts would pay off. And each time I made the long, blind leap of asking a girl out, I fell. Without fail, I fell each time. Then, for a long time, I just couldn't pick myself up. Until, one fine morning, I managed to stand again and walk in the opposite direction of where I was headed.

I wanted a girlfriend more than anything else in the world. Not a single person desired a single thing more strongly than I did. Nobody could've been so monomaniacal, and nobody worked so hard for so long at something, only to fail over and over. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I really didn't want it enough, maybe I really didn't try hard enough. It doesn't matter now. I can't deny that I still want a girlfriend, I can't deny that it's still the only thing I care about. But, I'm done trying. I give up. 

I knew I could never continue going on the way I did: trying to put forth my best each and every day only to be greeted by rejection. Having to live like that for so long must've broken something inside of me. I can't feel anything. I can't feel any hope. I've accepted that I will die alone. That's okay. A lot of people die alone. I wish that wasn't the case. I wish I had the willpower left to change it. But I'm just too broken. I've already tried. I've done it all before. I can't do it again. I can't do it again. I can't face rejection again and again and again. I can't. 

I used to always cry while writing these posts. Now I've forgotten how it feels to cry. I feel nothing.

lonely,beefmeefkeef,2018/01/12,"i hate it sorry just a vent. a very important friend to me recently got a girlfriend and everytime i ask her what she's doing it's always about her fucking girlfriend. we could be in the middle of playing something and she would suddenly log off and i'd ask her what came up. it's always, as expected, her girlfriend. i thought that i was an important person to her until her girlfriend was brought into the picture and now i feel like utter shit.

i have no right to be jealous but i am and it's ruining everything. she's already done so much for me yet i feel this way after she finally gets a girlfriend that she loves who loves her back. i'm not even into her, i just want her to spend time with me and talk to me again. it hurts so bad",1.981540616246498,3.896785627450985,3.5571101774042937,89.02485294117649,78.34640522875817,6.7243697478991615,25.30765639589169,7.7094869923839395,1.3480087768440712,583,22,122,9,14,193,91,153,0.14,0.7340000000000001,0.126,-0.5031,0,0,1,0,0,0,11.0,1,0,0,0,10,12,4,0,7,0,10,4,1,0,0,22,25,11,0,4,4,0,2,1,6,1,0,0,0,1,11,11,0,0,3,1,1,2,2,7,0,0,7,2,28,5,17,14,1,20,0,2,0,3,28,7,2,0,11,92,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19091828051735926,0.0,0.28791250355423426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.323477658938872,0.0,0.0,0.13303222925215658,0.14445418893441767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1978746998056018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13813255727014473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17704692689598822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11426994307783375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15548815005838185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749557658481126,0.12359672344508615,0.0,0.18952146039445664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13366530687451528,0.15994281530771046,0.09038937384206362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383700488059275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17080926926655518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18520830309327072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08452281505482134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3122923775139079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12718055366955516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15106363575090273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17082421535542106,0.0,0.0,0.1477476161530101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1775899006153412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13318976691632972,0.0,0.19366793699230475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13905702233983694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13734877531331935,0.10088217136357737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14274945746853504,0.1020444140245766,0.13732544607762692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12289969431079713,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,blue1smoke,2018/01/13,"Young n lonely I’m the youngest of 3 siblings and of 3 older cousins that we hung out with every weekend/holiday. The closest to my age is my brother who is 7 years older, everyone else is 9-13 years older. Growing up the youngest sucked so much. I was ignored, pushed aside, and often felt like I was the most annoying child. But I wanted to be like my older siblings and cousins so much, despite how they treated me, they were my role models. The oldest was so bossy and the ring leader, everyone did what she wanted. So when she would treat me bad or ignore me, everyone else did too. 
Fast forward to when I was 15, the oldest has a baby and everyone is head over heels for this child. As she grows up, I start to notice little things here and there between how differently she is treated by the same people that pushed me aside. 
It hurts. I should get over this but I can’t. I’ve tried.  

Example: family tradition is open gifts on Christmas at midnight, as a child it was boring and hard to stay up so late. One time I remember asking if I could open a gift early, oldest cousin calls me out and tells me  absolutely not, I have to wait like everyone else. Everyone agrees. 

This Christmas, my mom, my sister, and I arrive after 8 bc I had to work. We walk-in and said cousin starts yelling bc we’re late and her kids can’t stay up til midnight bc they’re kids and get bored and basically said we’re inconsiderate. 
 
Rage and hurt feelings built inside me, but all I felt I could do was walk away. 
Why didn’t I face her and tell her? Bc I didn’t want to make a scene and in the past when I stood up for myself I have found out later that someone said I was rude, selfish, bratty, etc....

So many of these instances occur and I hate it. I hate being around her and her kids. 

I feel like this has affected me so much, sure I may have been naturally shy, but growing up in that situation has led me to believe I don’t deserve to have a say in most people’s conversations. My biggest fear when interacting with people is whether or not I’m being annoying.  

I always wonder what it’d be like to grow up differently, not the youngest, or maybe the youngest but how my cousin’s kids are growing up, with love and patience and acknowledgment.

lonely,Kimatt,2018/01/13,"Just lost a friend. My (ex) best friend doesn't want to be friends anymore. It's kind of expected since we had a lot of fight but still, it hurts so much. 

Why would he waste 3 years of our friendship? We had a lot of plans for our future and we even dreamt of being neighbors when we grow up and I had a lot of fun being with him.

I am not used to solitude anymore. *welp*, back to being alone again.",0.1928104575163374,2.164714058823531,1.4203921568627464,101.70065359477124,84.88235294117645,4.248366013071895,17.6797385620915,5.033348758259628,-0.8854183006535951,305,7,75,1,9,96,60,85,0.155,0.6659999999999999,0.179,0.5005,0,1,0,0,1,0,13.0,6,0,0,3,7,9,1,0,4,0,10,0,0,1,0,17,13,5,0,3,3,1,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,4,0,10,6,12,4,5,8,0,2,0,0,14,1,0,3,6,54,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19886167206885946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3808393253523856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14764177340892745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20149983128922166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12681902076052806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4450331260584064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2055478020060718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19994607179666934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20959866596931664,0.4897132591585932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14114746924454774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588304352009378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533372898661439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16583267188702236,0.0,0.0,0.11325088918495352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17325673705183814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363964876892192,0.0,0.0,0.12364641571836175

lonely,Slim927,2018/01/13,"Another lonely Friday night.. 27 M new to Reddit and just need to vent a little . Been socially isolated for the past 5 years or so. Slowly lost family and old friends over the years due to severe social anxiety and depression. I spend my days in my room doing nothing but watch TV, play video games, and surf the internet. I force myself to go out about once a week to buy groceries. Pathetic I know.. It's nearly impossible for someone with crippling anxiety to go out alone and try to make friends and socialize. It was much easier when i had my good friend by my side to do things with but i lost him 2 years ago and havent been able to form a solid connection since. I think that is one of the worst fates a person can possibly have, complete isolation and loneliness. I've tried therapy, working on myself physically, reading self-improvement books, but nothing other than alcohol works, only temporarily of course. I want nothing more than to have this never ending cycle of torment finally end. My sympathy goes out to anyone reading this that may be going through the same thing.

lonely,fixylol,2018/01/13,"lonely but surrounded by people my brother has tons of friends. usually when he hangs out with them i ask if i can come too. whenever i do i’m just ignored or insulted or just saddened by them. there’s one who seems to actually care about me and i care about him. but apparently everyone else thinks he’s an asshole. not sure what that says about me. 
i have only one person i can consider a true friend. and he lives across the ocean from me. but i like him. he is nice. he doesn’t call me names or ignore me. he shares in my interests. i’m glad we talk to each other. but i’m sad we can’t meet each other in real life. i don’t even know what he looks like. but i just want to hug him. i want to chill out one day and just come to his house to eat pizza and watch tv shows with him or something. i live thousands of miles away from him and barely know who he is in real life but he’s the only person i can consider a true friend. for some reason i can’t help but feel this is unhealthy. 
i’m not sure if this belongs here, but i just felt like rambling. usually it’s night when the loneliness is at it’s worst.

lonely,redditbutdidntgetit,2018/01/13,"Some much needed venting. So.. I'm a 26 year old man who grew up in a small city. My parents were separated so I'd go visit my dad who lived 150 kms away in a very small village every two weekends. I never really hung out with the people there except for J who's been one of my childhood friends. Fast foreward  december 2015. I was at my dad because I had gotten laid off and was tired of being in the city. I've always told myself that I wanted a house as soon as possible in my life because paying rent is throwing money at something that'll never belong to you. So I see this little cabin/house that's like 50k with a big yard and it belonged to the family so my dad knew that there wasn't any major issues with the house. So, I buy it. I knew that I'd be lonely but the fact of having a house to myself at 24 was too overwhelming. So, now here I am. I love my house, my dad lives nearby so he can help me with anything(yard work, renovations, etc..) I have my own car. I can play my guitars quite loud and people don't really care. I'm livin' the life. But, the thing is, I've never really been good with girls. Never had a real relationship with one. Never knew true love. Can hardly get a date. I don't hang out with the people there because they're all druggies. My dad left for quite a while to go work in a mine. I'm lonely as fuck. This is really depressing because having your own house is cool but it's empty all the time. Nobody will visit me except my dad and when he comes, he's never here for long. My chancesw of getting a gf are almost non-existent because I live far away and there are no girls here. The worst part is that after a whole dry year, I was lucky enough to have sex with this chick and sleep over. But she's not looking for anything serious so I'm all depressed because I saw what it was like to have sex with a girl, fall asleep with her, wake up to her and have sex again and now I'm back to my loneliness. I feel like there's no escaping it. I'm afraid that was my dad won't be there anymore, I might commit suicide because it's fuckin' unbearable. I've been drinking lately even though I promised myself I wouldn't anymore. Spent a day drinking Scotch and felt really bad afterward. I think I made a mistake buying this house but at the same time I have my own place and it feels fucking good to have that. I'm really scared I'll end up at the end of a rope in a drunken lonely night that'll end up being one too many.

TL;DR I moved to a small village where my dad lives to be closer to him because he's given me everything and I wanted to be closer to him but now I'm lonely as fuck and I'm afraid that when he won't be there anymore I'll end my life because of how lonely I feel.",2.218330434782608,3.551871902608696,3.8143913043478257,89.97915217391306,76.06086956521739,6.5304347826086975,21.543478260869566,7.079830092131019,0.4724782608695653,2124,52,467,22,46,708,245,575,0.146,0.782,0.07200000000000001,-0.9931,2,10,4,0,0,3,54.0,0,2,0,4,32,33,4,4,30,1,48,18,3,2,12,67,87,35,1,5,9,9,5,3,2,7,4,1,2,5,26,25,2,0,8,6,6,11,15,19,0,4,23,10,57,14,62,50,15,77,0,8,3,9,38,32,4,4,37,299,83,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061286279982631885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050926061648967465,0.0,0.0,0.041620353501634066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820917303846318,0.0,0.0,0.05036511405080292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150050597860942,0.047061572002333865,0.05110221223678119,0.3357807592398677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06240085945503089,0.0,0.0,0.05272123725800255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03947107547318433,0.0,0.10542865244936983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11991189829539757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21683188680284984,0.06323938590886477,0.06825787549355802,0.04042421287000185,0.0,0.05156643324692814,0.0,0.05500559383705588,0.0,0.05769703918964475,0.0,0.09283870628159384,0.043723661043357086,0.05876478113878324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04728552997308415,0.1697444377465646,0.0639524128735923,0.0,0.06956650961108916,0.10266887505883224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054826149409013376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041023292476626505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.494342863908366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06388036058453911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06904000606198826,0.0,0.0664975817055823,0.0,0.12968913586014413,0.08970254581698532,0.06134180112916589,0.21617459662630067,0.054163008535438435,0.0513953708310656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11047676411024698,0.057912057253281524,0.0,0.06205055599063757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06492704619415565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06504943882830609,0.044991479263807255,0.04538148316839696,0.28322262130246423,0.0,0.0,0.057435165860964324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422258443626297,0.0,0.1244188522404812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0679590392824234,0.06627722680217746,0.0,0.12729201889865985,0.0,0.06394443855925776,0.0,0.0,0.06899754260810756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13019452005706253,0.0,0.06966277250233407,0.2352504678484736,0.0,0.0,0.06570945647794116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06127519613014805,0.0,0.048771118680216496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06124751611229079,0.0,0.0,0.04711730263367968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06694649379554607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04066076348370951,0.03921661348919374,0.060131947036694576,0.0,0.07137629126517572,0.07034420815163271,0.0,0.05848239106652185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059786746356338474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05049914527265318,0.07219860277543574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833131640497038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911348567467943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882585750366405

lonely,JhntnBD,2018/01/14,"Success and Loneliness The past several years, I delved deep in to personal development. I disconnected myself from nearly everyone, stopped going out regularly and just focused on bettering myself. In this time, I've earned my BA in Marketing in Sales, started a relatively successful small business, and have got in the best shape of my life, currently prepping for a physique competition. The one thing I haven't worked on is developing relationships. I don't really have any friends, just business partners, and acquaintances. I haven't dated in MANY years. My social anxiety is sky high and I have no clue how to talk to girls or date girls. I have read every dating, self-help, EQ books I could get my hand on, but I can never seem to put anything to practice. 
I am attractive, successful, and a genuine and authentic person, yet I cannot seem to find or talk to anyone to potentially date. Everyone I've encountered all believes in my potential and look up to me for everything I have overcome and the success I have achieved. I am everyone's going to for advice, yet I feel like I truly have no one to talk to when I get in these bouts of deep depression and loneliness.All I really want is a girl to discuss our dreams and goals with, watch movies together, cuddle, support each other and all that jazz. Even when it seems like I'm getting close to achieving it, something ends up happening. I don't know what my purpose is for writing this, logically I know that if I start going out and forcing myself to get rejected, that eventually I'll develop that skill set and achieve successes in relationships. It would be nice If I at least had a wingman or woman to help keep me motivated.

lonely,lonelinessp,2018/01/14,"Where to look for such (specific) people online in hopes to cure my depression? Firstly... This post is just for that - getting suggestions on where what sites/subreddits/whatever I could use to find people to connect with. Everything else, especially unsolicited advice, will just ruin my mood a lot further, and I will not use any of it. So please stick to such suggestions... I don't want my mood to be ruined for the rest of the day, it's early morning in Europe.

Onto the topic then! Basically I enjoy getting to know people, though I am aware that my end-goal is to find a lifelong relationship with a female (I'm a 25-year-old male). I've been on many dating sites, however many of them require you to upload a picture, and I'm not going to do that. I share too personal things and everything online these days is tied together, unless you take extreme measures to avoid that. Not to mention that the person I'm talking to might just be someone I know pretending to be someone else, and I do not want to demand to talk see the person on camera before I say a single word. So after spending many years on various dating sites, chatting sites, etc., I decided to try Reddit and see if someone can suggest any sites for me.

Note that I'm only interested in meeting Europeans like that...",7.525158555729983,7.0126408000000025,8.039183673469385,70.99268445839876,63.44897959183673,10.803767660910518,35.580847723704856,10.214889679676881,3.6637503924646784,1016,41,177,20,13,338,138,245,0.064,0.856,0.08,0.4236,1,1,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,2,1,2,11,11,0,1,11,0,16,0,0,2,0,32,34,11,0,5,9,0,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,4,13,7,0,2,5,2,1,1,5,4,0,1,1,4,18,5,36,26,5,26,0,3,3,0,18,15,0,4,10,122,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11583542059127835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16122184020389815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10086837765866817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09464413947839116,0.0,0.0,0.15289633285704518,0.0,0.10209789158468632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1980490714171057,0.0,0.10499080637273504,0.0,0.1322028691448756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2130713055949939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21668589807412347,0.10082963215175827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238639850638848,0.0,0.06736872559012276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177364633278877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13029241050522955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057912408596838175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09954331914817617,0.0,0.0,0.10077803789812136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605413210423419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575166938471946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243872573674564,0.0,0.0,0.09015462598655308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465410767030798,0.3105123389012531,0.0,0.13012076652315166,0.0,0.0,0.1135280669087231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12726705326704765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094267362624833,0.0,0.0,0.1889212570507962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30131438311721986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08912694628038446,0.19055510848239127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07875237187355626,0.0,0.11646444997059692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08048053457989861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047601241701092,0.0,0.0,0.13983532839466414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15267109398640766
lonely,SassyTechDiva,2018/01/14,"First-timer I’ve been diagnosed as chronically depressed about a decade (more or less) ago.  I’ve worked w/ my therapist and I’ve gotten myself into a good place over those years. I’m at a new job for about a year now and I love it, I’m making more money here (in 1 year) than I ever made at my old job in 13 YEARS. 
I got a new car. 
Working on completing personal projects. 

But I’m lonely. 

All my close friends have moved to the other side of my state (one, across the country). There’s one male friend here who’s reliable and honest but it’s not romantic (w/o a chance of advancing, which is ok). 
The acquaintances I have are pretty flaky and will routinely back out of plans. 

As an adult, I never knew nor was I aware of how difficult it’d be to make new, good quality friends. I’m at a loss for a way to go about finding a connection to another person. 

So I’m here.",1.7651450276243104,3.478881602209949,3.5555766574585626,89.71966332872928,78.2817679558011,7.618922651933701,22.914709944751376,8.472884824447931,1.2899306629834255,674,21,151,14,16,226,116,181,0.086,0.7829999999999999,0.131,0.8423,3,2,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,5,12,12,0,0,13,1,9,3,0,4,3,20,22,12,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,1,2,0,0,4,7,7,0,0,2,0,1,4,3,4,0,2,6,0,11,8,26,13,4,32,0,3,0,1,9,13,0,1,13,90,18,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214507752590798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14366654900265952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535195266594287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14365199619506458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11800619836848344,0.13906189609014502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12393305933767625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12522432478724807,0.1165403260384886,0.0,0.0,0.31755991376114695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786573329211006,0.2298343639036812,0.10957912164694453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2719218447720718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12365654533014835,0.12964182994636309,0.1829099913025155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456195598405849,0.0,0.0,0.10567027734043732,0.3969742794316159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14376856504661936,0.0,0.1856825498213288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392630581722939,0.1431459081734697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13938805524460185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15907874693268925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875187145497757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1994892929677408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529188531214615

lonely,sleepy_kat,2018/01/14,"This Might Get Long, I Feel Totally Forgotten Im 22F, and I live in a rural area in Texas. I work full time as an Executive Assistant, but it takes a lot out of me to even do that, with my chronic illness. I have chronic pain and chronic fatigue as the result of a genetic Disorder. (I like to think of myself as a prime member of the X-Men) and that means recovering from work takes all the rest of my time most evenings, weekends, and holidays, depending on how bad I am at the time. 

Because of this, I can't drive, or live alone. My mom died when I was young, but my dad lets me live here and helps me out as much as I can. He can't afford to totally support me though, so quitting my job in order to take it easier on my body is not currently an option. I'm 6' tall as a female and am really thin due to my condition, making my height look even more exaggerated. Boys in high school never wanted to be with me because I was 5 inches taller than them. My guy friends wouldn't even hug me me because they told me I emasculated them. They'd literally go around the room, hug everyone in it, and intentionally skip me. As petty as it was, teenage me took a huge hit. My self-esteem was non-existent. This was before I accepted my bisexuality. (Rural area, remember? There aren't many partners to choose from, in the first place.) By the time I overcame my own self loathing at the end of highschool enough to put myself out there, it was too late. I didn't have an SO by the time high school ended. I also had a back surgery gone very bad about that time, so I was isolated from my friends for several months trying to recover right before every one either moved away, or got married and turned into people who only hang out with their SO's, kids, and other couples. Quite young, I might add. If you don't do the college thing, you get married right away after High School here. Me being unmarried at 22 is quite concerning to my grandmother. So I can't drive, my friends all went on with their lives, and all I have is my dad and my job that is killing me. I can't go out and meet people because I'm not going to have my dad drop me off somewhere and then come pick me up later. My pride can't handle that.

I like a lot of different things, as I have a lot of free time on my hands being stuck in bed by myself a lot. I love pretty much all kinds of TV Shows and Movies. I live for Disney. I also love fantasy, as in Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. tabletop games, talking about silly existential topics, talking about human nature and current events (objectively, of course), and discussing even the most outrageous conspiracies. I'm also into horror and creepy stuff.

I honestly am not looking for pity. I'm learning to live with the hand I was dealt and while it royally sucks about 95% of the time, it's still my life. I've worked hard and endured a lot to survive this long - I learned to use my body to the best of it's capacity, just like everyone else has to. I'm just really tired of being alone and isolated and forgotten, and there aren't a lot of options available to me right now to mitigate the problem.

lonely,notthrowaway37,2018/01/15,"Finished applying, now I’m sad For the past month, I have been working non-stop to write my essays, look for colleges and all that stuff. I had so little time to do anything, I stopped thinking about anything outside of college.
But now that I have finished applying( today), I cant help but feel lonely and sad. 
I clicked submit and I was actually overwhelmed with joy that I no longer needed to deny myself some leisure. So I watched a movie, and now as I am laying in bed, struggling to fall asleep, I feel lonely as shit. 

TL;DR Finished college application process, now im sad

lonely,pond__water_,2018/01/15,"Anybody have advice for a lonely me? Sorry ahead of time for the long post. Thanks for reading it, if you do :)

Lost my old best friend during a bad experience we had together on drugs. We were friends for many years and were roomates for a couple of years too. After the event, she told me she never wanted to talk to me again. During that experience I thought she was trying to murder me (had a major psychosis) and she didn't react in a comforting way so my mind on drugs over reacted and now I have a really hard time trusting people. Even my family. I have flashbacks, lingering psychosis, PTSD, and extreme anxiety because of that experience. 

I had 2 close friends when I was younger but we have since grown apart and I find myself becoming jealous when they tag their best friends in cute things on fb. Nobody tags me in anything :/ I feel sad that I don't have that. Nobody is thinking about me, I don't have a gril bff to think about. No reminiscing or inside jokes with somebody who thinks of me as their best friend.

And finally, I had one friend (we'll call her gina) that was a friend of my mom's (I was friends with ginas daughter) and after becoming an adult, Gina and I became friends. I felt a really great connection with her. We have a lot in common and we used to really have fun together. But something happened (too long to go into now) and we haven't talked in 2 years. 

I have a boyfriend and we get along and I consider him a best friend (of course there are complexities when dating somebody). It would be nice to have a girl friend. It's too humiliating to try and become friends with gina again. It will never be the same. 

I don't know where to meet a new friend, I'm too scared anyways. And how could I even meet someone that I have enough in common with or get along with? I live in a small town too, so that makes it more difficult. 

Any suggestion? 

Edit: also, my dog of 13 years recently passed and he was a really good friend. I'm so sad about losing him too.",2.619227298364354,4.686877152284269,3.742800338409477,87.72182036097011,76.96954314720813,6.915848843767626,23.127185561195716,7.8897218956490685,1.1318654258319234,1554,48,317,25,36,503,192,394,0.11,0.6629999999999999,0.228,0.9964,0,2,3,0,0,0,52.0,8,1,3,7,26,37,2,1,20,0,36,2,0,5,2,59,55,29,1,4,5,2,3,0,14,3,2,0,0,2,14,32,0,0,9,2,0,3,8,10,0,1,16,3,52,27,48,33,9,50,0,5,0,0,47,17,0,4,28,224,66,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06421622015959015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0525524931238659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04468865020829088,0.0,0.05027201645621803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05407808380168228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0548695216495385,0.04005943041987763,0.21773212218494573,0.0,0.0,0.27585656730466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06710265780163027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05246831121720754,0.07271271770356963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1524177447664352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06790146066773367,0.0,0.08680865763535993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928464881797912,0.06195052625631479,0.0,0.03322762480177329,0.0,0.06309698327705815,0.07198788730790581,0.060062583902138963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7108005731659598,0.0,0.06866705273831847,0.0,0.03734751332781944,0.055118866837624736,0.0,0.07245133846643531,0.0,0.0,0.05811181331421871,0.0,0.05886799142901796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036115404404883256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05802780442609552,0.11631192621051865,0.0,0.0735185994247933,0.07173600113706956,0.05586878897562832,0.0,0.0,0.04386546590613195,0.066624988944092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06635370888615226,0.07696495260949264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10136736467943208,0.06346823591944978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689571416358081,0.0,0.04453038076569592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04555870728525506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0629370817811159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07681765655136176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0657330728067485,0.0,0.16839558828838333,0.0,0.06488592024814921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06579246873040362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054360366405402996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05568035138342176,0.05059084027414675,0.0,0.07356288619947983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1056389206028503,0.0,0.060501809274769225,0.0,0.0,0.043658318194106635,0.12632311178016642,0.0,0.05217059924799581,0.07663822733724003,0.0,0.0,0.06279377510846132,0.0,0.08923273556160256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056756910565414626,0.0,0.0,0.038760580263117086,0.0521617378642427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04668225606645078,0.0,0.0,0.16927396703689804

lonely,fuckanimae,2018/01/15,"cliché first post I feel really embarrassed writing on here, but here i go. i feel really stupid and worthless for even thinking clichés like the “teenage life” exist. but as a teen,  that’s all that ever surrounds me. i am stuck in an environment where people live and thrive their social lives. i’m not trying to say i’m not involved in social things... hell... i live off it. 

i just moved from my old school and at my old school i may have not been the most popular but at least people knew me. i was mostly comfortable socially for the last part. it hasn’t always been like that. in middle school i moved a ton and it was hard to make friends. eventually i thought i made some real friends but somehow rumors were made about me and therefore my self confidence was gone. my depression worsened from then on and i felt like dirt pretty much everyday. 

when i moved to the area that i gained popularity i overcompensated with my comedy. my family members at my old school and my old “friends” got me connections over here. it wasn’t until 8th grade that i made a true friend. god bless her. i was able to share the feelings i had with her... which was helpful... 

i was finally comfortable and happy.

but i soon noticed i was really lonely and depressed even though i had all these people around me...

now that i’ve moved.. that feeling of loneliness has amplified and i don’t know what to do. my two best friends are always busy now because that’s what your final year of high school does... with my depression and all... i don’t really think i can make it much longer.

All of them are ""busy"". All of them are ""busy"". 5 different people are busy for 3 days straight, and all of them are busy next week too. I don't know what's wrong with me. People seem to enjoy my presence when I'm around, but it's like as soon as they leave nobody cares. I'm always the one inviting them, and I'm the one who always gets denied.
I can't remember the last time I had a friend over.
I'm stuck in online school, and the gap between my ""friends"" and I just keeps getting wider.
Does any of them care at all?
I have online friends, but no matter how much I wish they could, they can't replace a real, physical presence.

Not one of those who has friends, but says they don't. Nope, I have zero friends, I haven't hung out with anyone in years. I don't know why I suck so much. Sometimes it just feels like it'd be better if I wasn't even here, but I have a 3 year old little girl who I'd never leave. I have the worst social anxiety and don't even know how to try and make friends anymore. Idk just rambling on I guess, but I have no one to vent to.

lonely,BeingBetterBrandon,2018/01/16,"New Here! Hello! | 23/M I'm the best 6/10 I know **Hey there!** My name is Brandon and I'm... Well... lonely. (Go figure!) I'm actually new to using Reddit in general but wanted to sign up after I discovered this subreddit. I'm honestly a very late bloomer in life. I'd just gotten my first job last year as a dishwasher and still have no clue what I want to do in life when it comes to career choices.

&amp;nbsp;

I'll keep the short version of myself up here and create a nove- I mean optional section down there below the line for anyone who wants to know me more.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel lonely in two ways:

**One:** I can't seem to find anyone in my area who enjoys video games the way I do especially single player ones. The worlds and stories they create as well as the wonderful musical scores they have. (More details about this below for those interested!)

**Two:** I've been single... All of my life... Aside from one short online thing that wasn't anything special because we just weren't connecting at all. Goddamn I'd love to wrap my arms around a guy/girl and feel that warm embrace for once.

&amp;nbsp;

Hoping to stick around for awhile and meet some lonely hearts like myself, help out and also get some help if the need arises.

*Thank you for reading!*

P.S. Should I upload a pic of myself somewhere on here? You mine as well know what the person you're talking to looks like. I dunno. I'll check Reddit's rules again.

**More Details About Me!**
--------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

**VIDEO GAMES AS A MEDIUM** While I enjoy an interesting game or its story, I enjoy characters and their personal arcs so much more. My most recent example would be 9S of NieR: Automata and his journey through the game's events. Going into that would be spoiler territory however, but it's characters like these and the emotions they communicate to the player, the game's world and other characters that makes me fascinated with them. You play as these characters most of the time. You see the way they move, the way they fight and the way they interact with other people and their problems and all of that communicates their personalty so much more to you because of all of the time you spend with them through gameplay. Ah but that couldn't be done nearly as well without the help of...  

&amp;nbsp;

**VIDEO GAME SOUNDTRACKS!** When it comes to video games my favorite soundtracks include work done by Darren Korb of Bastion and Transistor, Kenji Yamamoto of the Metroid Prime games and Keiichi Okabe of the NieR games. All of their works give me a sense of mystery, exploration, excitement, dread and discovery. Darren and Keiichi's work however are masterful collections of soul-touching melodies that communicate the feelings of every scene through song almost perfectly. (On YouTube look up *""Transistor - In Circles""* as well as *""NieR - Song of the Ancients (Devola)""* to hopefully understand what I mean!)

&amp;nbsp;

*There are few things I'd love more than to meet and talk to someone who loves games and musical scores the way I do.*

&amp;nbsp;

**OTHER INTERESTS** Lately I've been trying to make a personal tabletop board game for my nieces and I to play together. The idea is that they're ""Summoners"" and I act as a ""Scholar"" detailing them all of the information as they go. Got a whole plot lined up and everything. Also enjoy some light graphic design from time to time like making wallpapers or retexturing stuff in Skyrim. I also love to write but goddamn my procrastination sure likes to hinder any progress I make on any writing I do, including the plot for the tabletop game.

&amp;nbsp;

Music I adore aside from video game stuff includes:
 
&amp;nbsp; • Raleigh Ritchie for feels

&amp;nbsp; • Run The Jewels when I'm in the mood for rap

&amp;nbsp; • Marian Hill and Alina Barez for those smooth rainy day vibes

&amp;nbsp; • Celldweller for high energy electronic rock

&amp;nbsp; • Combichrist and Motionless in White for the harder stuff

&amp;nbsp; • Linkin Park almost purely for nostalgia. :V (""Heavy"" is a pretty good feels song tho fight me.)

&amp;nbsp;

**LASTLY, MY LONELINESS** Its this kind of appreciation for video games itself that make me feel so damn lonely because I've never found myself talking to someone in real life about games the way I do. Even online I struggle to communicate to anyone the way I feel about games as a medium in fear of embarrassment. If you read all of this and are lonely because you feel like you're the only one in your life that enjoys the things you do the way you do, you're not alone in that regard. That glee you experience when you find out someone likes something you like too: It's so hard for me to find. You might understand this as well.

&amp;nbsp;

Again, You're not alone in that regard.

&amp;nbsp;

lonely,Allinde2018,2018/01/16,"Losing a close friend hurts I recently cut contact with someone I perceived to be a close friend. Over time however it became clear to me I had found myself a narcissist. Our friendship became toxic and finally left me no choice but to run.

While it feels good to be 'free' it left a hole in my heart and head. I'm a sensitive empathetic person and I can't help but feeling used by this 'friend'. 

Anyone else ever had to get rid of a friendship even though it left them feeling lonely?

lonely,neca1121,2018/01/17,"me going insane part 2 Reflecting on my childhood i realized i was always lonely, the older kids used to make jokes about me being an edgelord, calling me emo and one guy unironically called me a lone wolf, even though i dress like a normal kid and i was popular in my large group of friends. Even then i was searching for better friends. Remembering all this just strengthens the thought of me being born wrong.

You know those support groups you see in movies and tv series, i always wanted to be part of one of those, lately i've been really wanting to talk to people IRL",5.0129090909090905,6.4755020636363625,5.219772727272726,82.12965909090909,69.27272727272727,7.6818181818181825,27.38636363636364,8.07648339933343,1.751,457,15,84,6,8,144,78,110,0.086,0.73,0.183,0.8934,0,2,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,2,0,1,5,10,0,0,5,0,7,0,0,2,1,15,16,5,0,3,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,5,2,0,1,0,3,0,2,5,1,15,7,13,8,3,9,0,2,1,0,12,3,0,0,6,56,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915722092473988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15495618879334352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3578114924133126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314448962269704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27072869947652384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995740699366791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734822916581148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09628908282160208,0.0,0.19764091746093101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08559719919458537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11695190872824883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17166547761498654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23744934286521835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794638111760131,0.0,0.12146634410777635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11224197136014988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19847516553125244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1396171465121152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19882261602858428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408246002325968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1721398050048515,0.1390946393822921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15132243296692882,0.0,0.0,0.20668303648644692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19156114648606845,0.0,0.0

One of them is with what I think is a friend or BF, the other is alone and doesn't seem in a good mood. I wish I knew how to start a conversation... I also wish I could stop glancing up at them. I look like a damn stalker or sexual predator, and I haven't had a haircut in a while either.

lonely,iTz_Lays,2018/01/17,"A brief moment of affection Hello. I'm sort of new to this subreddit although I have been lurking around lately. I don't really use reddit all that much in general but anyway.

I had an experience the other day that I just wanted to share and I guess more than anything just to hear from someone else that this isn't so unusual. 

I'm just going to be straightforward and honest here and say that I am currently receiving outpatient treatment for alcohol use disorder (alcoholism). While at this treatment center I attend groups regularly and I sort of developed a slight friendship with a woman there that is also a recovering alcoholic. Unfortunately, we are currently in separate groups so I rarely get to see her (maybe once a week if I'm lucky) so I've been trying to make more out of the short moments we have together. 

Anyway the other day while my group was on break I got the chance to talk very briefly with her and she gave my shoulder a quick squeeze in passing. Because of that short little physical interaction the rest of my day was amazing and I'm still thinking about it almost a week later. I guess it just goes to show how starved for some sort of physical affection I am. 

I'd like to get to know her better and see where this might go but obviously I'm pretty apprehensive. Mostly though I was just curious to see if anyone else here occasionally has those moments of affection from someone you enjoy being around that just make your whole day better and you just can't stop thinking about it.

Even when there’s a big group of us, I’m always the odd one out. I’m sure this is stupid to get worked up over but what had happened was I checked my Snapchat when I woke up this morning and I saw that my two only friends here at college had been hanging out last night, even though they made it seem like they didn’t want to. When I saw this I swear I could feel my heart break. I just want to have a close relationship with someone.

lonely,Findingpeace2heal,2018/01/17,"I don’t know what to title this [rant?] The guy I really, really like basically told me that he only wants to be friends today. Which, cool, I can do that. Just gunna take a few months to get over it. But it’s a pattern. Every person I have had feelings for (and I mean every. One.) has never liked me back. Again, cool, I can live with that. If that’s my worst problem I’m set for the rest of my life. But it gets to the point I just find myself really miserable, asking what’s wrong with me. It’s a horrible negative way of thinking and only repels people more but it burns deep inside of me and it’s only seeming to get worse. It used to get to me once a month or so but lately it’s every day. I’m not skinny, I’m not “beautiful” by any means, not saying that for attention I have proof. 
Proof as in sales staff looking me up and down before answering a question
Proof as in sales staff actually completely ignoring me when I walk in
Proof as in when I got so deep in my loneliness I started catfishing just to feel a little bit of affection. I know how awful that is and I’ve deleted the profile around a month or two ago, but hear me out. I wanted to know if I behaved the exact same way I am but the picture was of someone attractive would the response be the same? Which it was amazing. People talked to me. I was pretty well-liked, it felt really good I honestly forgot I was being dishonest because who I was was really me and I had a lot of compliments on who I am, which I don’t mean to sound braggy, actually at the end of the day it hurt more because I know I’m worthy of something that I’ll only get when I pretend to be pretty. 

I moved out of state because there was one day the only thing that stopped me from killing myself was that I was just too sad to even try to move and just fell asleep. It was amazing! I fell in love with the people, the culture, but most of all the chance to begin again. I found my room mate on Craigslist, knew no one in that city, and just lived. All I had to do was look at the mountains and feel the sun on my skin and everything was okay again. But I had to move back here to help my parents out. I feel so broken again. 

I feel like I don’t have any friends. I have a lot of friends. But it just seems like they only want to be a part of my life when something is in it for them. I’m sick of going to concerts or on any adventure alone. I’m socially awkward, and probably come off as if I don’t want to talk but in all reality I want to listen. I’m really not good at words unless they’ve been said in my mind a million times, it’s especially gotten worse since I’ve started dosing myself, but I’m doing that to take care of my anger issues I inherited from my dads side of the family. I’d much rather be quiet than angry. But I don’t “blow up” on people, my anger is more me being mad about something petty for like 2 minutes then spending the next however long mad because I got mad about something so small. 

I don’t know. I just don’t know what to do. Somethings gotta give here soon.

lonely,softheartedcynic,2018/01/17,"Loneliness isn’t always solved by having friends. (Rant) Loneliness, in my case, has only gotten worse the more I talk to people. I feel more alien, more self-loathing, I feel grosser, weirder, more boring, more useless, more stupid, more unattractive, more lonely around people. I don’t know how to be close to someone in a healthy way, it’s either cold detachment, wanting validation from them or a shallow friendship. I’m too inside myself and too self hating and depressed to have friends or a relationship (romantically or sexually) without hurting myself or them in some way. People make me lonely. They remind me of something I can’t have that I really, really want. A healthy bond with someone, someone to be close to and have it not hurt.

I actually really like being alone. I wish I could be alone more often. I have a bit of a net addiction; it’s good for drowning thoughts out and distracting yourself from what needs fixing in your life. It’s a way to connect to people in a way that allows you to censor yourself as you wish and present a perfect you, or expose every bad part of yourself to a stranger. Either way, you’re seeking attention. Validation. Catharsis. Care. Purpose. Meaning. And you never get it, because you’re just finding a way around the problem and not really touching on what’s truly wrong. The type of loneliness I have comes from self hatred and can’t be solved by others alone. I need so badly to cut myself off from the internet and find time to be truly by myself for a while, in my own head and learn to be okay with myself and reflect on things. I need to accept myself, but it’s very hard. I can’t ever solve my loneliness if I don’t stop these habits; it’s like covering up a deep stab wound with a little floppy bandaid and hoping it heals.",4.9303529411764675,6.442336035294119,5.539882352941177,79.56747058823531,69.52941176470588,7.792941176470588,29.482352941176465,8.238735603445708,2.183067058823529,1412,54,251,20,25,456,173,340,0.18,0.687,0.132,-0.9318,0,7,1,0,0,2,49.0,0,5,3,1,9,25,3,1,18,1,21,6,1,3,3,64,41,23,1,11,13,0,4,2,2,0,5,0,0,2,15,21,0,1,11,0,0,1,10,15,0,0,2,5,34,10,45,31,15,30,0,6,0,0,14,17,0,9,8,177,49,2,0.0,0.0,0.08847664648149291,0.09883899795615936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28170697182614696,0.0,0.0,0.07544112715409702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.161423394076132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15140414814656405,0.0552689704194746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09898346438899044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09243972575616144,0.0,0.0,0.0781004741956701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07238918552333448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780902362914144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08201231818159957,0.07638976432695806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168660627622664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657336181873087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14009619294095302,0.0,0.04736908721377444,0.0,0.0,0.07604608924474432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08121866044630137,0.0895136101611456,0.09304916732263692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005149958228145,0.0,0.0,0.19411901839854626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049827498714270335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06403986663626395,0.08858936460565159,0.09087085215317378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060520060125455064,0.0,0.0,0.09876152905522098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20168240766864587,0.06992697875688791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895535193510284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981821199736417,0.0,0.2514247276016018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08675483215744913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2323310813541295,0.0,0.0,0.09734103327189983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837523019682877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2304622652869228,0.06979888693626418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07580058662559473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728736569235773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06023426373123805,0.0,0.0,0.07197843994239575,0.05286789995897083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0748086994424924,0.1069539602310917,0.431797284708776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20852216565589374,0.08739850132894632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09239609614049214,0.0,0.09912871221260963,0.0,0.0

lonely,mellifex,2018/01/17,"Anyone in college, not a freshman, and STILL have zero friends? Probably shouldn't be going to reddit for validation, but I really get kind of anxious about this since once I graduate, I'll never be around this many people my own age ever again. I'm in two pretty lowkey extracurriculars (book club and an lgbt women's group), and academically/job wise I'm doing great, but even though I'm successful for a sophomore, I feel like I have absolutely nothing to show for it socially. 

I'm a pretty reserved girl and I just get kind of depressed and lonely sometimes about all this. I feel like I'm doing everything that I can. I go to my clubs and I'm super outgoing while I'm there, and I've made lots of acquaintances, but truthfully it seems like everywhere, everyone already has all their groups of friends and I'm just here all alone.

I've always been really really picky about my friendships and who I let close, but this school year I've been trying to be more outgoing and tend to my friendships more, and it seems I'm as alone as ever. I offer to study with people (that I sit with in class and talk to) and I don't really expect anything, but I still end up let down.

It doesn't help that I'm gay and live in Midwestern US suburbia. I feel like I'm never going to get another girlfriend (last and only real relationship was like 3 years ago &amp; I'm still lowkey in denial that I dgaf about men romantically--no offense to men). Tbh I think I'm a decently interesting person and pretty considerate. It's kind of hard for me to be warm towards anyone but I'm working on it and seeing literally zero change. It's all just very discouraging.
This is turning into gay angst so I'm going to wrap it up.

Like I know that it's just a part of adulthood to be alone but dammit I'm getting really tired of it. I spent all of high school sad and isolated and I sure as hell don't plan on carrying that shit with me to adulthood!

I don't know. Does anyone else have this issue where they're growing so much as a person but don't have a lot of interpersonal relationships? I've always thought that growing into the person I dreamed I would be would include lots of loving relationships. Instead I have a lot of accomplishments but no one to see them except me.

lonely,myquietpain,2018/01/17,"So I stay For the past year and a half, my husband has been sleeping in our guest room. I gave up begging for affection sometime this past year. 

Nights like tonight, I lay in bed with tears. Thinking what it would be like to feel the warmth and security of someone’s arms. Someone who loved and cared for me and wanted that same affection. 

Our tenth anniversary is this year. We have a young child. I know that leaving would cause more pain than I already feel now.  So I stay.

lonely,civisstilllife,2018/01/17,"I’ve never had someone who I’m close to I’m just sort of always there. I have friends who never invite me anywhere or text me. I always just sort of ask if I can come after I get word of some plans they make without me and they don’t hate me enough to say no. I’ve never had a best friend. I don’t think anyone not in my family has ever wished me a happy birthday. And if they have, it’s been so long. 
I’ve never had a girlfriend. Never even kissed a girl actually. I’m nineteen. I’ve never once been told I’m attractive by a sober girl. Its so rare that I meet a girl who wants to spend time with me unless I buy them something, and when I do she’s not interested romantically. I don’t know what’s so wrong with me. I feel like I’m pretty normal, yet no one wants anything to do with me.

lonely,Periplokos,2018/01/17,"It's well past midnight and loneliness bundled with silence is driving me insane After graduating from Lyceum socially phobic due to bullying my life has been going down the toilet at an increasing rate.
A year ago i made some  final attempts at socializing that left me with plenty of new bad  memories to ruminate upon.It left me emotionally numb for around 10 months and the lack of a supporting family environment made it even worse every single day.Now that the emotional/cognitive veil is gone i feel that most of my intellectual abilities have degenerated to nothing.
Knowing that you are undesired by others for unknown reasons is more painful that just being alone out of your own volition.
I used to wish that i could disappear and my memory erased from anyone who had ever known me but now i have grown bitter and resentful towards those that i hold chiefly responsible from my social derailing and finally for my impairment of social ability that is my bullies at school who probably had much better social support than me and now seem to have a vastly superior life despite destroying mine.Being alone used to feel like drowning but now it feels more like tottering into an infinite ocean.
Can anyone relate to my story at least in part?

I wish I could get him to understand how lonely and depressed I am. ,-0.4411567164179111,1.6407803134328385,1.4135634328358222,99.84482276119408,89.1492537313433,4.544029850746268,18.82276119402985,5.985473137389443,-0.3727597014925372,239,7,58,2,8,78,47,67,0.114,0.653,0.233,0.8271,0,2,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,1,2,0,7,0,0,1,0,11,16,5,0,3,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,1,2,0,2,1,3,0,0,1,0,10,4,8,14,0,5,0,2,0,0,9,1,0,0,1,36,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16221301764222218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21246041204098803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22919285054677024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6167681262558341,0.0,0.27805412409840946,0.0,0.3024632539624215,0.0,0.2128256955812758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1973109064331466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20238219809560928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17678602679124172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27702106845714297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3060036172160652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,TotallyLegitIPromise,2018/01/18,"Hoping for Friendship or Love on Fetish Tumblr Less-than-safe for work, naturally.  So I've recently become marginally more active on the fetish scene on Tumblr, which is about as glamorous as it sounds.  A blog I follow is run by a girl around my age and she's into the same stuff that I'm into.  She's amenable to private messages, so I asked if she'd be willing to talk some about her fantasies and so on and so forth, and she talked a little bit about it.  And then my mind just kind of went off on its own, making up possible conversations with her and our relationship becoming closer (and keep in mind that I have exchanged maybe five lines of dialogue with this girl in total) and the possibility of romance and all that nonsense.  I'm well aware that this isn't really healthy and it's probably telling that I'm hoping to get something really deep and meaningful out of the fetish side of Tumblr.  Hopefully I'm not the only one who's experienced something like this; I'd like to know what other people do to deal with things like this.  I don't want every superficial exchange with a girl to escalate in my mind.  If someone could give a bit of advice, it would be much appreciated.",8.361489028213164,6.822638534482759,8.300971786833859,73.113934169279,62.36206896551725,11.367398119122255,34.884012539184944,10.230975488527342,3.292994827586207,948,32,182,17,11,308,135,232,0.027000000000000003,0.8029999999999999,0.17,0.9862,0,0,2,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,0,1,10,11,0,0,10,0,12,1,0,1,2,41,29,21,0,8,5,0,0,3,0,2,0,1,0,3,20,19,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,0,1,2,1,2,14,11,38,22,9,24,1,0,0,1,21,18,0,7,6,124,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135769912906028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11055603876249503,0.1161015250808922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743177067432997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.271168123764617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09915615572955597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12803514206551644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10463600761616948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06488450663700161,0.11913502052279065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37004811361149176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11038638620485736,0.0,0.1293254864653707,0.0682519520893603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820198853457643,0.12447169148592055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208694108718674,0.0,0.08289824596282168,0.0,0.12476623449518807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761915643317575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09129444234328367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08415482159547133,0.09445261146997423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08609818325794462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2800126725564833,0.0,0.0,0.13389856232460906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15911946457900306,0.0,0.122623318028025,0.13333431760843753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10522636358534593,0.19121611198597926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1421686208815245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19963953516695454,0.108548131789581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250677213193029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07325088312499609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11166233966653176,0.11512600833171087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09041229709555912,0.0,0.0,0.08822149874749402,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,someboredgamer,2018/01/18,"Loneliness at Night So I kind of just popped into this subreddit and decided to post. Hoping that someone could relate. 

I just entered my second semester of University and things aren't what I thought they would be. I haven't made a single friend and I find that being on campus makes me feel much more alone then I do at home, as weird as that sounds. 

I always find myself hoping at night that someone will want to spend time with me and that I just need to try harder and be kinder, but it never seems to happen. I'm just weird and awkward in general, and the friends that I do have (from college) are consumed by their lives with their significant others(which I'm happy for, it just makes me feel a bit lonelier). 

I also find that a lot of people at my school are overly judgmental. I tend to get defensive when someone is getting bullied or teased behind their back. So I probably come off as self righteous. I just know that single glances/sneers and insults can destroy someones world. Its like the only time I get along with people is when I go along with their cruelty or carelessness and pretend to be apathetic. 

Its not like everyone's like that though. It just seems to be a common social norm and I have trouble finding people who are just empathetic and understanding of the individual circumstances of another person. Or maybe I'm justifying my own inadequacy. I think a big part of it is because I'm in first year and most of these people are probably fresh out of high school. I don't know. I don't really have a point or anything. I just wanted to rant a bit. Sorry for the lack of cohesion.

lonely,cardsfan1926,2018/01/18,"No one wants to get to know me At my second year in Uni. Didn’t really put myself out there my freshmen year, and I spent a lot of last semester trying to do just that. All I have to show for it is a few half friends who don’t mind being around me sometimes. It seems people don’t mind being acquaintances with me, but aren’t interested in more than that. This fucking sucks. Why doesn’t anyone want to get to know me better. I just feel so down and lonely all the fricken time. Been to hell and back with depression last year, so that’s not so much an issue currently. I just feel so defeated and helpless any time I try to put myself out there.

lonely,shinjukushay,2018/01/18,"Analogy I came up with I know most posts here are explanation of symptoms when lonely. Well, a lot of you describe exactly what I'm feeling. I'm here because I have no real friends. Just colleagues who gave up inviting me to the nearest bar years ago. Anyway I'm just letting off some steam so if it annoys you just ignore it.

I met this girl at work last summer with no intentions of falling for her but I did. It was as if I had been on course in my ship, with a specific amount of fuel, set off to find a planet to land on someday. I had one rule: never choose to land on a planet uninvited. Well, it turns out I had been in my ship alone for way too long because the moment I received that transmission from this girl at work, I was immediately interested in visiting her. After some time investigating I realized it was time to forget my end goal and compromise fuel to go visit her. As I approached her atmosphere, I had a much better view of her. Her oceans were the purest blue I had ever seen. The soil was rich, and vegetation was booming. This planet... this girl. I couldn't wait anymore. She was more interesting than anyone else I had ever met. No, I'm not overreacting. Everything was going great until I got a little closer and realized she wasn't alone. She was in a relationship and failed to tell me before it was too late. I quickly turned away and headed back to my path only to realize I had burned a good amount of fuel in the process. Now I'm back to the lonely and empty ride, knowing the reaching of my final destination is greatly compromised. Space is quiet to the ear, but it is mentally the loudest noise I have ever heard. I think I'll get over the mental noise, but someone please give me some more fuel.",4.160145772594749,5.4249533294460655,5.551470553935863,79.69812128279884,71.09912536443149,8.286833819241982,27.42262390670553,8.726425361277474,2.042832396501458,1364,47,263,24,25,459,186,343,0.086,0.8,0.114,0.9326,0,6,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,2,0,5,19,15,1,0,18,0,29,5,2,1,5,45,52,16,0,3,9,0,1,0,1,0,1,4,0,3,14,11,2,2,9,1,1,9,7,5,2,1,28,8,40,10,46,22,10,57,0,3,3,0,26,23,0,7,22,191,54,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564577575690122,0.0,0.0,0.2468688329198759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11819441977132365,0.0833333455636943,0.12211387459977907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197342364316684,0.1832839476430725,0.0,0.14530190150095995,0.0,0.10141330278467707,0.0,0.0,0.10540492184223016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13631003675927156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09955949977609796,0.0,0.10555800225434267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234150832151901,0.0,0.0,0.1071111944625128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060260930016399185,0.0,0.0,0.13055573682951388,0.10892825432824013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207808229856723,0.0,0.062266570123233236,0.11432820397350214,0.13546534850809755,0.0999624317687633,0.09531904006751757,0.2627924844442871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12231294379509687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13099629421844666,0.09714751172157587,0.13444009961795725,0.0,0.0,0.1218695054900411,0.0,0.0,0.1194495528743945,0.0,0.10547044646222484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10132247497815848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2402105821768747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876109273332719,0.0,0.09191887330700918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075937341094569,0.0906416717987922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13082372295746594,0.0,0.0,0.1141413839621125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1356527991389225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12795459297620213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10098072847583817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12387353204481395,0.0,0.0,0.10416847118272617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07636565702836637,0.0,0.0,0.1389894968930744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2592669796108636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09459944409878904,0.0,0.0,0.21431405626209707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17352874912337876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07674793746214735

lonely,tr3bron,2018/01/19,"The limits inside us So she broke up with me recently and it wasn't a long relationship but it was intense for me. I realized a few things. 

I was alone for a long time before I started talk to her in the summer. I was fine, focusing on my studies, just doing my thing. But when she came into my life she filled my days. I was happy. And this relationship just changed me. 
I realized I just don't want to be alone anymore. And I read a lot of wise things on reddit, like I have to find myself, have to search things that I truly enjoy. And I know this is true and I want to understand myself better, because I know right now I'm so messed up inside. 
Before the relationship I was a closed person, barely went outside but I did open up because of her. Right now I want to socialize more, talk more, go outside more, find a new girlfriend, but I have these limits from my closed personality. If my friends are busy, I just want to go outside alone, but I can't because I feel the fear, the limits that are holding me back. Can't even study or focus because I always thinking about the life that I had with her. That was so different. But it ended and I am here alone again.
But damn.. I want to change.

lonely,yorkshirelad92,2018/01/19,"25/m/uk Hey guys i’m 25/m/uk and i’m here looking for some new friends :). I’m a bit of a gamer with xbox one, ps4 and just recently started pc gaming (not very good). I’m also a big horror, comedy and action fan and love metal and punk music.

If interested and would like to know more, feel free to pm me, i also have social media/apps like snapchat, kik, instagram and twitter if makes it easier.

Hope to talk soon :)",-0.00977272727272549,2.0846484772727294,2.7260909090909102,91.1916363636364,86.95454545454545,5.792727272727273,17.89090909090909,7.1686216300943375,0.2365872727272724,318,8,71,5,10,111,65,88,0.037000000000000005,0.645,0.318,0.9785,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,0,3,0,2,1,0,1,0,18,13,11,0,4,4,0,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,8,0,0,2,2,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,2,2,9,6,12,3,6,0,0,1,1,7,1,0,4,6,32,3,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39696395531846973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27096537591529585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1254951818942335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917553493347392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2081747419762184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457527222242471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465142899035873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13640184250343246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2425117228483017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20842184265481006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22400627112977933,0.0,0.16567252867474114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2397089126512708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16818380089907134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2450632692674935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2530042168396364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756741638585298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19949026804133288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20478741061748448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763110740307798,0.0,0.0,0.0

I haven't held a hand, or hugged someone or cuddled with someone. I have family I hug but it's not the same. I wish I wasn't so ugly maybe guys would notice me more. I got to bars and things by myself hoping to get some sort of interaction but no one ever talks to me, or anything and I end up looking pathetic and feeling lonelier than before. Seeing all the couples just makes me feel so depressed I want that so bad. I come home after work to an empty house, I binge watch tv shows to get my mind off things until its bed time.I sleep hugging my pillow wishing it was someone.

lonely,micechest,2018/01/19,"long distance My best friend lives over 1,000 miles away. We met online and recently arranged for him to come visit me for the first time, which was really exciting and wonderful..
.
I love him to the moon and back, and it breaks my heart that I can't see him more often and casually. It's only been a few days since he went back home but I feel so desparately lonely thinking of how long it'll be before we meet again. 

I have friends here of course but it's not the same. We aren't as affectionate and close. There's more of a physical and emotional barrier. I don't connect with people very well and usually keep my personal space bubble intact even around my few close friends (or even family for that matter), but he's an exception. Our relationship is really special to me. 

I'm grateful for having been able to have time together at all, and to be living in an age where keeping in touch is effortless. I just wish we weren't so far apart. My heart is aching. :( 
Every three seconds I have to urge to tell him how much I miss him but I fear I'd just come across as clingy haha! I just love him too much.

SIGH. Feels like a waiting game full of lonely days.",2.830708154506436,4.674211072961377,3.893414163090128,87.89866201716741,75.60944206008584,7.578454935622318,22.8087982832618,8.395991825355821,1.2514207725321884,912,26,191,17,20,295,143,233,0.1,0.698,0.202,0.9779,0,4,0,0,0,0,27.0,5,0,0,2,19,18,0,1,8,1,17,4,2,2,1,44,34,20,0,1,10,0,3,1,3,1,0,0,1,1,7,19,0,4,4,2,0,4,5,4,2,3,6,4,28,13,26,25,10,33,0,3,1,2,25,15,0,3,14,131,35,0,0.12679655131232587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11287581309793235,0.0,0.0,0.11912953384516307,0.19499744255031495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10789452615950468,0.0,0.13306515787672835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2184480032432629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16354657195895864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426290538771357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16749585259007024,0.0,0.10683156317105028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195325039731788,0.1426813717659821,0.12822429230719912,0.0905834815926745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10785308177221613,0.0,0.0,0.2938881030343741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30050904761339603,0.0,0.0,0.12718727932513213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22540520151202384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06194639023000601,0.0,0.2239273556585834,0.22442191571326195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288776760545127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18642010922548155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964344909444531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0879047635052582,0.1107138578349458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16245823516386335,0.0,0.12519629757099393,0.13613204382478267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104043499108446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488741752496328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11082577463119987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812461102605936,0.0,0.0,0.1478721774821443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13964848758868795,0.10462043404176832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11400532728342508,0.11754167338681455,0.0,0.0,0.1458097764085543,0.0,0.13750545111946305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Cheesytatertot,2018/01/19,"I feel like I'm destined to die alone I tried tinder and dating apps, but it felt more like they wanted to hook up. Anyone worthwhile were way too far to date.

A lot of my good relationships were long distance. My last relationship in person was with a fuckboy who coerced me into sexual activities. 

I was raped, and I generally don't feel like getting involved with guys my age anymore.

My current relationship is falling into shambles. 

It really just feels hopeless and I'm not sure why I try. I feel like this is trivial, and I'm just pitying myself.

lonely,ArrestedLyric,2018/01/19,"My ex-best friend Ok for some context I only really have about 3 close friends, one goes to my school and the others don’t. For this post I’ll refer to my class mate friend as W. W and me had been friends for about 4 years or so and she had of course met my close family and all that. I didn’t have anyone to go to hoco with so W asked me to it. I’m not gonna lie over the years I on and off had feelings for her but I never acted on them. After homecoming W stopped talking to me out of nowhere. Whenever I would message her I’d only her one word responses. After about 2 months W messaged me and said “I miss you” reflexively I said “I miss you too”we tried talking again after that but it didn’t really work out. So that’s the main situation but there’s a little more

Last night I had a dream that we were in a class room together. All I remember is that she hugged me from behind while I sat in my desk and then kissed me on the cheek. If this was a few months ago I wouldn’t have thought anything about it, it would’ve been normal. Now though, every time I think about the dream I get butterflies. I feel pathetic that that is the closest to even just platonic physical affection in the last couple of months.

lonely,maxernest73,2018/01/20,"Graduation Day So it was graduation day at my school today, I'm 18 btw, and it was depressing. I've never had many friends, never had a best friend or a boyfriend. I was pretty much okay with it because i was involved with my studies. I had always had a distraction. Today was the loneliest I've ever felt. Everyone was hugging each other and clicking photographs and I was just standing there, alone. That was the moment it hit me...i am so fucking lonely and i am NOT okay with it. I know that I'm not a very interesting individual and  that keeps me from approaching other people. Iam scared that my whole life I'm going to be like this- invisible.

I have ""friends"" (let's just call them friends), not that great of friends, but still. But this last week reality hit me hard. I was out of town the week before, and i was so anxious to go out again. I love hanging out and all. And it was just like *puff* no one is there and no one wants to go out. So i spent a whole week in my house playing video games and watching Vikings and Harry Potter movies. Now it's Saturday night and i would just love to get wasted just to chill out for a few hours and have some fun, just relax and share a few laughs (alcohol does that to me). I don't find myself such a pain in the ass to deserve this but yeah, guess Harry is my company for tonight (or if anyone feels the same and wants to PM)",0.09436046511628148,2.261292970930235,1.416325581395352,100.22576744186048,87.31395348837209,4.602790697674418,18.483720930232558,5.985473137389443,-0.4634172093023254,629,17,151,5,20,199,98,172,0.14800000000000002,0.6659999999999999,0.185,0.8877,0,1,1,0,1,0,23.0,0,0,1,0,12,14,0,0,8,1,12,5,1,0,2,38,24,18,0,5,11,0,2,1,3,1,2,0,0,0,8,16,1,0,2,5,1,3,5,2,0,2,4,3,14,12,18,17,7,25,0,0,1,3,9,8,1,4,15,100,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15753675657644498,0.0,0.15267259112542253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16653165517935886,0.0,0.10307269365581476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25087057815433306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505223750301197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12899972743102026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07453506560884858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347303232924426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3416664447458569,0.0,0.07701578598455358,0.0,0.16755331582218946,0.0,0.0,0.16252035161286804,0.1623890401127933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13205065452613468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14516943003514127,0.1700916688297645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2403181018923383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15073699634151316,0.0,0.07201721572325816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2660870618845459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1383345598133613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19977803840983668,0.0,0.15685492871321427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410517276047713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14918707093248934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177220382211606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16235159496395893,0.0,0.17389280215986375,0.0,0.35473089945757363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16457831077273025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047160318993456,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Realmstalker,2018/01/20,"Not sure if this place is where I need to be. So I've always been kinda solitary and what not. I have my group of friends that I rarely ever hang out with. But recently I have just felt like there was something missing. I had found someone who I had thought felt the same way as I do, but apparently their attentions are taken elsewhere. Am I actually seeking companionship or do I just need someone to talk to? Also for some perspective I'm drunk right now, but I feel this way when sober, the feeling just increases when intoxicated.",5.361608876560332,6.449931097087383,5.843717059639393,79.373786407767,68.12621359223301,8.992510402219137,32.190013869625524,9.23628265651192,2.7514421636615802,425,18,82,8,7,137,75,103,0.064,0.879,0.057,-0.1608,1,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,1,0,11,4,0,0,2,0,12,2,0,0,2,27,23,11,0,3,10,0,4,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,3,1,0,7,1,0,2,2,1,0,0,9,4,12,3,8,13,3,13,0,1,0,0,6,4,0,4,6,60,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.20350423202501486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1667687679409218,0.1735213669949322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886356964448091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21088742780419825,0.0,0.4004607787913017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22865253074683475,0.16111691213364734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10188174691627934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3092584323491431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21787913754274826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20590735725880507,0.0,0.0,0.17809138546345565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35338927029948536,0.16054370782618302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19654578112673984,0.0,0.0,0.16761595490838466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16555687546204498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33105750993672994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I just want it to end well for me. On top of my social anxiety and introverted nature, I just want to be with someone who will give me happiness. While I have my friends, only one of them gets my problems but it’s so incredibly hard for me to open up to people. I’m good looking and I do good in school, yet I’m still virgin and my confidence continues to crumble each day. Even after fighting my social anxiety so hard I can’t even catch a break.

I believe all life is precious and I keep fighting to find *true* happiness, but I would be lying if I said I don’t experience suicidal thoughts.

lonely,winterfnxs,2018/01/21,"Humble words for a lonely soul. Please read. I had a lonely life. And after all I have learned that being alone is okay. There is bad people out there. People that will ruthlessly burn you. I know, I’ve felt it, I’ve felt the cold and sought for any kind of tiny spark I can find in bright or dark, dry or wet streets and alleys. Perhaps my search hasn’t ended yet now I know how to keep my heart just warm enough rather than blindly throwing my self into fire. 

No one cares about you, perhaps one or two souls sometimes there for you and care for you. However only you are here with you no matter what. You are the one truly understands you and loves. Don’t love yourself. You already love yourself. Please find the love you feel for yourself, don’t loose it again. You owe that to yourself. And appreciate it. Appreciate the love you feel for yourself even if you don’t appreciate yourself. 

Be in your darkness and your light. There are many bad people out there. And their fire may hurt more than the cold of your loneliness. If my words appears unworthy to follow. It’s either because I’m just a humble fool or you need to find out the meaning of my words by yourself. If thats the case go out there. Let misery fall on you from sky in the streets let cruelty of strangers froze your bones and let melancholia blind your vision. Stay out there. You’re either gonna find happiness or you will learn and grow. Just stay out there.

If these humble words can understand you please understand this. And remind it to yourself when you’re in need.

lonely,epic_twat,2018/01/21,"I have accepted that I end up alone. Is that wrong? Hey everyone, I think something is wrong with me, last couple of weeks I have accepted that I end up alone but before that it used to frigthen me is something wrong with me?

I never had really succes with girls usually i get friendzoned and I had only one girlfirend who cheated on me. Im also bad in texting girls where im intersted they never seem to be intersted to what i had to say or the give short uninterested awnsers. there was one girl i knew that i tought she is the one let me explain that for you:

We had always had fun, we liked the same music, same clothing style, we had the same interest in art and that sort of things, we had deep and meaninfull conversation, the goodbye hugs could last some 20 minutes or even more, and there are so many more things to say about her

and just the bond between us was so strong,  everyone we knew said there is something special between you, you two are soulmates.

But in the end she chose some fuckboy who had a reputation to make use of girls over me (everyone tought that she was stupid or something) so yeah is was pretty bummed out. We are still friends though.

10 months later and I just have the feeling that im okay with that I end up alone. I have accepted it, I don't really have interest to pursue somebody anymore I don't have the energy to do it anymore.

(sorry for the broken English it's not my native language)

lonely,kavipriya98,2018/01/21,"boyfriend’s (m19) family hates me... (f19) moved across the world to move in with him and his family... I left all my family to move into my boyfriend’s house which is across the world. I’m from Singapore and he’s Dutch. And I have absolutely no one here. It’s been a month living here and it’s absolutely miserable. My boyfriend’s mum and Brother hate me. I’m Indian and they are white (Dutch as I said) and today they really broke my heart.... we all sat down for dinner as usual and they were all speaking Dutch as usual and his mum was baking bread in the oven and accidentally burnt it and his Mother was like,” oh no, the bread is burnt” and his Brother said, “can I see the bread?” And he said, “oh it’s a little dark we don’t want that in our house” and everybody looked at me and laughed....

lonely,Dilexar,2018/01/21,"Bad habits. -Vent-
-Long-
I tend to keep people at a distance &amp; I hate it. I can't help it though. I feel way too uncomfortable w/ vulnerability to let just a small handful of people in, &amp; even they don't really know 100%. They all individually know a little bit about me that the others don't. &amp; it's because I'm afraid of investing so much into someone &amp; losing it all. I'm not afraid to recognize my faults, &amp; I know I'm just torturing myself, but I've had some problems before w/ investing everything that I am into people, &amp; then things happening to cause us to separate. It tears chunks out of my heart every time. I don't think I'm not enough, I just...
I don't know fam. It's 745am, I've yet to sleep, my roommate is out cold, the two people I actually want to talk to are asleep, &amp; I'm just stuck here w/ a half working vape, a show I love paused at 3:12 because I feel guilty for not giving it all of my attention, &amp; thinking way too much. 

God I wish I wasnt this way. I wish I could let myself trust someone completely &amp; wholeheartedly &amp; be okay w/ that, but vulnerability terrifies me, in more ways than socially. 

(Later edit, cause this is all I've got at the moment &amp; I guess I've got more thoughts to get out)

I hate that I moved a year &amp; a half ago. Sure, I was getting involved w/ a LOT of bad things (drinking, rampant drugs, other things I don't care to discuss outside of pm), but I had a system of connections there. The best part was, most of them were empty anyways. I could be comfortable around them because I never had to expose myself to them. It's easy to get high/drunk &amp; waste hours away doing nothing. It's hard to talk w/ someone for hours about the way I see the world, my history, my favorite movies, shows, music, interests, where I want to be in the world. It's hard to bare myself in that way. Now that I'm in Alaska, &amp; I hardly know anyone, you'd think I'd be happy that I don't have the constant pressure to open up to people around me. But there's the catch - that lack of social pressure left a void of loneliness. When I used to have everybody, I felt anxious &amp; pressured. Now that I have nobody, I feel barren &amp; alone. God, I wish I had the ability to trust someone w/ my everything. I knew someone like that, a long time ago, but I haven't seen her in years. I finally got in contact w/ her again, but Snapchat can't possibly emulate the feeling of laying w/ her, laughing at nothing, for what felt like decades. The happiest ""decades"" of my life. But my mistake was letting myself stay in that fantasy, believing that nothing could ever happen to ruin this moment of pure bliss. It ripped my heart out when it came time she had to leave. 

I didn't mean to rant about an old love. I'm just kinda word vomiting I guess. 

I hate being stuck in this lonely/socially closed limbo. It's my hell.

Every time I spot someone who looks like me, lonely, I get this excitement and urge to *try* and talk to them, but it usually ends with my hopes getting too high and realizing they already have a friend to go and talk to. I know people can have multiple friends but it just seems like EVERYBODY at this small school already is in a friend group, and im just such a nervous wreck and ugh",2.776597744360899,4.916089328947368,3.549548872180452,88.9518421052632,76.76315789473685,6.974436090225563,25.98872180451128,7.957251820313856,1.4867616541353383,606,23,125,10,14,192,81,152,0.106,0.682,0.213,0.9497,0,3,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,5,0,5,18,0,2,7,0,13,0,0,1,1,27,26,11,0,2,5,0,0,4,6,2,0,0,0,0,8,12,0,0,5,0,0,1,3,5,0,0,1,2,14,13,15,21,0,12,0,2,2,0,16,7,0,4,8,73,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887696853271626,0.0,0.4358619412448277,0.0,0.08216218371529692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09792663926527273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06019288778764715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10104849184583456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745709339174583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08319533505616385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5340208122223294,0.0,0.1031784066039818,0.0,0.05611798908088315,0.08282104193106861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3129825743090013,0.0,0.09807419549027216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10665951105618857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05426663489628507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19296359756352552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16583869883539054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591179753096267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321677028661581,0.07615677935913598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06845604459745079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885908626390216,0.29979991896369185,0.0,0.1797840508619639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0836647228298087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380979320177872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632706024746419,0.0,0.0,0.05757790575157123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13408018991650808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875159335097853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10027842869321632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,TheMaskHero,2018/01/21,"[vent] I rely on one person too much It's easy to stop feeling lonely when you have just *one* good friend who's around a lot and easy to talk to. You aren't lonely when you spend most nights casually talking to someone, right?

But then they're busy one night. And maybe it's fine, you don't notice, you don't need them all that much. But if it's a night when you were really hoping to have someone around? What a reminder that you're far, far lonelier than you thought.

All I wanted to do today was play ARMS with someone. It's an event weekend, so what better time right? But my friend was busy, which is fine that's not their fault, but it left me all alone with no one to play with. I could play on my own, but then I don't have that fun talk on the side. I might as well just play offline against CPUs. I might as well just not play at all.

It's sad. And it hurts. And it's not my friend's fault, I can't expect them to always be around after all.

This wouldn't happen if I had more than one friend. If I could find other people to get close to. But I can't, it just never clicks. So every once in a while, when my friend is busy and I need someone around, I'm going to go through another night just like this. Again and again and again.

I hate it.",0.9422388059701492,2.676859313432839,1.975874626865675,99.9900208955224,80.86567164179105,4.8850149253731345,16.317014925373133,5.414198509911553,-0.9596309253731344,968,15,237,4,25,304,125,268,0.108,0.696,0.196,0.96,0,5,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,7,3,1,21,27,1,0,6,0,22,1,1,0,6,54,34,27,0,11,17,0,1,1,5,3,0,0,0,1,21,15,0,1,3,7,1,2,12,7,2,5,5,2,27,20,30,23,11,39,0,4,1,0,20,16,0,8,22,163,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098576690626487,0.0,0.0,0.07919651335330538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998034308124991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33891778839340914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08417804911260639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519852980516428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08019237276530054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04812533834126373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08699183854353369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3676751141433895,0.0,0.049727074469563266,0.0,0.10818478454772038,0.07983158987055212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08416643362428597,0.0,0.0,0.0939695109267034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094534175961951,0.0,0.0,0.1018910375061655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341221070283647,0.0,0.0,0.04649962866157485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08091774203569578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956200510044584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.201939655822978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13993496347162818,0.14114797498037526,0.07340787599268288,0.0,0.0,0.3572759984002725,0.0,0.0,0.10836186860022874,0.0,0.1013624784228821,0.3224786083265345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598510172103803,0.08310659035821705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06097407435756661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16256461127783928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3225792713470892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07957386636893955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295037108285911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07556145692791996,0.05549961278427775,0.0,0.09021851826787827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05613901236078325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17115461819283667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

An only child, born in a weird age gap where I have family members a few years older and younger, but none my age. I missed out on social media, most I’ve ever done was download Snapchat since my friend made me then never used it. I’m pretty introverted, and I can never really make friends. I do have great friends, but I feel like they’ve been leaving me behind. I mainly just spend my nights in my room playing video games.

lonely,GeorgeHennon_PMOKING,2018/01/21,"(small vent/discussion) Interesting how the majority of us in this sub seem to be 20-something yearolds/young folk... Sup people, new here. Not sure if what I have to share is completely relevant to being loney, but I digress. Anyways...

So, you'd probably figure that most people around this similar age group would either be living the time of their lives, getting somewhere, making connections, or have become really successful recently, right? In truth, it's quite the opposite for us. In my opinion, It's feels like we're sorta the ""leftovers"" of society, and only few people trully know/ can relate to our suffering as a silent majority, like a ""Millenial's curse"" if you will. 

What do you guys think?",4.84145333333333,7.653510792000003,5.464500000000001,74.43808333333338,73.08,9.286666666666667,28.816666666666666,9.725611199111238,3.4017066666666667,559,23,89,16,12,180,98,125,0.077,0.782,0.141,0.8185,0,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,3,3,1,2,5,8,0,0,6,0,11,0,0,2,2,21,17,8,0,3,6,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,1,7,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,10,7,13,11,5,10,0,1,0,0,10,6,0,7,6,59,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16376269537566307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20316849060620065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1928777280142952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09301530214734936,0.1314204938595465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09611109274476036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18214853643136014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010991689274958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17974635228641822,0.0,0.3248786992052781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12279419878592597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1776689479318971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13990926604038692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826024534279521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19833913840121128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1956632600680328,0.0,0.0,0.11784897820990728,0.0,0.1816375233859122,0.0,0.0,0.15710015719005904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1674695525464346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14162078457491534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17337937503097142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787363155930915,0.0,0.0,0.10726809265389008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4425605501694535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306793422293946,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,thehorniestfrog,2018/01/21,"Saturday night. Syllabus week. Everyone’s out having fun. I’m alone. 21M
It’s syllabus week in college. Saturday night. Everyone I know is out partying. I’m sitting alone in the library.
Everyone already had a plan when I contacted them. I was not invited to anything.
I made the mistake of going on social media. They all dressed up so nicely for their best parties before the school year begins with assignments and homework. 
I’m not an introvert. I join organizations. I try to fit in. I want to go out, to meet people, to drink, to have fun, to have friends.
Useless. No one deems me enough to hang out with. 
I hate myself. I don’t know what I did wrong. I don’t know what more I need to do. 
I am so lonely",-0.2807042253521104,1.847053408450705,2.1646366197183085,89.65994084507045,102.94366197183098,5.370591549295773,22.58140845070423,6.918507183188421,1.2326537464788734,552,24,110,11,25,187,91,142,0.153,0.6709999999999999,0.17600000000000002,0.6609999999999999,0,4,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,3,2,3,10,1,0,5,0,11,1,0,1,1,17,24,4,0,3,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,3,7,1,0,3,1,0,3,5,5,0,1,4,0,18,5,22,20,4,23,0,2,0,0,7,10,0,0,9,71,21,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3414532071603305,0.18190725173104996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13565092478330953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14026840518903635,0.0,0.17299151445369035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16148240903301922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17032585635789585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4725408001882433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12735652426494426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187367020616144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627473527326409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2717785651066221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597749097892433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12222825810781827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093861102454258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11170120882928987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428069082182785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16682890969901076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16803566519973448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11191690097846392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722808554222408,0.0,0.26445262681793863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18022885529200466,0.0,0.1061528467544386
lonely,MetamorphicBear,2018/01/22,"What if I deserve loneliness? Do you think it's possible to deserve to be alone?

Everybody that talks about the subject of loneliness seems to have the firm belief that there is someone for everybody, that everyone deserves somebody and if they try hard enough they will find them. The people who ask for advice here think they're good enough to deserve someone. The people who give them advice concur and assure them that they will find someone to share themselves with. 

But what if I have nothing to share? I am boring, anxious and withdrawn. I don't have dreams or big interests or anything that defines me. I barely know myself and often I feel like there's no me at all, like I'm just an automaton trying to pose as a person, empty and meaningless. Maybe I don't deserve to be loved because there's no person to love in here. 

Maybe I deserve to be alone because I don't care enough about anything, so how could anyone care about me? All my life my relationships with people have been shallow and volatile, slipping through my fingers time and time again, leaving me in the same state I was before. And I get it, because why would anyone stick around for me?

What do I do, then, if I deserve loneliness? If I don't want to be alone but I know no one would have any reason to want to be with me?",5.251645658263307,6.259285765873018,5.268954248366015,83.68911764705884,68.32539682539682,7.675443510737629,30.299719887955185,7.724431198458867,1.9250417366946773,1031,39,195,11,17,322,123,252,0.131,0.8009999999999999,0.068,-0.8253,0,3,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,1,6,0,14,12,0,0,7,0,26,4,1,2,3,43,42,21,0,10,10,0,3,2,0,4,1,0,0,2,12,12,0,0,10,1,0,0,7,1,0,1,2,3,32,11,29,30,6,10,1,0,0,2,19,5,0,9,6,144,44,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20827047974343413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3311112781659704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246865818975869,0.0,0.0,0.12038945300105965,0.0,0.14902710472918396,0.0,0.1753897758072886,0.09486649547925076,0.0996249949573719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19488526662879227,0.0,0.0906799720615616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21730264998428048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08508442509835015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33033405937168464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10182855386255127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05388306366367985,0.0761309018394452,0.0,0.0,0.19479911979933928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05567643182997863,0.10222799235892867,0.0,0.08938265761093835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09546236749830676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11713197355496885,0.0,0.0,0.11283819998235252,0.0,0.0,0.07527084600731039,0.1041257074908002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1923602800707053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141201069283641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10225312590367312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722120029969113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22163871836141685,0.1860989596535928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12013735854030998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095677838494786,0.0,0.11441219837663764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701384990711083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27087954101210954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08565386057781091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365666131690439,0.0,0.0,0.12427919561869165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470288501914044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571099056392676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09615940410450254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15140311656935113,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,autecker,2018/01/22,"why am I defective why are you all ignoring me? it never leads to good things.. everyone's laughing and enjoying life like they're in on some secret on how to enjoy this shit. 

why does it only feel good to hurt, turn the volume up til it stings, to berate myself or to imagine taking revenge on all those who made it hell? i don't want to hurt anyone else..

no one listens to us

all i ever amounted to was pathetic. a bunch of social and material dead ends and lost connections which were always weak either way. a well-meaning loser who was used and laughed at. us well-meaning folks never are those who make an impact in the grand scale of things.

i want people to hate me, so i can hate them, and i want them to hate me so i can feel alive

we learn young that no one owes us anything, so how can we owe it to them to act nice?

lonely,Wheresmydeadspace,2018/01/22,"Taking initiative. /rant So, there's something i'm seeing a lot on here lately. 

Usually it revolves around people feeling really lonely (duh) and they hate it. When the situation get's explained it's often that they don't feel valuable because people won't reach out to them.

Ive seen multiple situations where people make a post and describe the way they feel but it all boils down to them waiting to be spoken to. Where they expect that if they place themselves in a certain situation people will come to THEM. As a former introvert i'm going to be bursting that bubble for you.

It, won't, happen. 

Ive seen multiple people getting the advice: ""have you tried taking initiative?"" and the answer is the same a lot of the time. ""it's not that easy"" 

This, right here. Pisses me off. No, it's not easy, it's hard. Doesn't mean it doesn't need to happen. 

YOU need to take initiative. There is no scenario in life where someone walks up to you and frienship/romance happens. You might think so, but you're wrong. Even if someone were to come up to you right now to talk to you. You still need to talk back. And you can screw it up just as hard. Awkwardly saying hi, or awkwardly responding to a greeting. It's one in the same thing.

However if you don't shoot, you will ALWAYS miss. Yes, you can be in bad place. However this bad place came to exist is irrelevant. It's your responsibillity to deal with the cards you have been dealt.

So yes. ""it's not that easy"" find a way to work hard for it.
If you want something you actually have to work hard for it. People who seem to make friends easily might make it look easy. But that's because they are easily putting in the hard work.

So next time you say it's not that easy. Think long and hard if you've done everything you could have. 
Don't dismiss advice with a ""it's not that easy"" ask others for advice. It's one of the reasons this subreddit even exists.

lonely,yaboy_3343,2018/01/22,"Loneliness I guess I've always felt alone. Sometimes I dwell on it more than other times. I used to have a girlfriend and that did absolutely nothing to help with the loneliness. When I lied awake at night and she was asleep I would kinda just get closer to her the point where our backs were touching and somehow that consoled me. It was like if I was literally touching another person then maybe we were connected in some way. Like maybe we're in this together. The reality was that our heads were in completely different places. She had her goals and I had mine I guess. Every man and woman has their own lonely road that they must walk through in life.  Even when I'm surrounded by friends I feel alone. Back when I was suicidally depressed I told my parents about it and my mom tried talking to me and i would calmly look her in the eye while thinking she had no idea about the shit storm that was going on in my head at that very moment. It made me feel trapped in my head. Here this woman is right in front of me trying to talk me off the edge and she felt so far away from where I was. I'm no longer that depressed but these things still stand out. I guess the point of this post is to see if anyone relates to any of this (thus making me feel less lonely I guess lol). I guess it feels good to vent anonymously, I could never tell people about this in real life. I present a very strong, secure front but idk i guess I need to get it out somehow. Does anyone know what the fuck I'm talking about??",2.6594800098111366,4.645046086092716,3.151030169242091,92.39329531518277,76.5496688741722,6.195928378709836,21.781211675251413,7.0931098945946705,0.4629775324993868,1186,32,253,13,27,368,165,302,0.107,0.8170000000000001,0.076,-0.5667,2,7,0,0,0,0,23.0,3,0,2,2,18,14,2,1,10,1,22,9,6,4,2,47,50,18,1,7,5,2,8,2,2,3,2,0,0,4,22,12,0,1,9,0,0,4,3,7,0,0,18,11,43,7,38,28,4,47,0,4,3,1,26,27,2,12,15,170,65,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812706846697002,0.0,0.0,0.07281643412742718,0.0,0.0,0.0595107029874441,0.09176325620585246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12237990861365945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221977204872609,0.13458161682567868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917539609800597,0.0,0.0,0.06987067343825773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507467547586925,0.0,0.0,0.09143071047316914,0.0,0.0,0.0765817516466187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057800405888274,0.0,0.07373206700321082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17699342462482376,0.0,0.16804919431234452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761103385922984,0.08090281131409979,0.0914421125159671,0.0,0.049734703612934986,0.07340034881540937,0.0,0.0,0.5784215542641655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26943560436687275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05865699756845458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09878963582970696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0480939364870702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12362367600695348,0.08550722762958789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07348747406330917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08280533317566813,0.05841449005012388,0.0,0.17583377980709486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10249220806262968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0648885398308338,0.06749412998536307,0.0,0.0,0.08212345184555535,0.0,0.08396947807778199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971709719353912,0.0,0.0,0.06066933516917272,0.07641151492841089,0.09143071047316914,0.0,0.1654529796177637,0.0,0.08381166052935733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09960704835208876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473419477291635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06973519718014405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982911919570333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08655093967813406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06988665847536339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572318765051076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21101486838186315,0.07648875667677862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05813863687694884,0.05607372454049853,0.0,0.0,0.0510285582949266,0.0,0.0,0.08362082279331659,0.0,0.1188288927504567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07558168867039712,0.0,0.14441201876493748,0.0,0.06946241774767142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12433107120514265,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have been lonely and miserable since day one. I thought it was because of the end of a relationship that coincided with my move to this place, but it’s more than that. I have reached my limit of no friends, nothing to do, and nowhere to go. I’m just so tired of being so alone. The friends that I had have all moved on and are living their lives in other places and I’m 30 minutes from the nearest Walmart. I’m just so exhausted. I’ve encountered some troubles with work and have realized that I don’t have the support structure to deal with it.

lonely,lonleyolive,2018/01/22,"I am having a hard time making friends in college. I am afraid I got lost, while others around me are moving forward. In high school I never had a lot of friends, people knew me and I had a friends group, but I wasn't really ""in"" the group. So, I had people to sit with at lunch, but I was not invited to hang out or go to parties. Often times, I was sad about not having people to hang out with, but I do not remeber being as sad and depressed as I am now at 20 years old. I recently went to a high school friends apartment she shares with her roommates and while I was there I couldn't help but feel like I'm behind socially in EVERYTHING. I don't have friends or anyone to talk to about anything and I've never kissed a boy. I don't know what I am doing wrong and it just really hurts that I can't make friends. And every time I meet someone, it feels like they already have a friend group.What do you think I should do?",2.85259340659341,3.6947408564102595,4.002142857142862,91.17750000000004,73.76923076923076,7.007326007326008,24.18498168498169,7.1686216300943375,0.7453443223443229,717,20,163,7,14,234,104,195,0.145,0.682,0.173,0.6954,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,1,1,8,18,0,1,7,0,26,2,0,2,2,35,38,17,0,2,10,0,3,2,7,1,0,0,0,1,5,12,1,0,5,0,0,6,10,7,0,0,11,3,26,11,25,24,1,30,0,5,0,1,19,13,0,4,14,114,31,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12783385897633273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08099899620651071,0.0,0.0953275970239882,0.10312340055740243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09977402300070257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760137073389964,0.0,0.10411077552757847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11714577901035705,0.16551423019315686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6264914161129781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0658353338372475,0.0,0.09264894518048468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037711355516344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07764604463844582,0.24478558601682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401060828074205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06366340068728507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1131885075721521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12645456583826284,0.09848421074271227,0.0,0.0,0.15465006017980087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12312106917908346,0.0,0.0,0.17868804906219612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12155605649584615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2409295106470208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14842192670733148,0.0,0.11437940147120723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344753506272501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11808571304181036,0.09815203730772308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310892458956106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422648787357929,0.0,0.0,0.20264414542763284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10738613290288564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12665437936981042,0.0,0.07459805979591355

lonely,LonelyThrowawayBoy,2018/01/23,"Not sure if I'll ever meet someone new. Where to start? My has been firing off in all kinds of different directions for a while now and it's been really hard to pin down the source of my anxieties but something that keeps coming back to haunt me is the real possibility that I may never experience another romantic relationship.

My last relationship ended about a year and a half ago, but it's really like it ended about six months ago because we were stupid and we kept hooking up with each other for about a year. We dated for 3 years and I seriously thought we'd get married. She's moved on to someone else and I haven't even been on a date with anyone since her.

I've cut my ex out of my life entirely and I feel emotionally in a better place to start dating but it's like I've forgotten how to do it. I've never been good at striking up a conversation with strangers and those dating apps are absolute trash (I've never been stood up so many times, I deleted tinder for the sake of my self esteem).
I'm 27 years old and I know that I'm still pretty young but I don't really have a good job or the even the skills to get one; which I think honestly matters more to me than to anyone else but it's just kind of terrifying to be directionless in my late 20's and I can't see anybody wanting to put up with that.

Most of my friends are in relationships so it can feel like I'm in this one alone. I'm sure I can figure it out but this time being single feels much harder than it ever has before. Maybe I'll be single forever, some people are, I suppose I need to learn to love myself enough that it's alright if I do.

There's plenty more shit on my mind but this post is already way too long so I'll end rant here.

lonely,ZondaHalo,2018/01/23,"Worried I’ll never find someone I’m a 19 year old guy in my second year of college. Every day I get less hopeful that I will find a girl and eventually raise a family one day. I don’t live a crazy college life I just study and stay in on weekends a lot. I haven’t met a girl in months, let alone one that I would date. I just want someone that would appreciate me as much as I would appreciate them, and who has similar morals, lifestyle, and plans for life as I do.

lonely,zhu_redd,2018/01/23,"[16M] It felt so much more peaceful, like a bliss, before I was born. My sister died, and now I’m living the nightmare of my childhood. I’m a sophomore in high school. Raised in a violent family, there’s been social workers to try and pull me from my house to escape the violence, there’s been police, but I don’t care about that. I care about how I am. I’m not socially awkward, but I have literally no sense of humor, because I don’t try, because my sense of humor is terrible. People generally perceive me as the nicest guy in the room, and I’m also one of the most attractive guys you’ve seen, and I’ve got a lot of attention from women, but not men. I want to be friends with men. But men hate me. Women hate being friends with me. Nobody likes me, and even if I dated a girl, she would instantly break up with me because of how uninteresting I am. Being in class is so stressful to the point where I just have to leave, because everyone’s socializing, while I just sit there with my head down, like a loser. I can’t eat lunch at school, because the first two weeks of freshman year I had to sit with the autistic kids because every other table was filled with people who had friends. Now I just walk around and try not to get caught during my lunch period. I need help. Jesus Christ, I had to save my mom from my sister when she was trying to kill her, and I had nobody to talk to when that happened. No one to let out my stress to. My future is now fucked because I’ve failed every class two years in a row for doing literally no work, all because I have no motivation to (but no, I’m just a lazy teenager, right?). My sister died three months ago. She tripped in the shower, and broke her ankle. While she was at her friends house she passed out because she couldn’t breath, because it turns out she had a blood clot that had formed where she had broken her ankle, which traveled to her lungs. When doctors used blood thinners to get rid of the blood clot, there was a 2% chance the blood thinners would cause a stroke, and she had one. We took her off life support three months ago. Again, nobody to talk too. I cry myself to sleep every night because the stress won’t just give me a break. One minute... that’s all I ask for... one minute to be normal. Holy shit I’ll take ten seconds, I would do anything, I would be so grateful. The school put me in all advanced classes because the ITBS test basically gave me a high IQ, and there’s so much work I haven’t done, my future is literally gone. But with this much stress and no one to talk to, why would I. Nobody understands... nobody. I need help, I beg... please, someone help me. I don’t know what to do. It felt so much more peaceful before I was born, why not just go back to it.

lonely,knightofinfinitedicc,2018/01/23,"I don't even feel like a part of society I am 19 and I do not even feel like I am a part of society. I am here to only observe the lives of others. I can try to get involved and I'm allowed to watch, but I'm not allowed to take part. 

I'm in conversations and sometimes I eavesdrop. People talk about hanging out with friends and doing things with their lives outside of work and school. Some even speak about parties. But I cannot ever see myself doing these activities. I often feel like I am here to only witness others enjoying their life. These activities seem like myths to me, not reality. Yet I am forced to believe the myths because deep down I know that they're possible. I keep replaying memories, a collection of about a dozen days in my life when I was happy and with friends. I know it's not impossible to feel this sense of happiness and friendship. But memories of the myth only serve to make the other 99% of days, sad and mundane, even worse.

I live most of my days as struggles from the first step I take out of bed until I can put my head back on the pillow, usually wet with tears. I have to go through my day dealing with happy people with friends. I put up a happy mask and delay the tears for that night. They laugh and they enjoy life. Yes, they struggle too, but they are rewarded with happiness after it is all over. They get together and drink, cuddle with their SOs, and do things that make them happy. I study and I work and finally I come home, but for what? So I can sit and cry in my free time? So I can wish that I can live a different life?

My life hasn't improved in the past few years, and certainly not from a lack of trying. It seems like every attempt at improvement has been met with a firm ""no"" from life. I can talk about this later.

I hear depressed people speak about their problems and how they cope with them. Even they seem alien to me. They go out with their friends and they drink too much. They go places and they don't feel so included. Sometimes they don't like themselves. They have positive stimulus and they don't feel the happiness. This is depression and how it manifests within a normal person who operates within society. I used to think I was depressed, but these days I increasingly feel like there is no depression there. I think that my life would be a struggle to any rational human being: longing for connections but being met with a brick wall of unrelatable people.

lonely,MoonBeth,2018/01/24,"How does your life gets so fucked up? Have you ever been to a point in life when everything seems lost, everyone seems distant, you feel so empty and disgusted with yourself? If you have, have you ever wondered when did it become this way?

I like to believe in transparency, I'm gonna be honest here. I really don't know where to start. It's just like a dream, or a nightmare (whatever you wanna call it). You don't remember when or how it started, it just does.

I remember how terrible the nights were at first, when I used to shed my tears all night and cry myself to sleep. I hate to say but I'm used to it. As far as I can remember, one of the few problems were because of a boy (such a cliché).

There was this boy, well, IS, who used to be my best friend. Yes, used to be. I felt so happy and comfortable around him. When he was with me, all the emptiness inside me never creeped out, it felt as if it vanished. He cared, he noticed. When I was down, he used to walk upto me and talk to me. Make me smile. 

I guess the problem was with me, or it's just true when I say I'm a horrible person, still I don't know how, but we grew distant. He found another girl with whom he liked to spend time with, who he talked with. It was like, I just vanished from his life. He stopped caring, when I was at the verge of crying, he wasn't there, when I walked down the path so alone and lonely, he wasn't there. He stopped talking. And the worst part is that he had the capability to look in my eyes, and not say a word. And it killed me everything. It felt like a thousand knives penetrated deep in my body, reaching my soul. 

And I'm not gonna lie, I tried. I tried so hard. To make everything work. To make everything just like it was. But I can't. Not anymore. I gave up. On him. On everything. He was the only one who saved me everyday from crying. I don't know how he became one on the reasons for the teardrops on my cheeks.

We were so close. It's funny how people become, from friends, to complete strangers. I don't know who he is now anymore.",0.8628033128565136,2.8736159834905664,2.421147433084688,95.2667222465994,82.56132075471697,5.830978499341817,20.709521720052656,7.025160622230231,0.30168863536638835,1563,46,362,20,43,509,186,424,0.139,0.6990000000000001,0.162,0.936,0,3,0,0,0,0,73.0,2,7,0,4,38,27,4,0,19,1,32,8,4,15,6,80,69,41,1,5,16,0,5,6,2,2,3,3,0,4,22,20,0,2,16,1,1,3,12,10,1,5,22,10,47,17,49,42,6,49,1,2,2,1,46,22,1,9,29,238,69,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774399699604368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07840367367731235,0.0,0.0,0.14830502835573842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06656183927823801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04557956852771572,0.16515688615298454,0.0,0.08424105530474564,0.07846731207543703,0.0,0.0,0.08305347167084799,0.0,0.0,0.07634931794096655,0.0,0.15246757024088098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839573172015056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463965457647321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13086481264939095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13526888770693984,0.0,0.07144667674181138,0.3359957424960012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03780634886196863,0.0,0.2153749998208978,0.0,0.0,0.06359998034615631,0.0,0.08198229202750751,0.11553542572188474,0.0691243737429983,0.03906464224625409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236843493347161,0.0,0.0,0.0795948770002048,0.06697992510888283,0.07382065736953804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272278084991287,0.0,0.16436824315522267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15843842219421153,0.2191753338748992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627886168610283,0.0,0.08162113004255098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14973021246028184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057667828729131475,0.0,0.0,0.14033460855637653,0.0,0.0,0.08512701933821823,0.0,0.0,0.1519998302822732,0.05686654129839413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08096945956420712,0.0,0.05183663868850304,0.06528695394370848,0.0,0.0,0.0706825474555404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309106131051094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0479000710675782,0.0768768065249849,0.0,0.0,0.2541021264743664,0.0,0.0,0.1783821565826913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13613700501232462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07482477041570071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1058462743289653,0.0,0.05971203499152534,0.12502342657445112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18029374246003985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04359943836129882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10152889201907987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32288970005600626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059349558408305914,0.0,0.0,0.06722790350948325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108571257293533,0.05443401242856809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,JamesSpadersDentist,2018/01/24,"I'm doing this to myself I'm drinking all my friends away and I'm totally awake for it. You hear about people sort of coming to the realization that their lifes' gaps are empty suddenly and abruptly. While I sit here repulsing people with out of character texts and mood swings. The only sudden epiphany that I've had in coming to terms with this, is that these people left hints and bread crumbs (more like a 40 foot high neon arrow pointing at the words ""get some sleep"" written in fire) recognizing my most shameful problem along the way without me noticing them let alone accepting. Their olive branches fermented and i indulged in that wine as well. I'm drunk typing this as I'm sure you've honed in on. My friends are wonderful and accepting, and indulgent in their own right. 
 STOP. RANTING...
Herein lies the problem. I start rambling, in person and in text, with literally NOTHING to say while my fingers get the better of me. I've outlined the problem and the solution. I guess I'm just lonely, but it's good to know I'm not alone on here.

lonely,Gavinso,2018/01/25,"Starting my PhD, I thought there was ample opportunity to make friends. 3 months later, I'm alone again. A PhD at the University of Cambridge provides ridiculous opportunity to make friends, in theory. The college events are great, then there are the university societies, then there's my colleagues. I have a social life pretty much set up for me.

I don't know what I did wrong. I didn't notice it happening, but suddenly I took a look around and realise that everybody but me has made some seriously close friendships. I have a colleague who goes to the same college as me; I thought I could become close to him as our lives overlapped, and it looked that way to start with, but now he's getting invited to college parties I'm not even hearing about. He is also now close to one of my colleagues who he smokes regularly with, whereas we just really exchange pleasantries.

There's the group of Italians; three of my colleagues are super close because they share the same heritage. Everyone else seems to have found a close group based on some form of overlap. 

The societies dwindled as I never felt accepted. I tried tennis and caving; neither of them seemed very ""social"" and I very much felt unwanted.

I could keep going but I won't. Everybody around me has people they're really getting close to. There are events and parties all of my colleagues are going to all of the time. For the last few days I haven't even been asked to lunch. I've eaten alone in a shared office while everyone else is out somewhere, and they just happen to return together. I don't know how this keeps happening in my life, I can count a total of 6 times now that I've ""put myself out there"", so to speak, and been firmly rejected. It always isn't long before I just stop being invited places, for seemingly no reason, and other people keep getting invited though I can't distinguish my behaviour from theirs. 

I just don't get it. I have zero problems with dating, so I'm not a dislikable person and any girlfriends I've had tell me *they* don't understand it either, but I'm starting to feel like I have no choice but to accept my life as someone who will be forever friendless.",5.903519870235198,6.876487997566912,6.137420924574207,78.17276561232767,66.8345498783455,9.105920519059207,31.767234387672342,9.250403328903447,2.801153122465532,1721,68,311,31,27,550,206,411,0.084,0.8079999999999999,0.108,0.8968,0,3,1,0,0,0,48.0,2,0,5,3,24,16,1,0,17,0,34,5,0,5,4,72,74,27,0,4,13,0,3,1,3,2,3,2,0,1,14,23,2,4,16,0,1,4,15,5,0,3,14,7,44,11,46,54,13,49,0,1,2,0,28,19,0,5,25,215,58,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951520735459357,0.0,0.07534193367995383,0.07839258804633252,0.0,0.0,0.06406792751590061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16773871375228755,0.08807624033810084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05743124199336029,0.10405062401758186,0.08016814471673284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1504424924126313,0.0,0.0,0.0607594551615553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574053929181706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12445331777112045,0.0,0.0,0.18004871542762696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04763681712030321,0.06730563560315812,0.18091810480848086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032994608042219,0.14557713483848994,0.0,0.19688917597931474,0.0,0.10708659875083658,0.0,0.0,0.10386993296200264,0.0,0.0,0.2499361756875473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1061846608799816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2512219682211617,0.0,0.0,0.10355377040187362,0.0767959978100874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19963583816176092,0.04602761005036258,0.0,0.08319161913707147,0.08337535395405363,0.15823003007066067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914641934154295,0.1257755370558888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519974969149078,0.0,0.13851448100716285,0.0,0.07266271125319022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726188521977408,0.0,0.0,0.06384102437318105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13063057140751738,0.08226297378551338,0.09843231279855998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0958482769734,0.0,0.09014891578244784,0.0,0.09470987513793266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12071025074791805,0.0968664386660094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25730335537379706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920761486829496,0.07982619076355796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20005289183637176,0.0,0.0,0.07876611054435821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08234613057054865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09256358728393947,0.14958886229513296,0.10987247032756577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046738756099969,0.06396429974232741,0.0,0.0,0.09807883640332636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554708361050443,0.0,0.0747817270159953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10300689548518413,0.0,0.0

lonely,depressed8881,2018/01/25,"Should I leave this group? Looking for advice! I'm in college right now, and I'm currently the secretary for this art club. I'm wondering whether I should leave this position.

Every time we hold leadership meetings, I get completely ignored. Hardly anyone acknowledges my presence, and 2 of the people there are obsessed with talking about how popular they are. This is not a joke; they have actual conversations about their popularity status. In college.

So that's one issue: 90% of the time, we don't get anything accomplished at these meetings. It's all talk and no action. And it's also damaging to my already low self esteem.

I'm left out of the group chat, too. Even though there are only 4 people in the leadership team, somehow I've just never been added to their group chat. As a result, I have absolutely no clue what's going on. 

It's just the president who contacts me, telling me when to come to their meetings. If anything, it's like I don't even have a leadership role, and that I'm just a general member of the club. 

I don't know if it's just me, but does anyone else think this kind of environment is toxic and socially exclusive? Should I actually give up my position, due to these reasons?

What would you do in my position? I'm curious as to what you all think about this.",3.8682099827882936,5.884475293172697,5.099345955249572,79.62168674698798,73.17670682730923,8.758921399885256,28.72461273666093,9.362217197678863,2.742815490533563,1024,42,190,25,21,339,134,249,0.07200000000000001,0.883,0.045,0.309,1,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,2,2,5,2,19,9,0,1,11,0,17,0,0,3,3,39,33,17,0,6,9,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,0,1,19,11,0,2,6,7,0,3,7,4,0,1,1,2,23,5,27,28,2,21,0,2,1,0,28,11,0,4,8,130,42,4,0.0,0.0,0.2853454429375162,0.0,0.0,0.14286756258290054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613382881666027,0.11691822691529286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2044566204262213,0.14980191866135484,0.2406246896095572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12594065942392565,0.1532907238223621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127942946725164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12213357520842423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19313097682541225,0.0,0.12318205992542793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15276972749399612,0.1402509286390978,0.083090349827778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13096888027220435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525976087564947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1522475884410621,0.08034916702039586,0.0,0.0,0.3096150470787749,0.15884963490355505,0.0,0.0,0.07142724235213982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277342548176055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11276051658920075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09907071679199962,0.11119372299531027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20271705335805826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150320700614592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12485628618813972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15252127634723225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14903521611301435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2350243452964097,0.12778758268325932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873615423337809,0.14364338653862627,0.0,0.1705039118331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15855056518035382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038581860394446,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Theurbanpunk,2018/01/25,"Loneliness in Los Angeles I cant help feeling everyday that what I relate to about being human, is not what other people relate to. My dislike for gender confirmity and oppression of any kind leaves me feeling like a woman on an island. I see so many lonely people pining for the attention of someone they view as their better, but why? I rack my brain all the time and I cannot find a reason. I dont want to be accepted. The fact I dont shave and wear makeup makes people treat me horribly. When I would help anyone no matter who. Why is everyone so desperate to fit into a group? What is so horrible about being good instead of beautiful? Instead of rich? Instead of statuses? The doctors say I have borderline personality disorder. It brings tears to my eyes that my compassion for other people is seen as lunacy. Constantly questioned why I can’t ignore others pain like most people. Its making me physically ill at this point, to not understand why Im so different from everyone. I used to think it was because I was biracial. But I see other biracial people clinging to the same labels as everyone else. I just want people to be free to be themselves. If your not a masculine man, there is nothing wrong with that, everyone seems so hell bent on making others unhappy even if their happiness doesn’t effect them. So many kids which no one to love them. So many men that feel there is no one to love them. Woman who feel scared to show their face in public. Woman, men, children all dealing with sexual abuse. It can change. I feel it, I dont know if anyone feels like I do. Like your lost in a sea of people trying to reach out for an identity, when all you need is light. Not like sunlight. But like that feeling when you help another person not for yourself but because you know they will do better. The feeling when you see nature in all its glory, breathing in that air that seems so still and perfect. I don’t think Ill be around much longer if I am forced to live in a wealth and status based society. We arent all the same. We are all different, want different things, but for some reason thats not okay with most of the population. I mean to sound like a martyr. But I weep for the lost people of this world all the time and that they just go ignored, if I could give my life, so that no person has to feel the abyss of a life propped up by humanities delusions of success I would. We live in a world were people act like if you dont have money you are no one. What kind of existence is that? Will I drown in this worlds existentialism? I don’t know but the only person that kind if gets me said people on here are kinder than alot of the forums you can speak on so I guess I thought Id see if anyone feels the same.",3.4213602817846365,5.1322572195571965,4.6281130493123115,83.8213443475344,73.66789667896678,7.731700771553171,24.31080174438108,8.438071523408619,1.5506701107011072,2151,65,422,38,44,708,240,542,0.183,0.635,0.181,0.8895,4,2,0,0,1,0,52.0,3,9,9,7,27,36,1,1,26,1,44,13,5,7,9,96,87,38,1,15,23,0,10,8,0,4,6,4,0,14,34,15,0,2,27,1,4,3,22,10,0,3,8,22,57,27,64,68,15,36,2,4,7,2,50,24,1,16,17,298,91,2,0.0,0.06954155725931407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03991322386211669,0.061544683618234286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12311844198226694,0.0,0.0,0.05224917592875918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07155736441736726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10381830279900016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06552075165215973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06208936677410432,0.0,0.0,0.06342623615306607,0.0,0.046861550785686726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050986212717186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183964945722012,0.06726721437421462,0.06007472917756027,0.0,0.0,0.2751508369244776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049030434791949164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03876614497440287,0.0,0.0,0.22433454502382305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2967692290857221,0.08386052133008938,0.0,0.0,0.053644299969894366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030664647904131637,0.05630363312802855,0.033356560406250284,0.049228868199473266,0.0,0.0,0.06465690994242965,0.0,0.0,0.062479744798328185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802195693386378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339846601272553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18335905039753853,0.09676834369561348,0.0,0.0,0.0621473675461318,0.0,0.0,0.08291314347545796,0.2293953152547216,0.0,0.10365391380096707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12814059314889378,0.0,0.10594537159136393,0.0,0.11753401494789414,0.1785163404673548,0.0,0.06393383729951556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043146077163270985,0.043520084393901017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05631747581289249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11931560124656256,0.044638639090781085,0.062453445089595876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4475933736410863,0.204993706871492,0.0,0.0,0.05548381620976087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06574954507058503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12069227150333177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055830443267195114,0.046674995677729765,0.05876188966635481,0.0,0.18708275294326035,0.10686372856329536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04973035254207618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04687227178766476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038992993062064205,0.07521615467522832,0.0,0.046595652298751115,0.06844867119167435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03984866553027532,0.0,0.0,0.06110143882101283,0.0,0.05069187067769726,0.0,0.0,0.10385588129356713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21184506065620207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08338758624771471,0.06417153540391086,0.0,0.0
lonely,uglychip,2018/01/25,"A little over a year ago I actually made a friend somewhat. A little over a year ago I actually made a friend somewhat. It was only a texting relationship, we never really seen each other besides the single photos we shared with each other. She was cute. We had ok conversations, mostly because I have no idea how to talk to people and I have told her that upfront if I recall correctly. She was the only person I really shared anything about myself with and it was pretty great to actually get to know her. Then I stupidly broke things off even though in my last text message to her I promised we'd still be friends and we could continue chatting. The reason why I broke things off was because I fucked my location up and had put west not east and I was really bummed when I found I screwed that up. I hoped I could have met her in real life if she was near me but because of the distance (I don't own any vehicles) I found it futile to even continue conversating because it would just depress me and I'll have the knowledge that I fucked up my chances of actually be in a real relationship. Then I realized that I was only thinking of me, because she herself had problems that she told me of. I am the type of person who wouldn't shy away from helping people or giving the best advice I could - I did, of course, for her - but then I just abandoned her... I hope she is doing well, at least.

I should have kept that friend. Being lonely is fucking depressing.",3.6983638842599618,5.408955794425089,4.982445084078172,81.56608089683384,72.93728222996515,7.500015149219815,27.11240721102863,8.18289091462,1.8277763672170884,1151,42,219,18,23,382,143,287,0.134,0.7090000000000001,0.157,0.2893,0,2,0,0,0,0,26.0,5,0,0,1,10,26,5,0,15,1,32,5,0,4,2,51,50,17,0,11,8,0,0,0,4,3,1,0,0,2,15,14,0,2,8,1,0,1,5,12,1,0,21,1,52,14,30,19,9,31,0,6,1,4,39,17,4,8,13,178,67,1,0.0,0.0,0.3540767418969298,0.0,0.0,0.08864007176940668,0.16081663118821413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0616854301280335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464601961031554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522436720205781,0.0,0.0,0.2764777168941805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09519380720003158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21727196931030912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1562555631321824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982526570204888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19891611665199946,0.2803271005477834,0.2515778404867933,0.047391861960978346,0.08701661983686351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10000731630566574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06080052735711325,0.0,0.0,0.18018959150817565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10239975117808617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04985145544963868,0.0739401810032183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0640706565851399,0.0,0.1818290845286707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17166265352012056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996059919075301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2069655156514477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12577280548280012,0.15840771251141678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228396205991987,0.0,0.08679654331312722,0.0,0.0911878940333411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20649406956858785,0.17433208846345416,0.09326426132015284,0.0,0.1947756684076198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244055895581211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0729086941010253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12052644794227345,0.05812285258823618,0.08912142029858068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733532343838756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08155854859653587,0.0,0.0818510284474936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0644372795191692,0.0,0.0,0.11682762197427493
lonely,_UncleRuckus_,2018/01/25,"I have a discord server of online friends and we are recruiting :) We are a somewhat diverse group of people from around the internet with ages ranging from 16-35. We all met online and created this place to foster friendships while facilitating open and fun discussion. The server's theme might seem a tad bizarre at first sight but I like to think of us as as a welcoming family of introverted social outcasts hehe.

The server has plenty of text and media rooms if you're shy, but most of us prefer to chat in voice. We have all types of personalities, some louder and some quiet, while some just choose to mute themselves and listen in on the conversations while playing video games or whatnot.

An average day can include rowdy conversation from comic books through to politics, listening to music, playing video games or jumping in a rabbit and watching movies or tv shows together.

We've recently been thinking of ways to introduce new people into the server that are looking for people to help pass the time, make friends with, etc, so this is a bit of an experiment to see how many of you are interested in joining such a place.

Please PM me if you have any questions, otherwise, just follow the link and we hope you enjoy the place and are able to cure some of that loneliness we all share from time to time :)

lonely,livedanddiedalone,2018/01/26,"You know that saying? The one that is about how loneliness is much worse when your in your own home with your spouse who couldn't care less that your there.  That's how I feel. 

A little back story: 

We have been together for over 20 years (on and off) life led us through some different hoops and loops. At one point their job kept them constantly away from home. After many years like this, I was made to believe that we should move to the place they work, and away from everyone. Oh things will be great, no worries, less bills, and we will be together every day... 

So I agree, and things were great for two months. But now, I feel so lonely. They're always off doing something else, and I'm always alone. I can't even go and visit my mom or friends because they don't live here or anywhere remotely close. Also the people here are pretty terrible, so making new friends isn't exactly a plan. 

I understand how this place got it's nickname now though. (Can't say because it identifies where I am ) 

How boring.",3.2519349059420715,5.225076862944165,3.36494475962974,91.5775097043894,74.78680203045685,6.8687966557181275,22.24813377127501,7.724431198458867,0.8033651239175885,790,21,164,11,17,241,133,197,0.115,0.7759999999999999,0.109,0.1837,2,3,1,0,0,0,30.0,4,5,4,2,19,9,0,0,5,0,19,1,0,7,1,31,30,20,0,2,3,2,2,1,2,3,1,2,2,0,12,12,0,1,4,0,1,4,6,3,0,3,6,4,21,6,18,18,5,29,0,1,0,0,21,14,0,3,12,112,33,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293723852631076,0.0,0.09989302694461158,0.20787554891370366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.234720093767278,0.09605052694002396,0.0,0.15229183334410973,0.0,0.0,0.14073438132045002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1273573146232527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349867741009552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08055866892633333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050768933507167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10434893549981704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825039789811276,0.0,0.10524474374845344,0.11935989895053666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12631971662336286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19301522993442694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099104026095845,0.0,0.09990448311089033,0.2754344494577004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2505962137651066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12395705924729453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06864901836016178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822987494726732,0.06102627137880705,0.12519582477215913,0.1103006286953908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11819587359050975,0.08338051930992456,0.1266423611928355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14629680968112424,0.09970451055942076,0.1327629446016339,0.09182556185937732,0.0,0.0,0.12064193007713525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16928881053071712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08659907273439878,0.0,0.2610153786701433,0.0,0.11808333300578255,0.0,0.0,0.12708161373944055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19867195280223784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0961642706226022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1659735360391405,0.0,0.12272656762331907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12202202874292185,0.13003902832056485,0.1502551784369977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09093828459545254,0.12685540029606746,0.12729720463651015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16087998822799

lonely,GroundbreakingDrink,2018/01/26,"Rejection Dream girl leans in and kisses me. (We’ve hooked up before but nothing in months). Super affectionate for the rest of the night. We have some drinks, some laughs, deep conversation and end up sleeping together. (No sex but fall asleep half naked in each others arms). So fucking happy. A couple days later at my house she comes over and puts her arms around me. I slowly lean in for a kiss and she goes stiff as a board. Fuuuuuuck. I back off/ play it off and we continue the evening.

I’m not bitter, I’m not mad at her, it’s just like... FUCK! Y’know? Rejection. Wishing you had more to offer someone. Like when the fuck is something going to go right for once?

lonely,reffresher,2018/01/26,"im going to be alone forever the only reason i signed up for this site just now is because i have no one to talk to. im so bad  with relationships with friends.. i just push everyone away and get angry. 

my family is all religious but i'm not and they treat me differently for it. honestly i know i'll never have any good relationship with my family because they've always been somewhat abusive (my parents used to hit me with wood spatulas so hard they would break but now they just sort of ignore me and yell at me until i cry) 

i feel like every time i've opened up to people they've eventually left me for another friend group and they only talked to me because they wanted to vent on how depressed and lonely they were too

im so scared of being alone forever",4.7649677419354814,5.316594432258069,6.1375806451612895,78.66637096774197,69.19354838709678,9.55483870967742,27.758064516129032,9.642632912329526,2.3766645161290323,607,19,121,13,10,206,95,155,0.229,0.705,0.065,-0.9801,2,4,0,0,1,0,7.0,0,0,6,0,11,11,0,1,1,0,9,0,0,3,2,29,17,12,0,2,6,1,2,1,2,1,0,1,0,0,2,10,0,1,3,0,0,2,3,5,0,1,2,3,21,6,22,11,2,16,0,2,0,0,14,8,0,2,6,78,23,0,0.0,0.15999223130115015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2797072903509241,0.0,0.0,0.11235841868149382,0.0,0.0,0.09182718932091606,0.14159405749410114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686811270627868,0.0,0.11274706058419955,0.2469449100012225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832760180324314,0.0,0.0,0.11630387555378703,0.0,0.0,0.1410809272768457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1137712736674411,0.12902998520169964,0.0,0.0,0.2545945190357794,0.0,0.06827683045102864,0.09646772702865868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.208652591708899,0.0,0.07054926052276543,0.0,0.0767424650562135,0.11325942038217812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096320136542422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4375770016462012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07421070142488638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467139394772764,0.0,0.0,0.06597038839807913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414590890522832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150197390265788,0.20539762846407256,0.0,0.0,0.14993836047090892,0.0,0.0,0.09361500111549942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13883659339564186,0.0,0.2899501898722459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13519176466145236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170691018108992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873893010993778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11662530748788882,0.0,0.0,0.07964606506171626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09592369305766517,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,dorthy11,2018/01/26,"I am lonely and okay. I think that my loneliness is safe and easy. I have tried to have some friendships, but they always ends in disappointment. Mainly me loaning them money that doesnt get paid back. I go to stores sometimes, and that is how I get most of my interactions... with the  cashier. I do have some pets that make me happy. I would like to change so that I could fall in love. The thought of putting myself on a dating app terrifies me. And going out to a restaurant on a date is even more unappealing.  Does anyone relate?

lonely,superherodream,2018/01/27,"Mistaken for a criminal I grew up in Ghana, a very beautiful and peaceful country until they get hold of a thief. So we have this place called ""Kant"" it's a street market where you get to buy various items ranging from clothes shoes accessories of all types and price range. 

So a young guy saves up some money let's call him Kwame. An Innocent young student. So it's a week for the semester to start so Kwame puts his finances in order to know what to go and buy for the new semester. Planning on killing it this semester to catch the ladies, Kwame goes to the one place he knows he will get quality nice and cheap clothes, shoes sneakers to buy. And oh before I forget Kant is a very crowded place everyday and worst on Saturdays. This is because new things are are available and all the stores and individual sellers bring in new stock. 

Kwame gets ready to go on a Saturday to get his things for school. With his empty bag and hopes of filling it up. He gets there safely does his shopping with his little money he saved up during the vacation. 

Trying to find his way out of the crowd and chaos all of a sudden he hears the crowd crying ""thief thief thief thief thief"" and according to the lead mobster Kwame was in the same T-shirt as the thief they were chasing to beat up . He was almost put down until one of the guys he got the sneakers from came to his rescue.",4.987277984304008,5.869931100371747,4.977366790582407,85.99501342420488,68.85130111524164,8.356959933911607,27.95559686080132,8.515128840125781,1.787837505163156,1082,35,220,16,18,336,145,269,0.159,0.752,0.08900000000000001,-0.9702,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,1,1,2,3,6,14,1,0,23,0,10,2,2,1,3,32,26,18,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,2,10,16,0,2,3,1,11,10,0,9,0,2,5,3,14,5,44,19,8,45,0,0,0,0,27,20,0,3,13,128,24,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453800710059625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758144429177461,0.0,0.10582921456149293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25399016242659234,0.14224548191385353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366139658434241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088365158888661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1136713950002028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898673267887423,0.0,0.14136401279967958,0.0,0.09946958501606974,0.0,0.0,0.24629055449948795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14017337309118796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12352689443863198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13759633426387874,0.0,0.13670035929151392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12717615629176912,0.0,0.0,0.12465082995333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36035027698378336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685518728189977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3898187136954611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2500512325058821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12586849088219704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880293142561216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16525103017787762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0844386710659841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20523558990110025,0.0,0.0987186551668186,0.09976164535109988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,ScarsOfTheFallen,2018/01/27,"I feel sad and lonely due to internal contradictions in views and beliefs, and I have no one to talk to about it Title says it all, but let me give some context. There is gonna be a bit of venting, so stick out with me: I'm a 22 year old male born, raised and living in Norway. I would say that I live a comfortable life. I live in a house, study at a university, am able to work a good part time job, and have almost every option to me in the future. My dream for the future would be to have a normal a-1 life; wife, stable job, kids etc. just like the rest of my family. But i feel that can't do that. Why? Because I'm a communist, convinced of the problems facing society today and feeling liberated from the propaganda of the capitalist society that I live in. Even if I want to I cannot reject the truth of the situation that my country, and mostly likely that rest of the world, will have to accept: increased environmental destruction, increased market power and economic inequality, worse living conditions overall etc. I know that Norway will most likely be less hurt by this development, but still. Even if I try to close all of this off and focus on having a ""normal life"" like the rest of the people, I still can't do it. And the worst part for me, as the title says, is that I have no one to talk to about all of this. I get sadder for every day that this contradiction cannot be resolved. I have come to the conclusion that I will have to pick one of two sides: either reject the reality of the situation and try to live a normal life like everyone else, or actively try to change things such that these problems can/would be lessened or removes, but at the expense of living a normal, a-1 life. I know that this may sound superficial to most of you, but to me this a serious existential issue. For either of these choices I make, the other will most likely be (permanently) be cut off. I feel that if I can't solve this internal contradiction soon I'll go mad. What should I do?",6.124943613348677,5.743215488607593,7.1555638665132335,75.73974395857309,66.26582278481013,10.219792865362487,29.60011507479861,9.800150414767053,2.540721518987341,1558,46,310,30,22,527,183,395,0.15,0.7390000000000001,0.111,-0.9457,3,2,0,0,0,0,53.0,0,1,0,4,11,24,3,0,30,0,35,6,1,2,4,62,50,23,0,13,13,1,4,6,0,9,5,4,0,2,28,15,0,0,10,1,1,5,7,12,0,4,0,9,30,12,52,33,22,32,1,5,1,0,10,15,0,13,18,230,58,4,0.0807221125282577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808315354120538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0492074505616654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08812764003701007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08539329168474306,0.06953495231877697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05205908460697429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06743296698211636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18005298679158488,0.10663238803307876,0.0,0.1360237226424452,0.0771334377908857,0.0,0.0,0.07609762360760186,0.0,0.16326210208955047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042173972113685364,0.07743600581569729,0.04587623679162207,0.06770587815401402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09314247989932106,0.08641469099594172,0.0,0.0,0.08425291321625744,0.1602084821160003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0887255239598224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08254382915059356,0.28508207657594,0.23662048049944795,0.0,0.4989537298207708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053882636930088434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3163621254015269,0.0,0.0,0.08470427817750661,0.0,0.16409817766151935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17482836311132438,0.0,0.055962548965253656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15448031986023888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19258039149248493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18147007321139055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892956667614042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12976275270187254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05362818471517654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04706971296526027,0.0,0.07651512408791274,0.0,0.0,0.16441504700417306,0.0,0.07885377455840678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047611993406985235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283915103532684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058766659316291776,0.0,0.08226272894930059,0.17202801812856364,0.0,0.0,0.05198239388977925

lonely,haikucaracha,2018/01/27,"50, newly lonely. What next? First, thanks in advance for the people willing to listen to others in this subreddit. I just typed r/lonely and was pleasantly surprised such a community exists.

The third of three long-term relationships across 30 years (17-year marriage and 2 6-year near misses) has ended, and I have zero interest in going through that again. Like many of you, I find myself lonely with the desire to be okay or better being alone. I just suspect I’m older than a lot of you at 50, and don’t know if that process is any different. I’ve never really lived alone before (we’re finishing out our lease, and then I can move). Any advice toward being ok alone this late in the game is appreciated.

Thanks again.

That has yet to come. Just to be able to feel okay and safe with someone... The times to spend with someone else who you give your whole heart to. Someone who comes into your life and just changes everything. That would be an absolute dream come true. I’ve never wanted anything so bad in my entire life. I can’t sleep anymore alone but it remains that way. I don’t know how much longer I can go feeling this way. I don’t want to be alone anymore.

lonely,getting-colas,2018/01/27,"I just fucked a french guy on omegle after crying for 5 hours straight. I am a college student, studying philosophy and communications in a small midwestern college, going deeper into debt each term. Perhaps I will go back home for school, but I wonder if it would be much different. 
Tonight, I forced myself to rush for one of the local sororities. I've always been against them, but here, I am verging on desperate. I've made no connections in the past 6 months, yet I can't pinpoint what's wrong with me. There are people far more awkward, far less relatable... Maybe this will help. I looked good, at least.
Tonight I sat alone at my favorite coffee shop/bar and watched people dance, talk, and drink while I tried to write an argumentative essay on Benatar's suggestion that existence is necessarily harmful. Thoughts on this are more comforting to me than they are melancholy, to see the stupidity of existence and yet to see the beauty in humanity. 
I said maybe three words to the man I swear I am nearly in love with, who is always at the bar, who's girlfriend smiles and makes drinks, who will absolutely never reciprocate my feelings, and for good reason(s). I bled through my pants and onto the seat.
Tonight I watched a silly show that I don't even like much, when I have so much more to do. I saw my cat lying down across the room and I looked up how someone might hang themselves from a doorknob. I moved to the floor and cried to ""Dream Full of Dreams"" by Donnie and Joe Emerson, and my cat climbed onto my lap.
I got over it, got on omegle for the first time since I was thirteen. I rode my curling iron and spit on my own tits for a French man with a magnificent jaw and a 10-inch cock. I wonder if he really will contact me again.

lonely,PhysicalRedHead,2018/01/27,"Driving Earlier today I was driving home from work. There, we just shipped the first version of a new product. I began working on it two months ago. At a large technology company, but with only a small number of people. I live in the Midwest.

This is the first software package I've worked on professionally, and it's at the first important job I've ever had. I'm 23 and recently matriculated from a decent university with a degree in Mathematics. I've been out of school now since last May.

Around that time I had a bad interaction with my old roommates. They were graduating at the same time as me, and had made living arrangements together. They weren't including me in it, but I'm okay with that now. Perhaps, then, there was some disrespect towards them on my end, but they were going to be my _old_ roommates before I did anything to make them angry. I'm sure if I asked them to talk about it then everything would be okay, but I don't have a lot of interest in it and it seems neither do they. We've talked once since last May.

Currently I live elsewhere, with two guys I met the Summer after the whole charade. They keep to themselves most of the time, and have different interests than me. I could count, on one hand, the number of interactions I've had with them since I've known them. 

At a work party, my boss asked me if I had a girlfriend. He was trying to make fun of my age. As though he was saying something an uncle would say to his nephew, trying to make conversation. My boss is sort of old, maybe-not-yet middle-aged but he couldn't be older than mid--late 30s. This happened at a bar visit that was one of two bar visits I've made since last May.

So far, at work, I've met one person within 4 years of my age, and the median age difference must be at least a decade. I can recall so many sentences said to me from friends and family amounting to ""you'll fall in love with somebody you see regularly at work."" Starting almost three years ago I've been hearing things like this. My aunt once told me she met my uncle at a gas station and thought that it was serious advice. Around that time, three years ago, I stopped seeing a girl I had been seeing for four. A little after that, I had a Summer thing with a different person. But I guess they're nothing but gone now because I haven't talked to them in I-don't-know-how-long.

And today, a Friday, I was driving home from work so that I could sit at home all
weekend. In the car I thought about how everything I do I do by myself. I pulled into the driveway, stared at the garage door, and felt lonely. Upon getting through the front door, I asked my Google Home what it did today and it gave me the line about practicing its R2-D2 impression. It did it the same way it always does.",4.139609079445143,5.23120736612022,4.924043715846995,84.83216897856245,70.96721311475409,7.8894213254868975,26.28093036289758,8.222332236545338,1.5214666386436884,2160,67,442,31,39,699,254,549,0.038,0.8690000000000001,0.093,0.9796,4,2,1,0,0,0,73.0,1,2,11,10,17,13,0,0,34,2,47,4,1,8,4,69,81,29,0,8,10,2,2,1,2,7,0,4,7,4,26,24,2,2,5,3,0,11,5,3,0,12,36,10,58,10,73,31,11,90,0,1,4,1,48,32,0,12,46,292,84,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0660867790303861,0.17984845269633534,0.0,0.06772118988853562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0562731739009507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05565332817326769,0.1204092127093113,0.18967340073624794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056467819870810364,0.041226324434267,0.0,0.0575477358432784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079933288160464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2119753458954189,0.0,0.0,0.05918304404343755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05989967650274512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061174767890548674,0.0,0.0,0.12156209403561705,0.0,0.0637550875673237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493493981663717,0.0,0.0,0.17257689191392506,0.0,0.0,0.052250395279249545,0.0,0.03533363011484733,0.0,0.03843541171523472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450153503856115,0.06696385223002617,0.059804556481331386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762233782074022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2713516695891506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06711185791426777,0.060112220035789976,0.0,0.0,0.03716741260334227,0.16538124256504586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03304036477375076,0.06778254062002599,0.17915430147688927,0.05984999231479352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057496194926325364,0.06103827743094568,0.12798536400632107,0.13542967860140614,0.06856571301312522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05398123339410783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531700670380694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06489234331324223,0.0,0.21289739744229316,0.1440464518905274,0.1374825282376267,0.05143529341653755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04688579012885191,0.11810296725260652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06677598686073243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433115546339756,0.10756340904646712,0.0,0.06844467942329767,0.1616759015307464,0.061567370177437714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22377533362858212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05206450447955535,0.0,0.0,0.04786851857747325,0.0,0.0,0.05654130252141279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06374001722315988,0.0,0.0,0.16307412641710428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986008893584264,0.0,0.06644565479897616,0.1073805607311264,0.1577412554874672,0.0,0.19231461661421184,0.06462289947560701,0.0,0.09183200229912353,0.0,0.19819262666763546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05368116085792884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07550593795064743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34464564505303263,0.0,0.0,0.09608413368573837,0.0,0.0,0.1306535703989153

lonely,AnthonyTheSexual,2018/01/28,"No one knows i'm lonly. I'm 17 years old and in senior year. I don't have any real friends, yeah I know people in school who i'll say hi too but no one knows anything about me. I don't hang out with anyone outside I'v been trying for god knows how long to make things better but nothing ever works. I'v tried being more out going and even got invited to a couple parties over the past 2 years but even at those no one talked to me i just sat in the corner and waited for the night to end hoping someone would come talk to me.

And no one even knows i feel this way. When ever i'm with anyone even my own family i fake this jokey care free persona and every one thinks I'm fine. but the past 3 months have been so bad that i haven't even been able to fake it anymore and I just shut down. now i just put my head down in class and day dream of being someone with lots of friends that I can talk too or maybe a girlfriend. I just want one person i can talk to. just one person that say ""good job"" or tell I'm not the stupid fuck up that i think I am, it doesn't help that i go to a really small school my grade is only about 70 kids so it's not like i can just go out to meet new people if i could i would but, I already know every one.

My dad means well and i don't hate him but he doesn't help at all (he also thinks I'm fine) whenever I do something wrong like leave a door open or anything he just berates and says things like ""your a no future fuck up"" or ""your just like your mother"" (I'm not even going to start with her. just know she often tells me ""Your not my problem anymore you little retard) and any self confidence i had is gone. he just has a short fuse and he doesn't know that he's hurting me.
My family has never really been that close.

I tried talking to my councilor i remember one day in class i felt so awful that i wrote a long note of how i feel hoping someone would find it, read it and help me. no one did but later he called me in and said i looked distressed i handed him the note and walked out. after he read it he called me into his office and he made up this long bullshit speech about how it's my world view that needed to change and he said maybe i should go on anti depressants.

I'm planing on just running away. I've always hated new jersey anyway. I have a back pack of everything i need ready and i'm planing on hitchhiking south west. I feel like out there i'll find what i'm looking for i'll find some friends or someone who will loves me or anything.

what do you guys think? I can't take being alone anymore. I started crying in my dads car (he wasn't in it) and i looked through my phone contacts for someone to talk to but there was no one and that made me feel even worse.

lonely,oceannearby,2018/01/28,"I made an app for people who have no friends. What do you think? Hey guys,

I made an app for people who want to connect with strangers from all around the world through photos. The idea is simple: you send a nice photo of something to a random stranger and in return you get another photo from another stranger. All photos are pre-moderated, so you will never receive any inappropriate photos.

Currently there is no way to communicate with strangers after you send a photo; however, it might be made as a feature (if people will be interested) since random photos can be a great conversation starters.

lonely,Librariette,2018/01/28,"I had a dream. In this dream I was laying in bed with a massive headache. A woman opened the door bringing in comforters and sheets she had folded and was placing them in the closet in the room. I tried to move and get her attention because the pain was so intense. She noticed me and sat on the side of the bed. My voice was hoarse, but I got out the word “sick” and she held my hand like a mother would and cared for me. Hours and maybe a day passed in this dream and we became friends. 

When I woke up in real life, I felt like I’d lost such a good friend or family member and the loneliness I’ve had for awhile now set in again. What a vivid, realistic experience to have just to be a dream in the end.

lonely,DiscombobulatedWorth,2018/01/28,"Probably, rather common case but Good day fellow loners!

I would like to share my history with you. Please answer if you have it similar or you have any advice on what can be done with the case. Thank you in advance.

To begin with, in my opinion i should be happy, but i am not at all. Everything is going pretty well for me but i have this disturbing and rather frustrating feeling that i am missing something out. It is the kind of feeling when you know something bad is going to happen, the so-called survival instinct. Why is that?

Last year i have begun my first, real, full time job which i got right after uni graduation. And it is fun, i like the diversity of it. Moreover i work as a professional in the field of study, which is pretty uncommon in my country.

Last year i broke my arm, and my girlfriend broke up with me. That was hell of a relationship, it consisted of multiple breakups and returns, which was toxic as currently famous tidepods. Back then we were friends at uni, and there have always been a chemistry between us. Then during summer holidays, she broke up with her then boyfriend and soon after i broke with my girlfriend. So to calm our nerves and cure our broken hearts we hooked up. It was a mistake, we didn't match, she became materialistic self-centered princess and i am a numerological 7... (i do not believe in numerology but it describes me incredibly well somehow...) That lasted for circa 3-4 years.

Soon it will be a year being single. Now i am alone. I live alone in the apartment in the city centre. I feel lonely in the crowd. I have never been a cool guy, so i had a very little group of close friends around. Now they are gone basically, some left the country, other moved to other cities. I am 25. Social pressure is high. It is ""the time"" everyone is getting married and having kids. Social media pressure is  also gigantic, everybody having perfect life with perfect families, having perfect trips around the world. I understand that it may be only a colorful facade, but the background - the reality is in the shades of gray(pun intended). I try not to give a fuck about it, as i have the ability to see through the shit. And that knowledge hurts the most, the shallowness of current society, and near zombie-like braindeadness of people lifes. Politics are horrifying. Day after day i am getting more and more ashamed of my nation and country, i do not fit in. It is disgusting that i want to puke sometimes. I love the landscape, the culture and tradition. But i hate people, their selfish, materialistic lives and toxicity which destroys everything that is good and precious in the country/nation.

Now i feel that i am loosing the last bits of hope. I am considering an escape to other country. I've done that once and it brought me joy, but it was a short-run. I don't know if i should. I know that my demons would probably follow me there. 

I am getting distance from the society. I do not know how to socialise more. It seems that i have fallen out of the grid. I see the pattern of creating relationships, and now i understand why lonelyness is such a big problem among the grown-ups. Those who have found their love at ""university age"" had it easy, lot's of people around and the possibility of trial and error relations.

I really do not know how to meet people. And i do not how to force myself to do it. I guess in my country the best way to meet someone is by friends, whom i lack unfortunately. The biggest issue being lonely to me, i think, is the sex drive and no one to spend time with. I do not want to rush anything (relationship or hookups), for the reason that it may not end well in the long run. Therefore i guess, i shall wait it out, at least to the summer. Maybe then the darkness will not be my only friend...

At last, i would like to apologize greatly for the text wall i have spit on the desktop. And evenly i thank anyone willing to read at least a paragraph of it.

Please write a comment, any thought that came across reading this.

This post may not fill here fully, maybe to /r/depression or /r/foreveralone ir /r/needafriend or all of them in some part.
This account is a temporary. I needed the comfort of anonymousity.

THANK YOU!

lonely,TwentyWonSavage,2018/01/28,"No Real Feelings I have had this lonely sensation since I have left high school. I joined the military, and since been living in Japan. I have made countless memories and friends since I have been here but at the end of the day, I cannot escape this crippling loneliness. I thought it was because I was single so I got into the nightclub scene. I had a few one night stands and even then came back to a empty room where I knew that no one was there for me. I then found a girl who was great, but even when we had great times together, after about eight months, I felt more lonely when I was with her than when I wasn't. I just don't know what to do anymore. Maybe its just a time for myself? I am not sure. Thank you to the community to listen to me. It really helps.

lonely,Deracsmi,2018/01/29,"One day I stopped falling and hit the ground. I am not sure what happened. I used to be the ""cool"" girl in high school. I could talk to anymore about anything. I always got invited to the best parties and dated the coolest guys. On the outside my life looked great, on the inside I was too drunk or high to notice any feelings except ""adrenaline, going with the flow, and ecstasy"".
I was always into art and that always helped me let out a lot of emotions I couldn't, or maybe didn't, know how to say.
I moved out at 21 before I could finish getting my bachelors degree. I moved in with a guy who lived 4 hours from my home town and barely spoke English. His family is all very nice, just we couldn't communicate due to language. I am now 24 and as lonely as ever. I look down wherever I go. I work alone in an office all day. I've turned into a hard shell that I just cant seem to crack. That guy- my now husband- is always too distracted to notice me. When we are with his family I feel like I'm invisible. We could be in a room of 35 people all speaking Lithuanian and I'll desperately try to say something and it's like I'm a ghost. 
I don't know what to do anymore. I used to feel alive. I cant even paint anymore. 
I've talked to someone before from a Reddit group, a depressed guy my age from France.

lonely,lo-li-ta,2018/01/29,"Trying so hard to meet people in college, but I am having terrible luck I recently moved to go to university in a city I've never been to. I've been here for about 6 months and haven't made a single friend. Back home, I had such a great group of friends and I have a great long distance SO, but no one here. There's only so much Skype conversations can do. I feel like I haven't touched another person in so long.

The worst part is that I'm trying so hard. I talk to so many people everyday. I'm incredibly outgoing and extraverted so it's easy for me to just walk up to people. I've joined almost every club that I'm even slightly interested in, but it's just getting so far into the school year that everyone has already made friend groups. People just seem annoyed that I'm trying to talk to them and their groups. The two people I sort of know will occasionally let me join their groups to go out if they know I have no one else, but it's always so obvious I'm the outsider.

I have no idea what to do. I'm so lonely that I have no motivation to keep going. Everyday is the same and I don't even know why I'm doing anything anymore. I never talk to anyone. I message my friends back home probably 100 times a day just because they're the only contact I have. They all have friends locally though so obviously, they can't always respond right away. 

It's so painful. I cry every night and I just get up and try again over and over, but I can't get anywhere. You'd think in a school of over 30,000 undergrads, I'd be able to meet one who wants to hang out with me, but I can't. What's wrong with me? I've never had a problem making friends, but I feel like I must be a boring person or annoying or something. 

I have no one here. I'm hurting so much. I've even contemplated dropping out just because I can't handle this. I have a pretty bad mental illness that likes to flair up when I'm stuck by myself a lot.

lonely,Tbh_imbad25,2018/01/29,"I've isolated myself in my depression and now the only person I had is gone Over the past year I've let my depression get to me and I've isolated myself. I graduated in '16 and my senior year was not friendly to me, I ended highschool with 2 friends. One went to college, and the other traveled for work for a while but no lives out of state. 

I didn't end up going to college. I work a part time job and all of my coworkers are a good 10+ years older than me. The only person I had outside of my parents was my boyfriend of two years. 

We just broke up, it was nasty but probably necessary, but now I have no one. I don't know how to socialize with other people, I don't know how to meet knew people and make friends. Everyone I try it fails miserable. I'm saved my anxious and paranoid all the time. 

I have never felt so alone.

lonely,LoLzman42,2018/01/30,"Hey.. so this is me I guess.. I never thought this would be my first reddit post but, here we are.
I'm a 17 soon to be 18 year old guy who has never really been good at socializing, I have  couple of friends who I talk to on occasion but, I don't have that special someone who I can share my feelings with and it feels like it's eating me up from the inside.
I'm not sure if I'm just unable to see how great my current few friends are but, I watch shows and videos with happy couples and I feel sad, like I'm missing out on something so great. I end up in tears after seeing people in love, not out of jealousy but, out of hopeful wishing that I maybe able to have some I love and that loves me. 
I'm not sure if this belongs here but, I felt like I had to tell someone about this.
If you read this thanks, I appreciate it.",2.789237288135592,3.2212204237288167,4.162500000000001,91.4908686440678,73.57627118644069,6.803954802259887,24.91949152542373,6.42735559955562,0.5762847457627118,633,18,150,4,12,210,104,177,0.092,0.588,0.32,0.9955,1,0,1,0,0,0,19.0,1,1,0,1,8,20,0,0,2,0,14,4,0,1,4,37,34,15,0,6,12,0,4,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,14,10,1,0,5,3,0,0,6,2,0,1,4,7,22,18,23,27,2,20,0,2,3,3,16,10,0,6,12,102,36,1,0.13250397702393285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2932262606221193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13558464814961158,0.0,0.0,0.11735919437917368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009939762470284,0.0946608676614441,0.12722459734137995,0.0,0.0,0.11270781516686924,0.0,0.0,0.20474448791672795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11113804931906562,0.0,0.29217220489803514,0.14596806932232126,0.13119976949928513,0.0,0.14105294744341754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13160634690393488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19420425041846665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35877003769427673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13311805466553922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20439047138386196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390406343185355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0918615738617704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12690218250664514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13253983448192685,0.0,0.08488544063977495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21117702868067464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13507111795660248,0.22454037948144087,0.10200803507163302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24976686044980154,0.0,0.0,0.10650167757039446,0.11581431626811567,0.1219918595728839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10519335691914287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15237303430685448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09412702355297613,0.0,0.0,0.08532821688987832
lonely,bitterassbitch,2018/01/30,"I miss being loved This breakup has been intensely difficult for me. With him I felt like I was a part of his life and his family. They loved me. The joy that brought me was incomparable and for the first time in my life I felt so loved and it’s truly all I’ve ever wanted. I thought and felt almost certain that I’d have a family with him (his family would even talk to us about our future family one day). 

Now I’m single, alone, and have no clue of what my future will be like. I’m scared of being alone and I’m scared of the unknowns I’m facing. I don’t know what my next partner will bring nor can I bring myself to believe that better circumstances can occur.

I’m so scared. I’m really young yet really really scared. I feel like I’ve peaked and lost it all. I miss my old life and the sense of security that came with it. I just want it back.  I want this all to end.

lonely,Micafire,2018/01/30,"Guess I can Start.... Hello everyone,

I've tried to keep it all to myself for a long time, but just holding it down will make it worse.

Ever since I graduated highschool, my circle of friends split to find their own ways, so have I. Shortly after, my ex cheated on me(after 4 years), and it has left me spiraling out of control, and devastated for a long time, but now its sometimes a kick in the chest once a week. 

My friends barely talk to me, either it's work, their girlfriend/boyfriend takes most of the time, or something else.

I've tried to go out to places to places to make friends, but don't know how to start that way.. I just take online college classes that does not have much of social involvement.

I've joined OKCupid, Tinder, and other apps for friends and dating bulletin board. I am mostly looking for friends, but also a relationship if there is a click.

Either way, I've met a few, but it turns out to be they're wanting a sugar daddy, pimp daddy, or unspecified reason to just leave me on scene.

I guess it's what I get for being in San Antonio, and my odd taste in rock, and heavy metal...

Deep down, I just want a friend, I'm tired of the cutting when I just glance at my phone hoping there is a match, my ""friends"" or someone just messaging, but turns out to be some automated notification, and just feeling dull...

That's it.

I’ve kind of come up with a girlfriend in my head to curb loneliness a bit too. It’s pretty crappy man, I just want to be romantic and in love with someone again.

lonely,sugarplumteacup,2018/01/31,"Wanting love is the most destructive thing I could do to myself. Love: elusive, unstable, ephemeral, changing, vanishing, inconstant. a feeling that can't even be defined yet which rules me.

As long as I want this from another human, I'll always remain in a state of constant suffering.

As long as I'm convinced I need this, I'll be stunted from higher functioning.  

Despite my insane thoughts, I don't really need love to survive.

Actually, I need to give up on the pursuit of it entirely to survive.

lonely,Cactuskeeper2000,2018/01/31,"Breakups are not fun Anyone else never had anyone stay for more than 4 months?

Nothing destroys self esteem quite like being unable to hold anything together. I'm surrounded by people and some friends but just the fact that nobody actually wants to connect with me cuts to the bone. I'm tired of being left alone, I just want to be held. The worst part is I don't even have any incentive to come out of my shell and meet new people because there are no desirable human beings in my area, only degenerates and weirdos who make me uncomfortable...

Maybe I'm just meant to be alone...",7.466216216216218,7.125748549549552,7.145720720720721,76.78182432432435,63.5045045045045,9.922522522522524,32.013513513513516,9.2995712137729,2.65765945945946,463,15,86,7,6,146,85,111,0.174,0.718,0.107,-0.8896,0,2,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,5,6,2,0,3,0,11,2,1,1,2,21,20,4,0,3,5,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,2,2,6,0,2,1,0,0,1,4,3,0,0,3,0,6,3,14,12,4,10,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,1,4,52,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.18463688503879896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3919188459338997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286659565392634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26459321117894274,0.19386298480697828,0.15569967648884167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153376731981798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16298344081743624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15805658329769315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496818452206045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14617939139354055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2055718954275737,0.0,0.0,0.09243605504292812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12629587386387006,0.0,0.19008195446428666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510217061909409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14592663772068634,0.18273546518799544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1815473969322799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438990049279802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2048906860663032,0.0,0.2623419872485712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20124291422290028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19738218404322933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20166746271857625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21746342996513768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2231961409586548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Skal1x,2018/01/31,"I got into female contact again after 8 years. My mother forced me to go to dancing school last year, because I abandoned Kung-Fu, with I did for 5 years and everyone I started with left before me.

Now that I'm over a year there I have finally found a constant dancing partner (after she took the first step). We shared some interests like gaming and anime, which is extremly rare where I live (everyone has to do something with horses n' stuff, I mean my state even has a horse a single symbol in their emblem).

We now even hug each other when we meet (this will sound extremly creepy but I feel like the hugs are like a kinda sorta ""drug"" right now). But in these moments where it feels so nice, as soon as she's gone, everything else is just twice as bad.

I'm not used to this amount of affection, I was just that wierd loner in class who noone talked to, and now this?

To be honest, I just don't know what to do, I kinda want ""more"" but don't want to ruin this. It has been 8 years for gods sake.

Sorry if this post is non-fitting but I kinda wanted^to^share^it.",3.4592289719626166,4.709664677570097,4.183259345794394,88.8930198598131,72.78504672897195,7.032242990654206,22.72079439252337,7.413659706084162,0.7437299065420562,827,20,173,9,16,264,137,214,0.06,0.768,0.172,0.9743,0,0,2,0,0,0,35.0,3,0,1,1,16,12,0,0,7,0,17,3,0,2,0,35,32,13,0,3,9,1,2,3,1,1,1,1,0,1,15,11,0,1,5,3,0,6,3,3,0,2,7,3,22,9,24,23,5,38,0,2,0,2,14,9,0,6,24,116,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126155417812098,0.09210421432527356,0.0,0.1285680707358403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16327665771517927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17521862497546553,0.0,0.1262178871820775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995895379523199,0.0,0.0,0.2887495533642395,0.13579164910441527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1527931997127807,0.10794007706830944,0.0,0.16551378119797164,0.0,0.12851868523774151,0.0,0.16566445974992516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08586900352818344,0.0,0.12084198768176445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303615185953153,0.1231600570720946,0.0,0.0,0.16416178158181172,0.0,0.0,0.2214475978831605,0.0,0.13341690782088972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16458336332584567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470426585243684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12903164930015748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15291306002987204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11631791931803324,0.0,0.16913500181821342,0.10694361806429432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17296406669397982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12144193866854786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16786865021227956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13049488223785136,0.0,0.0,0.178235823850089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4864911200759207
lonely,pangulin,2018/01/31,"What is wrong with me This is the first time I've ever told anyone about what I feel.
At this point I've nothing no friends no one to spend time with or care for. Today I came home from school and am now crying as I have noticed how pathetic I am as a human being. I don't go out as I don't any real friends and every person that tries to be my friend, I end up pushing them away. Today my classmate said ""I bet you are one of those kids that never go out"" I not wanting her to see the pain it caused me laughed it off and said kinda. She later invited me to go skating and I said no. I fully regret that ad now I'm realizing she wants to be my friend. At school I act as all is well and I'm happy with life but I'm bullied by ""friends"". And am an over all loner. My while life recipes around school because I have nothing else. Many people complement me on how good I'm doing but I don't have anything else at home. I have nothing that interest me. This is why o hate summer as I do nothing but pretend I'm fine to my family. I don't talk to anyone about how I feel so I write it down im a netbook as a substitute to a person. No one knows that I do it. They think I do work for school but after I wrote what I feel u end up crying. No one I'll my life knows the real me. All they see is that kid that does good in school and must always be having a good day with that smirk he always has on. I don't have anything left I try to get into hobbies but I later stop as I don't feel enjoyment. I don't remember the last time I've really been happy. I feel now is numbness followed by sadness. Even though I feel this way I don't think I'll ever kms as I fear death because I tell myself it'll get better just get through it. Although today has been the worst day for me in a long time and I want the feeling to end.",0.2976080125687375,1.923360957711445,2.6253417124901794,95.0824430479183,82.45771144278606,5.226603822990311,19.534171249018065,6.05967700443912,-0.18836417910447745,1403,36,335,10,38,480,177,402,0.16699999999999998,0.727,0.106,-0.9855,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,3,3,17,25,1,1,13,0,38,5,0,4,7,60,74,29,1,5,8,0,7,0,5,2,5,3,2,5,22,17,0,1,13,1,2,7,15,8,1,5,8,12,55,17,50,60,4,54,0,2,2,0,26,19,0,3,27,222,77,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11777806876562424,0.0,0.0,0.04812825396311042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897263897190284,0.0,0.11648075020904833,0.0630032196133705,0.0,0.0,0.0664938216371772,0.0,0.0,0.08628546317148468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625932104656654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094577245858095,0.07215807072013877,0.07270364888745531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1554822388035253,0.09128581497972768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061934169941933875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1182439797767572,0.0,0.18805234525948186,0.0,0.0,0.046745080701678834,0.12803695828524111,0.05962953666845956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0667187450709599,0.0796396105896472,0.25049566060238737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06019971161561635,0.0,0.0,0.2733962837720148,0.0,0.11092834548653337,0.0,0.120666249570353,0.1780837959273098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1506789346604685,0.0,0.06987395689014529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14198273078034965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644728182501326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07779028218919815,0.05768966516104423,0.0,0.0,0.07689537043776662,0.0,0.14996777157811236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06263212132730571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07175299261099159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0545847127640233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2716354647620265,0.08057584274343949,0.0,0.0,0.19183121124278732,0.0,0.07530775455590669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04906527774358622,0.12359298786829902,0.0,0.0,0.06690362088040812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16111096253111287,0.045339172259822966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801723242230331,0.0,0.2019647745107575,0.0,0.0,0.3581316638522708,0.1127942743597457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05916962697169295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05688487765311364,0.06185896186504895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09069731392391728,0.06953438341566985,0.0,0.16507386333566074,0.0,0.2012543683788968,0.0676268972465358,0.0,0.09610081617849182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1252317339167293,0.05617653152168182,0.0,0.0,0.06363367381194422,0.0,0.06386187266727797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05152378715284802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737946610856318,0.0,0.0
lonely,SweetChristabel,2018/01/31,"Socially starved and deprived from affection I'm so desolate and depressed, that I would rather be dead. I very rarely see my friends, because they're busy, live too far, and just don't invite me anywhere. I'm also really deprived from affection and the like for a REAL long time. I tried looking for friends and more, but I feel like people don't like me, and that contributes more to my mental state. I kind of gave up on rebuilding my social and romantic life. I've been alone and lonely for far too long, that I feel like it's meant to be",5.037063492063492,5.692019796296298,5.395661375661381,83.85833333333333,68.62962962962962,9.134391534391536,30.243386243386244,9.23628265651192,2.4253052910052904,430,16,87,8,7,137,69,108,0.185,0.6509999999999999,0.16399999999999998,0.1511,0,3,0,0,0,1,12.0,0,0,0,0,6,11,0,0,2,0,6,1,0,2,0,18,14,11,1,2,3,0,2,4,2,1,1,0,0,0,4,8,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,3,4,11,7,10,8,2,8,0,4,2,0,5,4,0,0,7,50,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19476691111769667,0.0,0.15038646972946368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463578532837668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16197036955460428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901711943391912,0.2686911905992073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2905796322495455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1958289819692848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13282788422608027,0.3674941402466353,0.0,0.16605485553699076,0.3328431998269968,0.15791773893536815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18951389106116184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13037275201994256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.214046271943388,0.12047201062857613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14985444530877806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3833941141246013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965562022344416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12767611285141836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516399066053266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335879474317875,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,bald-and-upset,2018/01/31,"Always the Best Friend. Never the Boyfriend. Since I was a child I fell in love as often as I could. I would profess my love to different girls from kindergarten all up until college. Every single time I got my heart broken. That wasn’t too bad though because deep down I knew I liked boys so I didn’t mind becoming the girls’ best friend. I remained single and in the closet until college. In college I got to live my truth as a gay man so I figured now was the time it was meant to be I’d find my significant other. To no avail, plenty of good friends!...Still single. I’m about to be 27 years old and no one has ever felt the same way towards me that I’ve felt towards them.

Rejection hurts, but constant rejection is a whole different kind of hurt. 

I’ve done everything possible for love. I’m ashamed to say I’ve even changed myself, my likes and my interests for other people unsuccessfully(which turned me into a chronically depressed and pitiful alcoholic.) I’ve bettered myself since then by cutting out alcohol and the people who I drank the most with as well as other toxic influences from my past (5 months booze free yippee!) I’ve reintroduced myself to myself in a way. Attempting meditation, working out and focusing on my body and my better self.. and yet I still don’t feel truly happy. I know having a significant other will not make my life 100% but sometimes I sit at home and I think “Damn, what is it? What is it about me that keeps everyone from being intimate with me? Why doesn’t anyone love me back?” These thoughts are what keep me up at night. These thoughts are what kill me.

It’s to the point where I’m even scared to make friends now due to the risk of falling in love and having my heart broken yet again. 

Everyday I wake up and go to work to then come home to a family that is so desperate for me to get married and have children. On the weekend I try to treat myself by taking myself out to nice places &amp; doing nice things for myself. Just trying to show myself that I’m worth something. 

I’m just scared of being on my own for my whole life.. but that’s what it looks like my life is shaping up to be. 

Any tips on how I can be completely alone without going insane or should I just save time and check into a mental facility now.

Thanks for your time and thoughts.

lonely,mincir,2018/01/31,"Is it abnormal to be so ruined by sadness after a one-week dating ends? Could it be just loneliness? I've always been an introvert, I have no friends, merely family and relatives in my life. The last time I've had a relationship was almost 2 years ago.

10 days ago I met someone. We dated for a week, we didn't have sex but made sexual talks, texted each other 7/24 and even planned vacations to go together a few months later. 

After this one week, we argued (not a fight really) and altough I apologized he wanted a break and said ''let's give it some time'', ''I am not sure about us, I want to think'', ''But let's not break connection, you may text me, call me whenever you like.'' I wasn't expecting this, because these words are indicative of an end for me. It was really unexpected, we didn't have a fight or anything. 

I know it is over and accepted it, but I think I got attached to him without realizing, because I feel so sad, occasionally cry and drink some wine. I don't want to leave my room, I am so depressed. 

Is there something wrong with me? Maybe I feel this way not because of him but because of loneliness?",2.7926362992683487,4.591268641255606,4.544319093698373,83.3866792541893,75.59192825112108,8.461552985603019,25.63818739674298,9.134995656068208,2.102467264573991,869,31,178,21,19,294,134,223,0.194,0.7559999999999999,0.051,-0.9891,0,0,3,0,2,0,33.0,5,2,0,1,7,12,3,0,10,0,23,4,0,1,1,42,37,14,0,5,11,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,11,12,2,0,7,2,0,1,10,8,0,1,11,3,28,4,18,20,4,24,0,4,0,1,21,3,0,5,18,117,39,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310027179685687,0.0,0.13047467487583267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10841841499008692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072241924738298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.317713925921268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13304887654698508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040323899301264,0.0,0.14312628884867976,0.08403146252020269,0.0,0.1122255189483436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276424833443124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308107943681088,0.0,0.0,0.08606063270310506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228334046657826,0.0,0.1317652175050887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006679496833224,0.0,0.0,0.1249937617908906,0.07405138414605696,0.0,0.10421125299140556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07160840031574743,0.10621030084159068,0.0,0.1379668206726275,0.0,0.26647716677726113,0.09203336560306448,0.06365704528714775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12329116473791278,0.0,0.0,0.13090190378617175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10400265984819897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17658666071320273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16694453372824314,0.0,0.0,0.13989134228177494,0.0,0.0,0.1239432828526596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11040111435236846,0.10030980415025617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12280436946633795,0.0,0.0,0.10472863643788427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16697945759422192,0.0,0.0,0.1519556807707324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15673251015158782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305594961780343,0.10342452667213453,0.3135517071125646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12560266984397475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14246046239668286,0.0,0.08390767177020632

lonely,DJMaxAlex,2018/01/31,"Do you ever just... : Hate yourself? Hate your dependencies? Have friends, yet feel so lonely? I have no idea which subreddit this belongs to, but I felt like this was enough of a fit that I could just let my sad thoughts out. For those that glance at this or share my pain, thank you for taking the time to read this.

Where do I even begin?

Well I'd say that I'm probably a NEET by now due to circumstances involving my health. Losing a lot of contact with my friends over the past 2 years has made the search for people, or to join their social circle, a hell of a task. I grew up having a friend I'd visit **every. single. day.** I probably annoyed the shit out of him but the constant companionship was what made every day interesting. Waking up each day felt like it had a sense of purpose : What kind of adventure would I go on with my friend today? The park? Exploring? Games? My childhood mind never knew. Nowadays it's hard to find someone to converse with on a daily basis. 

*I understand why though.*

You have a job, a fiance, kids, obligations. Don't let me stop you from your responsibilties. I've just got so much time on my hands that every day's a blur to me now. I've always been a gamer ever since electronic entertainment became the best form of mental stimulation. I'll be up at the late hours of the morning wondering why sleep is even a thing humans need and always checking my apps for anyone who dared stay up at this god-forsaken hour looking to chat.

I've met so many friends once I learned how to use Reddit. It's truly been a great tool to bolster my friend list. But recently a lot of them have gone off the radar due to various reasons and I find myself so lonely trying to fill the time without them. Even the friends that are with me, they're all wildly more independent than I could ever be. I've always been a lone wolf, not by nature but because of circumstances. The prime example was with the recent game that came out : **Monster Hunter Wold**. And boy, what do I say...I fucking **love** the Monster Hunter series. I introduced all my friends to it and they became fanatics with me in time and thanked me for recommending it to them. Now I'm sitting here watching all my friends come online, and questing with eachother. Without me. What happened to the good old days we played on 3DS?

*I don't know. Maybe I'm just a social outcast*.

It hurts. It hurts to be told by a friend that they don't want to play (with you) at the moment. It hurts even more when you watch them play with someone else after telling you this. Even in my off-hours, when I'm on my own. People just...have a tendency to pick on me. You'd think with the anonymity of the internet, you'd be less subject to getting bullied. Here I am in online lobbies getting hit, friendly-fired and screwed with. Is it something to do with my character? Sometimes I tell myself that it is. Then there's games where you are given a preset and have no control over what you look like and they still just...gravitate towards trying to piss you off. It's always been this way and I'm just god damn tired of it.

You tell yourself : ""*Fuck them. I don't need them. I'll do it on my own*"". Like that will somehow help ease the pain. But it doesn't. There's just this emptiness in your heart because everyone's out there blessed with this ability to be normal, to be cool, to be wanted. And now? Now I am conscious once again that there's a heaviness to my sighing as I debate whether or not I want to initiate conversation with someone and bug them. Because I'll be damned if anyone ever invites me to anything.

People are just too scared to say what's on their mind. Scared to be impolite.
Finding another friend like the ones I knew when I was a kid now seems like finding a soul mate.
And here I am. Still searching.

lonely,BigGameHunter4,2018/01/31,"Someone to talk to. I’ve never been one to open up to others, not even with my family, but over the last year I made a new friend who I felt comfortable to do so with. I would to talk to them every night and no matter what was happening I would always feel better afterwards. 

Well as I’m sure you’ve probably already guessed by now that relationship ended about a month ago now. (Why doesn’t matter and I’d prefer you didn’t ask) Without that support structure I have begun to feel alone wile surrounded by friends. Everyone else just sent that type of friends. I have searched for someone like the friend I lost but to no avail.  

Not being able to express my feelings is eating me from the inside and I can’t stand it anymore. I need someone to talk to or at least to know others feel this way.",3.7528541666666686,5.095314243750003,4.43375,87.02291666666667,72.1875,7.333333333333335,26.458333333333336,7.793537801064563,1.4081458333333337,629,21,128,8,12,201,107,160,0.079,0.715,0.206,0.9733,0,1,0,1,0,0,13.0,0,1,1,2,7,11,0,0,5,0,12,1,0,1,2,29,27,8,0,4,7,0,5,1,4,2,0,0,0,0,9,6,1,0,7,0,0,1,9,1,1,1,7,5,14,10,26,17,1,20,0,1,0,0,14,5,0,2,13,85,23,1,0.12999920647417304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152364528360731,0.0,0.0,0.13463997219789134,0.1434573569793011,0.0,0.10816975380581376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892428099355813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215317094504289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497373385294744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13302164256055402,0.10859765587534044,0.0,0.11514071112737365,0.0,0.0,0.08586324982447499,0.0,0.10952993827429104,0.12421981277967628,0.0,0.0,0.12255168223075814,0.0,0.2629260193298002,0.0,0.12481962481313515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4017482577798862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432087821714321,0.0,0.1149578689561388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07144416410524715,0.1059667040394082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0635110457697237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14190949047764265,0.0,0.0,0.12300839241517635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037641263429104,0.0,0.0,0.09639276438663523,0.10026340222974986,0.12555404368908574,0.0,0.12199544888825214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08809082671280707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14016113191387095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395704969083711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33044371734658984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14752155894659685,0.122522713624494,0.0,0.0,0.313465313644559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1031873191342127,0.0,0.0,0.11688489889734835,0.0,0.11730406375985496,0.0,0.0,0.12531459600860154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18469541283960933,0.0,0.0,0.0837152267779613
lonely,Carcharodonfan,2018/01/31,"Anyone here ditched their mobile phone or stopped their monthly plan? Wondering if others here have stopped using their mobile phone and/or saved money by not keeping up with their monthly plan?
I'm considering this, as I receive at most 3 txts a week for ads or non-urgent message from my housemate that could either wait or easily be sent and received over facebook (I have my laptop at work). 
Aside from that I receive nothing from family (they're all living in another country), nor friends (most in my home country).
At this point it just seems to me like a great way to save a bit of money each month.

lonely,Darknesszero79,2018/01/31,"How can I fight loneliness If i am a neet without friends? I am currently 3 years old as neet
3 years since I took refuge from society

I almost do not have any social contact with anyone
I only talk to my parents when they come from work while I spend all day surfing the internet, reading comics or playing video games

I have enjoyed something during this time, but now I'm starting to feel very lonely and I have a very large social anorexia that prevents me from leaving my house

I do not know what to do to solve my situation

lonely,gold_coast_ghost,2018/02/01,"Insanely lonely, but social interaction is my 'kryptonite' Any time I spend hanging out, wether it's a couple people or a group - I spend the next hour, day, week, going over every single thing in my head. Did I say this right? Did they understand it as I meant it to be? Was I funny? Was I being snide and shitty, or do they feel that way too? How do they think of me? I wish I could've said this better, etc etc. 
Whenever I feel this happening I try to make myself conscious of it, and cut it out. But I wish I didn't have to feel so unsure of myself. I wish I was a naturally better person. 

Being a shy and quiet kid didn't translate well into adulthood for me. 

I've tried a few times to write something coherent...I just have a shit ton of thoughts tornado-ing around, and when I make an attempt to write them down, or say out loud, it's like my brain suddenly doesn't compute and what comes out is something completely different that what I meant. 

I am just so bored. There's only so much talking to pets you can do before you start to wonder if you're actually losing it or just...Lonely as fuck. 

But then I think about how awful I am at keeping in touch with people, how it's really my own fault for being such a recluse. I don't really want to hang out with anyone, I just miss getting alerts on my phone of someone texting, or a link to a funny video, or a lame meme. 
 Something...anything...just to know that someone thought of me for a sec. Or thought of me enough to hit me up. I dunno. 

I'll probably cross post this to a couple different subs, only cause I'd like to hear what people have to say,  and if there's someone out there similar to me - how do you manage?

lonely,_Elevator_music_,2018/02/01,"lonely but not alone (cliché i know) I have a ton of friends and I go out every other day but I can't help feeling lonely and like people are indifferent to my presence. i've never been close to anyone (like a best friend) because i don't know how. I can't get myself to find love even though I want to. There's a few of my friends who i think are great people and i know they have a crush on me, so i'm considering asking someone out so i can have someone that i'm close to. Pretty weird, kind of shallow.

lonely,slipknot1011,2018/02/01,Wish I had people to fill the void I have good friends but they all go away to school so majority of the year I’m kind of alone. I live with my friend/ex gf and it’s kind of a strange scenario but it works out alright. She needed help and me and my family offered a hand. It’s been like this for. Months now. It kind of makes it difficult to bring people home to hang out at my place and stuff like that. Idk if this is the right sub or not for this. My job also makes it hard to meet people since I mostly work with older people. It’s just hard meeting and having fun with people my age (20) since there isn’t much way of me meeting them since I don’t go to school. Just a rant I’m having. I hope someone sees this and can brighten my day. ,0.09746803069053556,2.038020310559009,1.735827548410672,99.48570697844356,85.0248447204969,4.5335769090244815,16.30288637194008,5.5289334501034215,-0.8882878333942275,574,11,140,3,17,186,95,161,0.094,0.71,0.196,0.9644,1,1,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,2,2,6,11,0,0,6,1,9,1,1,2,1,25,20,12,0,4,7,0,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0,13,11,0,0,0,0,0,5,3,1,0,0,2,4,17,10,20,18,4,18,0,0,1,0,10,6,0,4,8,85,30,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13242812583057356,0.0,0.10225247308314284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12013205928437433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08246144278490154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12053842057654167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19757419719046002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14533565866320022,0.10724591951143868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22908133758246865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08570427445555252,0.0,0.12825761410234396,0.1269974034431122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12688489128653074,0.0,0.0,0.3994507832467018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12493539063514465,0.0,0.11290589955776255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1706998890147544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10205950399218576,0.0,0.09399445666589576,0.09480923772465008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4432225964435497,0.0,0.1335902454760625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091948140127332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588095748700843,0.10189073300869604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31731026858556144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833841160825301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14637322855263274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10149217249050413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14703682737918322,0.0,0.0,0.186172444308442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233996490575987
lonely,M_McCoy5,2018/02/01,"Peaked in highschool Man, it's been a really shitty couple of months. I've been really isolated, spending multiple days at a time in my room interacting with no one. I hate to say it but I miss high school. I had a lot of friends, I played sports and did theater, sure my grades were bad but I didn't feel like shit all the time. Now I'm 4 years out and I've only made one friend in all of college and only stay in touch with one friend from high school. My grades are fine, and have only gone down slightly this year, which I feel is caused by my crippling loneliness.  My work really isolated me as I don't have any co workers and my contact with other adults is extremely limited. Everyone says they loved college but it's been a fucking nightmare for me socially and I just want to give up.  I just can't help feeling like I'm going to die alone. 
More fun sad facts: never been kissed or even had anyone show romantic interest in me.

I was very talkative till I was like 10. Way too talkative that I used to say stuff to other people I shouldn't have said (personal shit about my family). Then randomnly outta nowhere I became a quiet dude. While I wasnt that quiet, in a class of about 30, I used to just talk to around 5 people.. Somehow the rest of them had great friends, everyone grouped with themselves, I was left to fend for myself.. I guess? Anyway yeah in class about 5 people, they had 'closer' friends so I guess I've never in my life had a best friend.. Last two years, I sat with these 4 people. One of them was great, but he had better friends, and whenever I used to talk about my life and how I felt, he lost interest. Like the rest of them. Another one had a 'squad', so he hung out with them often. The other two guys were best friends with each other, and preferred each other's company over mine. Everyone's done something interesting in their lives.. I guess I'm just a boring person, since I've never really experienced anything interesting or shocking or whatever. 

Edit: Not that this matters specially, but I've only ever talked to 2 girls my entire life. Family friends. One of them was elder to me so we talked, but never really became friends, and the other girl I did like, and have had one of those infatuation things when we were in 8th grade so.. Anyway we dont talk anymore now. I dont talk to anyone now lol. Just some people I met online, but I obviously cant tell them how I feel.

Used to just go to school, talk with a few people, come back home and do nothing/play/study. Never been for a sleepover, never been to a party (thanks to my family being JWs). Atleast I've decided to leave the cult whenever I can...

So yeah back to topic uhmm, high school ended last year, and everyone left to different countries for uni... And Im here at home doing distance education, so again, no opportunity to meet people. No ones called me in a year, no one texts me in a year unless I text them back, its like Im all alone, and recently since I'm home alone and my parents work, and my brothers work, the effect just compounds... 

The silence when I'm alone.. It kills me. Makes me feel like I'm such a pathetic, boring person no one likes or wants to talk to. I'm really not blaming anyone, I had to shift classes almost every year since 8th grade, so I've never had a long lasting friend. It's just that I'm alone and every bloody second of my life I spend thinking about myself it's like a 1000 ton boulder is placed on my heart and I feel just so fucking useless, like no one wants or needs me, like no one likes me enough to talk to me, and a year of this shit finally got to me and I went and sat on the toilet seat, and cried like hell till my eyes became so fucking red. 

I can't tell this to anyone since they'll think I'm a sore loser. I don't have any friend to tell how lonely I feel rn. I thought typing this out would make me feel better. I guess it did? Idk. 

Next month on I'm going to join Toastmaster's. Ironically, I have absolutely no stage fear and can speak in front of anyone about anything without stuttering. I'm not doing it to hone my public speaking skills. I'm doing it to find a friend. And that makes me realize how fucking lonely I am again. 

Im talking around in circles ain't I? Sorry about that. I'm a pathetic fucking loner hermit, and I hate myself for it. 

Fuck my life. Idk if it gets better. I hope it gets better.",2.2042079724832644,4.192766172839509,3.8040501197715137,87.16897180762855,77.94375857338821,6.547026185942714,21.580185492291626,7.543152864043107,0.8189683311835885,2816,78,574,40,67,936,290,729,0.157,0.675,0.16899999999999998,0.8391,2,8,3,0,0,0,106.0,3,0,10,13,46,58,12,1,26,3,45,18,5,12,10,107,102,49,1,8,21,2,6,11,10,3,8,6,3,6,29,36,0,0,14,0,1,6,26,22,0,12,31,15,80,36,81,67,12,72,1,5,2,5,56,26,8,14,49,368,109,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042084884814047166,0.17411297522500865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028580422625301825,0.044069932166495344,0.0,0.0,0.04168039731458924,0.11754757828225153,0.0,0.06917078419754218,0.07482750754619155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09695061459665152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08821140536562344,0.1486810977979279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0429151990564216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03620332638701309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09233137979904532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04391022480117763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04300914766170277,0.09851280407933992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03722425713673806,0.04342606978984335,0.0,0.0,0.0380166542324096,0.07082066015699545,0.12047841828785145,0.0,0.0,0.1188605304039938,0.04729308755125839,0.10625288023282647,0.03002475006118168,0.040353388165332384,0.04603952532853277,0.03841275187077157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3247066199567629,0.1942706456870347,0.0439157007103099,0.0,0.07165629594570799,0.0,0.03361356203910481,0.09267184681068494,0.1851939415552607,0.0416142423434088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12448159162099445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049803280283971935,0.0,0.04440479848867265,0.1264722730531794,0.04174320149259801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13619207699426142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04649765973573816,0.0,0.0,0.1027750775674454,0.0,0.04450149242903622,0.09132690276796727,0.0,0.20779890932075706,0.2258598738159615,0.0,0.0371114179279571,0.03719338122728545,0.0,0.0,0.04587843267564631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08416187656662052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033546279875625924,0.0,0.0,0.031163165595527287,0.19448710865832586,0.0,0.044697163189409486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25631281911973586,0.031964122343014975,0.0,0.0,0.04666702467639761,0.0,0.0,0.2039580456523624,0.1100914598784512,0.04391022480117763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0807724734203108,0.0,0.04149749465423959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03997817037898757,0.03342228398066835,0.0,0.12760347777726355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628209924569327,0.13906369860725282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706542416911053,0.0,0.04704680869345338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048111906282647984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3378044517386236,0.11020274751421308,0.038693656456589634,0.0,0.0,0.027921478480143896,0.05385958038103949,0.0,0.0333654690435547,0.0,0.0,0.03983754814698397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08211032989850943,0.0,0.0,0.14519449419978775,0.0,0.034677430456045384,0.04957830500399831,0.033359801785950625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03896029721049672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04051340919416672,0.0,0.06119364368436043,0.0,0.0,0.029855424168398707,0.0,0.0,0.16238759153028964

lonely,ThatGingerGuy69,2018/02/02,"I’m starting to resent my only friends out of jealousy and it doesn’t feel like I can help it I’m an autistic (high functioning Asperger’s) guy with several other health issues that i don’t really want to dive into. I’m a freshman in college and I’ve kissed 3 girls in my life, but I finally found a tight group of friends at my school. My roommate is probably my best friend, but I can’t help but be jealous of him. He constantly seems to just fall his way ass backwards into getting to fuck super hot girls and no matter how I try to observe or understand how he does it I can’t. He’s decent looking but nothing special, so it just makes me feel lonelier and lonelier as I don’t get laid and he continues to do it effortlessly. I know sex isn’t everything and I shouldn’t be comparing myself to others in that regard anyway (esp since I’m autistic) but it’s hard when I’ve never had a woman show real attraction towards me... I don’t even know what it feels like,  and my jealousy is slowly morphing my view of him even though I know that logically he’s not doing anything wrong or out of line. This shit just sucks.

lonely,mohaha14,2018/02/02,"Feeling really lonely right now. I've always been pretty introverted and quiet. As a consequence l've been pretty alone and lonely growing up. Even when I started making friends it always feels like they want to hang out with each other than me. 

Now that I'm a 20 something with a job it's gotten better. But a small incident happened that brought back all those past feelings of anxiety and loneliness came flooding back.

lonely,Supevict,2018/02/03,"I feel so alone I came home from a party almost two hours ago. Tonight was when I realised parties and I just don't mix, almost everybody was out on the floor, dancing, jiving and just having a good time listening to loud music and near-epileptic lights flashing in the background.  

I kept going back to the floor and try to get in the mood to do the same, but I just couldn't. I don't have a dancing bone in my body and I just didn't have the energy or enthusiasm to participate. So I just resorted to walking around aimlessly and sitting down occasionally by myself because I didn't know the other people that were sitting down chilling.  

Honestly, that suits me better, just sitting down and chilling having a good old chat. I'm not much of a talker, I prefer to stay in the background and listen, yet still be involved and not left out.  

Because of my strict parents, I had to come home at 10pm (as the party was just getting started) and just wallow on my bed, thinking about how lonely I am, and how nobody checks up on me to even ask ""hey, how are you"".  

Times like this, is when I truly feel alone, and all by myself.",5.712349085891688,5.6510094035874445,6.286547085201793,80.5440255260435,67.07174887892377,8.475888237323218,30.60676095205244,7.882392219407189,1.996755363918592,879,30,172,9,13,287,127,223,0.055,0.8029999999999999,0.142,0.9701,1,4,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,0,1,21,7,0,0,14,0,19,2,2,3,1,43,34,22,0,2,12,1,2,1,0,0,0,3,3,0,4,17,0,1,5,3,1,6,7,1,0,1,9,6,22,5,31,23,3,40,0,1,0,0,9,18,0,3,13,129,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435789996923975,0.0,0.3243844655786569,0.3355096768604112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14419001711187066,0.15142258238911524,0.0,0.0,0.12454698578209385,0.0,0.1974740733497647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325166465327546,0.0,0.17991512300855464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852535852542279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13952511375653173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698142138819282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16379649806723046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16924807051712795,0.0,0.09205280141314172,0.2717099828620645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249435902869967,0.0,0.1595104537168951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08901594385834649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17598378062717626,0.0,0.0,0.07913166534210153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119068549769372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699630711501923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17985148262478348,0.0,0.0,0.11229145559324702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464508998109275,0.1726413158028644,0.12935158403934918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10378554720650346,0.0,0.0,0.18889513365472735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099688112312025,0.0,0.15822376371174485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,BrokenAutumn,2018/02/03,"Just a stupid rant. For those of you who actually decide to read this (or just simply skim through it), thank you.

I've always suffered from loneliness, but for a while now it's just been increasing in severity. 

I've never been the best at making friends, and I'm even worse at keeping them. Throughout my school years I was usually alone, as my admittedly odd and hyperactive personality at the time scared most others away before they truly got to know me. Over time I became more silent and distant, which didn't make it any easier to connect with others.

I've had real life friends in the past, but all of them have left and moved on. One moved to another state, and several others just quickly grew tired of me. 

I had a longer friendship that lasted for the entirety of my middle school years, but it was admittedly very toxic, and just like all the others she eventually left me. Despite how she treated me, I still miss her and have yet to get over her.

The fact that I have no real life friends to speak of just gives me a feeling that can't be described. However, I know that it's almost impossible for me to actually go out there and attempt to make some new ones. I dropped out of high school and for over a year now I've been suffering from a very painful chronic illness that makes me unable to do many of the things that I could do previously without a second thought. It limits me immensely, and I fear that even if I did manage to make a new friend, they would soon grow bored of my presence due to my inability to do most things.

I honestly just feel trapped. I yearn for someone to just physically be here and to give me a tight hug and words of reassurance, but I'm just longing for something that will most likely never come to be.

Due to this intense loneliness, I become increasingly bored throughout the day, as there's just a lack of things to do to pass the time. It's gotten to where I watch the same videos, listen to the same songs, and visit the same websites over and over again on a daily basis. I notice myself constantly going on the same websites, even though I literally just checked them a few minutes ago and I know that I haven't received any messages. I feel like my loneliness and just lack of things to do in general is just driving me insane. And I'm sick of it. 

I suffer from suicidal thoughts, and while I thought I had them under control for a few months, they've recently started to resurface. I just don't know what to do. I've tried making new online friends, but it just never works. Even if they have the same hobbies and interests. They just soon give up on me due to my short responses and my difficulties in starting and continuing conversations. They always just leave to go and find someone more social. I've posted on almost every single subreddit intended to help others find friends, and while I got a lot of responses, it always lead to the same result. An eventual loss of contact. It's gotten to where I just want to give up and let my loneliness consume me. It's like I'm not meant to have a long-lasting friendship. Maybe my personality just makes that impossible. Maybe I really am supposed to remain alone. And it hurts.",6.427750809061493,6.537385480582525,6.7046763754045315,77.56908576051782,65.55339805825243,9.779288025889967,32.37702265372168,9.516144504307137,2.810768284789644,2529,94,485,45,36,817,268,618,0.168,0.7240000000000001,0.108,-0.9906,1,3,1,0,0,0,61.0,0,2,9,7,38,30,1,2,31,0,33,8,0,12,6,118,77,40,1,8,29,0,4,4,6,2,7,3,0,2,38,29,0,4,16,3,1,15,10,13,0,3,18,8,64,17,84,52,23,86,0,7,1,1,40,30,0,10,42,353,102,7,0.0,0.0,0.12829515167343572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05826983715272885,0.0,0.1316475948755629,0.1361626301597365,0.0,0.0,0.16408958582094954,0.0,0.0,0.08940368770813976,0.06892855477308822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061759905820887785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259880142990599,0.055935380246355915,0.0,0.0689845024424393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05662461554076115,0.0,0.07103584803273172,0.07372704521936244,0.05248380168983529,0.0,0.0,0.042393437443658914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17366857314823705,0.0,0.05538431207762322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07396980243467913,0.09971230426120066,0.04696087621196417,0.0,0.0,0.12016063293705252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3047187541063187,0.0,0.034343662821774104,0.2522348207401849,0.11207561884303076,0.0,0.10514807435499117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04406057758730953,0.06945230987084193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07037034601370587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058428013472353775,0.0,0.0,0.14450426771978556,0.10716509292022988,0.0,0.06960354617271312,0.14284186769146434,0.06721817496166572,0.09286071217634433,0.12845859806760154,0.0,0.0,0.11634626554158242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05588528338770859,0.0,0.0,0.30714891563466873,0.06664465896097685,0.13207866441883614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052468803017545335,0.13973114654990348,0.0,0.0,0.15209593778325373,0.190460921858733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07483938111463831,0.0,0.0,0.08908705536964777,0.0,0.06994634560686645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06275120036385788,0.0,0.1147939929294206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06295566299937858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06575247949892954,0.14964093847586707,0.04211132613256348,0.0,0.06490507683139371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581189295832973,0.1995810493643907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14852297984153345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06700823906302712,0.11139358032432532,0.05060577645197106,0.0,0.0,0.09305470490629064,0.0,0.052495808952341495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0719030825172704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06051967151578209,0.0,0.0,0.17468483059997916,0.0,0.0645839999165309,0.15655800547704818,0.11499128041619933,0.07555235706272935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04462954008629053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0723974749428348,0.10847600833825234,0.038772023736209166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06336589614285155,0.0,0.04785563776824979,0.0,0.06698926575419731,0.04669603829410445,0.0,0.0,0.12699295695507284

lonely,nanica_kun,2018/02/03,"lonely but not depressed? i feel like a lot of people mix up loneliness with depression. i feel this gaping hole in my chest as though something is missing, but i can't really put it on a t. is it loneliness? is it something else? it's really hard to explain too (especially being young and fortunate (for the most part)) especially to parents that can't really see in that sense.

sometimes i would try to reach out, but the words get choked into my throat and my mind beats me back into suffering, nearly to the point that anything i feel i just slip with and don't complain about whilst keeping that same smile and fake laugh. 

does anyone else feel this way sometimes (or often)?

lonely,PPG724,2018/02/04,"Immigration choice leading to loneliness Years ago I moved to another country, endless possibilities.  Yet it’s never felt like home.   I constantly feel lonely. I struggle to find meaningful friendships, and even more of a failure at meaningful relationships. I’ve been gone from my home country for so long that when I visit it feels foreign. Friends changed so much in almost a decade (which is expected).  I feel perpetually alone.

lonely,_deathanddespair,2018/02/04,"fuck. you don't know that I still want you.  
you know that I used to - your abusive ex managed to get me to admit that much, while pretending to be you on your discord account. pretending that you liked me back. for months, every single compliment you gave me, all the attention you paid to me, all the subtle flirting, it was all him. all fake. all to get back at you, to make it seem like you were cheating on your boyfriend at the time. I was a tool he used to get revenge. fuck.   
and when you inform me of this, 4 months after the fact, you laugh and say you never really expected me to believe it. and you're right - how could I believe you actually liked me? fuck.  
and then you break up with your boyfriend because you still have feelings for your abusive ex. and I get my hopes up even though I know I shouldn't. and then you meet _him_, and in a day he's 3rd on your snapchat best friends (while, after one and a half years, you still haven't given me your snapchat). fuck.  
and you show me his pictures, and I agree he's ridiculously cute, and you tell me how much better he makes you feel, and I'm happy for your sake, and after 4 days he knows about your ptsd and your schizophrenia, which it took you a year to open up about to me, and even then only accidentally. and then you rant about how confused you are, have you now have feelings for three guys, two of which are your exes, and I try my best to help you and be supportive and encouraging and help you sort things out, and I encourage you to date him anyway if you want to. and I try to ignore my own feelings in favour of yours, try to live only for you, try to care only about making you smile and offering words of advice, but it still hurts. it really, really hurts. fuck.    
and then I cut my hair, and you don't notice, so I cut my thighs, and I don't think you care, and I cry because it hurts to not mean anything to you. to try so hard to help you and to care about you so much but to not get much back. I cry because I feel like I don't deserve the little attention you do give me. I cry because I'm worthless. fuck.",3.349875968992252,4.122875088372094,4.02279069767442,91.75038759689924,72.53488372093022,7.22170542635659,23.86821705426357,7.3011,0.6720914728682166,1608,41,369,16,30,511,169,430,0.161,0.7020000000000001,0.13699999999999998,-0.9702,0,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,0,48,0,3,24,38,10,1,9,0,18,8,2,8,7,77,61,46,0,7,5,2,7,4,1,1,0,1,0,1,15,31,0,1,16,3,2,1,9,17,0,4,7,8,88,21,52,50,13,44,0,4,0,6,74,14,6,5,32,259,103,1,0.0,0.16979705360947814,0.0699241767828725,0.0,0.0,0.07001966878982109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058965312925172174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1652930032324963,0.0,0.17471897554467447,0.0,0.0,0.16145952404856015,0.1503933541102753,0.06337232951324889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21916874054057225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0572100594563175,0.0,0.23612636892110356,0.09242208066566658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465386534135847,0.0,0.060371765857078326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18115261825677187,0.051189784918487816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05535986811988695,0.3974589982636612,0.18718184741959606,0.0687372514322564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07094893748537955,0.0,0.07627724338605707,0.06418810157212736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14408492805149795,0.0,0.0,0.07116880246666384,0.0,0.0,0.2301219547622132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15751712874758594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14002651859242135,0.0718163468333749,0.06327198387600731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434892330827971,0.0,0.0,0.07805244538115033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11438742025492167,0.0,0.21069636821080487,0.0,0.055264147308200465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815787977506913,0.0,0.0,0.0485547499455712,0.16348877621092545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083759941889593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771057322024727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061192307387114425,0.0,0.05698230709560481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06523130543406228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2288925919749139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08131235309648284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626289414697736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04760387597206528,0.04591312716820845,0.0703999016113029,0.0,0.0417821485090256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961046844060811,0.2432425395680973,0.0,0.06999575547716234,0.0,0.0,0.12377246961740808,0.0,0.0,0.08452702402539093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09228592929642107
lonely,Japanagan,2018/02/04,"It's been years.... It's been years since last we spoke. I heard recently you got pregnant which I'm happy for you. I'd like to think I am. Maybe you'll get your life together in the end after all. I know I don't have it together. 

We were together for 3 years and one of my biggest flaws is that I go in too much in a relationship. I give it my all and really try to grow my roots with you. We had plans to get married where you would later get married at to the man you cheated on me with. We had plans for a small house where we would have our heads in the clouds but still remain humble to each other. I grew jealous and spiteful... I didn't mean to; honestly I didn't. I worked long hard hours to make sure the roof over our head stayed there no matter how bad it was. Our tiny little overly-priced apartment was more than that to me. It was you, it was knowing you were safe and warm no matter how bad it got. 

When I found out the day you were cheating on me it just broke me. I can say now I haven't been the same or...me since then. That was god...4...5 years ago? I have tried letting go. We'd get back together at your new apartment and I lied to myself saying things would get better. That things would fall together with us finally. I was an old fashioned heart where the only way I thought to make things work was to put hard work and time into it. Love... And you went back to him... I left and you got married to him. Later you go divorced and now from what people say is your pregnant to some random guy you barely know. 

After you, I've had one other love that I and only I can say I broke that relationship. It was going too well and I blew up my own happiness. You'd of loved seeing us together. It was what we always wanted. We used to cook together and I helped her during the worst of times... I helped her discover parts of herself that no one put the effort to help her find. I watched a caterpillar turn into a magnificent butterfly. I joined the Army and everything just went numb for me. I stopped caring about everything and everyone. 

I'm here in Japan, around 11pm and I just don't know where to go in life. 

When we used to drive around in my Camaro, see your grandparents and I told you the only thing I wanted in life was love... I wasn't being clique or pulling it from some movie. I just have an innate need for love. Maybe I'm not independent. I'm not someone who can work on a full 100% level by myself. I need someone there that I can be there to support and care for; someone to protect. 

How can I go on?

lonely,sadcollegekd,2018/02/04,"College Kid Wastes Life A story of a wasted life.

This is my first reddit post and I don't quite know the proper etiquette, so please excuse me for any wrongdoings. I just needed somewhere to go to vent. My life feels so fucking empty. I have literally nothing and nobody in my life right now. I am in a highly intensive major that is male dominated. I have two friends, everyone else just sorta disassociates with me after a while. I've never been in a real relationship with a woman. I just want to have a relationship with someone, anything really. I feel like everyone else is living it up, enjoying their life while I just sink lower and lower into a pit that I have no clue how to get out of. I've tried improving myself. I work out, dress nice, take care of myself, but it's all useless. I don't act depressed or anything like that. I am so fucking hopeless. I don't know what went wrong. I thought I could just focus on being successful, but now that I'm most of the way there I realize that I'm just empty. I can't see any happiness in my future. Instead I see a life of working to the top then dying alone. There is nothing left to live for. If I was a different person I would kill myself, but that's just not me. Instead I am just gonna suffer for the rest of my life, probably pick up drinking again, maybe hookers to try and feel something. I just don't want to be empty anymore. Please if you are young (high schoolish) listen to me. Don't only focus on games or being antisocial and successful. It'll just drag you down later in life. Yes, you will be able to achieve anything you want, but there will be times you are so empty you can't even function anymore. Then they will become more common. Until all that's left is emptiness and you are a shell. You will look back with regret at every time someone reached out to you and you shot them down. Please just try and make connections, even if you get shot down you'll still feel more than this. Enough of the rant, thanks for reading. I'm gonna go put a face on, find a party, and get so shitfaced I don't remember making this.",2.7985286355238834,4.615949237529693,4.134253760886779,86.25112463710742,75.6270783847981,6.6730271839535495,24.04598838743732,7.492282038375204,1.0920925837951971,1643,52,329,21,36,541,202,421,0.138,0.732,0.13,-0.8592,3,1,2,0,0,2,51.0,0,12,3,8,29,19,3,0,18,1,38,12,1,4,3,65,71,29,2,10,21,0,4,2,1,9,8,1,0,4,14,17,1,0,10,3,0,5,11,9,0,2,4,8,50,10,47,52,8,50,0,5,3,2,25,24,2,7,21,228,64,7,0.08121633052230877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08411562485737835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11045977956362717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16108955279821738,0.0,0.0,0.20050235982006528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062450344986755925,0.0,0.0,0.08969705621886602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08280546175218059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06484463128910183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06995150647140966,0.0,0.08428972867721599,0.08485377938102086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07956108453190855,0.0,0.0,0.13569164539895634,0.0,0.0,0.08391817992317263,0.0,0.10728524068105842,0.0,0.06842826129665794,0.1552113685268967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16426166795907618,0.05802096275292755,0.0,0.0,0.07423025473950501,0.06908256925289417,0.0,0.0,0.06274753549571717,0.15016637773071942,0.12729654185244474,0.0,0.09231422453379888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08645629405252722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17161902456557068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898538365224741,0.0,0.08926874252904908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17648356149652886,0.0,0.4589239688011901,0.07935639339577243,0.0,0.1434310156067012,0.0,0.06820126278321359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10842506255756633,0.0,0.08159272022643108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0602208799939046,0.0626390409267639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15585851910540469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06176867911023338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709149671521766,0.0,0.2674534263215166,0.0,0.0,0.07778279437303594,0.0,0.08756494077646082,0.0,0.0,0.08164484427593112,0.0,0.08638356462620346,0.08123830881477621,0.09244196465194386,0.05202926099558941,0.0,0.0,0.17439188923549542,0.09200227030433862,0.06935830250756092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294378006250404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13762866658919598,0.06252429910698172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06485946646652681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061064573055732124,0.0,0.0,0.07477308538680982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06447669448256027,0.09471579090397456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16542167173409167,0.0,0.07933655372591146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14371048795386976,0.06446574285959299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07528835206577737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11825291180413773,0.0,0.0,0.057693750992688135,0.08879730787298495,0.0,0.0
lonely,goopriel,2018/02/05,"lost my only friend I've always felt like a social outcast. I had friends but I never felt like I belonged. I ended up shying away/burning bridges in order to protect myself from being rejected or abandoned. Eventually I got a girlfriend and it was great for the first few years. Towards the end of our relationship I became emotionally dependent to an unhealthy degree. She was busy with work, school, and her own social life.  She knew I was lonely and she felt a lot of guilt because she didn't have the energy to be there for me as much as I needed it. We decided it was best to end the relationship before she ended up resenting me. It's been a few weeks since we broke up and it's been really hard. She was my best friend. She was my only friend. I'm sure it's been hard for her as well but she has plenty of friends to support her and distract her through the process. I've been going through this on my own and it really sucks to be alone with my thoughts. I've tried to reach out to those old friends again but I feel like they'll know I'm only doing it because I no longer have a girlfriend/best friend. I'm afraid I'll end up isolating myself again for fear of being rejected/abandoned. I'm trying hard to not be alone but so far it hasn't been working.

If anyone has similar experiences or advice on how to go through a break up, I'd really appreciate it if you'd share. Thanks.

Maybe your lonely because you just cant find the right ego mass to surrender yourself too

lonely,mackmechle,2018/02/05,"Lonely and it is my fault I have come to the conclusion that the only reason I am lonely is because of myself. I was never really an outgoing person, but after a bad breakup in which I depended too much on the other person, I just spiraled into not talking at all. I rarely communicate with new people, and I just try to do it over the internet at this point. 

I'm really not too bad looking I think, I have had a few dates in the past 2 years. I use dating apps and such just to boost my confidence since I love being compliment (not healthy imo). I could probably get more dates if I put in any effort at all to talk to people, but I'd rather just sit in silence and work alone at school. 

I guess I only made this post to spill out what I'm feeling and ask if this is normal for people, and how can I go about changing it? Most people in my classes think I'm weird since I do not say a word to them.

lonely,Bob_Sherlock,2018/02/05,"I feel that I don’t belong in my high school... TL;DR: My high school sucks ass and I feel like an alien from another planet when over there.

Throughout my elementary/middle school years, I went to a public school and then for some reason, my parents put me in a private Catholic school for high school. Okay, for starters, I’m not really religious in my family. Next, the classmates I have (I had them for freshman and sophmore years too) are ridiculously loud and annoying while I’m relatively quiet. The people there too don’t really have much in common with me as boys were usually into sports and rap music while the girls are into just talking about their dating lives. I’m into mainly Godzilla and video games (mainly Nintendo).

I had three friends which made me feel good until two of them left and one of them is too busy with school work. Another thing to mention is that there’s barely anything going on which makes it boring. Hell, when I hang out with this friend from elementary/middle school (she goes to a public high school), it feels like a breath of fresh air. I try to get my parents to have me switch schools but they said no for literally very stupid reasons like every reason or excuse comes out of their asses.

I’m not big on going to parties or school related activities either so I can’t really do that.

lonely,RockyMountainDave,2018/02/05,"Sigh... Here's my rant. Thanks for reading and sorry for the ""woe is me"" vibe. I'm just really really down right now. Basically,  I moved to a city I fucking hate for a job I no longer have. Lost my girlfriend due to the distance. Now I work a job I hate, for not enough money and am going into debt each month. In large part because I've developed a severe opiate addiction (main reason I can't quit or get a new job).

I don't ever go out. I haven't been laid in two years despite being a pretty good looking guy. I haven't done *anything* in 2 years. Life is - wake up feeling like shit cuz of drugs. Drag myself out of my disgusting apartment. Sit in the worst traffic in the nation, in a city I SWORE I'd never live in. Survive through the work day at my stressful, toxic job. Sit in even worse traffic. Get food. Come home and try to find *something* new to watch. Get fucked up enough so that I can fall asleep. Rinse and repeat. For 2 years. Without a single vacation. 

And if that wasn't bad enough, I've now developed feelings for one of my co-workers. She's in a serious relationship so even if i wasn't a ghost of my former self,  it wouldn't matter. But that doesn't stop me from constantly thinking about her.

I know most of you will read this and just think - well he's a junkie loser, probably picturing some pathetic guy. Truth is, I am a very likable and relatively handsome guy. My whole life, despite being an introvert, I've always made friends pretty easily. I've always been able to hook up without really putting in too effort. But thst was back in college and after, when I still hung out with those same friends. Now I don't hang out with anyone outside of work. I'm really good at putting on a face so all my work friends think I'm fine. But I'm not... at all. It's gotten really bad recently and I'm just *so lonely* and starved for affection. I dunno... Thats my rant. Thanks for reading and I hope for anyone in a similar boat that things turn around for you soon.

I'm a total fucking loser, basically all my friends are assholes who talk so much shit about me and treat me like garbage, I have pretty bad social anxiety and shit social skills, people just feel the need to remind me of how awkward I am all the time because of it. I mainly spend my time smoking and drinking whenever I can to drown out my thoughts which mainly consists of how I wish my life could be or thoughts of ending my life. I'm not the best at venting my thoughts but I've been feeling pretty lonely lately and I just need to know someone understands it.

lonely,epicchuseok,2018/02/06,"There's a difference between being shy and knowing that nobody wants to hear you talk. For a while I've struggled with the idea of what the few people who do notice me see me as. Because I barely speak, does that make me ""shy""? Does it make me somebody who seems afraid of talking? Or do I just seem cold and disconnected from the rest of the people around me?

I realized recently that the reason why I'm so quiet has nothing to do with fear or unwant of speaking. It's knowing that if I ever did open my mouth, nobody would want to hear it.

It's pretty objective. If I ever let myself, I'd talk way too much. I'm not funny like most people can laugh with their friends about for hours. The things I want to say are things that nobody cares about or can relate to. 

I'd rather keep the half-friendships that I have now than ruin them forever. Sometimes I do feel loved, and warm, and like somebody's noticed me. I can't imagine losing those moments, and those people. It's better if I never make them have to deal with me.",3.7411594202898537,4.864467270531399,4.499246376811595,87.38452173913043,71.94685990338165,6.679420289855073,24.4280193236715,6.742157984588678,0.7967561352657002,803,22,163,6,15,258,119,207,0.085,0.7859999999999999,0.129,0.8466,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,3,2,11,13,0,3,9,0,15,2,1,4,3,42,34,14,0,9,9,0,2,2,1,1,0,6,0,0,18,11,0,1,9,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,1,10,23,8,23,30,4,11,0,2,1,1,17,2,0,9,10,114,41,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10771161810066278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07375771360415845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10701065791154228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12336294246522568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12474101351669825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264145103745185,0.0,0.0,0.21176789697748735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2188946539275534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13615353904385447,0.061178943589261174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09348079761162637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727413698365023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915616225003685,0.0,0.0,0.13658915455058396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075463304175781,0.0,0.0,0.1329918886451246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237260626345689,0.0,0.11822454685451578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536297805827155,0.0,0.0,0.10920313288712187,0.0,0.2422962411726177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08894559011396712,0.0,0.0933191632340822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609841378977027,0.27550828211574674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33553208809021245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12309588852829292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244034917755793,0.11946842659626294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0962204517090286,0.0,0.0,0.09641772181115647,0.22029945765110004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11966761064463767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264907329726866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29175471928619345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16076802371120555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21409878384786474,0.09604056977747097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10917958926770804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08595170818097175,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,SeaDragonScale,2018/02/06,"I'm in second year uni and I'm feeling lonely and stuck. I'm a second year student at university in Canada and socially, I feel like I'm not succeeding. Last year, I was pretty reserved and didn't really form that many friends except for a few, but even this year, those friends have made their own tight social group and we haven't interacted as much as last year. At this point I feel like it's hard to make new friends, since everyone has already established their core friend group in first year. I joined a club this year to change that, but I haven't had that much success. Making friends isn't so easy for me as I'm pretty reserved and holding casual convo's or introducing myself isn't so easy.The worst part of this is I see so many people having the time of their lives here, which is what I had hoped (and continue to hope) my university experience would be like. Overall, I don't want to be lonely for all of my uni life and I know my skills at making friends suck, so is there any potential advice out there? It's almost halfway through semester 2 and I'm just getting kind of depressed that I might be wasting my uni experience honestly. I recently joined another club last week, which looks promising but nothing too much has occured.

lonely,Allmudes,2018/02/06,"Not Depressed, but not feeling well. I'm probably way older than all of you, but fuck it, this is why I am here...


Four years ago I married my husband, and it was the best decision of my life. I was working in a toxic environment, and living in a party house.  I had never felt comfortable being around superficial people who demanded respect and admiration because they used credit cards to buy nice things. None of them  contributed anything to the world around them besides fights, gossip, sleeping around, dirty little secrets, rainbow colored hair, and tattoos. Living a soap opera is more painful than watching one. I was happy to leave.

We moved to a bigger city, I started to attend school, made a couple of friends, but was once again turned off by how superficial and drama prone my new ""friends"" were. I litterally have had to block people I have met here because they are nuts. Message me if you want examples.

The one awesome neighbor I had my age moved away to another state. She  made me vegan muffins, I bought clothes for her daughter. It was so nice a normal. I miss that.

So after shunning everyone because I like living a simple life, I am alone and lonely. 

Does anyone else feel like most potential friends want to be the center of attention, or like celebrities in their little world? I day dream everyday about moving to some remote place that has yet to be tainted by capitalism and reality shows. I want friends I can learn from, laugh with, and contribute something to the world with. I'm tired of talking about sleeping around, coming up on the newest shiny item, and drinking until my brain shuts down. Like, I really wish I could be friends with Neil deGrasse Tyson.

lonely,callthekarmapolice,2018/02/06,This hurts so bad I am so lonely. I feel like crying it to the heavens. I have no friends left. Lost them all in a horrendous year of breakup and loss. Nobody texts or calls anymore. Nobody cares. I'm lonely. Desperate. I've got nothing left and I don't even know how to start feeling better. I miss having anybody to talk to. I miss people caring. I miss affection. I want to die yet I'm not the suicide type. Just feels that bad. I miss having somebody. She was my best friend. Something has to change soon I can't handle this anymore.,-0.3584502923976629,1.7512274629629658,1.2675828460039007,96.09885964912279,103.07407407407408,3.3847953216374265,18.647173489278753,5.399115186594226,-0.2794148148148148,418,14,85,3,19,134,76,108,0.308,0.448,0.244,-0.7972,0,4,1,0,0,2,17.0,0,0,1,4,7,19,0,0,3,0,8,0,0,2,1,13,24,6,2,1,3,0,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,11,0,0,3,3,13,8,8,21,2,7,1,9,0,0,6,3,0,1,5,50,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32973072928267405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776068359589924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17445857583077629,0.14702573021748586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16974958006496718,0.0,0.3389854254091296,0.0,0.17585982900101704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18260678375394468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17253082664268662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10979992195814224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2521677475129877,0.11876185655670513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2568731526073521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13295727774964067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17796330931739004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09136113132401824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612403934819172,0.0,0.0,0.08121644455865787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814705477770468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15951171965172709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11524985273812688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279796385570528,0.0,0.0,0.11766549527446715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818395281501464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13361737819582006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980526321653198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070530801678113

lonely,Cheezgamer92,2018/02/07,"The Music Life can make you a lonely person.... So I enjoy making music. I sing and I rap. I even have a song with one of the top dawgs of philly. But that’s just about all I have in my life is my music. No one really seems to care about me at all. I pour my heart out into what I do and really get nothing in return. I’ve handed out 100s of cds, put up all my music for free and still, I barely even get any people even just saying good job. Not even from my so called friends. It hurts so bad when i put my everything into it (including my money) and no one seems to care. I’ve travelled all over the country preforming shows, but you couldn’t tell that from my lack of followers. I love to cook too, I can make some amazing meals.

I have a long online friendship with a 2 people they are my only friends really and when ever I talk to someone I feel good, like I’m worth something. It’s been helping with my depression

lonely,throwban,2018/02/07,"The vicious circle. As I grew older I tried to rationalize the ""why"" of my loneliness. As a result I've thought of some values that you have to hold to enter romantic relationships or friendships, such as: atractiveness, humour, personality, hobbies. And a few others I think of from time to time, my conclusion is that I don't have any of that. I don't think I can have friends as I'm basically a hermit doing nothing of his time. I don't think I can try dating as I don't bring anything to the table. etc  





Now the thing I see repeated often on reddit is, ""drop that attitude"" ""show confidence and no insecurity"", but I'm an unconfident and insecure, as a result I'm not seen as attractive.  
  

Is it even worth trying to date with such flaws? Is it even worth trying to make friends if you don't have anything to say? I'm so lonely I've built a ""all or nothing"" picture in my mind, one of love and not of friendship, I've forgotten what it is like to have friends...

lonely,zzthrow99,2018/02/07,"Dealing with loneliness due to work Hi, for the past 4-5 months I've been working away from home. 

At first I could deal with the loneliness but it's getting worse and worse. I only see my coworkers on Mondays and Fridays because they drive me to and from the airport. The few friends I have at home were difficult enough to get together and now it's even harder. The weekends have begun to feel kind of meaningless since I know I'm leaving again on Monday.

I'm trying to keep my hopes up that we get more work closer to home soon but I'm tired of being alone and depressed in a hotel room 4 days of the week. Would love any ideas to help me cope with this.

lonely,highlyflowlyf,2018/02/07,"Lost and sad In the last year I’ve lost my best friend (we are not friends anymore to be specific), am very recently single (this is by choice but still difficult) and am feeling as if I don’t really have anyone I can just call when I’m feeling low... or even if I really want to. 
I’m socially anxious and find it difficult to make good and lasting friendships... I’ve had some good ones in the past and that leads me to believe I must be doing something wrong or must be hard to be around or boring. I can’t help but wonder what I have to offer and it’s such a shitty feeling. 
This is a bit of a stream of consciousness so thank you if you’ve managed to get this far. I guess I’m wondering if other people feel similar? Feel as if they are lost and insignificant to anyone in the world??

lonely,Gawkawa,2018/02/07,"What am I doing wrong? I feel like I give everyone in my life every ounce of me but Im just so alone. 

My wife of ten years cheated on me and left me a little over a year ago. I have come a long way since then. Spent 6 months with  my folks, moved into a room at my buddies house for another 6 and just the other day i could finally afford my own apartment.

Just days before i move in, my new girlfriend of 2.5 months breaks up with me. She said she just wasnt interested anymore.

Here i am, all alone in this apartment. I should feel great and i do, until i crawl into my bed and its just me and my thoughts. 

I decided to re add my ex wife on fb, as i am ok with all of that now, only to find that she blocked me on messenger. I dont even know why i feel the need to be in her life. 

I redownloaded the dating apps, much to my displeasure. 2 days, no matches. Feels bad.

I hate feeling like this. I hate being by myself and I just want someone to share my life with. I just dont know why its so hard, and maybe im broken and people just tolerate me.

lonely,RamashekaTalamasoa,2018/02/08,"I’m facing a diagnosis of a potential brain tumor and I’m alone. I’ve been having headaches for the better part of a month and a half, so I decided to go to the doctor. Today, I went in and he said that it looks like the pressure inside my brain is elevated, which in conjunction to my other symptoms points to a possible brain tumor. 

Now I’m waiting for the insurance company to authorize the MRI or CT or whatever, and that can take about two o three weeks. So I’m stuck with two to three weeks of lonely uncertainty and a million what ifs. 

I’m so fucking scared and so fucking alone.

lonely,ThisGuyHost,2018/02/08,"Pretty lonely person Hello I'm a 21 year guy who is pretty lonely. Ever since I left high school about 3 years and moved on to college. I have been just a loner in a sense. I have a ton of friends online,  but when it come to in life I have slim to none that want to hangout. When I tried Tinder to meet someone I could hangout with I meet a few really cool people,  but out of all of them I went out with one. I don't get it. I'm decent looking and people almost always say that I'm nice. 

Sorry for the post if it does not fit in to the subreddit. If you could please let me know what a guy like me could do or go to try and meet new people. At this point I just feel useless and lonely.

lonely,WolfWoff7,2018/02/08,Isolation at its finest I've managed to find myself at a point in life where I'm numb towards most things. I hate being awake during the day and can never truly sleep at night as this is the time my mind is most active. I distance myself from most as I'm an antisocial introvert. I've never found someone anywhere close to my mindset towards life. I just want someone to talk to at night as I spend my time wishing I was asleep. ,4.281034482758621,5.205006471264369,5.120172413793107,84.17956896551726,70.49425287356323,7.179310344827586,28.29310344827586,7.1686216300943375,1.4873310344827582,341,12,67,3,6,111,56,87,0.131,0.7979999999999999,0.071,-0.7424,0,1,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,4,0,5,5,2,0,2,13,11,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,2,0,0,2,0,10,0,15,8,3,17,0,0,0,0,1,10,0,3,7,45,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399686513512834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1983646851009429,0.0,0.0,0.2379660280961544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21427564649914746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3065943558862495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21914196348806256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33477922639675023,0.0,0.0,0.407342470876327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2051668068522561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21719023680207147,0.0,0.3677835567806456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17444330445332085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14418741216197192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25310795581514606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280119801497456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24957781154665876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Not looking forward to seeing same &lt;100 people in the building day after day. Scared that I will wake up 30, saying now what?

I'm really depressed for things...I mean the one thing I enjoy in life is learning, and thus classes....but it sucks, I mean really sucks, seeing people for a semester, and never crossing paths with them again.

Have no family outside of immediate, switched part time jobs a few times....in short, I lead a very lonely life.

I don't see things changing...Ill be entering the career Im striving for around age 27, and many people will be in marriage/family mode...I, OTOH, strive to never endeavor myself to that.

lonely,d0u3V3nDr1fTbR0,2018/02/08,"Miss you Hi ******, I miss you so much
I wish we could have stayed in touch
I know that you must not think much
Of me now that we're done and such
I'm sad but we cannot stay friends
I hate to say this is the end
Maybe some day we'll make amends
But currently we seem condemned
It makes me cry that we must part
Sure you'll be fine but will my heart
Dump my shit in a shopping cart
And find a new place to restart
'Cause when I swing I tend to miss
I really can't get over this
I envy his post—coital bliss
I'd trade my life for one more kiss
With you I felt things I'd forgotten
Now inside I just feel rotten
Hurt, rejected, blood white hot and
You just make me feel downtrodden 
Wanting everything I lack
You make me want a heart attack
The only way I know is back
To play chicken with the Amtrak
Just kidding I'll say with a sigh
I really just wish I knew why
You make me feel like I could fly
But also make me want to die
The hole you left may someday fill
I'll stay for now I'll take my pill
I love you and I always will
But as of now I hate you still
'Cause you put my head in a whirlwind
And refuse to be my girlfriend
I'd give you diamonds rubies pearls and
Anything to stop my world's end
But at this point that ship has sailed
Add your name to the list I've failed
My heart feels like it's been impaled
And everything has been derailed
We could have been perfect together

lonely,friendlyreapers,2018/02/08,"Isolated and alone from everyone I've always been kinda of loner since I was kid I was hit by a bus when I was 9 which left brain damaged and epileptic. It's not very obvious as I hide it very well there's just some things I have trouble understanding and I can get a bit over excited. I've had friends but they never stick around, They literally leave me and forget me like I ment nothing to them. I'm not a bad person the opposite I'm the kinda person that's always there for someone I call a friend. If they need anything I can out of my way to help and put them first wether they need money, someone to talk to or help with something. But my life follows the same pattern had friends at school that didn't really respect me they fucked me off. Went to college made friends who didn't respect me they fucked me off went to uni and the same thing. It's usually quite a fast process once they realise they can't get any more out of me they dub me useless and fuck me off. Now to try an stop the pattern I have locked myself away in my flat I have no friends don't go anywhere literally don't speak ever just sit in silence as I don't have anyone to talk to ever. But I feel like this is going to be life I'm nearly 30 I don't have one person in the entire world who just wants to hang out. I can't work due to my epilepsy which cuts out meeting new people that way. I can't meet a girl because who wants to go out with a friendless jobless loser ? I feel like I'm loosing control of my life it just feels like an existence. The only control I feel like I have is the fact that I could kill myself and stop my life going the way i know it's going to go. Me living alone for years then dying in my flat and no one even noticing. Like what is wrong with me am I that much of a prick that I don't deserve just one friend. Like even paedophiles and rapists have friends and I'm here on my own lol. I just don't know what to do any more I feel like my only choices are ride it out and deal with the daily pain or kill myself and end it now.",2.8740163873920466,3.641840784897028,3.975934155163504,91.66498929652323,73.64530892448514,6.645574665977707,24.85192293496716,6.532088108194933,0.6177930021406954,1601,47,367,11,31,521,194,437,0.194,0.6629999999999999,0.14300000000000002,-0.9786,1,2,1,0,0,2,20.0,0,0,11,6,18,34,8,0,20,1,34,11,2,3,5,67,67,23,3,6,14,0,5,8,7,0,5,1,0,5,23,24,0,4,8,0,1,12,16,15,1,4,11,6,59,19,49,53,8,53,0,3,0,4,35,21,4,6,24,238,82,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.149554779981094,0.0,0.0,0.12015231039457196,0.0,0.0,0.0981969048997045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05048389467985922,0.0,0.059414419852480235,0.06427327666500607,0.0,0.0,0.06783424435809117,0.0,0.06028395548085268,0.04401242889349174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882366280731103,0.0,0.0,0.08059903957108065,0.07372423731699132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16195680141464236,0.057645797566384764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07443499424304605,0.0,0.0,0.07493216538759027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639477394358477,0.0,0.0,0.09537479268851318,0.1306180048212443,0.0,0.06899016119170041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18253235986625602,0.25789834925194005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06141325385541033,0.0,0.0,0.3904706002559227,0.20024311434547035,0.07544300416391493,0.0,0.24619742579371534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09678823006253172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1597571292415723,0.0,0.07935842580232462,0.0,0.0,0.0764493387176223,0.07844547387790718,0.0,0.2039878836378045,0.28218604984557405,0.0,0.06375389238888672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06831735317221006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05307528215001407,0.107070719298904,0.05568506445688723,0.0697311766822838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06927781423638593,0.08220013937297342,0.0,0.07689060701130555,0.14677369571968246,0.10982265458666968,0.07682585387374333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050054365323095804,0.18912667523648524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07258090719162331,0.0,0.07679355068430699,0.0,0.0,0.04625314674870271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307021975870905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059724557637613675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12234959310911593,0.05558306088952833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12072480828296432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606319492528548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593289794625216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04901903731172397,0.0,0.0,0.07516271045743482,0.0,0.0,0.07951806177334036,0.11914506602305515,0.08517082069416658,0.1719269161828949,0.0,0.0,0.06491643994107688,0.13386018290214025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05256243485374357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07893932824237261,0.0,0.04649441067710452

I just feel even more depressed now because I just tend to stay by myself and not being able to talk to other kids in my class because I just feel like they’ll either use me again or we just don’t have very detailed conversations that can lead me to having a good friendship. What is wrong with me like am I just not seen as someone they see as friends. I also have a very low self esteem because I’m ugly and I feel like my looks make them want to avoid contact with me even more and they just make fun of me for not getting girls.

lonely,aaronr999,2018/02/10,"My Life 1. Rejection from every girl I come across
2. No license
3. No job
4. My patience is limited when it comes to being around people.
5. I've been crazy about the same girl for 5 years, would do anything for her.
6. I'm in my room and online almost 24/7(aside from sleeping)
7. I've constantly been reaching out to people I like to talk to lately, probably annoying them.
8. I have bad anxiety
9. I feel like most of the time, if I share things with people, as my cousin often tells me ""No one cares!""
10. I lived with my ex for a while, she took all my money calling it ""rent backpay"" and stole my parents car, putting the title in her name. So I currently am living with my parents in a townhouse helping them with tech stuff(I'm in my 30s)

lonely,psyduckspirit,2018/02/10,Tired of pretending I was having a bad week and just kinda kept to myself before having a chat with my roommate. She asked me if I was lonely when she's gone (jokingly) and that triggered me to almost start bawling. Why do I dislike spending time with people but crave affection at the same time?,7.571052631578947,6.986616982456143,7.553333333333335,74.75000000000001,63.38596491228071,9.705263157894738,33.03508771929825,8.841846274778883,2.788466666666668,236,8,41,3,3,76,46,57,0.132,0.769,0.099,0.0129,0,2,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,3,0,5,1,0,2,0,13,9,5,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,3,1,1,0,2,0,0,4,0,9,1,6,5,1,7,0,1,0,0,4,1,0,3,5,31,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3451255918784406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3222090692757502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28777535933841825,0.0,0.0,0.2932789046805846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389427311531585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2439509824559555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4019461578670265,0.3961341181163642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2764641710602786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31100058887711746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,FlashingAppleby,2018/02/10,"There's no one. I have no friends. No one to talk to. I just moved across the country 6 weeks ago and can't find work. I've moved across country 3 times this year, to different places, just trying to find something that works.  I spend most of my time sitting alone in my room, usually crying. It's been like this for 7 solid months. 

I've never been good with finding friends, so at this point I just figure people don't like me and stop trying to make them. 

I don't even have anyone to text. The only person in my life is my mother and we haven't been getting along. 

I'm so alone, it psychically hurts. I wish it were as easy as everyone says. Just go out and talk to people. Just sign up for something. Just put yourself out there. I wish I could do those things like a normal person. I live every minute in fear thinking everyone around me hates me. 

I've joined group therapy, to try to meet people like me. People are nice enough, but want nothing to do with me once the session is over. Some.of them are friends with each other. Not me though. Eventhough we all have social anxiety, I'm still the only one in there who is really, truly, completely alone.

lonely,yladas,2018/02/10,"I (23F) have no friends - in a literal way. Hey, so I'm 23F and I genuinely have no friends. I wouldn't say I'm the stereotypical loser but I only have 3 friends from school (none of which I have anything in common with - when we're together we just talk about other people we know lol)... and we only see eachother maybe 3 times per year. I went to uni for a science undergrad and made no friend (sat alone in lectures) and now I'm a masters research student, and again, I sit alone too much. The most interaction I have is with youtubers I follow and their vlogs they post... haha!

Is anyone else the same as this?

I'm not a nerd at all - to be fair, I would class myself a 7/10 in attractiveness but I genuinely feel my anxiety and depression have always held me back. 

I've tried for years to get involved in social groups (including uni) but it's so awkward and I've never met anyone I've ""clicked"" with.

Any advice?",1.9067632850241552,4.05725508695652,3.4031884057971027,88.87031400966184,79.65217391304347,6.480193236714977,23.809178743961354,7.594959193182576,1.1229599033816422,712,25,148,11,18,234,116,184,0.122,0.7390000000000001,0.139,0.7359,0,2,0,0,0,0,33.0,3,0,2,2,9,10,0,1,8,2,11,0,0,1,2,29,25,15,0,2,5,0,1,0,4,2,0,1,0,0,4,14,0,1,2,0,0,2,7,4,0,0,5,4,19,6,18,17,5,20,0,2,2,0,17,6,0,1,9,89,23,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15797633199802685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3348705988627585,0.0,0.0,0.13451751973979278,0.0,0.0,0.10993716267173252,0.0,0.12367262884923523,0.0,0.0,0.22607865889015394,0.1656440216977568,0.13303581710727402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243097489934798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13924109167084395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504964931445734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08174224945263908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4996052712974616,0.0,0.08446284360676899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888463865099788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529705233920883,0.0,0.0,0.16241336334000853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884174829204328,0.0,0.1246853553242928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459057351077983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207756310804193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15482956333666573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12856181726265756,0.0,0.16361274613038468,0.12882539327348155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16479623753926326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12993951646168947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426766333707982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10975934291319893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12832147388863452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498642825658423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11484157062566044,0.0,0.0,0.20821281873011696

I think several years of not having any connections has taken its toll on my health. I spent this period in my life in self-improvement but happy and outgoing people don't seem very relateable... I kept telling myself I am more of a fighter than a lover,
but really, I don't want to deny myself love either. 

There are so many awful things going on in the world and it's been hard to protect my innocence and happiness. I really believe if I make a few friends and talk to more people and finally be accepted and loved, my fighting strength will be replenished and maybe I will feel elated and whole again. That's my wish if things were to go to shit and I get caught in a stupid trivial crossfire. I want to feel love and friendship before that ever happens",5.611553911205078,6.304982755813953,6.287251585623679,77.83618393234673,67.37209302325581,9.74291754756871,30.752642706131077,9.800150414767053,2.9349813953488373,702,26,129,15,11,230,105,172,0.105,0.5429999999999999,0.35200000000000004,0.9958,0,0,0,0,3,0,13.0,0,0,0,1,4,14,3,0,5,1,13,7,1,1,1,31,35,16,0,6,7,0,3,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,8,11,0,2,6,0,1,4,4,3,0,0,6,3,21,11,18,25,5,18,1,0,0,4,8,9,1,3,5,91,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09504749429640333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13861297217218488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11893285100920105,0.15747143821317874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12642877166989158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14134248692271534,0.0,0.0,0.15310975552890804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10798493434811092,0.0,0.0730233658107366,0.0,0.2383012829968305,0.1172313363002716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12359698086186835,0.4463590719613372,0.12520528262794214,0.0,0.0,0.14856756943651545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987227511213439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784400680153353,0.0,0.09329667826370462,0.14170350250334193,0.14041642380578154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10363670415344224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19379600639821604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17907878894057708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12724015562111446,0.14580921415942302,0.15789882320578724,0.14347054001707807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11234076948709014,0.1221639856196788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18571219896791846,0.08955812561255759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532379757628194,0.16487837579844428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15604673819053844,0.160727082555113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000644649972106
lonely,chrissycookies,2018/02/10,"Hot pockets &amp; dunkaroos I have a big family, but that makes me feel more lonely than anything. I used to connect with them by taking care of them. I stopped that because no one ever reciprocated and because now I have more self respect than ever. Now my brother takes care of my parents. They’re tremendously over involved in my life. It’s interference rather than involvement as such though. 

I’m a single mom going through a divorce who is trying to start my career while dodging getting sucked back into the black hole of my family’s neediness. My daughter is 3. Not too many people my age who can relate to where I am in my life right now. 

I love my kid and love hanging out with her. She’s in school now; not a baby anymore. I love seeing her get more independent. I might be who my family groomed me to be and that makes for a great mom, but I’m not what my family is; I won’t let my daughter be my companion. 

I was at a play date with my kid the other day and the mom got a huge box. She said her step mom sends her stuff all the time. She didn’t know what it was until she opened it: it was a bag of meatballs. What I wouldn’t give to have someone think about what I’m having for dinner. I grew up on hot pockets and dunkaroos. 

I’d give anything to have someone ask me what I’m doing later today for a reason other than to figure out if I’m able to go out of my way to help them; to sacrifice my free time to give them some of their own. 

Basically, I need people my age to talk to in a setting other than a play date. I need people other than my family; people who can see me. I live in a big city and the anonymity sometimes adds to the loneliness. I’m surrounded by people, but I’m very alone.

lonely,Woodland_Corridor,2018/02/11,"How do I trust? I want trust, absolute transparency of mental states to a point where the information exchange is not inhibited by stress. 
Is this even possible? Is it preferable?
I just feel like everyone I talk to is so closed of, and I've adapted by keeping everything inside this little box of acceptable conversations and when they run out all there's left is dread, a roadblock.

I understand that developing a relationship is on me but I always seem to be the one asking questions, showing that I care for the other person. And I'm tired of being the person who writes first.

I want to fill this hole of loneliness in me but I don't know how. How do you feel something real? When does an interaction stop just being a balancing act? Can't we just settle for each other and enjoy each others company without desperately having to maintain the interest of the other person?

lonely,coilofariddle,2018/02/11,"An Overview of the Crooked Social Life of Mine (23F) Hello everyone, just got my account and as the title says I'm a 23 year old girl who is apparently forever alone. Just wanted to share my story with you. I'm not writing this to bore you but for the possibility of making a single person somewhere feel less lonely after reading this. Prepare yourselves, it's going to be long and may be full of grammar mistakes because English is not my primary language. 

It all started in kindergarten. Until that day, I was the most adored thing in my family, (well, not my own comment on myself, not being a snob here, heheh) I was a very beautiful baby even people in the streets wanted to take pictures of me (believe me it really doesn't matter when you're 23 anyway). My mother and my father did everything to make me happy, however I didn't end up being a spoiled child. I loved playing alone at home, and was very satisfied with my imagination. 

Kindergarten: 
This was the first place I faced bullying. We were 6 at that time but I looked like 4.5/5 and they were making fun of my small figure. It got worse after I had my first crush ever on this boy who of course was also the first one ever to ignore me. My mom taught me to read/write when I was 4 so I have evidence. I wrote on a notebook how he ignored me and laughed at something with a girl and never told me. I know it feels so stupid today but now that I know it was the start of everything, it makes sense. 

Elementary &amp; Middle School: 
Then the real nightmare started. Again lots of people were making fun of my height. My crooked teeth and braces were not helping and again a boy whom I had a crush on was totally ignoring me. I was that kid who'd always talk in classes that the teachers hated, and who'd annoy you as a classmate until you freak out. I don't know how I ended up like that. Maybe to ""earn"" hate before it comes to me with an unknown reason.
In 7th grade, bullying reached its top. Everything I did was a fuel to bullying; a single word I said, a single gesture I made. I had a male friend, we used to talk about anything and he once told me he wanted to hug and kiss me on my cheek, I told him I didn't want anybody to get us wrong. He laughed and said, ""me... and you??"". 
Then came the 8th grade. Girls were already transforming into their teenager phase, having boys to chase them, some receiving lots of romantic approaches (preteen romance *pukes*) ... while I was there all alone, being treated so badly by boys. They treated me like a boy who's being bullied. Let me underline this, even if you get bullied, thank god if it's in a way according to your gender. 
People didn't respect me, let alone love me. I was that person whom you can treat bad and not care about the outcome (even though I'd never ever do things they did to me to ANYONE). The school was like a bullying laboratory and I was the subject. 

High School: 
I wanted all this to be forgotten for good and prayed for high school to be the time of my life. My fantasies consisted of me finally getting rid of my braces and finding good friends and my first boyfriend, maybe? Nope, apparently not possible.
Whole 4 years I've only had a boy to flirt with me on the phone but ignore me in school. Sounds very pathetic, right? First he put very long time intervals between his messages then he eventually stopped texting me. 
Interestingly good things happened too, for instance, a guy whom I respected and liked his uniqueness, sense of humour, intelligence always put me on a different shelf then other girls, he always criticised my friendships and told me to stop hanging out with this and that. One day he watched me for a while and told me that I'll seriously be very beautiful in couple of years. Don't get this wrong though, those words were not flirty but sibling-like. 
And again another guy whom I similarly liked once told me if I was taller (I'm 5'0) all of the boys in school would have fallen for me. Somebody else was once creating the perfect girl of the classroom had chosen my face for her. So I assume I didn't look bad at all. Then why were all those things happening? Why nobody was asking me out? Why even those boys who complimented me have never seen me as a possible girlfriend?

University:
Not to make same mistakes and let people be disrespectful towards me, I acquired this extremely cold personality. No boy even to flirt with me in sight. Only good thing a boy has ever told me in 5 years is that I made him sing songs of victory every time I entered the classroom. I think my intense absence and quietness preciousized(?) me for him.
I never talked in classes, now people were making fun of my quietness during internships and stuff like that but at least they respected me. 

People say, ""people never change""... maybe inside they remain the same, but I learned myself to wear a shield totally different than my own personality to protect myself. I opened up my humorous side only to those who attempted to get to know me better. I believe they're lucky because I'm a fun person, I mean it. I'm a person you can talk about anything, I don't judge (at least I'll try not to), I'm not conservative, open to different adventures, I read books a lot, I've travelled many countries, I'm studying a third language, I'll be an engineer in couple of months. 
But if you don't know me you'll see a very cold person, who you'd never imagine laughing or even making a joke. You'll probably think I'm very annoying too. 
Bad thing is, as you age, less people will be likely to try to sneak through your shield. This pushed me through loneliness and here I am, an ""owner of a lonely heart"" and it's ""much better than an owner of a broken heart"".

lonely,teachinlady,2018/02/11,"Family makes my loneliness so much worse I've always struggled with loneliness, I've never had a group of friends, and it's been almost a decade since I've even had 1 true friend, in the sense that someone is more than a friendly acquaintance. I'm somewhat estranged from my family, more because of how they treat me than anything else, but I still make the effort to show up for holidays and family events. 
Last night was one of those events,  the baby of the family was having a birthday party (my cousin) and I went because I felt that was the right thing to do, even though I didn't want to go. I took my boyfriend with me as he has always been very supportive and helps me get through these type events without losing it. But the whole evening just reminded me that my entire family is very close knit and involved in each other's every day lives, except me. No one gives a shit about me. I hate myself. What's so wrong with me that even my family doesn't like me?

lonely,philboswaggins,2018/02/11,"I thought I was fine not having friends, but since moving in with my partner I’ve realized I’m definitely not. I’m not alone, because I have him and an amazing family. I’m just very lonely. Circumstances, like moving and travelling a lot among other things have left me without any actual friends since I dropped out of school when I was 17, and I’m 20 now and the loneliness is crippling me completely.

My boyfriend’s phone is constantly buzzing with texts and calls and he hangs out with people every weekend and a lot of weekdays. I sit home alone in our tiny apartment with nothing to do other than watching youtube on my phone. The apartment is too small to bring my video games and computer, which I would usually entertain myself with when I lived at home. 

I only really leave the apartment to buy groceries and work. I work a lot.

I’m a party animal, used to be and still is - when I travel I go out most nights, drowning myself in booze and drugs and good company - but now at home I have noone to go out with, so I don’t. 

I constantly reach out to my old friends, trying to establish a new connection again, but everyone always says they’re busy, if they reply at all. I get left on read most times. I took to Tinder the last couple of years, because when you go on dates and hook up at least you have stuff to do. At least you don’t end up sitting at home. I have a relationship now, so I don’t do that either, obviously. I never really cared about the people I would date. They were just something to keep me occupied. 

I’m just 20 years old. I’m an extrovert. I should have friends.

But I don’t. It’s been years, and it’s killing me.",3.1072020202020205,4.781108366666668,4.15909090909091,87.01308080808083,74.42424242424242,7.7979797979797985,26.16161616161616,8.515128840125781,1.7281313131313132,1291,46,268,24,27,419,165,330,0.104,0.8170000000000001,0.079,-0.8059999999999999,0,4,2,0,0,0,39.0,1,3,2,2,16,12,1,0,13,0,26,2,0,1,3,53,43,25,2,4,13,0,0,1,5,3,1,1,4,1,8,25,1,1,2,7,1,10,9,2,0,0,6,2,41,10,42,33,9,66,0,1,1,0,19,26,0,6,28,177,49,5,0.0,0.0,0.09424758456016863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20005430965279225,0.0,0.0,0.08036181629304243,0.0,0.0,0.06567731911422246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177478390131451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09861838854628256,0.0,0.09846915786692932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126168693642768,0.20873609039598331,0.0,0.0,0.1068632939688504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11200146810249928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554070199770533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137232884885952,0.09228577696938367,0.0,0.0,0.09104648413558816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29846808883114834,0.0,0.05045876206047269,0.0,0.16466493435275886,0.08100623736980538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3875081412808895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858442282282835,0.10685082150692507,0.0,0.0,0.07872511957900406,0.0,0.10226366340480596,0.2098676501548763,0.0,0.0,0.04718382739308065,0.0,0.08528139943871718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24632511375763666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052972833092356,0.0,0.0,0.0744880045245099,0.09327700802484992,0.0,0.09063324549804094,0.0,0.09267056060038067,0.0,0.20268771490347565,0.0,0.0,0.07345300280723448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391202208430206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660555821142916,0.0,0.12374250215540755,0.0,0.0,0.10369015586939734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07680383314490401,0.0,0.09774353164676046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15978299254656567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07435155784421868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07712845152377948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056033227869967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06416307681391188,0.0,0.0,0.07667327339761867,0.056316237900629375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10730329195764926,0.06557108820247064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08341361195220323,0.10636858918855488,0.07968813813504264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309911679524237,0.0,0.1406219395951749,0.0,0.0,0.13721450141625988,0.0,0.0,0.18658194472749176
lonely,alphabettiispaghetti,2018/02/11,"Being uninvited Has anyone else thought they were decently good friends with someone, and then they come up with some bs excuse for you not to hang out with them anymore? 
On Friday night I was supposed to be going out, this would have been my first purely social activity is about 3 months. An hour before I was supposed to be going I asked what the plans were, and they told me that they didn't know if they wanted to go out anymore. Okay, thats fine, sometimes you're just not in the mood.
What stung though was waking up the next morning and seeing on various social media that they did in fact go out, and actually everyone was there except you. 
This isn't the first time something like this has happened to me - I've had the ""oh, we forgot to invite you"" before. 
These people are the only 'friends' I have, but I feel like they don't even like me and I'm just tagging along. I find it really difficult to make friends, my social skills are quite poor and I'm really bad at keeping up with people I don't see regularly. The prospect of not really having any friends, and it being really difficult to make new ones, has really hurt me and I've kind of been in a bit of a depressive state all weekend. 
I'm at the stage in my life where I'm supposed to have loads of friends and a lot of social activity, but I almost have none. I know a lot of this is due to my poor social skills, but I was hoping I'd have a least a small amount. But really I'm more lonely than I've ever been.

lonely,huntsmeat,2018/02/11,"I must be too cool (Backstory: I'm 21 in community college) In  2016 one by one my close friends started hanging out with their new friends more and contacted me less, I never made any new friends at uni or at community college. Fast forward to 2018 I have zero friends in my contacts, 34 friends on Facebook ( all family) and I spend a majority of my days doing homework or watching tv alone .  My twitter feed is nothing but celebrities retweets. Smgdh...Thing is I don't feel like I should have no friends but whatever. I'm finally over the fact all my friends dropped me. Just kind of being a hermit rn ig... I fucking hate it . I need friends but admitting that now makes me feel terribly lonely and confused.

He thinks it's weird I don't hang out with people every weekend and that I enjoy being home. Because of that I reached out to an awesome friend, a guy that I swear is my male equivalent in every way. He has a crush on me and wanted to take things further but I had to tell him I only want a friendship. He stopped speaking to me and it hurts so much.

lonely,rantipoler,2018/02/12,"How do I stop asking myself ""what's wrong with me?""? I need to switch my brain off but I can't.

I'm 25, male and never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than six weeks. I've been out with plenty of girls two or three times but they all end up deciding that I'm not what they're looking for, which is fine and it's nobody's fault; but you can only hear it so many times before you believe there's something fundamentally wrong with you.

The latest time it's happened has crushed me. I just want to have someone who wants me around as much as I want them around, and it's devastating that every time I think I'm making that connection the other party doesn't feel the same.",5.3894366197183095,4.933711147887326,5.791654929577469,85.15396126760565,67.80281690140845,8.508450704225353,25.49647887323944,7.6454224807358475,1.0385042253521128,541,11,119,5,8,174,96,142,0.151,0.787,0.061,-0.9404,0,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,3,2,0,6,4,0,0,4,0,9,1,1,2,2,28,23,11,0,4,6,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,13,9,0,1,3,0,0,0,4,3,0,3,2,3,16,1,16,21,3,16,0,0,1,0,11,6,0,1,10,77,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3021764283958655,0.15866679275487294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14442058782804293,0.19121813258403444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18946544484316344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15032296865327452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14299777478000109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08581634457277416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15008425744760348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1912885872162081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13834576296810575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14252340524779591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11329049125548687,0.17207107166078076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476491030467494,0.12584642180353675,0.13089976710131798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12908093083894714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18221749046233796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14380456769807565,0.13065998569240675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14189486392555273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875075335361004,0.0,0.0,0.3958641379788421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16579334951001354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3003186052157548,0.0,0.1361404364947537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.371127870025588,0.0,0.0

lonely,welllwhynot,2018/02/12,"suicide notes and butterfly kisses this is a throwaway account

I picked up smoking when I was 25 as a passive aggressive way to kill my self, but it's not going as planed. I have been feeling really down lately. because of that I have been drinking a lot more by my self, in fact i am drunk right now. I am finding it hard to find a reason to keep going on. I really can't think of a reason my self. I have no real friends. I am estranged from my family. I have had girl friends and boyfriends alike, but I feel nothing. Why is suicide such a taboo thing? I pray for death every night but I always wake up in the morning and I am forced to go through the same routine. I have a job that means nothing to me. No real prospects in life. yes I have been to a therapist, multiple in fact. i am finding it hard for to find one real tangible thing to cling to. one real good reason to go on. when I die I will basically end up as a John Doe. some people in my life might be sad for a bit, but they will move on...

I don't even know Why I am telling you all this. you all mean nothing to me. I guess all I want to know is that I am not just yelling into the void, that there are some people who can hear me.

give me a reason to live...",0.9088295165394378,2.562117255725191,2.85452290076336,94.04084287531806,80.64122137404581,5.740712468193383,22.36704834605598,6.6274283507984215,0.3667552162849877,939,30,219,9,24,315,135,262,0.151,0.737,0.112,-0.9269,1,0,1,0,1,2,31.0,0,2,1,0,7,7,2,0,14,1,29,6,1,5,5,45,45,12,5,1,7,0,4,0,2,3,2,2,0,4,12,4,2,2,15,2,1,5,6,3,0,2,5,6,36,4,37,36,9,26,1,1,0,1,13,14,0,5,6,156,48,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07321483117585076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05363796235784589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09606242520260648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131985594745903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07700074969540709,0.0,0.0,0.08619682246576515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07793313223021292,0.0,0.0,0.05811664646472513,0.0,0.07413547370968099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08294925715509227,0.0,0.08898090011153915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3216855138169217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1359619017038275,0.0,0.0,0.08440814384153562,0.20002725880422995,0.07380194060813773,0.0,0.0,0.09693104070850768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15764373458414765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09917126368117817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08731662009573958,0.07820966432909167,0.09734803440857258,0.0,0.09671414105010766,0.0,0.09925669145693046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12430005227045265,0.0,0.0,0.07769689076684738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07480605611821729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19169407852767467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09334361566418417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09351957578669004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08257276993169466,0.0,0.253286688714964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924876925388088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12200254476040025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4006080943903895,0.11273745197033196,0.36187400519784574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07514308437277972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753786650341554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19249382663210216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07690724592666816,0.0,0.0,0.1021633147779714,0.11691345600063095,0.056380518008467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05189885436038831,0.0698424641278417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15879480025140666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,the_mighty_midget_,2018/02/12,"Cursed by loneliness (a rant). I'm interested to here what people think I should do Hi guys (19M) so I'm at university and have been living away from my parents for over a year and a half now. I've been suffering from various things like depression and anxiety for many years now and they were always bad when I lived with my parents due to a difficult relationship with them.

Since I move out to uni my mental state has been a very rocky road but I've made some close friends that I now live with and help me through most days.

Over the past couple of months I've been realising that my main problem at the moment is that I'm lonely.  I can be sat in a room with all my closest friends and still feel like I'm not ment to be there. However if I leave I feel even worse as I am alone. 

They know I struggle with this and they tell me to talk to them and ask for help but it's difficult as they are all in relationships and the main way I've found to feel less of a stranger to them/lonely is with physical interaction (hugs and cuddling) and I feel very uneasy about asking  them for this as I want hug etc a lot and don't want to make them/partners feel uncomfortable about anything.

I've got a job in which I promote a night club and work on the bar. I hate the promoting part of my job as I constantly get horrible comment and jokes made about me and some night people have tried to punch/kick me and once got spat on, just for doing my job. However when I work the bar it's nice as all the other people I work with I get on well with and it's one of the only aspects of my life were I feel like I'm wanted. Which is difficult as I want to leave my job due to the promoting but feel if I do I'll only get more lonely not having the bar work.

Most nights all I want is someone to cuddle with or talk to about my day but I don't want to burden my friends as I'm scared if I do I'll push them away (which has happened before in high school). I've tried various dating app and going out to meet ppl but it never works and I always end up alone in bed hugging my pillow.

I've thought about getting a pet cat (had one when I was with my parents, she help a lot as she would always cuddle into me at night) but I don't think my friends would want one and my letting agency won't allow pets.

Doesn't help these days I'm an insomniac so end up spending 7+ hrs a day alone anyway and the major lack of sleep really doesn't help

Don't really know what I'm looking for from this just wanted to share with people who may know how I'm feeling.",3.6060305745914616,3.8769611107011097,4.774889826041118,88.4107269372694,71.65682656826569,8.113104902477598,24.895308381655244,8.052868069273773,1.0875878123352654,1990,51,460,26,35,658,230,542,0.124,0.7240000000000001,0.152,0.9448,9,9,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,8,8,23,28,1,2,25,0,38,12,2,5,5,95,86,45,0,16,14,3,8,3,4,5,1,0,5,1,19,36,3,0,15,5,1,3,10,13,1,4,15,9,56,15,78,63,20,57,0,4,1,6,36,25,0,11,30,290,75,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1982787991282405,0.0,0.0,0.15929718742878698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048818181145266336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052514179400752564,0.0,0.11931652991537912,0.0,0.11991229356711733,0.0,0.05328272936046053,0.0,0.0,0.05430173223014273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0689611759431243,0.0,0.0,0.07060991133126553,0.0,0.16462118095860062,0.0,0.05496363180197679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130420214266049,0.0,0.07117041997695613,0.042149102742985764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2581336211986027,0.09117867489677392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06996968284508885,0.19721276132216892,0.0,0.13336248893895966,0.0,0.036267446573395326,0.0,0.10207712100986116,0.0,0.0,0.063186728715035,0.056431255975659934,0.0,0.0,0.06300394702101603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21386872454553324,0.06742388657699445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533055443121215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10521290841243358,0.0,0.0,0.1351414117466477,0.0,0.0652550017840462,0.045074311688698264,0.09353012839374868,0.0,0.16904902971630265,0.0,0.05358839695008606,0.0,0.0,0.1085061969994456,0.0,0.12076629712375275,0.04259690403491235,0.06469823588450377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06431035354360921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05093639981254026,0.06782508021529016,0.0,0.0,0.04921794190858154,0.0,0.0,0.2395436333881647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.067960726383427,0.12972776991633145,0.09706812924456253,0.0,0.0,0.21257649752446528,0.06910525755909466,0.06091848959049918,0.17696471172448094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061062187517911065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176284653595968,0.0,0.0,0.13702652126739434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06388979163531935,0.06458402924388865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052788298567915816,0.0,0.06386093051883095,0.0,0.05407011040496577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05096261701234239,0.0,0.0,0.06671313084759699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10258390901171986,0.055776986585258925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04239574690531351,0.08177995086774399,0.0,0.05066185810875184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866521805929103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10530785939481052,0.3011171879653441,0.050653252990681165,0.0,0.0,0.05737720879187514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23228983304922676,0.0,0.06503277809602945,0.09066446876689092,0.0,0.0,0.08218933482787537
lonely,ChaoticLint,2018/02/12,"It's a vicious cycle. So, I'm new to this sub and I was hoping to see if anyone could relate to this. 

I've realized over the past couple months what has been happening to me for the past year. I broke up with a girl for reasons I don't want to talk about right now, but this made me lonely (as well as question my decision to leave her). And being lonely did not help my self esteem, I just felt (feel) ugly and undesirable and I can't bring myself to actually make an effort to find someone who would love me or at least care about me. By pure luck, I met the most perfect girl I have ever met. It feels in inappropriate to say I loved her bc I had only known her for a couple months but oh my god was she perfect. Anyways, for some reason, whenever she tried to engage me or talk about having a real solid relationship, I would just shut her out bc of low self esteem issues. Eventually, she just stopped talking to me and left me for another guy. I don't blame her, I was a dick and didn't deserve her. But still, it hurt a fucking lot. Now I'm here lonely as ever with absolutely no one and I don't know how to go on in terms of personal relationships from here. 

Thanks for letting me rant.

lonely,DysfunctionalBee32,2018/02/13,"Valentine's Day I act like a badass when it comes to this stupid holiday. I act like it is the dumbest holiday in the world. But the fact of the matter is that I secretly wish my experiences with Valentine's Day were a little better. I am a hopeless romantic who is divorcing a narcissist who never cared to treat me the way I would have liked to be treated. The best he ever did for Valentine's Day was a heart shaped pizza that I told him we should order. He had to wait an hour to pick it up and of course told me alllll about how annoyed he was when he got home.

I am extremely lonely to the point that it physically hurts. I walk into the local grocery store and am bombarded with red everything. Balloons, flowers, stuffed bears, cards. All of these things I won't be getting. I tell people it's no big deal...it's just a stupid day. But damn it, I want that day to be special to me. I want one day to find someone who will love me and that I can give my love to. I know it's only been a year and a half but damn, just someone to hug would be nice.

lonely,Suerte13cr,2018/02/13,"Dealing with loneliness and regret Hey everyone. I hope everyone is well. Just wanted to talk. I feel alone and depressed. I have a lot of regrets over how my life turned out. I am currently 38 and I am kinda of overwhelmed with life. 

If I write it down, I can say my life seems good, I am married to an amazing woman, I have a job that pays decent and allows for a lot of flexibility and I own my house.

The problems come when I look at the details of each one of those items. My wife works in a small rural town, a place a I do not like and only chose to live in cause I love her. I did not know I didn't like this place until I lived here though. When we got married I agreed to move here and had been ok with it but lately its hard to deal with this place, I have no friends and I live far from anywhere, and going anywhere I just don't enjoy it.

My job is as a project manager in consulting firm, that allows for a lot of flex time and working from home. Something I am not used to because I spend all my time at home alone until my wife gets here. It feels like I am isolated. I can go out and walk. Right now I am just depressed. There is also no room for growth or improvement.

And my house, my depression started when I realized I have to pay off this thing for the next 15 years. I live in a place I dont like far from anywhere I cant get a new job since all jobs are far from 

I feel alone and sad. Sometimes I wonder if its me, and I can never be happy. Cause I have so much, but I dont feel happy with this. I am almost 40 and I am starting to feel worn down. What is worse is that job that would have been my dream job was available in another company and I went for it, but realized that my life would change so much that it would be so risky. I decided to not go.

So here I am just trying not to think. Life feels more like a burden than something I can enjoy. 

If anyone wants to talk please let me know.

lonely,nilinilin,2018/02/13,"not depressed, dont want a relationship, just venting First things first, I really miss my ex gf turned best friend. I miss the affection greatly. I long for the touches and the feeling of having someone be deeply in love with me and I can return the feelings. I miss the little things about her love that made me so happy and thankful. I'd do anything for her. I still deeply love her and I can't let go at all. I have friends to hang out with and vent to but they only exist online and they're not on that often or if they are I don't want to bog them down with this business, which is why I'm venting here. I don't look for acceptance, pity, or advice. I just want to talk about this some place other than my prayers. I miss her so much guys. I'd do anything to have her back, I swear. She is such a sweetheart and I should have never treated her the way I did. It makes me feel undeserving and unworthy of her love, even though I've grown and helped myself. Now it's all gone. I miss hearing, ""I love you"". I miss her hugs, cuddling before and after sleeping, her kisses, her kindness, the feeling of having her hand in mine. I miss the sex, the things we would do for each other, the time spent together, the new experiences and places to go. I miss making out with her, showering with her and washing each other's backs. I miss the silliness of her personality. I'd sacrifice my well being just to hear her say something endearing, to get a kiss on the cheek, or just a hug from her. I don't want anyone else. I miss her. She says there's a chance we won't get back together, and it deeply saddens me. She still means everything to me. I'm going to be going to college now and working, but I'm wondering what it will all be for if my purpose is drained? Why should I experience the good and bad in life anymore if I don't want to? I told her previously that if I ever got to this point that I'd write a suicide note for her and only tell her, but I really don't want to do that now. I kind of want to fade away peacefully without telling anyone or making anyone feel guilty. I don't even cry anymore thinking about taking my own life. I feel disconnected and like I shouldn't care. The only thing I have cried about has been reminiscing the good times had with her, and how important she is to me. It's all gone, and may not come back. I just want another hug.",2.3773848238482387,4.02480631893004,3.649387734618088,90.01094399277328,76.34567901234568,6.6344675298604825,23.376292281441327,7.407850130929222,0.8123432299508182,1845,56,402,23,41,602,216,486,0.127,0.6679999999999999,0.205,0.9909,1,0,1,0,0,2,59.0,2,1,3,4,30,40,0,0,22,0,40,18,3,6,6,90,98,34,1,16,20,1,8,1,4,7,3,4,1,2,22,32,0,0,10,0,1,9,15,13,1,2,9,13,78,27,51,77,10,44,1,12,1,12,54,14,0,12,21,285,100,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718352311148705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07708390850261625,0.0,0.0,0.14580861712299714,0.1542042327427601,0.07532189430505074,0.1209884866623696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06906709338531249,0.2261052509787276,0.0613795822778328,0.0,0.0,0.0625534330026686,0.0,0.07714647567872185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07495054557287402,0.0,0.0,0.06332421588859458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16149930990274813,0.0,0.0,0.06331591494975893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08615570302331024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06140997608811063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09710817560594877,0.0664959565936111,0.0,0.0,0.06606798854458526,0.1438179950346765,0.0,0.0,0.223019738729713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1250588100233357,0.0,0.0,0.11359062359515028,0.0,0.07681413809743595,0.0,0.16711461651290924,0.1233170226534808,0.0587943891286326,0.08104741497372032,0.0,0.07278859511482932,0.0,0.07825506035868578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657070921058908,0.0,0.049273650702431865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15310320277913625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517116332287996,0.10384762402829067,0.03591432771372796,0.07367849579647184,0.0,0.0650559475470823,0.061731699168094976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3317379686555401,0.06955898242890345,0.14720981117375245,0.0,0.0,0.08007629213251617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054039895386106485,0.0,0.05669710901043198,0.07099850138167801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16772792883456855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06418798186579898,0.1536091200737812,0.0,0.06949275161798106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09418754306433633,0.0,0.0,0.07892454775992114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691963902195306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07356524874321244,0.0,0.06228661388423318,0.05659325158592494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741381049912923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041037059406507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05527199497297918,0.059086288926473926,0.1285057345376906,0.06768011946700977,0.0,0.0,0.19535284822221607,0.047103623286692216,0.07222532311445698,0.0,0.08573106232853303,0.0,0.0,0.0702440183536382,0.0,0.0,0.07996011959755857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34687500876604377,0.058350530216804974,0.0,0.0,0.06609625952319745,0.0,0.1326665790797543,0.0,0.0,0.07086309812444964,0.07972080076969996,0.05351772738026955,0.0,0.0,0.05222092868691293,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,TheKillingTaco,2018/02/13,"A depressing last two weeks Hey, name’s Jeremie. The last two weeks have been really shitty in general. From problems with work productivity to a full blown mental breakdown and screwing things up (but are now somewhat mending) with the perfect girl, not many people are talking to me. I feel hated and distant from everyone else, like I’m alone in my own little bubble.

That being said, I welcome any conversation with any sex. I’m pretty big on videogames, add me on playstation. I also love reading and deep thinking. 

Last note; for people who post on here, (and i know this is somewhat ironic) you’re not truely alone. No one ever is and I’m so glad we have a platform to put ourselves out there for this. Chin up, people. :)",2.8361557177615566,5.552082299270077,3.5617810218978114,85.79386374695865,80.02189781021897,5.405158150851581,25.191727493917274,6.742157984588678,1.1477137712895376,573,22,102,6,15,181,97,137,0.124,0.713,0.163,0.7942,0,2,0,0,0,0,24.0,1,0,0,2,6,9,2,0,5,0,8,3,0,0,2,24,17,8,0,1,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,11,0,0,3,1,0,1,3,4,0,3,2,2,8,5,18,14,4,22,0,1,0,3,10,13,1,2,8,66,13,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32364647892650594,0.0,0.12494948738165335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2125046255043666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13457403902938828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13052308452673894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14133301974749715,0.0,0.14929929189216534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07900243050516703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15426010522664882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08586845264096406,0.38208286238422223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07633366971474002,0.15659906007531796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14101768371129134,0.0,0.0,0.15840843546187644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15745873669614682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587600927836316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3249629151358895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496400196906421,0.1589578670108856,0.0,0.14950586300157198,0.0,0.15706990477221766,0.0,0.0,0.15628780411740684,0.0,0.10009488219889054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14862527115354016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12558423199605506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380258202862297,0.10011582149036063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30525834299027393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.250661466103326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374860078941305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,lyricalyre,2018/02/13,"If anyone wants to become online friends with me lol I'm so lonely all the time and I just want someone to talk to. I know this sounds kind creepy lol but we could skype/facetime because I really need to socialize more, or we could chat on instagram and text each other pictures of memes and gifs. Maybe we could troll some weirdos on Tinder and catfish some peeps.

PM me because I'm bored and lonely. Feel free downvote if you think im creepy because I don't give a shit about that. Made a Reddit account to share my feelings and thoughts with the internet, not to gain karma smh.

lonely,CnotX,2018/02/13,"Running on empty I get by okay, but that seems to be all life ever is, just okay. I've got friends and family that love me, but never a girlfriend. I always feel empty, like I'm just along for the ride waiting for it to end. I can't remember the last time I was truly happy.

20 year old male, part way through my 2nd year of university, silently wishing I'd get hit by a bus so I'd have some change to this monotony. Managing decent grades but I just have no motivation for anything, which leads me to being lazy. This is part of the reason I haven't even tried to get a girlfriend; who would want a lazy guy with no motivation? How can I care for and love someone else when I don't even give a shit about myself?

I really just want someone to hold, someone who won't judge. But if I found that, would that fill the emptiness inside me? God I hope so.

Not sure why I wrote this here, guess I'm just bored af and there's no way I'd say any of this to anyone I know. I don't know what I'm looking for here, I don't know anything anymore.",1.5208120981186042,3.0464443438914053,3.0956370564420084,93.5855084543939,78.41176470588233,5.919599904739224,21.58633007859014,6.5966054737557815,0.20690407239818984,804,22,187,7,19,265,125,221,0.113,0.65,0.237,0.9867,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,3,16,12,1,0,9,2,16,4,1,5,4,43,42,12,0,7,11,0,1,1,3,3,1,1,0,2,13,5,0,2,10,0,0,4,11,2,0,0,4,3,20,10,22,32,4,16,0,0,1,2,12,1,1,5,10,112,33,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10704174749170177,0.0,0.0,0.08748203229902833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12757984414419493,0.08995056839062304,0.0,0.211725377775256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13116068324882954,0.0,0.1360878291446126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10746518735049704,0.0,0.11394001088915195,0.0,0.0,0.16993571646706246,0.11636546516692828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12127369955540225,0.0,0.06504604933423201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14105102376386927,0.09938969548203404,0.0,0.20163285188298824,0.12340662505425642,0.0,0.0,0.10288800688997178,0.0,0.1417153849430751,0.1273773498913484,0.0,0.13694346193042714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12777208192881795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21209740906792765,0.10486167137513246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086475099820863,0.06284874546743482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10802819084386904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2322116712873501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09921784423585314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349897762343525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27861687890615705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08241235875885296,0.1322670054212157,0.0,0.0,0.1457280761222587,0.0,0.0,0.10230252243071053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11711226567496096,0.0,0.0,0.13205076586861694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32699781323281385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12124503303701045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501309446590598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08734053297813088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15175460966945914,0.20422254041436844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11608080383795802,0.0,0.14793374545537136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1827693883776825,0.0,0.0,0.16568447002410502
lonely,AbjectConstant,2018/02/13,"Are there others out there like me? I'm a 35 y/o male, and it seems no matter where I am at in my life I always feel disconnected from people, even though I feel such a strong desire to connect with another person... to really connect. I've been married for years, to someone who has their own demons because really that's the type of person I feel most connected to... but of course those demons cause (and always have caused) problems in our relationship, so it becomes a catch 22. I worry that's the closest connection I'll find, so I don't move on. 

The same goes for my friendships that have sort of endured... I feel I can relate most to those who are some-what self-destructive or who live a life of some degree of hardship. I come from an economically sound family, and my parents were always extremely supportive, yet I have always found it so difficult to relate to other economically sound or professionally stable individuals.

I've never really tried to put it into words before, so if this sounds vague or brooding, I apologize for that. 

Throughout my life I've always found myself browsing Missed Connections or other types of personals, never communicating with anyone, but just browsing in some drawn-out hope that I might come across a familiar thought... someone speaking words that connect with me. I never do find them, but I always search. 

After browsing through r/lonely, and reading how other people feel, it seems maybe what I'm feeling is loneliness. So here I am, taking part in something so that at least we can be lonely together :)",7.8328124999999975,7.851067211805558,7.9418055555555584,70.18375000000002,62.64583333333333,10.533333333333337,33.625,10.125756701596842,3.400641666666667,1239,45,209,24,16,403,161,288,0.095,0.8059999999999999,0.098,-0.4718,1,4,1,0,0,0,46.0,2,0,2,1,16,8,0,0,9,0,17,3,0,3,3,53,36,20,0,4,9,1,6,1,0,1,3,4,0,4,23,12,0,0,13,1,0,5,5,4,0,0,5,10,26,4,34,29,8,23,2,2,0,0,15,12,0,14,7,149,49,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4943387715425249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10382760405011576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06923475267008887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060359638418833475,0.10935612438402996,0.08425588686328851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2034347755591294,0.0,0.17058817441364946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06539957173098816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09334409714502956,0.0,0.3003947980583133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18099887136862744,0.0,0.0,0.2171333193081266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0983458876220534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20981519097702536,0.048374539771299824,0.0,0.08743352705434222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09947554622239924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10504103143606047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523904211550666,0.0,0.0,0.2291032629042773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1099462858711116,0.10722539638110158,0.0,0.13729137283005186,0.25937259132541224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474557351741593,0.0,0.09953909439533612,0.0,0.0,0.099043457812257,0.0,0.19029782838668385,0.0,0.0,0.1063068395704587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1802821014632946,0.1032959737162184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16779299362525474,0.07622786430675825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123629352012376,0.0,0.0,0.07444820742217159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09728336816840308,0.0786081697542147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06722581421114182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055622714903988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0637634842593695

lonely,malaptivedaydream,2018/02/13,"I am tired of everything being out of my control. I’m sorry if this is too long. I need to let it out. (I’m in early high school btw, and I’m a gay guy)
So, I feel like I don’t have a lot of fun. I’m involved with a lot of afterschool stuff this time of year, and I never feel lonely whenever something like this is going on, but I realized I don’t really have any close friends. I think I am an asshole sometimes without meaning to be, but I’ve matured a lot over these past few years and I’m getting better.
One of my old friends boyfriends hates my guts, and won’t even let me be around her. He doesn’t even want me to talk to her.
The worst part is, she is one of the few people in my life who I have the most chemistry with. But she doesn’t care about me like she used to, and now we’re involved with afterschool stuff together, and we are reconnecting, but I feel like it will end the same as last year, and I’ll be depressed all summer. And the other friends I do have aren’t very social. I’m just so pissed that her boyfriend won’t let me around her. I don’t even want in her pants.
Plus, I just have a lot of anxiety about hanging out with other people. It makes a lot more difficult sometimes.",2.787596899224809,3.4209393875968988,3.9953488372093036,91.94713178294576,73.72868217054264,7.283720930232557,25.18604651162791,7.3871296695380915,0.8780837209302326,934,28,221,10,18,306,126,258,0.113,0.7440000000000001,0.14300000000000002,0.6098,1,2,1,0,0,0,29.0,1,0,0,2,13,16,2,0,12,0,29,5,2,3,2,49,49,17,0,4,8,0,3,4,3,3,2,0,0,1,13,20,0,1,6,0,0,2,10,6,0,2,0,3,31,10,32,39,13,27,0,2,0,1,19,12,1,7,17,155,44,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0702982245949208,0.0,0.07908123174915488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840504949952521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09142637027317001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053972218836061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594332440671228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08903633036579885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09155914952289343,0.0,0.0,0.20483370440114404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09290636105199178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15680780378352946,0.14770156836930412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396007140598088,0.0,0.05400892478482176,0.0,0.05875012710707825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10235703624671368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1020609457090264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922086556149883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426403836310642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31712237927422593,0.07301648699243321,0.2020142929133948,0.0,0.0,0.09148320517295397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4394266393087777,0.0,0.0,0.0690033008349401,0.0,0.0,0.11260516738068672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0766509034118928,0.07972880961515272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10847417873539746,0.0,0.14009851243094662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1119445411506428,0.0986826850180975,0.14333376470605205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06622437034411903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046205422674866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10537731407099334,0.0,0.0795827628595039,0.2044801049545197,0.11571932183671588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2366782071692091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308853066596339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0662382241132888,0.0,0.0,0.06027851918550869,0.11881381409701827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892824023022544,0.0,0.08529481269516677,0.12194595111134235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09964935704331224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19970942225883206

lonely,sorryalps,2018/02/14,"Just looking for uplifting words in a heavy period Litttle bit of background: I had a nearly 3 years long distance relationship and even if admittedly it's not a good idea most of the times, it was hell worth it for her. We were happy together and we loved each other, even if we could physically meet only every couple of months. Until she left me somewhere at the start of september. Admittedly she did that in the nicest way someone could do such thing, because she still clearly cared about me, but it felt horrible anyway. I never cried so much in my life, also because I never usually do that and just buckle up and go forward, but that was too much to just ignore. After something like a week I managed to put myself together and just go forward normally, but I think about that still pretty much every day. It also hurts that she couldn't just give me a reason for that, she said she just changed and didn't feel the same. I guess she just was fed up with the distance and I can completely understand that. 
Still I tried to not think about it and in the last months tried to look out for someone I could try to get out with, but never got together to ask anyone actually for multiple reasons. 
I had a bit of a crush on a girl in the last weeks but I never really got around to ask her out because I didn't really have time (exams period yay) and also because she clearly is WAY out of my range. I mean, I wouldn't call myself straight ugly, but I'm not the nicest guy around, while she is just gorgeous. I also wanted to know her better as a person first too. But that doesn't really matter anymore since she went out with someone else today so I guess she isn't single as i thought/anymore. Long story short, I'm heartbroken completely right now and have no clue what to do next.

lonely,CockitoMagic,2018/02/14,"Another Valentine's day post I've felt lonelier than ever on this valentine's day. I've lost some good friends recently because I'm a worthless, romantically unsuccessful loner and they started mocking me really hard about it, despite me telling them to stop and that I genuinely feel awful (for the record, I never made fun of any touchy subject for them). They told me that I deserve feeling shitty for today. I'm 18 and I've never had a girl my age tell me anything positive - no girl ever thought that I'm even remotely attractive, and I never had a girlfriend, nor romantic experience. I feel like a disgusting, unloveable piece of shit that will stay alone for life, which will, I'm 90% fucking certain, happen. Besides that, my family has been very shitty to me today, and I'm stressed because I have a difficult, lengthy math test tomorrow. However it would be unfair not to mention some good things that happened to me. A girl sat near me on a school break yesterday (on the floor). It made me really happy that whole day. So yeah, sorry for rambling and clogging up this subreddit, but I have to take it out during this shitty day.

Edit: I don't even have an imaginary girlfriend, since I'm 100% certain that *every* girl would be unhappy with me, no matter if she were imaginary or real. I used to have imaginary girlfriends, but then reality hit me like a brick, and I've faced the truth, despite it hurting me.",6.2589574187884125,7.048480764925376,6.84928007023705,74.03531606672522,65.97761194029852,10.037225636523267,35.540825285338016,10.056822442137396,3.7393662862159793,1127,53,196,25,17,370,153,268,0.175,0.703,0.122,-0.875,1,1,0,0,1,0,41.0,0,0,4,1,6,21,4,1,12,2,16,4,2,3,8,37,39,14,0,3,5,0,5,2,4,4,1,0,0,4,18,9,0,1,5,0,0,0,8,10,0,0,11,5,27,11,22,21,4,28,0,3,0,1,17,7,2,4,20,123,45,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274273295624485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08059225172714557,0.1242702080834928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09752531173694484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14448768022292546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3057218483597109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15655217053180476,0.21440185177736526,0.09985150579618016,0.0,0.0,0.1159275166262709,0.11172260480921363,0.0,0.17976974622224165,0.08466502566106929,0.11379014438312003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09156210877672306,0.1095624720856574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1988045541938851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095996126583175,0.12615827120429562,0.10616351046196236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12686959085126362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370855926781402,0.11579799376707132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.129369892234179,0.0,0.0,0.2242779171017896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2742113758108045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11350177537773587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348926480717796,0.15184369608192289,0.0,0.11701634293747736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11994051239326685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12165090686586788,0.09803438485844702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326645270047547,0.08388343248977896,0.1263180670143354,0.0,0.09908137276617288,0.13575514238008501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910630571163586,0.0,0.2071694946602103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07873413391283159,0.0,0.0,0.09408532250925898,0.0,0.0,0.22467111494787484,0.11324333375144092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10235635227788467,0.0,0.09778484528392033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323144612969324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16837510708258008,0.0,0.0,0.0

I have no hobbies/interests anymore because I can barely get off my bed to do anything. My mind is going crazy as I am thinking about suicide every second.
I know I sound unhealthy. I know I am in no condition to hold a conversation or make friendships.

lonely,Echelon906,2018/02/14,"Of course I've been super depressed lately and loneliness has been a big factor in that.  My roommate had mentioned something about having to buy herself treats for Valentine's Day, so I mention about maybe doing a friend thing and getting stuff for each other so it's still a surprise aspect. I thought it was going to be our plan, come to find out yesterday, that she made a friend date with one of our mutual friends instead. They exchanged gifts this morning and are going to my favorite restaurant for lunch, as I sit home alone. Can't help but feel extra unwanted today.

lonely,intensifrying,2018/02/14,"Happy valentine's Day to everyone that feels lonely ❤️ Today might not be the best of days for a lot of people but take it all in stride. Use this day to treat yourself and love yourself :D On a day celebrating love, Why forget yourself &lt;3

Don't forget, pornhub premium membership is completely free for today so go give yourself some extra love.

Another great thing: Don't forgot to go buy all the discount valentine's chocolate tomorrow when it's all reduced :)

Remember, there's always someone that loves you no matter what, even if it is just a stranger on the internet ❤️

Have a great day everyone, i love you all &lt;3

Edit: also, a lot of adult toy websites have great deals on for today, so maybe treat yourself :)

I've replied to some comments with some outside perspective, Some of it is truthful but i only mean the best for everyone so please don't think I'm being mean.

lonely,Chloe_Zooms,2018/02/14,"Ill and alone I've never been the kind of person to have somebody really take care of me when I get sick. Dad would do his best to help me get everything I needed to get better, but I rarely had that whole doting mother who makes you chicken soup type treatment.

More often than not, people in my life tend to avoid me when I get sick or hard to deal with. They stay away until I get better and I guess until it's easier to be around me again. I feel like I'm in some kind of social quarantine, and I'm just so so lonely. I turn the TV on as soon as I wake up every day so it's not so quiet in here, but living alone is hard. Living alone when you're sick is even harder.

I appreciate that it makes me stronger, and anyone who goes out and buys their own medicine and comfort food can easily be called independent, but I feel like I'll never stop wishing for that mother figure who will fuss over me and make me chicken soup.

I'm tired of being left alone as soon as things get hard...",4.715289855072463,4.355900879227054,5.502717391304351,86.33494565217394,69.19323671497585,8.252657004830919,23.047101449275363,7.492282038375204,0.7141275362318842,770,12,171,7,12,252,122,207,0.163,0.6759999999999999,0.161,0.1626,0,8,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,1,2,3,15,11,0,1,2,0,12,8,1,4,2,34,33,24,0,3,7,3,5,2,0,2,6,1,0,1,10,10,1,2,3,1,1,0,4,2,0,0,2,6,23,9,28,26,5,23,0,1,0,0,15,10,0,4,14,109,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4618766953490286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07795583145530169,0.0,0.0,0.0992490130674514,0.0,0.0,0.10474776071876256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1170010228982511,0.19720625077776785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11384292465745367,0.0,0.11367065600414653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07190130202388284,0.11494045581040005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07363755620538827,0.0,0.09393444811760164,0.0,0.10019929196426618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11274456514187473,0.15929579422805998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13481316686284592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3494909904066959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12281790833460945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29961723719502964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07472885162148436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.232197662648354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12113332734800117,0.0,0.07874810955372158,0.10893596997764493,0.0,0.19689398851670986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22325969315456345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08266781911730421,0.17197466744223136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729256412314968,0.09734805731565332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142282771732575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11364918547504853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118832638703459,0.0,0.09320995207145752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083825993249478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07406846154344232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281404191628271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126821998896847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12447369522173572,0.12820706231882606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791987193103967,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,kkrrcc,2018/02/14,"I broke up with her, but she moved on first. It’s been almost two months now since I broke things off with her. The relationship itself couldn’t even make it to six, and yet I seem to spend more time mourning the loss than learning from it and moving on.

We weren’t good for each other. She had alcoholic tendencies, and I was ill-tempered. In the end, those things were what tore us apart. They fed off each other until things ended in violence.

What a mess it’s been to clean up... Despite me being the one to end things after it reached a physical point, I miss her terribly. I don’t even think about the fact that her hands had been around my neck; I only think about when they were around my waist. Or how her palm felt forced against my cheek in the heat of the moment; I can only remember her fingertips gently grazing it while we lay together all those countless times.

Somehow, she’s okay. Somehow, she’s better. She’s happy. She enjoys being single again. But I still feel alone, abandoned, isolated in a city of almost a million people. There has to be something better out there, something more to live for besides counting down the days until graduation.",4.157891865079364,5.997284084821434,4.224047619047621,86.94317460317465,71.99107142857143,6.942063492063492,24.49801587301588,7.594959193182576,1.1353986111111118,921,27,177,11,18,284,137,224,0.16399999999999998,0.708,0.127,-0.8562,1,1,3,0,0,0,32.0,3,0,2,4,16,14,0,0,12,1,16,7,5,2,2,32,24,11,1,1,3,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,18,12,3,1,7,0,1,2,3,8,0,5,11,3,30,6,34,9,6,36,0,6,0,0,18,16,0,6,18,140,48,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435375418682524,0.2689859984264946,0.1391056215516662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23913041363915274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23757421289753625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08661944115494402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3568788657442623,0.0,0.0,0.17742221036297345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06791164381559131,0.0,0.1289595593941223,0.0,0.0,0.11424481183613215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126536390887624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14297648673028304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185990154004472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0896535913774738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10720570610695826,0.2855025342584628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09101256486353508,0.20429903515840644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931142903025048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696724574765872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14419967863761882,0.15214810585487584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12227162993539785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110339252451608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20679823764267188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072608853781136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35692086599312856,0.17212204652144247,0.0,0.0,0.15663557141487872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13120226636278762,0.0,0.16155951631661994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,omgimabagel,2018/02/14,"I'm paralyzed by my own self esteem, but it's probably for the best. I have a huge crush on this girl I think is just perfect for me, in every way.  All I do though is convince myself she would never wanna be with me the way I am, and that she's just being nice every time I think I see a sign.  It feels like the one for me is right there, but I can't do anything about it.  I don't know how many more times I have to feel this pain before I decide I want to make a change... why am I so lazy that I can't just go to the gym like everyone else and actually be fit and healthy so that I could feel like I might be worth someones time.  It hurts so much and it's just even worse because of tomorrow, the day that I told myself i'd ask her out if I was ever going to.  Of course i'm backing out of it, why would I gamble our friendship on whether or not she feels the same way when there's no way she can.  I'm so sick of being alone... alone for 21 and a half years and still counting, it's so sickening to think i'm so bad that for 21 years no one has felt that way about me, I feel like I should just give up on it.  

I'm sorry for this, I just have to put it out somewhere or i'm gonna cry all night.

lonely,throwaway3245490,2018/02/15,"[31M] Incredibly Lonely for Years I'm a 31 year old guy from Orange County, NY. I've been lonely for at least 7-10 years and its only intensified the past 2 years.

I've never had a GF, I think I'm ugly but I know being ugly isn't the problem, lack of self-confidence and a crippling fear of public humiliation and rejection are. I used to try though, at least online, put up my best pictures, wrote a nice profile, seriously its not bad, just generic. I would send out hundreds of first messages and in the entire 10+ years I've been on dating sites probably got about 5 return messages. Even went on 3 dates that went nowhere. I just don't even try anymore though because my job situation has gone to shit. I was laid off a year and a half ago and live with my parents. Real appealing.

I never had a large friend group, I only had about 3 close friends from high school and I never went to college. My so-called work friends basically disappeared after I got laid off. I thought working together for 12 years made us closer than it did. I picked up 1 other friend along the way in my mid-20s but he has 3 kids and works in the city, not much time to hang out. But over the last few years all but one has had kids and 2 moved over an hour away. The 1 that's left I just never hang out with, he claims I'm his only real friend but I constantly check his Instagram and see place after place, activity after activity with his other friends that I know nothing about and was not invited too. When we do hangout its just not the way it used to be, we were inseparable when we were in high school into our early 20s.

I sit at home day after day, mostly on Reddit, I talk only to my mother (before she becomes too drunk to talk to). My brother and father are too stupid to talk to and share almost nothing in common with me.

I have a part-time job where I work 1 day a week and its not a conducive job for talking to people for the most part. My co-workers are also generally retired elderly folks and very young (like 17) so we share pretty much nothing in common there either.

Where I live the county has a population of probably close to 400,000 people, which would be the population of a very decent size city but it has none of the activities of a city, nothing. I've tried to find groups I would be interested in joining, hobby groups, whatever, they don't exist here or I've never found them. Its a very boring place to live but I have neither the means to move away or the desire, since I would lose the very small tenuous grasp on any social life I have now.

I'm just at wits end right now, my sleep pattern is fluctuating wildly which doesn't help any of these thought and all of my so-called friends have happy healthy relationships, are having kids and moving up the career ladder while I have no future, no relationship, no anything to show from 12 years of working.

I know what to do to fix the situation, expect for the GF, that I have no idea how to fix but it all seems like a monumental challenge that I don't have the strength or willpower to overcome.",5.306142506142507,5.4069100389610405,6.0935573885573895,81.02785538785542,67.92857142857143,8.737381537381538,28.823973323973327,8.441846121484758,1.881235222885223,2408,75,492,32,37,793,286,616,0.119,0.779,0.103,-0.8042,5,4,0,0,0,0,67.0,6,0,2,10,26,28,2,1,35,0,44,4,2,5,8,94,68,36,0,8,22,4,0,2,9,4,1,0,1,4,20,32,1,0,12,3,1,12,21,11,0,3,22,1,51,17,80,38,16,101,0,4,1,0,49,42,1,7,46,315,71,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05068327972356637,0.0,0.05725373711380299,0.0,0.0,0.04572381195771932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07776359663668314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056703458288944374,0.0,0.0,0.04705116708647622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10743790390959003,0.0,0.04773976534662548,0.03485410024857605,0.06314665597611434,0.04865276208065288,0.0,0.0600029278392699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0617871944074085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106218184256511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05064117061933935,0.0,0.0,0.07552872379747615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433915677621231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05225804008124128,0.04863407360788136,0.0,0.06269078706169111,0.3092195042990249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145811152621004,0.0,0.0,0.05661345877141044,0.0,0.0608651619979969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03832402298956703,0.12081965629680295,0.05735242241615868,0.0,0.056307071102922976,0.0,0.0,0.06454500625011096,0.0,0.0,0.17021576303812966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09426768522058616,0.04660626017232338,0.0,0.0,0.062122143206505415,0.0,0.04038526346167103,0.05586683760323951,0.0,0.15146298073686465,0.0,0.0,0.06396557833271556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054101533045218766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06228167827748096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823078577031447,0.08406221839084181,0.0,0.2204891740496248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21944854606779327,0.0,0.059996837255007936,0.0,0.03874409443786518,0.1739404031434653,0.0,0.0,0.06348743912479493,0.12383257463298915,0.05458118293165719,0.07927760001938951,0.0,0.1792109788454605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05816878302353955,0.12329129681330588,0.05470993206702957,0.0,0.05747790519608235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13015813864367687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277175081095082,0.0,0.04882818959905871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573079826240315,0.045562054157219666,0.05205109409224876,0.05964727949821495,0.0,0.05869058035524325,0.047296769833829036,0.1285369603918,0.057217523846450964,0.05828396800412136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18382435747344594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03663622069801301,0.11235071499708242,0.09078308289254436,0.033339920594076734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11645672485056792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06877596699853973,0.09876381316020068,0.0,0.18870551704111246,0.0,0.090767663024891,0.04586332437742192,0.0,0.0,0.15900881926288676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2497498665390675,0.0,0.0,0.16246541857593824,0.0,0.0,0.33137656846748303

lonely,Pobrecita23,2018/02/15,"I'm so lonely I give myself a headache Why and how in the world do shitty fake people find others to love, and stay by their side? I do not care to lie. I try to be as nice as I can to everybody I meet. I give my love away full force 100%, and all I ever get in return is dumped, left, used, made into a joke, hurt, broken. All I've ever wanted in this life was to be loved. For someone to never give up on me. I want at least one person in this world that I know I can always count on. I want to know that someone in this world truly gives a damn about me. About who I am inside. Someone who is actually interested in me, solely for me. Someone who wants to know if I'm ok. Someone who wants to know my stories, my dreams, my thoughts, my heart. I want someone I can hug and feel safe I won't ever lose them, safe that they have no hidden intentions to harm me. I've lost every friend I've ever had, and idky. How do they all just grow up, still all friends, just minus me. Don't they ever wonder how I am? Don't they ever want to see how I am after I've been here in the same home I've lived in since I was a teenager while they're all moving in life? Does anyone see my pain? Doesn't anyone see how the man I waited 10 years for, dropped out of high school for, became an alcoholic with, a single teen mother, and now just recently a drug addict because of, broke me &amp; killed me inside. I wasted my whole life on what I thought would be my forever. How could someone lie so much? Hurt someone so much that they said they loved? How am I so unlucky? How can the ones i cry to, do the same exact thing to me that he did? How can they sit there, pretending to listen to me? Telling me they won't leave me like everyone else? That they won't make me look like a fool? That they love me? Then they leave me too. After they get what they want.... How can I believe that my soul is so pure, and good and all I want is love, but here I am the only person I know that has no one. That everyone hates. People don't even know me, but they hate me. How am I the least evil person I've ever come across, and the loneliest? How is it, I meet these fake, manipulative, evil, heartless people, and the ones i love, and who said loved me, leave me for said people? WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH ME?! Why cant I be happy? Why am I so cursed? Why is it so easy for people to lie and use me, but never really care for me? Why can't I have love? The only person in this whole world who ever really loved me with out asking for anything in return died 6 years ago. I miss love. I want love. My heart physically aches day after day, because I hate my life. I want to move away, start anew. But I don't know anyone! I have no support! No one to help me. WHY DO I HAVE NO ONE when thats all I want in life. I don't want money, I don't want success or fame. I want someone to make memories with. Someone to explore with. Someone to grow with. I've been alone for 6 years now only meeting fakes, and demons since. I know how to love myself. But I don't want to anymore. I want to give up. I don't want to be alone anymore. Can someone just take me away. Can someone just save me from myself? Can someone help me and show me the way? Can someone care for me? 😭😭😭 I don't know what to do anymore. I have nothing I look forward to. I'm Losing all hope. All ambition to live. What am I to do? I'm a joke. My head is so negative. It's like 10 different voices yelling at me all day everyday reminding me that no one loves me. That I'm so worthless. That I'll never be happy. That I'll never leave this place. That there is no future. And that is why my lonliness literally gives me head aches. I need help.

lonely,judebrewer,2018/02/15,"Celebrating V Day in another state (away from my wife) I flew to SLC, Utah to hang with a friend this month, while my wife flew to Missouri to play music. I did what I could to keep her feeling good and not too stressed - I had a corsage delivered to her hotel room, so she could wear it and feel like I was still with her wherever she went.

But now I’m trying to soothe myself and finding it near impossible. My friend is staying at his girlfriend’s tonight, and I have the house to myself.

And I feel like I’m counting down the hours hoping it’ll count down the days quicker to when I’m back home in my own house and my own bed.

How have I grown into such an anxious little man? I get homesick so quickly.

I allotted this month to really break away from my comfort zone and write and work on myself to see what my routines are, and I’m finding that I’m more depressed than I realized.

I think there isn’t much I can do except for move through these feelings (as opposed to ignoring them and emotionally escaping somehow), but I figured that posting about this in this subreddit might help.

If you’re feeling the same or completely different, send me a message? Write a reply to this thread?

I think I just want some semblance of human connection.",6.193290919606709,5.993978048582997,6.339297281665704,81.0368117408907,66.08502024291498,9.486292654713706,33.83718912666281,9.04235418022936,2.742335106998265,986,40,197,15,14,315,154,247,0.029,0.841,0.129,0.9468,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,1,1,14,12,0,1,9,0,14,1,1,1,0,46,34,20,0,5,7,2,5,2,3,2,0,0,4,2,13,13,0,3,11,2,0,7,2,4,0,0,6,6,34,8,35,24,7,36,0,2,1,0,19,13,0,7,14,140,47,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14041478746483593,0.0,0.15127854280962946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2516229762320232,0.10296740713330547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14040056404679158,0.0,0.0,0.2138301574401236,0.0,0.0,0.1727198699624929,0.0,0.11533523550521935,0.0,0.0,0.13990593086680594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15062909202838132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33854092488850474,0.1913285857848833,0.0,0.0,0.24477997240823995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20691482282025006,0.0,0.06996168905265067,0.0,0.0,0.11231613616282296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08975607653267492,0.0,0.13432119110043347,0.13300140203395044,0.13187294519212006,0.3090249691797234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11902406949806345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13084190438253196,0.13421154335524216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14205580721156147,0.0,0.0,0.21376904966298302,0.14232359368053155,0.0984381899239654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824737249847204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578524427549619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067077749388306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14272869424077886,0.10693953878916372,0.0,0.15339178841441276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171606380140937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09091511357665297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07898273060306424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12413456484822599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09748701722158433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,gearbox10mm,2018/02/15,"Empty Spaces If there's empty spaces in your heart,
They'll make you think it's wrong,
Like having empty spaces,
Means you can never be strong.
But I've learned that all these spaces,
Means there's room enough to grow.
And the people that once filled them,
Were always meant to be let go.
And all these empty spaces,
Create a strange sort of pull,
That attract so many people,
You wouldn't meet if they were full.
So if you're made of empty spaces,
Don't ever think it's wrong,
Because maybe they're just empty,
Until the right person comes along.

~Ernest Hemmingway

Happy Valentines Day everyone.

lonely,Rustycans1,2018/02/16,"Miserable loneliness I don't have any friends, not even classmates or work buddies anymore which used to be something that made it A LITTLE easier. They were your friends but really never true friends, because when school is over or work is done, they go on with their lives and you go home and sit infront of a pc. 

I don't even have that anymore, for years now ive been isolated here getting more and more depressed, more and more hopless and sure I will die alone. It really is hell and life shouldnt be like this. You're supposed to have girlfriends, friends that you talk to and do things with, persue a career and maybe have a family. I'm positive I will never have most of those things, so what's the point to persue an education and a job to get money? For what? To sit alone in an apartment?
I just don't see a reason to get my ass in line and ''do something with my life'' Because what's the point? What am I trying to accomplish? A job and money is just something you need in order to have a life. Something I don't have or will have. 
Every day that pass and I grow older and wasting all my younger years makes me so fucking miserable im at a point where I don't know where to even go anymore. I stand up and walk around, pacing, because im so fucking restless and bored of this hell. I have been alone for 5 years and wasted half my twenties on NOTHING, experienced nothing, done nothing, all of it alone, for 5 fucking years. And even before those years it's not like I had a bunch of friends. I had classmates and one friend for my entire life",4.7650000000000015,5.216113748407643,5.07631210191083,86.631347133758,69.15923566878982,7.936050955414013,29.394267515923573,7.7348632917899725,1.6613138853503182,1223,43,256,13,20,387,142,314,0.252,0.696,0.052000000000000005,-0.9971,2,4,4,0,0,0,30.0,0,4,3,3,15,20,5,3,14,0,35,8,1,4,6,44,51,26,1,2,8,0,0,2,7,4,4,0,1,0,19,22,0,0,2,0,2,6,10,10,0,2,8,2,27,10,32,37,8,37,2,3,1,4,15,16,6,4,13,176,46,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333788704180664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054723716015884286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394197863316641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163713649057668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14716494348147158,0.0,0.06847574059438705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0518977794110103,0.0,0.06931041126729212,0.0,0.08351722578861248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647015800697524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21260397465646547,0.0,0.06780112640912955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07586183494206751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3730347817165052,0.22318518765474327,0.12612988788601867,0.0,0.13720226749242034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071997214296471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17384712705284808,0.0,0.15971207575776492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04422530385768915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2273589992735108,0.07862910379489889,0.08065407961428125,0.07105824578809475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614454728020953,0.05371568145296697,0.0,0.08084493502112676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05966896454133876,0.12412992677426345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2316451482668622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054529906357499214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2282161380070077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10310484103759752,0.08273861332120001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08144195500617828,0.0641257611694329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2478050926365852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584390282080318,0.0,0.0,0.06468034125387853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10692403531768158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054635202198249536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0695019661870311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11716914136866395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2591066316009133

lonely,Ardchie,2018/02/16,"Slowly noticing I'm being left out/behind. I use to have a good amount of friends. When I was like 16-20 years old. I'm 28 now, unfortunately lost my fiance in an accident, while all of my friends are happily married now. Don't get me wrong, I'm super(!) happy for them, they really deserve to have a happy life. But I'm noticing we are slowly drifting apart. They all have their families, two of them have babies now so they all do the 'family-stuff' and I'm not a part of it apparently.
I just received a text from one of them asking me what time the meetup was. -Well, what meetup?  -""Oh wow.. Sorry, they forgot to invite you"". Welp, that did hurt a little, I must admit.
So here I am not knowing what to feel. Should I feel left out or should I just get used to the feeling that friends aren't going to brighten up my life anymore? I mean.. There is no way that the 'family-trips' are ever going to fade away again so there isn't really a way back in, I'm afraid.

Anyway, thanks for letting me ventilate this. I hope you'll have a great day and amazing things happen to you. I really do hope that. Much love.",1.0394750367107228,3.217600779735683,2.9657103524229065,90.64624541116008,83.05286343612335,5.721659324522762,18.70943465491923,6.996647511020387,0.22220425844346486,855,21,182,11,24,286,128,227,0.07,0.703,0.227,0.99,1,0,0,0,0,1,44.0,1,3,8,2,17,20,0,1,12,0,24,3,0,2,5,28,50,9,0,5,6,0,3,1,3,4,2,0,0,0,10,4,0,1,6,0,0,4,6,4,1,2,5,3,28,16,21,39,6,28,0,2,0,1,19,9,0,3,14,126,38,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248327992306456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11546003804271135,0.0,0.11603654570634307,0.09496733901653022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07965018690032402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11171689336216373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11642905342603715,0.0,0.1873427622193106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2862578170130497,0.0,0.12905201028963426,0.0,0.14038090997269245,0.10358971714411047,0.0,0.13616415011868685,0.0,0.0,0.10921462376367463,0.262945679135653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2453356763714505,0.0,0.0,0.13221412440737398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06787484470368764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26837600687458024,0.12629172158805874,0.17446976528791364,0.060338061513861174,0.12378395739583835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348197539824252,0.0,0.11146763552848137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345326099100783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09079002001652818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812213895703873,0.12959719977849152,0.0,0.08368984727910206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1337433408829971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.237360440625054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13825317919102725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14138310727635864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11370635263499453,0.0,0.0,0.08205090365950585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720164686592534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206459531278753,0.0,0.0,0.21333647256447272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1960642509948592,0.0,0.0,0.11104538012617153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13503278552452122,0.0,0.07953285041613073

lonely,fox0119,2018/02/16,"Need dating advice Hey peoples of Reddit, I have been feeling extremely lonely especially now, but have been for a while now. I'm very close to being 4 years single and it's really taking it's toll on me. I'm finding it very hard to enjoy the things i use to enjoy like video games, and I don't really like to watch much tv shows or movies now either because if I ever see any sort of romance or couple it just makes me really sad. The few past girlfriends I've had went to my high school and liked me first, so now i have no clue on how to try and get a girlfriend. I can't bring myself to ask for girls' numbers or even talk to girls I might be interested in, and it's really hard because I'm 20 and recently withdrew from college and am just working full time, so I don't have any places or people to help me meet people. I just miss cuddling the most of all things, I just crave being able to watch something with somebody while cuddling. I also miss a lot of other parts of relationships but that's the most prominent. I know I would be a good boyfriend who would treat their girl really well and do things for her because seeing them happy would make me really happy. I'm not a very outgoing person and I'm not out doing a lot of stuff in public to be around people besides when I'm working, and when I'm working I like to just relax, I'm just wishing I had someone to relax with. Sorry for the long winded post, any and all advice is appreciated, thanks.",4.168255813953486,4.795482727574754,5.4117259136212645,83.06888455149505,70.56146179401993,7.880465116279073,25.349003322259136,7.908726449838941,1.324150697674419,1155,31,235,14,20,386,157,301,0.065,0.7,0.234,0.9962,0,2,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,2,4,20,20,0,0,11,0,24,2,0,4,3,53,49,26,0,6,16,0,3,4,2,4,0,0,0,4,12,16,0,0,3,6,0,2,6,4,1,1,5,7,25,16,32,35,12,29,0,4,4,2,18,10,0,11,20,159,37,5,0.09791194468741754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19135683831656256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07830014679191652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19975043979327656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08716238930954016,0.09153445114175947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17905863808690664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083377044816759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06466991603649623,0.08856695953439156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04950722115872444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08948974361986127,0.08328385013277723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051154949932688265,0.0,0.0,0.08212389380305453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2084581715699388,0.1754197411480794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06562831262876095,0.10344934530104788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05380984418163725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19133932180364988,0.0,0.0,0.08664898993914961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16648246801793226,0.0,0.0,0.1307139667551238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386910041703347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07197654523799868,0.0726004663479738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10602909464711707,0.09346803017161164,0.2715192567307841,0.08549293346129082,0.1022971427032242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09377257764918982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37634939367235104,0.0,0.09667623319380456,0.10512078607189622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09909211529291574,0.1560462864273181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08296047299737888,0.07537739856519086,0.0,0.109604405908585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208575143956433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07361759711307432,0.07869791230119964,0.0,0.09014416378353693,0.0,0.0,0.19514503613916914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05709324233423474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06647578333390942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0845644833300865,0.0,0.2423628256064908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08803459702583051,0.0907653536630339,0.0,0.0,0.11259390428871445,0.0,0.0,0.21384318557421916,0.0,0.0,0.20866150882502849,0.0,0.0,0.0630520822094926
lonely,ProminentDetail,2018/02/16,"This is one way I deal with my loneliness.. Hello, My name is Alex.

I am an artist, and I like to create things. I've been doing it all my life. What I try to do is observe the world differently- in a way that is new. In a way that will allow me to discover some secrets or hidden meaning to everything. I spent many years alone without friends. Without a social life. But I'm doing better now because I noticed certain patterns everywhere.

I am capable of tracing details I see, and follow the patterns back to a specific point that reveals strange truths about my life. It helps me relate to other people that I haven't met before.

It is difficult to explain because it is a very simple process. The problem is that it becomes diffused among all the noise. There is a duality that links everything together.

So lately I've been looking at the world and pointing out the symbolism in it. I'm doing this because I know it can help others get a grasp on their lives and gain control over it. 

It may be difficult for a lot of you to grasp, but there might be some out there that will finally connect the pieces together.

I've created a video- where I analyze a film The Terminator. The film has some very strong duality symbolism. The more you notice duality in everything, and the spectrum between the sides, the more oriented you will become- you'll find a greater direction in your life, knowing that everything has a direction and pattern you can use to find yourself.

Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqMrvzCoK0

I hope it helps someone. It may seem strange, but for me it means a lot. Everything broadcasts the same messages, and you have to learn how to listen to the patterns in order to interpret the whole message that is being sent to you.

I know it is a bit risky, so if you become crazy- just remember to find a balance. Find the balance between it all- you don't have to do anything right now, you have plenty of time.",4.992542701863356,6.729644535326088,5.504192546583855,79.00913043478263,69.67934782608695,8.518012422360249,32.97981366459627,9.04235418022936,3.0202846273291923,1551,73,276,30,28,498,182,368,0.049,0.853,0.099,0.9529,1,1,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,11,1,4,13,10,0,0,34,0,39,4,0,4,5,58,58,15,0,3,8,0,0,1,1,7,4,1,0,0,29,10,0,1,19,5,1,2,4,3,0,1,5,3,32,7,39,43,15,33,0,0,2,0,27,19,0,12,9,211,61,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09475901711908546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752908336147254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07035236699158533,0.0,0.16731960704290988,0.30314004919489845,0.07785369081236101,0.0,0.0,0.0809180055266474,0.09988651401568352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261702982507477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09432512815207222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09559057246045004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4111394455780962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10022596335794223,0.3344912906034405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706871618715382,0.0,0.047801246633423417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1839772199306672,0.0,0.0,0.09087306077518284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1508462604156842,0.0,0.1032079388111685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2584964701250512,0.04469879319715518,0.0,0.08078987754253736,0.0,0.07683096497916461,0.0,0.0,0.15556792694231455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09275940648282552,0.0,0.19932510782643226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09705947309419093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836438080823378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20833047034723928,0.0,0.0,0.061997934344820135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342963375875774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17298066432055584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08754631707139117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10364358252756692,0.07813440827204618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07290796915603663,0.08329166963193853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326545565467133,0.07752160906796479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06078379520816096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05335022635173454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062117650754725987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07902046096044454,0.0,0.15098239390757673,0.0,0.21786833688453186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10214851829646088,0.0,0.1763917171788651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05891840645749327
lonely,lubu222,2018/02/16,"Having Trouble Making Friends Ever since I got divorced nearly two years ago, I have been feeling very alone. I quickly found that the few friends I thought I had simply avoid any attempt I make at communicating with them or spending time with them. 

I got a new job recently, but my coworkers do not seem interested in hanging out after work. I joined the gym, which gives me somewhere to go, but I haven't made any friends there. I have searched on meetup, but I live in an obscure part of South Florida and most of the groups are over 30 miles away from my house. I even tried hanging out at the local coffee shop. I did meet one dude, but after about a month of hanging out, he just started ghosting me. 

Dating sites haven't worked for me either. No matter how many hundreds of messages I send out, less than 5% of girls ever respond back, and those that do, the conversation usually fizzles out pretty quickly. 

I am at my wits end, I don't know what to do. My only social interaction outside of work is with my son. He lives with his mom, but he calls me everyday around 9 pm and we chat. It is the highlight of my day.",5.217608274078863,5.7378700271493255,5.570048480930833,83.2441742081448,68.18552036199095,7.943244990303812,31.17032967032967,7.7094869923839395,1.958398577892696,880,34,175,9,14,281,146,221,0.05,0.866,0.084,0.8056,1,2,0,0,1,0,26.0,1,0,2,4,11,6,0,1,9,0,16,0,0,4,2,38,29,10,1,0,9,2,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,6,14,0,1,5,3,2,5,5,2,0,2,8,1,30,4,34,21,5,43,0,0,0,0,25,19,0,4,19,122,36,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12330671966907908,0.0,0.0,0.14406911094074365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18919008523594627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12383146600257708,0.0,0.0,0.13069216881256202,0.10696188366239608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14204006486968912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08971014785870364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12320427295413172,0.0,0.0,0.09187644547722812,0.2516538733142374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033482930380898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525196346450236,0.3224126909091529,0.0,0.0,0.1334406008818485,0.07905563489731356,0.0,0.22250729986169507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16050658029770667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13803860293885595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644755889743675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2456615989576495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316229455800654,0.1857051218825119,0.14102895565682394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16291615294378528,0.11103096046242518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13434687451298474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942600245631066,0.10579435982891376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15063536386606854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415181073698356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1373477686744127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1266344582021487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11506772195804026,0.0,0.0,0.1417983394737593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09845806142974177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11043251555523104,0.08111227736060764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09444203823594237,0.0,0.13588375262948554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153202678842689,0.11477482523184945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3038066690700313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957799156684992
lonely,honda_dad,2018/02/16,"I feel so lonely I just need somewhere to vent right now. 

I’m in my early 30s and this is not where I expected to be in life at this point. I’m pretty sure my wife has given up on our marriage, not that I blame her. I’ve put her through a lot. We started dating at 18. We’re all each other has ever known. 

My family is toxic, parents especially. I’ve all but cut them out of my life at this point. I grew up being told I was fat, lazy, not worth anything. I didn’t know unconditional love until I met my wife. 

I have binge eating disorder. At my highest about 4 years ago, I weighed 500 lbs. I’m about 330 now, but still have a ways to go. 

All that said, my wife was with me through it all. She saw what I could be, not what I was. However, she’s grown so much as a person and I didn’t keep up. I think it’s too late this time. She feels we just don’t have anything in common anymore. She feels like she’s missed out on life, dating different people, etc. 

We have 2 daughters and it kills me that they’re going to grow up in a divorce situation. I grew up being shuffled around between parents and it sucked. 

I only want my wife but I’ve ruined everything. I failed as a husband. It will never be the same. 

Im not suicidal but I feel like they would be better off without me. 

Even in a small house with 2 kids, my wife and dogs, I feel so alone. I have no family for support, not that they would anyway. I have no friends. I only have my wife and kids.

lonely,mannuskript,2018/02/16,"Is life destiny or a bad joke? Hey,
I just want to get some of my concerns of me....
English isn't my first language and this is just some anonym account (I hope) because I fear, someone could recognize me, when I post with my regular account....... 
No one I know is on reddit but who knows, someday maybe.....

At first I am male and in my late 20......
My life is a big pile of......
In school I had many friends and was accepted by nearly everyone, but I got never some deep relationships nor love......
I asked many girls out but none wanted to date me.......
When I met a girl interested in me, she already had a boyfriend or I was to dumb to see her interest.......
I got deep depressions and felt lonelier as the years went on.....
I lost all my friends, got some new and lost them again, and so on......
My best friend tried to help me, but there are no girls who like me.....
Ok, I have to say, there are no ""cute"" girls who like me......
I am very ""superficial"" I think......
I am fat and ugly (I think) even when others tell me I'd be some handsome guy, I can't believe them, cause then there where somewhere some cute girl liking me.....
But it's not......
At the end my best friend left me too and now he has a wife and kids and I am still alone......

For several years I try dating websites, but I am shy and cannot write any girls and when I do, I never get an answer......
These matches from Tinder an co. are also very rare although I like every girl on these apps and when it's a match it is with some girl I find very unattractiv......
Then I hate myself and feel like some bastard for liking the girl but ignoring her........
I don't drink don't do drugs so I have no way to get relaxed and talk to girls in real life......

Besides my love life I have no own flat and I faild university and have no job and I lost every motivation in life......
I don't know what to do from now on????

It all feels so unreal and I hate everything about me and my life.......

My family knows about the girls but nothing about the deeper problems with my feelings and stuff......

But everyone is in some kind of relationship and this makes it even harder for me to enjoy being with them! 

I don't really know why I write this and what I am doing here, I lurk this subreddit for many years now and I never saw someone saying ""yeah this helped me, thanks, my life got better"" or something like this......

Also I don't need someone to listen to my problems because I know them and but maybe it would be better to whine with some anonym stranger on the internet, than with my few friends in real life so they don't leave me like everyone ever does......

The solution to all my problems is really easy in the end, all I need is love.......
No friendship, no family, no good wishes, no good talk, no everything will be ok, no you will find someone, no dumb sayings!!!!
I need love, secureness, the sweet touch of someone beloved!!!
I don't need sex, I need lovely hugs and kisses!!!
I don't need someone doing my liefe for me but someone to support me
I need someone to support and being happy with me!!!
I need someone to cuddle with in some cold winter night or to do silly stuff in some beautiful sommer nights!!!!
I need someone to motivate each other!!!!
I need someone to learn the way of life together!!!!!!
I need someone to have fun and lots of love with!!!!!

I think I lost my point.....
Writing this makes me very sad, because I'll never find someone like this.......

Yeah, so, I'd be happy when someone notices my little cry for help and attention, but I think there are others that need more help than me......
This subreddit is flooded with lost souls, so I don't expect any responses....

There is so much more I wanted to write, but I feel a little drained so I end this here for now.....

lonely,scootyhearts,2018/02/16,"It is so difficult to make friends I have almost no friends. I have been on a spiritual journey the last few years so everyone i used to associate with has nothing in common with me anymore. I used to search for people but i believe in things/people coming into your life when they should. I also believe in not forcing things so searching hasn't been a priority but I've been feeling really lonely lately. People do try to get me to come out but i just am not into bars and partying anymore. I prefer to spend time in nature or with maybe one person in either of our homes and just vibing out to music or each other. It seems like all anyone wants to do is drink, eat or watch sports and I fucking hate it. The only people i meet that are into spirituality are on the internet. Sucks, man.

I'm a bit of a geek, so i love buying the latest technology and games. I really enjoy following rumours on the latest Apple products for example (apologies for those who dislike Apple). I am also a true car nut/petrolhead, so love reading about the latest sports and supercar models. What really keeps me optimistic is that one day I will own an incredibly nice car.",5.0901765650080275,7.043154101123594,6.604526484751204,70.35696629213484,69.7865168539326,9.580096308186198,30.69181380417336,9.957137785484203,3.552176886035312,381,16,60,10,7,130,62,89,0.043,0.677,0.28,0.9781,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,2,0,0,4,6,0,0,7,0,3,2,0,0,1,9,12,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,6,5,0,3,0,3,1,6,0,1,0,1,0,0,7,5,7,11,2,11,0,0,0,2,10,2,0,0,5,40,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18770831062771176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2562572861853814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137724937461064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13339878312504366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23241318362956376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6258991366969631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42369427410658056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24947395035842845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159054728867688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23478703512392898,0.0,0.3007397890740341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,DuckPoet,2018/02/17,"Always alone, sometimes lonely I wanted to voice my loneliness today, just so that it wouldn't feel like an overpowering ghost on my shoulders, pressing me down into the void of nonexistence.

I don't have any friends. And I've worked very hard to get rid of the ones that I used to have, because most of my so-called friends were only ever really after getting favors from me. I got sick of being the giver of everything and never the receiver of anything. I got pretty good at being alone, because at least then I didn't feel as if I was being taken advantage of all the time.

But now, after years of being alone, I feel lonely sometimes. I feel invisible. And while I normally don't care about being insignificant to everyone, I've started to think that it's possible for me to stop existing entirely due to the fact that so many people forget that I do exist. They don't think about me, therefore I am not?

So this is me, telling no one in particular, that I am here. I am alive. I exist, even if I am alone and lonely.",5.756716171617165,5.873615282178219,6.805693069306932,76.25114686468649,66.97029702970298,9.703630363036305,30.199669966996694,9.516144504307137,2.6494343234323434,805,27,152,15,12,271,115,202,0.21,0.718,0.073,-0.9721,1,10,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,1,2,10,11,0,0,7,0,20,2,1,2,4,28,35,13,1,5,5,0,6,1,2,1,1,1,0,0,9,5,0,1,6,0,0,1,8,3,0,2,6,7,25,8,28,23,3,20,0,3,0,0,6,6,0,3,14,114,34,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5508995734590966,0.0,0.0,0.1106481794745416,0.0,0.0,0.09042946175155572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10942939623256703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16212406121281134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13557972623013334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783058056969788,0.12028603022785064,0.0,0.127065983374743,0.11951186920635748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2689502781670093,0.09499936452493156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20547663171266306,0.0,0.13895082062782474,0.0,0.0,0.11153546677400768,0.21270898353041226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11912198633230735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496623449434638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13481861415227586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256067462778354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13029000689574732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18021839305795934,0.10113560659109376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09219006075815553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14991248548588687,0.0,0.13528622561370449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08518898165014345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2630368823180046,0.0,0.09412236892952658,0.0,0.0,0.11117539238368672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1162284555399414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17041360542059572,0.0,0.0,0.07754042262854273,0.0,0.12604740257564342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11485012076196972,0.0,0.10972060883001282,0.07843374982315683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09680941974759832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856333412194746
lonely,nosepickingisgreat,2018/02/17,"What loneliness is to me Loneliness to me is when you feel just like you’ve had a continous conversation with yourself since you can remember. Like everyone you talk to are either just talking at you, not to you. And when they’re gone, you’re standing there feeling lonely as ever, but at the same time it feels like the only reality you’ve ever known, like you were meant to be left all by yourself. And it’s really frustrating, I try to be very social, but I still feel like nobody really cares about me. Even the few «friends» I have.

lonely,booman49,2018/02/17,"Nightshift problems Currently at work and the overwhelming feeling of loneliness is getting to me again. I work 12hr night shifts at a desk which gives me nothing but time to reflect on the past. It’s been 18 months since the breakup with my ex gf and I find myself looking at her Facebook page daily. This woman was so terrible to me but the loneliness I feel daily tricks me into lurking at her page. Just knowing that someone cared about me once somehow makes me feel less Insignificant. Dating for me is confusing and it’s not even fun anymore. Last 2 out of 3 dates ended great, followed up and offered 2nd dates. Only to be “ghosted” as younger people tell me. It sucks and it feels like I don’t have purpose. I have family but we’ve never been the hugging type, they don’t call unless something needs to be done or it’s a holiday.  I don’t post often on reddit but my emotions are overwhelming and I just had to vent I guess. I don’t often express myself verbally, I usually draw or write  or play music. It’s just not enough anymore. I really can’t recall the last time someone hugged me.

lonely,Ciacat,2018/02/17,"22 [f4a] I’ve never felt more alone than now This guy recently broke things off with me because he wasn’t ready for commitment. Now I’m left to pick up the pieces. 

I have my friends who have been trying to help but nothing seems to work. How do I move past this great guy who within a few days promised me the world? Worst part is I believed him, after I told him I was scared. I feel so alone now. I don’t know how to cope this situation. 

Edit: after getting outsiders perspectives, I think I agree and he lied about everything just to get in my pants 😓 which  makes me a gullible idiot.

lonely,scarletteriversx,2018/02/17,"Harsh Word of Advice. 1) NEVER make someone your world. Don't ever do that. They are not your world and they are not the sun, your world should not revolve around them. They are a big part of your life, but nobody should be your world. Not even your own mother. Cause what are you gonna do when they're gone, huh?

2) If you are unhappy with your weight, your looks or where you are at life... do something about it. Hate to say it, but the time we spend here on reddit complaining about it, could be well time spent in doing something about it. ""Oh but... "" blah blah blah. Excuses. You must not really want it. You must be really scared. Regardless, go for it. Or it's never gonna get better, pal. 

3) Heartbreak hurts. Break ups suck. We're better than this, though. We've loved before and we've loved again. If you're the problem, do yourself and your future lover a favor... stay single. Work on yourself. If they were the problem, oh well. Wish them the best and let time do the rest of it. 


These are just three things I've learned in past two months..sucks that it took me to age twenty to learn this but hey... better than to be learning this shit on my deathbed.

lonely,Gothamologist,2018/02/17,I thought about killing myself today... I just can't take it anymore. A woman who I thought was the love of my life started seeing someone. I honestly can't do this anymore. This has happened so many times. Every woman in my life leaves. I'm usually kinda happy but it's starting to become too much. Everything keeps crashing down. That and the constant emotionally abuse from my family takes a toll... I just want someone to tell me that they love me... no one's ever loved me before. I don't know what that's like.

lonely,Drake_Harrison,2018/02/18,"I love crying but hate pure loneliness I have always felt this way since I first cried not over a physical trauma and rather something or someone. I never knew why I love to cry. Maybe it is because I know crying has a sign of importance instead of the feeling of dread. Or maybe it is because I miss it, I miss it because I am slowly emotionally grown up hollow and losing all the tears which mark all the important times in my life whether they are good or bad. Either way, I know crying is a good thing and you should never frown to someone or yourself if tears are shown.

lonely,glasswallaby,2018/02/18,"It's exhausting to always feel unwanted I try to be a good friend as much as I can. I like hearing about my friends' worries and troubles and giving them advice if I'm able to. I'm blessed to have some incredible people to call my friends, even if they are online friends and few in numbers. I'll always be grateful for all the late talks and all the times we've spent together. 

But it's incredibly tiring to always have to be the one who has to initiate stuff. Last thing I ever want to do is be a burden, so why do I always feel like I am just that? How come I never get a random text just asking me what I'm up to or how I'm doing? I'm always the one who has to do that.

I'm just tired right now. I just want to feel like someone cares. 

Or maybe I'm just way too needy.",2.3614299802761347,3.0083267159763345,4.21610946745562,89.91911489151876,74.73964497041419,7.053451676528598,23.55078895463511,7.1686216300943375,0.6664197238658773,601,16,141,6,12,205,96,169,0.101,0.69,0.209,0.9569,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,2,0,13,13,0,0,7,0,16,3,0,2,4,29,35,14,0,5,10,0,3,3,4,0,3,1,0,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,3,0,2,1,4,13,10,18,30,5,11,1,0,0,0,13,3,0,6,9,92,22,0,0.12537212082701032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12251218546975592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5215982393963574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720600898098064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12801895280781594,0.0,0.12782523279698213,0.0,0.0,0.10799698088622693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08280710339360806,0.11340626097740658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901757339026302,0.1791317363387008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3874487582078234,0.0,0.06550175858865184,0.120268362328701,0.0,0.1051561867097124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413034919402404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10219501166807593,0.1414252131180737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18375145633693146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259531465291048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921629343089616,0.0,0.09669470852787598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16991078745674365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691724275926475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10706710616463674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062273911288161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14352108332981714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10076936170921942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832916662270293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07310549187011812,0.28819361981325675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08511944039939046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14789545028682885,0.0995145539206037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11312883866042392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12732147440739622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

This is always happening to me. I hardly have any friends anymore. Before I know it, they’ll be gone too, and all I will have left is me.

I've tried to lower my wall and expectations, but no one seems matchable, and if they are they're out of my reach. I feel very very alone.

I just hope someone will come along and shake my shit up.",1.8484358974359016,3.766266638461541,2.8857692307692315,93.66839743589745,78.76923076923076,6.17948717948718,20.833333333333336,7.1686216300943375,0.30917948717948684,493,13,112,6,12,157,89,130,0.206,0.684,0.109,-0.8574,1,1,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,1,6,9,3,1,6,0,7,3,1,0,1,22,18,10,0,3,3,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,11,0,0,5,1,0,4,2,6,0,2,5,5,14,3,15,12,2,24,0,2,0,2,5,9,3,3,10,69,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4409857481612608,0.0,0.0,0.1717463164095595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693274690504456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428449072381233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17134317561138968,0.0,0.0,0.14999962680999354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515406897983731,0.0,0.15921951280390234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15330399237684145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13908745978638098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14854803555212925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1647032010619731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870595944738992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22473675165590065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1588160158860109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658714455719365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1637337329485217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15096228181546034,0.0,0.0,0.1702185916745323,0.13717345276088494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14050431509681907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11258535625936687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4104728623937052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15372289224228586,0.0,0.18513944400736268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’ve got no plans. In fact, I never do.
It’s rare that I’ll have any plans.
I keep myself busy by playing video games, but truth is, I’m just wasting my time and I’m aware of it.
I just wish I had my own clique I can have fun with while I’m still young.
It will probably all boil down to a bad memory.

lonely,adeepdarkplaceatm,2018/02/19,"I feel tired and guilty all the time and I don't know why. I feel so isolated and alone all the time. Even when I'm with other friends, I can only ever look inward and feel guilty that I'm taking up someone's time or that they don't really want to hang out with me. 

All I am is a burden. I KNOW I'm not a burden. I know logically that I am not a burden. But thinking and feeling are two different things and I FEEL like a piece of shit. 

I know I'm gonna feel this way for the rest of my life. This started 4 years ago and ever since then it's only gotten worse. I hate my self so fucking much. 

I just want someone to sleep with. Not to have sex, but when I can't stop thinking at night I want to be able to hold onto someone and feel a warmth and know that I'm not alone but I don't have that and never will have that. 

I shouldn't even feel this way. I have so many things that anyone else would kill for. I have running water, I don't have to worry where my next meal is coming from, I'm not sick or ill but I feel this way anyway and it's selfish and arrogant and I hate myself for it.

I hate myself so much and I KNOW I shouldn't but I do.",-0.6581072818232343,1.1776574513618705,1.6721331295163997,99.4222519455253,87.32684824902724,4.449638688160088,15.015147304057805,5.543175910156928,-1.0315490828237914,883,15,222,5,28,298,112,257,0.211,0.7070000000000001,0.08199999999999999,-0.9834,1,2,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,0,13,12,6,0,8,0,23,10,2,0,6,64,59,28,1,6,13,0,9,1,1,5,4,0,0,1,17,19,2,2,18,0,0,3,13,10,0,1,1,10,32,2,19,52,7,26,0,0,1,2,3,5,2,2,16,148,49,0,0.09898076109963007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08774047255743989,0.0,0.0,0.20502843492706932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06920964957818812,0.10141748675175656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526316133178119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10341382836800914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08268572496488609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13075171839302993,0.17906753034026446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4504288216597112,0.07071187550686696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07647229049318026,0.09150611868187254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2931690286068605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950754693692108,0.0,0.3263834263789518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06991303877353719,0.0483570001619172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08311891038199609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10035095611026064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14552449656113495,0.0,0.07634006493040109,0.0,0.1052671623417087,0.09288673915135937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15055865812037222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06340961010766358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10325852072879267,0.0,0.1016023288770131,0.08187790842057648,0.0,0.0990522438215436,0.0,0.2515982330250186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07005909215749967,0.0,0.0,0.08275234834438493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07442121403921446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315168390232984,0.12684575008936033,0.0,0.0,0.17314943333816935,0.11376382422585607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966898211272347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17514425219895888,0.23569896295706835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08931474141987711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10051976753715472,0.10086985172351623,0.07031309278840432,0.0,0.0,0.06374036493643491
lonely,StaySlapped,2018/02/19,"The least valuable friend A lot of people probably experience this and I’m sure people have it worse, but it sucks knowing your friends don’t really care about you. Almost my whole life I haven’t really had any friends, but I found a group to hang with senior year of high school. I’m 26 now and I talk with them every day still; we have a group text, we tag each other in things on Facebook, and we play PlayStation together. I’ve noticed though that if I leave the group text or I don’t join the PlayStation party myself then the party invite never comes or I don’t get added back to the text. I’m ALWAYS the one who has to initiate contact with my group of friends and I don’t ever see them in person unless I invite myself, I’m never involved in plans even though we have many common interests. It just sucks knowing that I could cut off communication with them and no one would really care or miss me that much and it’s too late in life to make strong friendships.  I have this joke I say where I tell them if we were stranded on an island and had to eat each other to survive I would get eaten first. Everyone laughs, but it makes me sad because I know it’s true. Sorry for the rant, just wishing I had better friends.

lonely,5hin,2018/02/19,"A little motivation for you guys/girls Hi everybody.

I just want to write down everything I remember because I think it could motivate other people.

So I always been alone as far as I remember, I had kids to play with when I was a toddler and after ofc, but I never was able to connect emotionally, I was always alone in the inside.

I've been abused emotionally and physically during middle/high school, and from a very early age (12) I lost all sense of happiness or appreciation for life.

Everyday I hoped the bus school wouldn't make it, I just wanted to be alone, at least alone no one would be able to hurt me.

The only moment in my life when I had some people I kindda like to be with was at the end of middle school, but I was already so fucked up that I couldn't relate to anyone, poor communication skill, no humor, needy and desperate for validation from men and affection from girls.

Ofc as you can expect it almost never happened, and the few times it did, I was way too shy to tempt anything past the first few dates.

After high school, I was so depressed that I couldn't work most of the time, I was so slow and physically stiff that I was unable to be efficient at any kind of work.

So the depression gone even deeper with the years passing by.

My mind was obsessed with love and sex, ofc since I never had it, and since I was in such a bad place I couldn't imagine any favorable scenario for it to happen.

At that point I wanted to kill myself, there was nothing to hope, and nothing was able to relieve that infinite pain in me.

Then suddenly, and I don't why, I started to get back to life.

I did a baccalaureate, then started to meditate.
Shortly after I've gone to an online dating website and got my first gf. Obviously it didn't last long, since I still  had so much things to work on myself, but it lasted 6 months and I didn't regret it.

Then I started to read a lot about psychology, and spirituality.

The Power Of Now from Eckhart Tolle change my life, I was finally able to be happy again.

Started last december I also started NoFap, dropped my gaming addiction, and now I'm starting to work out.
I've also done everything I was supposed to do for months, including the suscription to college.

I wouldn't say I'm happy all the time, I still don't have friends, and I strongly wants a relationship, but I know all those things will come when the time is right, as long as I continue to work on myself.

I know some of you have way worse wounds than that, but what I'm trying to say, is that no matter how depressed/stuck you think you are, there is always hope, even if it seems impossible right now.",6.867533475783475,5.967496675000002,7.419957264957267,76.1680056980057,64.94230769230771,10.396011396011396,31.759259259259267,9.633347757342033,2.6905327635327643,2061,65,410,35,27,683,236,520,0.172,0.7240000000000001,0.104,-0.992,1,4,0,0,1,1,62.0,0,5,0,13,28,25,2,1,21,0,49,11,0,5,7,76,81,43,1,17,9,0,0,1,2,4,8,2,0,3,22,22,0,1,10,3,1,4,15,10,0,4,30,2,55,15,68,38,11,81,0,5,0,3,17,22,1,11,53,289,77,13,0.25873494401008035,0.07663965000020127,0.0,0.07051481992077678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06477141806021677,0.2679713716180343,0.07138011114177012,0.10345512062325034,0.16146615018045304,0.0,0.0,0.08797431716306885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04522837218473536,0.0,0.05322920331858199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049737800297195565,0.054008217720646456,0.03943060509440465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06842681593334822,0.05571931107676464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05164469983451032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11142401407392742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06619391964404066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14552099361997434,0.05729059094822325,0.0,0.0,0.0854459951656424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11626714217538088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07085787107472331,0.0,0.11003990560008346,0.0,0.0,0.0499744939806023,0.05979907163449399,0.0337945823385669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051733492652953184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11439922825141972,0.20657111929159866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13668383694040614,0.0,0.19273663456575246,0.0,0.0,0.06924527721154636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07156297019399108,0.06735815724515087,0.07109697936229536,0.15817763419588274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18275214265566325,0.03160120610912299,0.0648300965016943,0.0,0.114486141767527,0.0,0.0,0.07060993883936988,0.054991799237053586,0.05837959716393822,0.0,0.043176896059123816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531213410215407,0.0,0.10325988191674694,0.0,0.04754998856790602,0.0,0.14966425449293985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12413157844885032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043831373543553036,0.049194895990692836,0.06882805564916146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06174794513169394,0.08968711620448226,0.0,0.06758073689121415,0.0,0.06114703815353573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470124034011583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0694461252542738,0.14654812710021853,0.11047911424044628,0.0,0.10287820616852834,0.0,0.2618535765376105,0.0,0.058885643905468764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605211645337069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27470088760767497,0.0,0.1033130302540012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594600001818692,0.08289345243125723,0.0,0.0,0.15087042654358082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04391601079376676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05337085643092696,0.15260857356839208,0.10268587771743416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05836701083073676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2354526509470614,0.0,0.06591825307273429,0.04594947018914003,0.0,0.0,0.041654205246033936
lonely,Crumpers,2018/02/19,"Isolated 25 year old first time mum Hi everyone. I don’t really know why I’m writing on here but it has gotten to the point where I need to talk to someone, even if it’s strangers online. 

I’m a 25 year old first time mum and incredible lonely and isolated. I am originally from Germany but I live in London. I have lived here for almost 2 years (moved here from Sydney where I lived for 4 years) but I don’t have any friends except for my boyfriend. We spend ever minute together when he’s home but when he’s at work I’m home alone with my 14 week old baby. I have bad social anxiety anf forced myself to one or two baby groups but I’m usually at least 10 years younger than everyone else and seem to get ignored or forgotten because I’m quite shy. I have only just regained contact to my parents who I hadn’t spoken to for 3 years prior so I clearly also don’t have any family to make me feel less lonely.

I feel real shame for not having any friends which makes me leave the house even less. The thought that someone could see me alone and realise I have no friends or that I’m unlovable breaks my heart. My boyfriend and I go climbing around 2-3 times a week and sometimes go with friends of his but I feel lonely even then. 

I just wanted to vent how I feel. Feeling so alone sometimes makes me feel like I don’t exist or shouldn’t exist at all. The only reason I still keep going is my little daughter and I feel like I’m failing her because I can’t seem to get my life together.",2.2024163969795048,3.972556404530749,3.4992233009708755,90.35869471413162,77.18770226537217,6.260625674217907,24.06580366774541,7.0931098945946705,0.8439480043149943,1175,39,250,13,27,383,160,309,0.18,0.73,0.091,-0.9778,1,9,0,0,0,0,18.0,1,0,0,6,19,14,0,1,6,0,18,2,1,6,3,55,49,25,0,5,15,4,7,2,4,1,1,0,2,0,6,11,0,2,12,0,1,5,9,8,0,4,3,8,36,6,28,44,4,40,0,4,1,0,20,10,0,8,26,141,42,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08414908508010514,0.2611052809785006,0.0,0.06720289603050646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714403942708999,0.0,0.06428667593729953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07480911883991863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016585778273929,0.10245412072850886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06709524618204965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07020060236213015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16651331402679725,0.0760146234354474,0.0,0.16059841461871646,0.0,0.0,0.07922088044853585,0.0,0.29743495265615066,0.12006948616211735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14296054735036895,0.0,0.0,0.25970145917752235,0.0,0.08780981703413912,0.0,0.1432773731163435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09958208246029064,0.0,0.0,0.16858825700249194,0.0,0.0,0.09696530476212074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07469432132647769,0.0,0.0,0.046183532370205525,0.0,0.0,0.08898111255736861,0.0,0.0,0.05935652661875445,0.08211067971488005,0.08422531835262158,0.22261378723940126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16828238791666994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08931608777572203,0.0,0.06231101462319169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.264542327743968,0.0,0.05694440683798686,0.12782506890243248,0.0,0.0,0.09331111270188844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07944039933161058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938174864219198,0.0,0.09565042244163273,0.05383508250059075,0.08640215200966223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0669651513591052,0.15300492740150706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566327421799902,0.14240545567048815,0.0,0.16622586613892354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06711059625593697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06754428739770163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06671453909614952,0.14700475232167218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08209015145360338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09255286865374016,0.0,0.0495661212373846,0.0,0.13481589079227824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07582867115401005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06117860547212561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32469537022647743

lonely,Days_B,2018/02/19,"I'm so lonely I'm crying. I've never really been a people person and I'm extremely introverted but I don't even have a friend anymore. I have autism and I've lost most aspects of my personality probably due to depression so making friends is really hard.

However I did used to have very small group of friends but I moved and just haven't stayed in contact. I made friends at my old job but we've drifted apart. I used to have a few friends online but those days are gone and not coming back. So I'm 19 and completely friendless.

I didn't even realise how lonely I was till I woke up from a dream about an old friend. Now I've been literally crying because I want friends but I can't make any, I don't even have a personality and I don't know how to interact with people. I'm good at keeping a distance.

I've never even had a boyfriend or even a first kiss. I'm just sick of being so lonely and depressed all the time. It's really starting to get to me just bad bad it is.

It's making me think I'm a horrible ugly person that doesn't deserve anything.

Need water? Drink.

Need affection? _______

Not all of our needs can be met by ourselves. They have to be given to us by others, and when nobody is around to provide them, they just go unmet forever. There are some substitutes like getting a pet, but it's only somewhat effective.

I need a person to show me (force me to see, really) that I'm desirable enough to love like that. And I want to find a person *willing* to let me love them too.

lonely,Vincent-Amadeus,2018/02/19,"Yo. I’m just trying to make it. So. I’ve recently fallen into a hole I struggle to escape. I’m stuck in a paradox, I enjoy being alone but I hate being lonely. I like time to myself, but when having only that, you have no one to enjoy the line times with. And I know it sounds convoluted, because it is. 

Recently I’ve fallen back into the pit of late nights and calm music, nobody to really connect with. No one I want to connect with. I do have friends, but I feel they don’t truly care. That’s fine, I don’t expect them to. I’ve just struggled with self confidence and romance for a while and a large romantic failure had flung me back into my abyss. 

I don’t mean to advertise, but I’ve created a sub to try and create a community of sads(r/TheSadExchange), an uplifting spot where people can be positive to anyone’s problems. I hope it will take off. I’d love it to. I want to help people. 

The school shooting happened only a county over and I like so many others knew people who were in it. I just feel that everything is going to shit and even I can’t stop it. 

Sorry for the horrid organization of this.

lonely,AnarchistPermavirgin,2018/02/19,"I am so jaded and bitter... Everyone around me has everything served on silverspoon. They seem to have it all figured out. They have it all soooo easy. They're so happy. They're constantly euphoric! They find love, they have a social life, plans for the future... Meanwhile, I have none of that. I just breathe, eat, drink, shit, piss, sleep, rince and repeat. I live in the middle of nowhere, there is no one to meet, I have no money, no skills, no friends, have never even so much as touched a woman for more than five minutes. Never been kissed, never been hugged even. My friends are all starting their adult lives while I have nothing. I have no money, no car, no access to any prospect for employment. I can't go to school because I suffer from severe anxiety and had to drop out because the stress became so overwhelming I went in shock in the middle of an important exam. 

There's no hope for me. I'm just fucked. I was dealt a bad hand in life and I have to just accept it. All there is to do is kill time until time kills me. I don't even have the money to drown my sorrows for fuck sake. I just have to endure this shit every second of my miserable life. And I'll have to endure it for decades to come. And the worst part is it will only get worse.

lonely,t3chnophile,2018/02/20,"Fuck today. Today just happens to be one of those days. 

I’m single, and the loneliness hits me from time to time.  I’m 4 years divorced now.  And I just miss having someone to come home to.  I miss having a partner, a friend, someone I can laugh with.  Someone I can cuddle with.  I’m sick of sleeping alone.  I bought a twin bed because the queen mattress we shared was too empty.  I hate being alone.

Sometimes it’s okay.  Sometimes I miss her so much it makes me sick.  Even after what she did, I still miss her.  I miss her perfume and how it soaked my room.  I miss her laugh.  I miss being with someone.

Valentines Day is fucking garbage, I’m sick of seeing couples in love.  And it’s  100% jealousy.  I’m sick of hearing about people’s relationships at work.  I don’t care what your fucking wife did, I really don’t.  At least you have her to come home to.

I’m just so sick of being lonely, fuck today.",-0.12601513240857187,2.1975990655737725,1.5987158469945368,96.13686317780581,93.86338797814207,3.471122320302648,19.060319461958805,5.069623422648166,-0.43057360235393016,691,22,146,3,26,224,98,183,0.258,0.632,0.11,-0.9709,0,4,0,0,1,0,30.0,1,2,0,2,11,20,5,0,5,1,15,12,1,2,0,15,43,7,0,0,3,1,0,0,2,0,5,1,5,1,7,10,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,13,0,1,4,3,25,7,20,34,3,17,0,8,1,6,17,4,4,0,11,90,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2555810193631533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07521485734303465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258000779245387,0.0,0.0,0.2125719361322066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13652407514971965,0.0,0.15914730706138092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08149517768660122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532758694780306,0.4562728501341337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1091096828527342,0.0,0.0,0.12181796345093898,0.0,0.0,0.13906479892999146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24753209748887856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136052976910936,0.0,0.08236100028966767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907027827301969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08360943232634868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554019948054968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904412280424179,0.0,0.0,0.13247020662048972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832253247825276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12347493875726467,0.0,0.4181776567682814,0.0,0.2440634836248713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09853608400919532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14389454058071885,0.0,0.3508660219438631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08982635447578056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07945642979144936
lonely,dickle_doot,2018/02/20,"I’ve done it. I’ve cut literally all contact with her. I’m emotionally weak. I went back to ask her how was life but I didn’t anticipate me still having resentment towards her. As the chat progressed, I could tell from my a mile away that she was just using me to fill her time, a mear amusement for the time being. I got angry. I snapped a bit, she countered. I didn’t say text back. I realized that I really needed to cut everything. I’ve deleted my Facebook, Instagram, Whisper, and her number from my phone. I felt some impact from doing the last one, it stung a little to delete her number but did it anyways. Now I lay here alone with no one to talk to or listen to but at least I’m not used as an emotional dildo anymore.

lonely,merkoukou,2018/02/20,"So for the first time I just posted comments in this subreddit , which is pretty awesome, and offered up advice - but really I could use some myself too. I think my ex-fiancé broke me. Harsh sentence but I don’t know how else to put it. I was the hopeless romantic and optimist, and I barely remember her now. (Quick backstory - by the way it turned out not to be so short -  to understand why I would have so much leftover Everything from a relationship) He was my end all be all (but then not)  We met in therapeutic boarding school - a story for another day - and we really connected immediately. We “dated” no physical contact or alone time allowed pretty much - for a month, sixteen year old me got weird and we broke up but stayed friends.  My mom met him at our prom, which was my 16 birthday, and the day he first asked me out. I’ll never forget watching them talk over the table at dinner. She loved him immediately. He and I went in and out of touch in the years after and my mom would always ask about him, I called him my what if guy, too - what if it had gone different - I also use to say that it was pretty awesome to know that no matter what there was this great guy out there that really loved me and that was kinda cool. 

(Wow sorry this is getting long - is this even meant for this subreddit? I’m sorry it just started spilling out of me) 

So then I was on vacation in his home town 6 years later, we met up, spent the day together, and I missed him immediately (me to my mom: how did I not know I would miss him so much? my incredible and really normally censored mother: because you’re stupid. It’s him) So dream day across the country, he had a girlfriend, we didn’t cross any of those lines just enjoyed each other’s company, but that was it right? The idea of being with him at this time felt like an incredible dream, too good to happen to me. So six months later when he was visiting my neck of the woods, single, it just all went from there and it felt like my our movie script ending. 

Right before I saw him that time, my mom was visiting me. I remember exactly where we were when I said, “but mom, what if the dream of us is better than reality?” I really freaking wish I remember what she said, because yah it definitely was. 

Fast forwarding through the bad parts as much as I can because - well, because they suck - but also explaining why they have mattered.  

A little over four years, a couple break ups later, but still always working towards an us. I loved him so intensely and was in awe of him. He also scared me.

He never hit me. I feel I have to clarify that before I explain how he hurt me. I also remembering thinking that I could legitimately end up as the victim of a Snapped episode. He knew what I was scared of and used it against me. He would always tell me I was heartless and had no class. He once told me that if I broke up with him he would make sure that everyone knew just how crazy I was. 

And the episode.... 

We were fighting and I tried to leave our house to go study for my finals. Standing in the garage, he reached towards his back pocket and I just instinctively cowered, I didnt really know he scared me till that moment. When he saw this he stepped back, yelled help help loudly, and then told me he just wanted to make sure the neighbors heard him yelling for help in case I tried to call the cops on him. When I jumped in my car, he stood behind it so I couldn’t back up and called a local sheriff, introduced himself as an EMT, and told them that he was scared for me and I was trying to hit him with my car (I wish I could say I left him immediately after this, but don’t hate me, I’m flawed) - I keep wanting to add a note saying that I remember every detail and doubt it all the time because it felt so unreal, I wonder how he remembers it. I also was no where near a saint in this whole relationship. I tried to change in the last couple years - not calling names (which I still can’t believe we did), being more supportive - but I was my worst self in that relationship and I regret it all the time. 

Maybe I didn’t share all the worst, but as I write though even I thought wow no wonder I’m all fucked up now. Not in defense but to understand - he also loved me intensely, I was in awe of how his mind worked, how he saw the world, and this list goes on... 

But I guess, the game changer (for lack of a better term).... he had severe, unmanaged, multilayered PTSD. I did my best to support him but he wasn’t ready to face it. When our relationship finally ended, a year and a half ago, he wandered around town for days, threatened suicide, and had to be committed by his family - so not well. 

I went back and forth between being really shaken by seeming someone I love almost lose touch with reality, and noticing the walls I started building in me trying shut out all the thoughts and fears and kinds that were spiraling. 

After our relationship, I didn’t know who I was anymore, with or without him. I apologized for everything I did to everyone - my mom cried once when she pointed this out to me. I remember now how small I felt. But I couldn’t go back. He scared me mentally and physically, and I knew we couldn’t come back from that, which I still resented despite it all. 

I turned to my best friend shortly after and I said I’m going on a bender, will you come with me? Not my best, but it’s what I was capable of then. 

It went on a lot longer than expected but I am on a good path even with a plan now - grad school, teaching, curriculum development - but,,, 

I’m cold in a way that still feels unreal. 

I don’t know if I’ll get backlash for this, but I started steeping around, a lot, when we broke up, because I never had just said fuck it like that. I accepted that I wasn’t dealing with my wounds and just went for the adventure. 

I also kept boundaries - no kissing, no cuddling, But the boundaries were to them, I never had to worry about getting attached, I didn’t feel it.. 

It was fun for awhile. I mean it was a fucking blast. 

But is that girl I used to be just gone? Did I lose that part of me to him? 

I just vomited all of that up and now don’t want to even remember/think/can’t express how this post first started and it’s central message. 

But pretty much, I don’t know how to care about a guy in a relationship way (unless we have no chance at a future, my favorite) I am dismissive, disconnected and make shitty, selfish choices sometimes.

I feel like a memory pack of compassion was unplugged from me and I keep waiting for it to just fit right back in the slot and take over again. But yah, that seems less realistic as the days go by.

Why am I so fucked? 
But really, am I being ridiculous about him?
Was that abusive? 
Did I deserve it? 

The one other shift that’s important to mention - about a year in I realized that could really learn about myself during my fuck it year, as I dropped my reservations in most fields of life. And I really did. I learned and found myself. In retrospect, I finally had a moment where I could look back and go wow, I am solid in a way never thought I was capable off. It’s so important to me; that foundation I’ve built. 

But there’s still that dark cloud.

lonely,photofirst,2018/02/20,"I'm scared I'll end up all alone. I am 25 years old living with my parents after college. My job is pretty great and very close to where I live, so I don't see a reason to move out. My friends all live with their parents too (it's also a cultural thing). 

I broke up with my bf 2 years ago right after moving back home and reconnected with my old high school classmates who are great, but I don't see any potential partners anywhere. I make an effort to put myself in situations where I meet new people, but I'm finding it so hard to connect with the opposite sex or find someone looking for an actual relationship. I don't really go looking for this in a bar or a club, so I'm mostly looking through friends or other get togethers, but sometimes I feel like my high school friend group isn't who I am anymore. They're not bad people and I enjoy their company, just different and I don't think I would find someone for me through them. Does that make sense?

I'm hoping to apply to grad school soon and maybe I can find someone there, but what if I don't? Then what? I tried online dating and hated it. So much of it was trying to stand out and it felt really insincere.

I read a story the other day about how a member of a band met his wife at a thrift shop because she gave him her number. I feel like no one talks to anyone anymore because we're all busy researching them online before taking any risks. We are too busy looking at our phones instead of people right in front of us. We are quick to dismiss because their social media doesn't match our expectations of what it should be. Or we know we can find another person on some app or something. 

I don't know what else to do. I feel like days are passing by and I'm just floating along. There are interest clubs I can join, like hiking and stuff, but they're usually older people. And on the other hand a relationship is scary and I feel like I'm enjoying single life now, but what about the future? 

I'm turning 26 next month and this thought is terrifying me.

lonely,goobitakesnewyork,2018/02/20,"Most of my alone time is spent either working or high Despite being extremely introverted, I rarely feel comfortable being alone. I hardly ever do “fun” things alone and I rarely have days to myself where I just enjoy a book or something. Granted, this does happen relatively more often than for people with more active social lives, but the reason I don’t do those things more is because I quite frequently feel uncomfortable doing things alone besides working. 

I’m a grad student now so I’m working most of my day anyway, but before this I spent much of my time alone, sometimes days at a time, after graduating college early. I had a few close, busy friends and no job and was pretty miserable. I’m extremely grateful for everything in my life now, especially because of that period post-undergrad, but the problem persists, I’m just alone and unoccupied less of the time now. 

When I am alone, it’s often at night after I’ve stopped working for the day, and I smoke pretty much every time I have free time at night. I know that part of the reason I continue is because I’ve built a habit, but I’m afraid of how I feel when I’m alone, unoccupied, and not high. I know it’s also because I’m extremely stressed like all the time, but I also know that it’s because I’m uncomfortable with myself. I experience a lot of negative emotion towards myself and my body that I rarely feel when I’m high. That’s connected to and partly causes a strong sense of loneliness when I’m sober that sometimes gets so overpowering that I feel an urge to get high and escape from the negativity. I have often gone without smoking for periods from weeks to months long, and it can feel nice and equally as calm, but that’s always been when I’m on vacation or don’t have a ton of deadlines. These days most of the time I’m smoking to de-stress but there are those days where I smoke to escape.

That was a lot of gushing. I guess I’m just hoping someone can relate in some way cause I know no one I know does.

lonely,thundergun661,2018/02/20,"I am empty I can fake emotions. Give a reasonable reaction to a given set of circumstances. I hide my emptiness well. Most people don't even notice, and the very few who know me well are only vaguely aware that something about me is...off. Quite literally off, as in the opposite of on. That would be a complete and utter absence of feeling.

It used to be sadness, grief, anger, over people who'd died too soon and mistakes I'd made and things I couldn't change, opportunities missed to make things right, chances not taken. I've been given a lot and I screwed it up. Now I'm stuck in an impossible situation and I've grown tired of beating my head against a wall. At some point, I shut down inside. Accepted fate. I hide it, and fake emotion, so that I don't have to talk about it or try to explain it verbally to someone. In fact, I'm not even entirely sure what compelled me to write this here.

I kept waiting for some big, defining moment where suddenly it all makes sense. That 'hero' moment. It isn't coming. I've succumbed to experiencing friendships, sexuality, emotions, and human connection on a nearly two-dimensional level, in one way or another. I watch television to simulate connection, to try to experience something outside my four walls and a broken futon.

I used to take solace in music. Listening to it, writing it. Even got kind of good at it. Nevertheless the accolades and attention of others in that regard led to my dreams of pursuing it falling apart, bitter egos, putting pressure on myself for something that became more and more unrealistic as circumstances changed. Now it's nothing more than a past-time that I'm way too good at, to the point it no longer serves as a conduit for things I couldn't express when I was younger. I feel as if even that one thing has begun to lose its meaning, and I daresay I'm not even sure I enjoy it anymore, or anything really. I pass the time. The little bit of superficial emotion I can attempt to conjure artificially is fleeting, and in the end I'm always back where I started, empty, with four walls and a broken futon.

I guess I'm not asking for advice, or help. I'm not on the verge of ending it all and this isn't a cry for help or something cliche like that. It's simply a written record, something someone might find if they know what to look for, that even if things get better, even if I gain back a fraction of what I've lost, I can never go back. I can never undo what's been done, what I've done, what I've failed to do. I've lost so much, and I'll never be able to truly settle on anything because I know eventually I will lose it again, and the emptiness will always be there, somewhere, in between the clutter and distractions.

When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you. That's Nietzsche. Sounds nice and emo taken out of context, and is often used in reference to the concept of evil. But an abyss is nothing more than emptiness, and all I know is that I am empty. I suppose I too am taking it out of context, but for me it means my life is empty, and therefore so am I.",4.837526537557736,5.810958606312294,5.738999270723608,80.06870634470468,69.24916943521595,8.198752127056155,30.463657726278267,8.407314429234152,2.2476431731626296,2419,95,461,35,41,796,280,602,0.118,0.826,0.057,-0.9751,0,0,5,1,0,0,83.0,0,2,1,12,32,31,4,2,28,0,37,4,1,10,9,92,82,42,2,9,16,0,2,1,0,4,2,2,2,1,48,28,0,2,14,1,0,7,15,17,2,4,16,10,43,14,78,55,14,71,0,8,4,1,16,40,1,16,22,322,91,1,0.07104936959622457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06942862167492835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11823753430077652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450145893029725,0.0,0.0,0.07046188310432988,0.0,0.0,0.11693515475813494,0.0,0.06642156961258043,0.0,0.0,0.2185303184145689,0.0,0.04331103624945202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06283739364208289,0.0775675099736852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15032162444518898,0.06120274076602233,0.07449391225081703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07804439628007816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07373802839206092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14541634582235646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3196839112481871,0.12585730578418808,0.0,0.0,0.3284920697501993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06949991677024256,0.0,0.0,0.07184939212509102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493783664309125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03712036315943991,0.06815702940540501,0.0403789940748993,0.11918568060560936,0.05682467134953425,0.0,0.0782688907869968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0729171509493512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952457895678304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739869850629049,0.15618750171418894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050184270925299916,0.034711133142434354,0.07121013367453496,0.0,0.0,0.05966357621984359,0.15897214170654658,0.15511755973927507,0.060403633281209665,0.0,0.06722863141383563,0.09485201182575304,0.0,0.0,0.15478718465342628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07537215330281906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05222946169846754,0.0,0.16439296166192405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13634757267934408,0.08089017819735267,0.0,0.0,0.09628978322107896,0.05403624718514073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782466268333967,0.09851337385619688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13432923890839407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.071424240411766,0.0,0.07556975020535571,0.0,0.0,0.045516045486426605,0.07305058520071511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060675773428015736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07986246827804812,0.0,0.0,0.12039980058992422,0.2734863793665617,0.0,0.0,0.050289109489306164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13392638001938129,0.0,0.10684056746643156,0.057106791979158265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23601022057427934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04142945877545362,0.08166079856636893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09647571630545763,0.0,0.06940491021832945,0.0,0.0,0.1840915298949791,0.0,0.058623170808814025,0.0,0.11279136501909008,0.0,0.0,0.127763831906542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050471433655157466,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Sockeyesoul,2018/02/20,"Breaking down more often. Being constantly reminded about my loneliness is really taking a toll. Most of the time all I do is go to class, read textbooks, write papers, and surf the web.  When I go to bed, I just start thinking about how lonely I am and just cry. 

I don’t really have many friends, but what I really want is a girlfriend.  It’s extremely hard when one is in their mid 20s with no dating experience at all, and is in school full time, paired with the worry of rejection.  I have asked out 4 women, and they have all turned me down. Each time I get rejected, I end up crying for a couple days, and it’s the worst feeling in my world. 
      I have tried Zooks and Plenty of Fish, all together probably messaged 30+, and not one of them replied back. I don’t use dating apps like Tinder because you need a Facebook account to use them, and I refuse to use Facebook, because I get depressed from the social comparisons of my life to other’s. 
       Being a dateless virgin all though college has made me more depressed than ever. I have dreams about going to the local gun shop down the road, buying a hand gun, bringing it back to my room, and shooting myself in the head.  I have read a story online about a 58 year old virgin, and I keep thinking that his life will be mine. 
        I really don’t want to end up alone, but I have nothing that will give me any hope of a decent future.  I just want to be normal, I just want my existence to matter. I’m tired of crying all the time. I’m tired of being trapped in a world of loneliness and isolation from anything rational.

lonely,sufferinmall,2018/02/20,"Is it really worth it? I'm 27 now and I feel as alone now as I ever have before. I have been single for 6 years and the limited experience I have in relationships were with people that were desperate to have anyone around them and I was also desperate/foolish enough to put up with their toxic personalities. From the outside looking in I have a pretty decent life so far. I have a job that I enjoy and I am respected at the company I work for. I volunteer with 2 different organizations and for the most part I enjoy interacting with the people I meet. I'm currently taking bass lessons with the goal of learning to play the double bass. So it seems as though I'm fairly accomplished and should be happy with where I am.

But I so badly just want to hold someone's hand.

I've been told time and time again that if you focus on yourself and work on making yourself a better person and enjoy your own company then you won't have to worry about feeling alone. But after so many years of just feeling unloved I can't help but feel a sense of hollowness to my existence. We human beings are social creatures after all, and despite what I have accomplished so far the extreme lack of physical/emotional contact with someone is making my existence seem increasingly mediocre as I get older. What am I doing so wrong that I could spend my life up until this moment not knowing what a healthy, fruitful relationship looks like? I've tried putting myself out there on various dating platforms, but the very few women that respond to me end up not responding anymore or show little/no interest in having a conversation to begin with. I feel as though people can smell the inexperience and the intrinsic sense of loneliness I feel, which is why I think that now even my friends are distancing themselves from me (and to be honest I'm not sure if I can really blame them).

I've spent so much time looking for answers and I don't really have a lot for it. Realistically this will probably be buried deep down in the quagmire of this subreddit. I think its somewhat cathartic to see these words reflecting back at me on the computer screen, because for a moment I can pretend that someone else wrote these words and I won't feel as alone as I once did.",6.831511627906978,7.02396470930233,7.418465116279073,72.51095348837211,64.69767441860465,10.507906976744188,33.47906976744186,10.264317810270406,3.433746976744186,1795,70,320,39,25,594,222,430,0.08800000000000001,0.8009999999999999,0.112,0.8106,3,4,0,0,0,1,28.0,1,3,3,9,23,15,0,0,21,0,39,4,1,2,3,70,68,40,0,6,12,0,8,1,1,4,2,0,0,4,21,25,1,2,16,3,3,3,7,3,0,0,9,15,44,12,59,50,14,46,0,0,5,0,24,21,0,8,23,243,65,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999296491296819,0.0,0.07719545522554158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09573237855857687,0.06749641310893628,0.0,0.0,0.08593266547988727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07422604338438514,0.08059898684084058,0.058844134379116515,0.0,0.0821403980986738,0.0,0.0,0.08537343725076423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0770717986638837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085389137562677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08063889767476475,0.10858388912691903,0.08549742577738513,0.09974187436493807,0.0,0.06375752552676263,0.08731741943433118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09442541199455393,0.0,0.0,0.341661266500421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07457927242765565,0.0,0.05043323427717167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275857778779264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06470240065481436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09579168746503276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053050672155901764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363647807934266,0.04715995644437288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2431840796695477,0.0,0.0,0.08206683149566403,0.0,0.0,0.1288697988627501,0.09786683837840937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07096106971516823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280189767336753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10453319136409622,0.0,0.20076641121952615,0.16857352604076112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09820628449723567,0.10407627202704953,0.0,0.0,0.19407975262976804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1855198486766629,0.0,0.0,0.207275395180346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692235973084836,0.17575559566880267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840075115761343,0.2453700947372959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097891190341592,0.0,0.07257896893676039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12370577226333206,0.18968157329346735,0.0,0.16886324021866636,0.0,0.0,0.09223908832265433,0.0,0.0655379148850508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796478228074582,0.056936226244585726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710381746382581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055079701745862,0.09803147099649942,0.0,0.0,0.10554101547388696,0.0,0.12432503356641322

lonely,mattypants_gobirds,2018/02/21,"The cycle seems endless... I’ve been very lonely for a while now. And when it seems that I’ve made a new friend or met someone new and really start to open myself up again it all just ends with being ghosted or ignored. Why do people do this to each other? Why not just tell someone that you’re either not wanting to be friends anymore or that you have a lot going on or whatever. Just tell them something. My first thought is “what’s wrong with ME?”  But at the same time I know it’s not my fault, or at least I don’t think it is. I’m always reminded by my best friend that I’m a great person and I do truly know that. But being lonely really takes a toll on my mental state and my brain takes over and sometimes I can’t control the sad thoughts. I know I’m rambling now. I do have good things coming in my life. Guess I should just focus on that. It’s so hard keeping the sad thoughts out though.

lonely,sneakthelisa,2018/02/21,"It's my birthday! Never been so lonely---- I woke up earlier today than I ever have, but didn't leave my bed. I just looked into the darkness and kept thinking not just about this past year, but nearly my whole life.

I have PTSD, anxiety, and a bit of depression. These issues have been haunting me for 10+ years. I'm finally going to a therapist for all of them, and I have been making major strides in healing. My therapist told me, however, that I've been hiding from my emotions for so long that now that I am working on them they'll probably come back with a vengeance.

Today's the first day I'm feeling that vengeance. The loneliness. In my bed this morning, I looked at all the relationships and non-relationships I've had in the past and realized how much my PTSD and depression ruined them. I either pushed women I was interested in away and to the margins of friends with benefits (which always made me feel scummy) or when I did finally let someone in (just last year) I was so depressed that I couldn't even manage to hold myself together, let alone a relationship. She had to break up with me and even when she did, I was so numb to my emotions I just didn't care. Well, those break-up emotions are finally hitting me over 8 months later.

That last relationship was what made me see a therapist, so it didn't happen again. I'm glad I'm working on myself, even it is does feel like I waited to long.

Doesn't stop the loneliness though.

Even though I'm still in my mid-thirties, I almost feel like I don't have a lot of chances any longer for love. Or hell, even a close friendship.

lonely,LittleBigPerson,2018/02/21,"Cannot sleep I feel completely cut off and isolated.

Wish my role model, the person who I derived my value from, didn't die. It caused me to become a very negative person which I previously was not. I drove away friends and my first girlfriend with my stupidity and became socially stunted.

I wish for that, or that I was never born.

I am trying to improve my life but it is agony. I cannot sleep most nights as I lay awake, not even doing anything, just thinking and agonising over my mistakes.

I feel like a ghost or another species right now.

EDIT: Plus my neck is impossible to shave with an electric shaver as the grain varies and curves etc so it is all red from where I had to pass over it many times.",2.3090714285714284,4.633875192857143,3.481428571428569,87.91357142857143,79.21428571428572,6.571428571428572,23.57142857142857,7.7094869923839395,1.1617857142857142,557,19,113,9,14,180,95,140,0.157,0.755,0.08800000000000001,-0.8764,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,5,5,2,0,5,0,11,4,3,1,2,24,17,12,2,3,6,0,2,1,2,0,1,0,0,2,8,8,0,0,3,0,0,2,7,3,0,1,5,3,19,2,16,12,3,14,0,0,1,0,7,6,0,3,7,80,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886634409693822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14806011173282765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16904222617856038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19870922483589606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18482900150182427,0.0,0.0,0.18864433016888146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18673017101262165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2006600970272304,0.11883649202515145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18194749129087984,0.12853599681949954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15304118512450615,0.0,0.0,0.1390069492168498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12708391716415787,0.08790058493653047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18241221977162214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13876659716289833,0.0,0.0,0.16884419374470366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3142011286900669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15365202725919805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3601029899305617,0.18340737008844826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11528646930365832,0.0,0.0,0.10491370722537154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12215492736325233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14845412806847658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4138018240671713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,oh_no_mah_fingers,2018/02/21,"My “friends” stood me up today... again My friend invited me to go see Black Panther with a group of people, most of who I was also friends with. We confirmed movie times, location, etc. and I made it to the theater later the next day (today). The movie started at 5 but nobody was there at 4:50, so I just went into the theater and saved a few seats. The movie started and no one came, so I just watched the movie on my own. It was pretty good, so I texted the friend who had invited me. She said something along the lines of “oh, sorry, everyone had to cancel last minute.”
The only problem is, something like this happens pretty much everytime I want to hang out with my “friends.” What should I do?",2.301055586749019,4.4389430583941625,3.076204379562043,91.7778775968557,78.27007299270073,5.675238629983156,24.40707467714767,6.67199483983844,0.7664468276249297,537,19,110,5,13,169,87,137,0.065,0.71,0.225,0.9781,0,0,2,0,0,0,24.0,1,0,0,0,8,9,0,0,11,0,8,0,0,1,0,20,19,8,0,3,3,0,0,1,5,1,0,1,0,0,6,11,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,1,0,1,10,4,16,8,17,8,5,20,0,0,3,0,11,6,0,1,11,77,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12110524572430285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17320520305156276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976652494568603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1688938636091296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14470589523779,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5850047186652624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860659411171343,0.12701935751520488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391649020942892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12344252040226315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07398516009597285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329468985572127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132465971742113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1610564723333182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261858922878174,0.11517573864769025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.104988329053351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3081346221991939,0.0,0.1449061109048445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14405261166788505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12067680991944373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2331693808839337,0.0,0.16952290709365248,0.21437777910521352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08830495759426188,0.0,0.28709182029172625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932230077300747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14038492785750142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,gneev,2018/02/22,About getting a gf I’ve never had a gf and I’m 19. It’s not that old at this point but I get so sad and hopeless seeing my best friends doing coupley things together. I’ve grown such a low self image that I’ve convinced myself that I’m good enough to be friends with girls but never get any farther. I convince myself to take comfort in that fact but I’m secretly crying inside. I don’t make it seem like a big deal on the outside but I always have his twisting in my gut and a knot in my throat whenever I think about it. I always cuddle with my pillow and feel like an ugly (pics in my profile for anyone who cares) sorry excuse for a person when I do this. I hate myself for doing this and I really just want someone to cuddle with and hold and share enjoyment/experiences with. I also think I might be falling in love with my best friend but she’s in a relationship with my other best friend. Or I might just be falling in love because she’s giving me attention. I’m so pathetic I start liking any girl that shows me attention. I’m so stupid and dense and lonely and I hate myself and I wish I had someone to snuggle with.,1.7688239845261116,3.7227154936170272,3.6899516441005815,87.63295454545454,79.17021276595744,6.145067698259188,22.171179883945843,7.1686216300943375,0.774404255319149,891,27,182,11,22,301,121,235,0.18,0.547,0.273,0.9815,0,2,0,0,0,1,14.0,0,0,0,3,10,25,3,0,9,0,12,6,2,1,3,43,36,22,0,2,9,0,1,3,6,2,0,0,1,4,14,18,0,1,7,1,0,3,4,7,0,0,2,2,32,18,25,29,4,21,0,4,1,4,22,13,0,4,8,124,46,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096827887538596,0.20149705027359535,0.0,0.0,0.16467753818723987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08466217445931057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07380943877227003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38119897489166704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1234494550294844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330010451741637,0.0,0.12482849250132608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12510833656825868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184397856930977,0.0,0.0,0.061221847456360785,0.08649980424686537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741854171200501,0.0,0.1897784081665172,0.11615127515822715,0.0,0.10155642714854646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2390834957962561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1774611839095656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21855943078250892,0.0,0.08082205328633914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2568941690656945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18676921310145195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12705342712395154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10572266446107284,0.0,0.0,0.114460038284817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07756715293388458,0.0,0.0,0.12999494980243367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09648533810002878,0.110226975163086,0.1263131795874099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20518192311660446,0.0,0.0,0.13553950437991674,0.08570127314397588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103733142505846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08044038394637866,0.15516675909990466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07141630936141848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392363916120346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

So I think helping others who maybe can't make it alone through the other side would be a good thing.",3.9686872586872575,6.508952162162164,4.957181467181467,78.350945945946,74.67567567567569,7.471814671814672,29.49034749034749,8.418075326091056,2.5732185328185326,316,14,53,6,7,103,63,74,0.14800000000000002,0.502,0.35,0.9693,0,2,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,4,0,6,0,0,1,0,9,11,7,0,3,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,6,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,6,6,6,7,0,6,0,1,0,0,8,2,0,2,5,35,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1852384094205904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3926594339197135,0.0,0.1515931677878059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1772154712196527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17325681081933658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14645561873540688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15899614142178894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6053788378619619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541196719439465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09261072648966016,0.0,0.0,0.16775696353924938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126534528390979,0.0,0.19044114212075366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055828919209062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13141886040327125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19775516655129885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15236326255849902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259369891307217,0.12146407995292602,0.0,0.0,0.11053549475103948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13465985447950166,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,qiuAr,2018/02/22,"I'm in my early twenties and I'm still a virgin. The title sums it up. I turned 20 about 3 months ago and I'm still a virgin. Altho I could easily go to a prostitute, I just don't want it to be like that for the first time.  Never had a long term relationship and probably never will.  and I sit here asking my self.  Will I die alone?  Will there ever be someone close to me besides my parents? I'm too scared to talk this with them... I don't know why but I am.

By the way, objectively I'm a good looking guy but my personality ripped off the 3 to 5 chances I ever had. The thing is I'm way too funny/good-talking guy and no one takes me seriously. Might have a couple good friends but my _____ life is super fucked up.

lonely,slxmmy,2018/02/22,"Put Myself in a Pit It's 2AM on a Thursday morning and I have class at 7AM - and I feel like I'm having a crisis - not an actual urgent crisis, but I feel so boggled lately. I'm 19, male, student in computer science, part-time worker, irresponsible, tired, and feeling lonely as Hell. 

I've had a procrastination habit for as long as I could remember. I did my 4th grade science fair project the night before the fair. I was able to make it all work somehow, despite how unsettling it would be. However, procrastination would start to hurt me in high school, but still, I could make it work somewhat. Now in college, my procrastination produces devastating results. I'm just beyond irritated at myself. I've been telling myself to give it up and stay on top of things for years, but I feel like it's a permanent habit and I can only dream of being responsible. I'm sort of losing hope for myself. After all of these years of math, I can't seem to learn anything new past PEMDAS and factoring - and I'm in calculus. It's horrendous. 

On top of being irritated at myself, I'm just flat out lonely. I had friends, a pretty close-knit group, but they aren't true to me; there's no depth nor sincerity from them, just excitement. They're stuck in a middle school mindset and I can't stand it; while it's fun to have fun, I want to be able to take something meaningful from my relationships with people. They're all shallow and it's also pretty apparent they're not all supportive of me being gay. I would like to make new friends, but I don't know how to put myself out there. I dream of starting to talk to people at my school, but I don't feel like doing it. Even I don't think if someone started talking to me that I wouldn't take it as one-time small talk that couldn't blossom into a friendship; I'm not engaging. 

I feel overwhelmed. I suppose I'm just venting. Any advice or relatability is cool. Thank you.

lonely,MoireachB,2018/02/22,"I tried to kill myself the other day So around a month and a half ago, my girlfriend left me out of the blue. No real explanation, no attempt at trying to work through things, just gone. On top of other things I’d been going through, that was the nail in the coffin and since then I’ve been in a really bad mental state, depression, paranoia, anxiety, the like. I got put on the anti-depressant fluoxetine, which makes me feel nothing, not happy, not sad, just empty. 


So the other day my ex told me that she was happier without me and that she didn’t want to try speaking again. To me, it feels so unfair because when I met her, she was in a really really dark place which I helped her out of. When I was the one going through a tough time, she upped and left. So after that conversation, I drove to a bridge and was considering throwing myself off. My rationale was that either I’d do it, or I’d finally feel something that would make me not. As I was standing on the edge, luckily I did feel something, I went and broke down in my car, when the road workers showed up who took me to their command centre, then the police came and took me away. 


I’ve been around people in the day or so since then, however I still feel so fucking lonely. Even when I’m around people I just can’t get what she did to me out of my head and I’m just brooding about the fact that she left me when I needed somebody most, without seeming to care at all about fixing things, to me the relationship was going great. She wasn’t even going to tell me, I only found out that she wanted to break up when I found a Reddit post asking how to dump somebody you lived with. I feel like I can’t trust people now and I’ve never felt so alone.",5.298266475644702,4.978495810888251,5.9908581661891125,83.19144484240691,67.96848137535817,8.81381088825215,27.478653295128947,8.238735603445708,1.5882273925501424,1334,35,282,16,20,437,168,349,0.117,0.8059999999999999,0.077,-0.9358,2,3,2,0,0,1,40.0,0,1,1,4,28,15,3,0,21,0,19,2,1,4,3,53,53,29,2,4,12,1,7,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,20,18,0,0,11,1,0,13,12,9,0,2,27,9,47,6,49,25,3,67,0,4,1,1,23,29,1,4,23,204,67,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342766584855088,0.0,0.0,0.09747522015765854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07199805994013918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513481064517321,0.08798523901509449,0.0,0.08842456127272189,0.0,0.0785824676845961,0.05737190341370212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10764299960960176,0.09595697146916424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18209003350829106,0.0,0.16212299451431664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432473125872813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2855255894773993,0.0672360946933491,0.09036558913406577,0.1030988727072935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20638546137074648,0.0,0.08700821490893339,0.049171436988924,0.0,0.213951911440298,0.0,0.07527272119290597,0.10376261342515776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10018764422275032,0.0,0.0,0.09658960172123436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0630836007729612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10412479859584793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30677012814652205,0.0,0.0,0.0919601076528431,0.0,0.08310566465745868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12564558441224752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948462351644432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07512205249772544,0.0,0.0,0.0697854119903014,0.07258763535494701,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09030631044473142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06377506313712307,0.07157903903497695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1957434037349025,0.0,0.09833061146961064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09013658305273237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461201987178787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10712398405805006,0.18087829741921585,0.0,0.0,0.1010447691838601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567916892245754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15570654191811473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449093395190238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07516071816446132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0822610496588566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18757836457360785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05487947445213464,0.0,0.0,0.08993134357488901,0.2091314508618462,0.19169463341047888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11102345908598643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08724596298680679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1814478662689115,0.0,0.06851716688746333,0.0,0.0,0.0668569137929921,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Zweisoldner,2018/02/22,"Should I get a pet? I don't have friends or family right now. I couldn't even get anyone on my messenger to agree to let me use their scanner.

I'm still trying nevertheless. I was wondering if I should get a dog. It is more financial burden and responsibility, but I don't feel like I can make much more progress in my life until I at least get a sense of belonging.

Should I?

lonely,dw_horizon,2018/02/22,"Best friend angry at me Was lonely af for ages. Met this real cool chick, really liked her. We talked heaps, all day every day. Hung out with her for a bit. 

She didn't wanna date me, allgood, we can just be friends we live in different cities anyway. 

Still been talking heaps. Last night I went for a run at 11pm and somehow the fact that I'm a recovering alcoholic/drug addict made that the worst thing in the world and she is pissed off and isn't talking to me. 

No other friends. What a lonely night this is.

edit: and my ex sent me a message today saying she is blocking me on everything, that she loves me a lot, it just hurts too much for her and she hopes i understand.

update: well i explained that i was in good frame of mind, wasn't likely to come across drugs on the route i was running, and that 11pm isn't really crackhead hour, but that i understand where she's coming from. She's just ignoring me :(",1.7663440860215085,3.8437275698924713,3.0313978494623655,91.73376344086022,79.75268817204302,6.2838709677419375,20.010752688172047,7.3871296695380915,0.458378494623656,712,18,153,10,18,230,114,186,0.125,0.768,0.107,-0.6601,1,4,3,0,0,0,25.0,3,0,0,1,9,17,1,0,10,1,13,4,1,1,2,31,25,7,0,2,4,1,0,2,3,0,2,1,0,1,12,13,0,2,3,0,0,6,5,6,1,0,10,2,27,11,20,14,6,29,0,3,0,1,27,12,1,3,13,104,39,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15037097470168595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14475568262042485,0.0,0.15059076202010974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376398925993953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17791506087627673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1441141208161241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31992473338891303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621731863542165,0.0,0.12396829144805205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3197078307168394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11569446067285827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13700191266146158,0.13583951329331648,0.0,0.14766370869963313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11243653015902366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134777460106016,0.0,0.12180031851678992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11726854668515885,0.1244929355005927,0.13051870348310998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13927638581254348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10139908371095914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2588878288237868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15700175713457815,0.17673110755439442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10969251679649042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11015614218495333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3326040241687327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163877755743917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074752526702246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871931965646271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12402133839246975,0.12786837244966792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,doctor_exgirlfriend,2018/02/22,"I'm the problem. Over the course of my life I've had a lot of people leave. Some simmered away and keep an arms distance friendship with me, some cut me off and ended things with me permanently.

Last year was the worst year of loss for me. I lost my boyfriend/best friend and all of our mutual friends that I had known since highschool and also been really close with. Later that year I tried to reconnect with an old friend and they said they would never reconnect with me. In October I lost my other best friend, she told me I was too much and it was hard to be my friend and that she loves me but that it's better if she doesn't know me.

I guess, surprisingly enough, it's taken me this long to figure out that I'm the problem. I'm the reason no one wants to be around me and why I'll never have any long lasting meaningful friendships or relationships.

I feel shitty because my girlfriend is asleep in the next room and she has no idea how miserable I am and how miserable I'm eventually going to make her. It's inevitable, my sadness spreads like a fucking disease. I really do care for her and I don't want her to leave but that isn't going to make her stay when she finally is miserable enough.

lonely,AdhesiveMadMan,2018/02/22,"Yesterday was my Sour Sixteen, and not even that made me feel considerably well. It's midnight.

I get a lot for Christmas and my birthdays. The day before my birthday I received my Parrot Disco (drone), so that was nice, but it didn't ""cure"" me. It's not that I'm ungrateful or anything, I'm really grateful to have all the things I own. It's that I'm feeling bad in a different way. The feeling of solitude.

I like to go by the name ""Basement Boy"" because, well, that's where I spend all of my time. All of my peers, or at least the people I can relate to, are all busy doing their own things. Meanwhile, I'm just...sitting down here. In front of this screen. Contemplating. I even feel that my friendships over the vast internet are stronger than many of the ones I have in real life.

I've never been in a relationship, and I've always wanted to be. On Valentine's Day, I found out that my first crush, since October, was taken. The rest of that night consisted of one long, miserable, drenched Hell. I could barely think rationally. It was so horrid that I even vomited a bit. To make it worse, I couldn't find the Clonazepam, which is something I take to suppress anxiety attacks. It all ended when I cried myself to sleep.

I've never experienced, nor have I had the opportunity to experience a relationship. Only hardship. What makes it even scarier is all the basic people and how dull people are getting. It makes it feel like by the time it all ends, I'll never have had anyone to call my ""girlfriend"" and all the people I find real interest in are already with someone else. I desire the ability to cry right now, but I don't even have enough buildup for that.

I may be overreacting about all of this, but for now nothing can negate it, and what can is out of reach from me at the moment.

Oh yeah, and I'm also breathing with the acknowledgement that my childhood has 2 years to live.",3.755770052978903,5.3424530350404345,4.761574495770984,83.71037735849059,72.55795148247978,7.489209034296866,27.34835951296589,8.104835398774808,1.7255702388697831,1480,54,292,22,29,483,192,371,0.12,0.755,0.125,-0.6439,1,0,1,0,0,0,61.0,0,0,1,2,17,12,2,1,21,1,31,4,2,5,12,56,53,18,0,4,7,0,5,2,1,1,2,0,0,1,30,11,0,1,11,0,1,3,10,5,2,3,11,8,34,7,42,37,16,38,1,2,1,0,8,15,1,4,21,211,64,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100941138021764,0.08044602243506424,0.08370334538408519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07695512664186488,0.0,0.0,0.07033857041691871,0.0,0.08278135791772293,0.0,0.0,0.1144416724164006,0.0,0.0,0.08399287088466316,0.0613219591827484,0.0,0.08559918830668004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10982401005411027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10271904516954124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08031715890929958,0.0,0.22099841968984274,0.1297512886736345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105100674444663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403446229482954,0.0,0.17819514923858035,0.10394183231945413,0.0,0.33221122370122946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840150290662113,0.0,0.0,0.2543200228357421,0.07186530006965486,0.0,0.0,0.18388455751132055,0.08556630799256176,0.0,0.11029755058699163,0.0,0.0,0.1051137812266393,0.0,0.05717062533992692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105343302277063,0.09829156141579208,0.0,0.08882748998637426,0.08902367203914498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08552252394115614,0.0,0.09518570203970647,0.20144442506800986,0.10198784180799024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23275588297869865,0.0,0.0,0.09440187145023393,0.0,0.09652390026358867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13633195295514092,0.07650725614578266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27896045043904816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22899894153876896,0.06444392296233932,0.0,0.0,0.2160034038557992,0.0,0.08590783374714447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08321346896178743,0.0,0.10066794543041876,0.0,0.0852340684584728,0.0774431740490445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563514388692429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336620904603779,0.0644574042718403,0.0,0.0,0.11731585295532468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059333712333940115,0.07984786420291004,0.0,0.0,0.18089450550386274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025152014443192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647800729350102
lonely,kno_da_wae,2018/02/22,"Brief physical contact Today at lunch, I went up to a teacher's classroom to take a nap (I hadn't slept, and she has blankets and pillows). I laid my head on the desk and 20 minutes in, I woke up and felt someone touch my back for just a second. I know that they were just trying to get between the desks so that they could get to the closet, but I was kind of hoping they'd do it again. It had a familiar soothing feeling, like when your mom would hug you and rub your back as a child to make you feel better, and then you actually did feel better. I haven't had that happen in a long time, and I'm sad that it probably won't happen again for a while.

lonely,pinkfish277,2018/02/23,"Never felt so alone As I type this I am sitting with tears streaming down my face. 
I am a fully grown woman, with a small child, and I have pretty much no one else but her. I am in a relationship, but its long distance, and we have been arguing a lot lately, mainly due to me and my moodiness. 

I have no friends close by, I have no friends period. Slowly but surely over the years I have just been forgotten by everyone, or so it feels. 
Ive always had trouble fitting in, people seem to instantly decide they dont like me, even before they get to know me, and I have no idea why. Its happened my entire adult life. My daughter started school this past September, and I hoped it would be a chance to meet some mums, you know, get to know a few people. As usual this hasnt been the case. I have tried talking to them, but they just wander off to talk to someone else, theres one woman who just stares at me and laughs. I dont even know why. 

I feel like there must just be something about me? Im not a bad person, I just dont fit in anywhere. And Im so hurt by being so alone. And more over, Im so scared that my daughter will end up the same as me. And I want so much more for her than this. 

I dont really know why Im writing this, I guess I just needed to talk to someone, anyone, anywhere.

lonely,wanted-lifepurpose,2018/02/23,"Lonely and losing hope Hi everyone, this is my first post so apologies if its a bit of a jumble.

2017 was the worst year of my life so far and 2018 hasn't been much of an improvement.

I've bounced between active and passive suicidal ideation for a year now. My immediate family and ""friends"" are turning my back on me because I have left the family religion. One friend said that she wouldn't shun me for leaving but has avoided meeting with me for about 5 months now. 

I have been in a long distance relationship for 6 months and I'm scared that my mental health issues will ruin the relationship. He is the only person that makes me want to try in life so I'll do anything to make us work as long as he is happy being with me. Culturally we are miles apart so sometimes I can still feel lonely next to him.

I have been chronically ill for 8 years and have been unemployed for a year since all my issues came to a head. I am scared to get back into work - as long as I'm at home I can pretend that I'm not part of the real world, which is a small and strange comfort to me.

I don't know what I'm even asking for in this post, it's turning into more of a vent.

Does anyone have any tips on rebuilding your life and making new friends? I really need to get more involved in life so that I don't slip back into suicidal thoughts/self harm. Any help is appreciated, thank you.

She's perfect for me in every conceivable way, and for some reason she feels the same way about me. She's coming to visit me in June and I fully intend on eventually marrying her and helping her move here to live with me. I never believed in the concept of soul mates but this girl has convinced me otherwise. I was so depressed and lonely before I met her and now it feels like I finally have meaning.

lonely,sadcollegekidxyz,2018/02/23,"Loneliness has become overbearing lately I hate college so much. Its my second semester and I've made 0 friends. I know I'm bad at conversation and making friends so I've tried to come to terms with it and be comfortable with myself but its really starting to affect me. Every day is the exact same: go to class and go straight to the library afterward, eat alone in the dining hall, go home, rinse and repeat. I'm having a hard time remembering the last time i even SPOKE to a classmate. I have an amazing best friend who I talk to every day, but not having much physical interaction is taking its toll, and I don't wanna become clingy and needy.

lonely,coolsauze,2018/02/23,"boring af and dont know how to talk to people (venting) which is the reason why i don't have any friends and probably wont have any sort of friends in the future. I think i also give off weird vibes too which i just feel is what makes people go away, especially since i look strong (and a little handsome? i really dont want to sound egotistical) on the outside which i suppose what makes me inviting? despite that muscular outlook i have a very soft, squishy body under my clothes. its weird. i hardly know how to talk to people. even online! I DONT UNDERSTAND MEMES! i dont even like music, so no connection will come from there either. and i guess because i hardly talk most of the time when i have to speak my voice is so low and soft that it even varies in pitch every once in a while to a point i cant control it. i sound white most of the time even though i am black. when i talk like this i feel like when people hear me they would think im a pussy or something, which is something i think i might be. i dont really follow anything trendy or popular because i hate that type of stuff. if i wasnt popular or anything of the sort, why would i follow what is? and i just find that is something most people do just to be able to connect with other people in some way or another easily. im not going to get into stuff i dont find an interest in just to connect with people. i dont even want to be a poser for the sake of other people. im not gonna become another carbon copy of some stupid fad. the only stuff that i do like is stuff that literally interests me in some emotional or psychological level that i dont get sometimes. this encompasses a whole bunch of stuff that is on separate spectrums of popularity that it seems weird to even like either side of these things. i dont know how i will ever find someone. EVER. not a lot of girls or guys (hey cant knock it till you try it) will ever be interested in someone so fucking boring, weird, shy, and so short sighted unless they are the same thing (and looking at the college i just started NO ONE is like that). the only way i think such a thing will be possible will just be someone forcing themselves on me in such an invasive way that i wont have no control over. in the end i might even let a woman rape me just so i can lose my virginity. even if such a thing happens i would still chicken out or somehow fuck it up once a relationship begins.

I made a friend a while back, and we clicked just about instantly, and have grown to be close friends fast.

She's already one of my best friends. I'm lucky to have met her. But, like the pathetic piece of shit that I am, I got feelings for her. And then I learned she has a boyfriend, so I have to accept that we're just not gonna be together.

lonely,FuriousBJs,2018/02/24,"Does anyone enjoy being lonely? I know it's more common to seek help or companionship while experiencing loneliness; but I personally can comfortably say that I enjoy feeling lonely. 

I recently moved out of my parents home, while at the same time, I broke up with my girlfriend. I had the idea that just living with her will be the best thing ever. But now, it's just me, my work, and video games; and honestly, I can't be any happier.

I guess dealing with people is Somthing I've always hated. I hated going to school, I hate being around family, and I hate going out. I feel this huge sense of responsibility that would overwhelm me when I meet someone, and the very thought of concerning myself over the problems of another person is just too much. My ex always brought her problems to me, and I honestly began to like her less and less the more she did this.

This is why I prefer being alone. But I feel that in the long run, this might all come back to haunt me, this separation from people. What do you guys think?

lonely,TkopeDubRave,2018/02/24,"I've never felt lonelier in my life I lost my ex best friend, my ex girlfriend ( they ended up together ) and together with them a couple of other friends because the two of them painted me as a medication dependant maniac ( I'll never confide in someone about my antidepressant use again because of this ). Before that, my ex best friend avoided me for about a year, preferring to hang out and do drugs with his cheating ex, even when I tried to reach out countless times so we can hang out and talk, but he refused every time. And then he ends up siding with my ex after an argument and ends up dating her, like what the fuck man.

Now I have a small group of friends, we play DnD, WH40k, watch stuff but only during the weekends, I still feel completely lonely. Ever since I felt two of the people I trusted so much betray me (then take it a step further and insult me over social media and mutual friends to rationalize their actions) I lost all the hope I had for being happy. 

How do I go on and trust someone again, when the two people who I trusted the most, one of who ( my ex ) made me feel happy for the first time in 10 or more years ( since I was a child ), ruined every good memory I had of her, together with that scumbag of an ex best friend. This happened a year ago and is still the biggest reason my depression is even worse than usual and why I gained a deep distrust of everyone.

I feel like I automatically see everyone as a potential enemy, and to protect myself I can't let myself talk about my problems and how I don't want to live anymore. It's like at the same time I wanna scream ""Help!"" and keep completely quiet about it.

I've never felt so lonely in my life, not even the support of my family makes a difference, just want this all to end and have no will to change it.",6.994591136079903,5.8427359185393275,7.536254681647938,76.25774656679151,64.81460674157303,10.49538077403246,32.418227215980025,9.586721724236666,2.786282646691635,1401,45,276,23,18,465,185,356,0.187,0.625,0.188,0.0927,0,5,1,0,0,1,40.0,2,0,4,7,21,35,5,1,23,0,15,5,0,7,6,58,36,28,0,6,5,7,6,3,7,1,4,2,0,2,14,23,0,4,8,2,0,5,7,14,0,5,9,10,45,21,46,24,9,53,0,6,2,1,36,18,1,4,33,198,59,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07139562678865229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.079876025539464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981953159690475,0.0,0.06853531307943868,0.0,0.2535715919887695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08520276058716206,0.0,0.16889351732682284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08911819532919839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06937070989865124,0.0,0.0,0.08414925153400102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09340315407482183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2853452371195053,0.0,0.0,0.1595917018041892,0.07285485360116815,0.13572022398744782,0.15392267246528424,0.0,0.0,0.07592783317719205,0.0,0.12217337149252412,0.05753922364515269,0.2319988631132673,0.0,0.0,0.068508987331884,0.0,0.0,0.3733593142993535,0.07445978472491283,0.0,0.0,0.045773876880482164,0.06755481154183803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07122302801255652,0.17147692154654726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053985607429635485,0.0,0.0,0.07999638303243009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07158943370548206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235965582671395,0.11377839846185757,0.1180462642454604,0.0,0.07112006499951565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17584222302160266,0.0,0.0,0.0762107914692499,0.053762412990335066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08113759543265624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059207640113196014,0.0,0.1863568758838503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054577346253777095,0.06125582329138547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11167536857431512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07706782025145767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08281059421198682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06418154926190961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13325035576948793,0.0,0.0,0.08210243003372852,0.1364859569907832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12864189663362538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09220132490531566,0.0,0.09139811150568826,0.0,0.0,0.06055756332089216,0.12947322363923033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.187858760591708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05468273369974185,0.0,0.2360335036584975,0.0,0.0,0.06956243146722807,0.08870563835473795,0.0,0.09501152128692784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07267663096940802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08207918282140822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15559922942271612

lonely,Cordbish,2018/02/24,"Transferred Universities unexpectedly I went to auburn university for a year and a half and during my time there I made a whole new friend group of people that I cared about and they cared about me and I met my girlfriend whom I love, we’ve been dating for over a year now, and my parents made me transfer back home to go to school here. I’ve never felt more alone in my life, I have a couple friends here that I hang out with consistently and a lot of the time they are busy, plus I am struggling so much with the fact that my gf lives so far away. I have honestly never felt like this before and I’m not entirely sure how to go about dealing with it or distracting myself. Or whether or not dealing with it or distracting myself is the better option.",6.629155629139074,5.878486112582781,6.618932119205301,81.22654387417221,65.35761589403974,9.669205298013246,30.133278145695357,8.841846274778883,2.0593105960264904,597,17,125,8,8,190,91,151,0.07400000000000001,0.772,0.154,0.9256,1,1,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,2,1,11,12,0,3,9,0,6,2,0,3,4,31,18,16,0,0,7,1,2,1,4,0,1,0,1,0,7,13,0,0,2,0,0,4,4,3,0,1,7,2,20,9,20,11,4,19,0,0,0,1,13,5,0,6,11,91,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15907036590241586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14430054421690194,0.11809933344273298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13069167938722218,0.0,0.0,0.13583569288230848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31318545447344365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16994168536198986,0.0,0.0,0.31668400760396576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2949362372363685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2373226959367473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17457467027662565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15406081961118046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1084834175612005,0.07503511122674793,0.0,0.13562060659359035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13057462927404145,0.13861874611501698,0.2906564769902188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11290450967924905,0.0,0.2369123495638569,0.14833579763962218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170540780921315,0.0,0.0,0.10647825777236383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15543878430441535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605630382231552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14475443339337235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17911625267455122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14237718297402155,0.0,0.17147499705898667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19781067297906912

lonely,throwaway6789009,2018/02/24,"x I’m desperately lonely. For years I’ve always been the cheery extrovert, cracking jokes, trying my best to play it cool so that people will like me. It’s all I’ve done so it’s second nature to me even though I’m shit at it or else I wouldn’t be here. In fact to be liked has been my sole motivation in life for so long that I don’t even know who or what the real me even is. I don’t know what I find funny, despite making jokes to get laughs. I go to the gym to look good in order to make a good impression on others, but in reality I hate the gym. I try to eat healthy, I play sports, study, clean my room, shower, even smile - all only for the sake of what other people will think but if it’s not working, what’s the point? I’ve come to realise that all I can talk about are my achievements and even then the only reason why I ultimately do what I do is so that people will like me but in reality I live alone, I only have a handful of friends I’ve made in life that I keep in touch with on the phone and even then my conversations are hollow. I rarely see any of them, maybe one once every 3 weeks? I started dating 3 months ago and in that time I’ve been on several tinder dates but they never work out. And the amount of effort I desperately put into that and r4r is exhausting. I hate it but I wouldn’t stop until I’d lost hope and I’m certainly getting there. I always get attached more or less instantly but I actively try to avoid being clingy. I had a good thing going with someone, we had our third date on Valentine’s but she cancelled on our fourth at the last minute and seemed genuine about it, I then tried to be funny in my response, came across as creepy and fucked it all up. I haven’t gone about things passively, I have hobbies, I could say what I’m “passionate” about, talk about things most people would find interesting and list achievements. I dress reasonably well, I write with a fucking fountain pen at work and I try my hardest not to shy away from things. Don’t get me wrong I don’t come across as some super eccentric weirdo, completely out of touch with everyone else, or at least I hope I don’t, but that may explain things idk. I’ve built this persona to be liked but I’ve failed miserably and that’s been such a big part of me for so long that I don’t even know who I really am. It feels like I’ve had this one task and failed at it, now I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m not sure if I even want to do anything anymore.

lonely,izzyjones19,2018/02/24,Just want somebody to relate to(New to Reddit) It seems like I live in a town where everyone is friends with eachother and I am the constant third wheel in the way. I've had one really good friend but she was forced to disconnect from me due to a paranoid and insecure boyfriend. None of my old friends from high school want to make time for me even when they make time for others. And I don't count co-workers as people to hang out with on that type of level. I can't relate to my family either plus I'm really close to getting a divorce. I'm the loneliest I've been in my life. ,2.585750000000001,4.224019408333337,3.5450000000000017,91.02,75.75,6.8000000000000025,23.666666666666664,7.554174236665415,0.9143166666666662,459,14,99,6,10,147,82,120,0.119,0.762,0.119,-0.6013,0,0,0,0,1,0,9.0,0,0,1,0,4,6,0,1,6,0,7,1,0,2,0,16,15,7,0,2,3,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,0,3,8,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,1,0,2,3,0,11,5,23,12,2,18,0,0,0,0,6,10,0,1,7,62,14,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21809942800200968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13330247162004316,0.0,0.0,0.19285093566292955,0.0,0.0,0.19026116733235446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4677848425308469,0.0,0.10544441186190164,0.0,0.0,0.1692799170611422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21323753394580894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14255385675263485,0.09860073306781132,0.0,0.1782137856612173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26943741250390224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19492232567320425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21177973871035524,0.0,0.13676077893481836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13991895394693452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25858651360609325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2042560853047864,0.0,0.18373247008990354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23536972930846295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2380813753487157,0.1601980440823692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14692986024629964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,perksofhalesx,2018/02/24,"Lonely but hopeful I am a lonely 23 year old female. That is a big part of why I am here. I am probably one of the most empathetic people in this world, yet I always feel like I am getting shunned or walked on. Would be lovely to meet some genuine kind people who won't make me feel alone. I am just looking for companionship (this is where the hopeful part plays in the title).  
I have tried so hard to maintain ""friendships"" but it is ALWAYS me putting in all the work (texting, calling, trying to make plans, making sure they're okay, etc) and I am so tired of everything feeling so one-sided. I just want someone to care about me and make me feel like a human being. Like I matter.  I never have anyone to talk to, and it makes me feel unimportant.",4.344799999999998,5.040532546666668,5.206666666666667,84.45000000000003,70.2,7.333333333333332,27.0,7.1686216300943375,1.2838000000000005,582,18,117,5,10,190,93,150,0.1,0.625,0.275,0.9854,0,5,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,2,9,13,0,0,7,1,15,2,0,5,3,28,32,9,0,4,5,0,6,3,0,2,1,0,0,1,6,3,0,0,5,1,0,2,2,2,0,1,0,7,16,11,15,28,6,13,0,2,1,1,7,7,0,5,7,81,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.135808994597833,0.0,0.0,0.21821789280632006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09168770106473753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13389628267018086,0.0,0.13369366900430893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462423096872482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11784933284671155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33151111957959273,0.18735564600355506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06850893395875841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746487365533342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2604792534814013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13654956584639932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921874566157601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11011444002937083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11834808096085996,0.0,0.4376445743616975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10113394729291032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13759670974420835,0.0,0.17771136481778954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28399755067474297,0.0,0.18181519923660416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413780922276154,0.0,0.0,0.1318197925059845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110427384336044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235865269511794,0.0,0.0,0.10539566715693033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507122716438223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17805452087323373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07734265350134117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832256573888017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095462698444054,0.0,0.0,0.09314952281671622,0.0,0.0,0.0844420909752874

lonely,Ilovebeer1999,2018/02/25,"If you need someone to talk to I'm here do my best to help! Hey all I've been wanting to do this for a while, If your a recovering alcoholic drug addict or just severely mentally ill I want to hear, if not help the best I can.


I am not God, I don't know the answers to everything but I want to do something right and generous with my life.


Little bit about me, I'm severely lonely at times comes and goes. I'm a ex self harmer slip up from time to time but it's mostly minor injuries now, was a severely depressed more moderately now. 

And also I'm want to be more socail, what better way to fulfill a meaningful life then trying to help poeple. I won't judge or criticise, I can secrets, 100% privacy when we talk. 


So if your out thier and struggling I'd could do with the company and clarity knowing that I can help or atleast try to. Looking to make long term platonic friends if possible but all topics and rules are in your hands. You can pick me up and then just dissappear the chat what we chat about how much time you spend it's all up to you. Your 100% in control and in the drivers seat.

Anyone?

lonely,SORRYMOMIMALONEAGAIN,2018/02/25,"I'm very strange, I need to vent I spent a lot of time with a girl from my school in my head and I paid no attention to another who liked me, I feel like an asshole for doing that, another girl wanted to enter into a relationship with me, we exchanged messages, but when simply I went away from her, as if I was not ready for a relationship, it happened last year, this year I'm in another school, and I miss the girl who wanted to date me, I do not see her because I live a place far from where I live, sometimes I go out to the street to buy a snack in the hope of seeing her somewhere, I do not know why but I'm very sad for everything I did with the other girl, all because I had someone in my head who did not even know I existed, I lost 2 amazing girls for being an idiot, I'm alone now, that crying all day, I do not feel motivated to do anything else.

I do not understand how I am so strange, I only give value when I lose, I feel so alone,I do not have any friends because I'm very shy, and that also makes me sad, I'm sorry for the long text, I needed to vent on how trash I'm feeling.",7.113319327731091,3.733153525210085,8.0701512605042,79.59396638655461,66.26890756302521,11.200672268907564,34.72436974789916,8.841846274778883,2.600116302521009,841,26,199,10,10,290,121,238,0.197,0.731,0.07200000000000001,-0.9827,0,2,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,0,3,10,11,1,0,13,0,14,3,2,4,2,39,44,14,0,6,10,0,4,2,1,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,1,0,9,0,4,3,8,6,0,0,8,6,34,5,30,35,3,25,0,5,2,0,17,12,0,3,12,127,43,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12068843701162504,0.0,0.09318784117481398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07924341149926932,0.3665710421989532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589306966791407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10948241077252903,0.0,0.0,0.2131041717120226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12800114294380216,0.07515127606778882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973446528305687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696600978811599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047283490040602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2356813493392779,0.0832480210476176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09002967044648062,0.0,0.0,0.111784805564229,0.06622586167442067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10304581395866397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2391838262987548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573914551726913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12808208971985158,0.09498632298432634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11385992913985135,0.0,0.205793693168343,0.10312410184703677,0.0,0.13036564317594887,0.1272046801798954,0.0990684080661759,0.0,0.0,0.07778371352021476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17280889000710936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0886252150028791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1217475353168748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25021611115678705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358662321830001,0.1857163383633616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873426421552127,0.0,0.11524971785344022,0.13044417396831118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06794873594473383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1213103325458655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28844477851768785,0.13746311859608593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10802313543299548,0.1051488935951416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150081134286867

lonely,Killofarts,2018/02/25,"First post here About a week ago I (17m) got my first girlfriend and I was really exited, but four days later she left for another guy because I was to nervous to make any kind of move. Now I just sit at home with this agonising lonely feeling in my chest and think that I'll never be able to find any kind of companionship. I tried texting my friends to see if they wanted to hang out so I wouldn't feel as lonely but they don't respond. I hate being cooped up in my house with nothing to do and no where to go with just my thoughts to keep me company and make my loneliness worse.",3.0295810564663017,4.090066803278688,4.301584699453553,88.36627504553736,73.59016393442623,7.717304189435335,25.030965391621127,8.167268648758528,1.25616102003643,458,14,102,7,9,151,85,122,0.177,0.7490000000000001,0.07400000000000001,-0.9289,0,4,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,2,2,7,7,1,1,1,0,7,1,1,2,1,24,19,9,0,3,5,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,2,8,0,1,5,0,0,3,4,4,0,3,4,3,17,3,21,12,0,21,0,2,1,0,8,8,0,1,8,66,19,0,0.17579915921686398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1558353475314498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2390989133550153,0.1843407466499456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10716553574979752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11337591419330018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17777867414751786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16067724665391156,0.2990693500456448,0.0,0.0,0.1358219943222796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991071347615778,0.0,0.14060264718455115,0.0,0.0,0.17406880672913475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735652739143043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17634089048181475,0.0,0.0,0.20284862648933105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15625837019539487,0.0,0.3661355432417661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910063008705204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23469460776020026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18684668473071567,0.0,0.0,0.13558714926243856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16868403459812434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1683669991537216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11262144298906668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400891691019686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11264500276723642,0.0,0.13956489546154993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193560893483662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10369089890526352,0.0,0.1410154814819518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1791543621843312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,belshiir,2018/02/25,"Just getting some things off my chest I don't know or care if anyone reads or responds to this, but I just feel like I need to share my feelings in some way. I'm almost 20, working my way through college, and I've never been in a relationship.  Never even been close. No flings, no dates, no back-and-forth flirting, nothing. I know that that's not that bad, I'm still young and there's plenty of time, but the longer that it goes on the more I lose hope. I like to think that I'm a somewhat desireable person. I'm in good shape, I dress nice, take care of my self, am somewhat succesful acedemically, and I have a decent amount of friendly relationships that I mantain; yet, as more time goes on, the louder the little voice in the back of my head telling me that I'm worthless and that I'll be alone forever becomes. 

I've struggled with depression before in my life and I've been (thankfully) mostly over that for nearly a year now, but I still have this deep pain and emptiness that won't go away no matter how much I try to improve myself personally. I just crave to have someone who I can cuddle with, who I can talk to about anything, who I can feel completely comfortable and happy around. Someone that I can put all my love and emotion and caring into and receive all the love and emotion and caring that they have to give back. Instead, I'm alone. I have a loving family but I'm not that close with them. I have friends but they don't care about me on a deep level. I just want a partner. 

And the catalyst that makes this all hurt so much more is that I'm deeply in love with my flatmate. We've been good friends for a while, but I made the mistake of accidentaly falling in love with her (after agreeing to live together but before actually moving in). She's nearly perfect to me in every way, and it tears me up inside every day to see her and to talk to her and to know that my feelings aren't recipricated. I really just want to get over her but constantly being around her is intoxicating. At this point, it seems like my whole life has been me feeling unrequited love for girls, except this time there's no escape from the longing and the pain. 

I don't know where I'm going with post, but, after spending an evening listening to her and my other friends speak in depth about their relationships afterwhich I cried myself to sleep, I realy feel like I need to tell someone what I've been dealing with. Sorry for the meandering and all the whining; don't feel the need to respond to this in anyway, just getting this off my chest is all I wanted.",7.015709769682374,5.937023279843447,7.107876712328771,79.10826396206531,64.73385518591,9.818485623965076,32.76539214210448,8.730908602173464,2.4410839379798284,2020,67,409,25,26,651,224,511,0.129,0.6579999999999999,0.214,0.9959,0,2,0,0,0,0,55.0,0,0,4,3,26,39,0,1,22,0,29,16,4,3,8,92,81,35,0,10,21,0,7,4,5,1,5,3,0,5,32,31,0,0,13,1,1,6,15,10,0,0,7,11,56,29,70,71,17,66,0,5,1,7,44,36,0,11,24,287,88,3,0.0,0.0,0.06641031610993459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814566471734393,0.1409656279807889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0475845300120932,0.0,0.05600216192807682,0.12116393482857488,0.0,0.0,0.06393842347098119,0.15698662609238334,0.056821758840463615,0.0,0.07515965006120663,0.115816887401803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34692496001566114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07135271074220689,0.07354156507798536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07475348071494943,0.04388882268577672,0.07016008253660523,0.05861430652547502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531018640249966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989727741616423,0.0,0.114675874329795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06415470295986689,0.0,0.2408689594144757,0.09723474639086584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21031159812218256,0.0,0.10666530143738584,0.06528303665724867,0.07735264794757712,0.1141599512753719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07244412559896242,0.0,0.0,0.06984243708824447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06759239631312079,0.0,0.0,0.0728525881544021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496015082928906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09613627903137,0.1329898440187875,0.0682073999937794,0.060092412144601225,0.060225130661946236,0.0,0.07613436387301524,0.0,0.0,0.36852518352790464,0.06439378663205121,0.045426182882783925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07233001007242335,0.1000541805414725,0.15138223451867733,0.1049739778468884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06529908699810949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14482726313183175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884323387947494,0.0,0.0,0.06433247387907408,0.0,0.06517635976363906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06841247844419245,0.0,0.0,0.068071831110981,0.0,0.043596760186085,0.0,0.0,0.2191916979382823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05422976076233852,0.06195327300872671,0.0709945536290088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06810256225277668,0.0,0.1729843127849289,0.0,0.0,0.07618022635468827,0.0,0.0,0.10869509007934193,0.0,0.0,0.07114420522398114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05116769864561598,0.10939751414276323,0.11896336837981993,0.06265444116645723,0.0,0.0,0.04521166493214029,0.04360588038532631,0.0,0.0,0.1190474804810123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0462038015671209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12041900191665678,0.1620528993428763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759792073976014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049543696552486936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04382416797058091
lonely,watuknow,2018/02/25,"Lots of friends to no friends I went to college in Wisconsin and had a ton of friends. A girlfriend, people to hang out with whenever I wanted. People to talk to, and it felt amazing. Sure I had bumps along the road but nothing my friends could t get through. Then I had to transfer home and live with my parents. And I went into a shell. No more socializing no more hanging out, no more girlfriend. I’m embarrassed to go eat because I walk into the cafe every single day, every single meal alone and the cashier who works everyday notices it and tries to be extra nice to me cause I’m never with people (thanks Camille). But man isolation gets to you. I still keep in contact with my friends from Wisconsin but I’m always by myself. Wake up, gym, eat, class, work, smoke, bed. I talk to people a lot actually. I sometimes find a group of people I know in the cafe and sit with them. And I actually train people in the gym which is nice, I always get a long with people but it’s just being friendly. I don’t invite people to my house (My family is lonely too, they don’t like new people) and they sure don’t invite me to hang out. I’m not interested in girls unless I know for a fact they won’t like me back. I know this because I do have chances to get to know a lot of girls but I always shut it down, I’m genuinely uninterested in every girl I’ve met here that actually wants a chance to get to know me. I think I’m just scared to get in another relationship. Haven’t even been close to a relationship. I’ve had sex a couple times but I never talk to them again. And I’m serious. Never. One girl asked if I would like to try and date once after sex, and suddenly our friendship was over. I play basketball with some guys sometime, but we play ball, dap each other up then leave. They need another player and they message me because I’m somewhat capable of playing basketball. Once the games over they don’t need me until next time. I’m not mad, I just notice that that is how our relationship is, basketball only and saying hi to each other when we pass each other on campus. I’m taking a bunch of Psychology classes and everyone in that major is really cool. Before and after class we talk about material, or the teacher or the test we had and it’s always a nice conversation but of course the conversation ends and we part ways. Most psychology majors are girls, and I’m bad at being friends with girls. I don’t message them to hang out, nor do I really want to. I just want a couple homies to chill with everyday and talk sports with and talk about girls with or some dumb shit. Don’t want a relationship or anything like that. Except I kind of do, but not while I live at home. It sounds dumb, it even sounds dumb to me but I really can’t face having a girlfriend with her having the pressure of being my ONLY friend. Like, no, I don’t want all my social needs pushed onto one person. That wouldn’t be fair to them. I work at an elementary after school program and it is the high light of my life right now. I love being with the kids and teaching them and hanging out with them, it’s awesome, they like me and I like them. And I like my co workers, they’re very smart and very nice people. And we have a good relationship. But outside of work and Class and the gym I’m so so so lonely. I told my parents I would like to regularly speak to a therapist but nothing was set up, and I don’t want to talk about it with them again. My whole family has issues with friends. My mom and Dad have zero friends. Zero. It’s work and then home for them. I’m so scared of living a life like that forever. I would literally kill myself if I had to do this every single day for years on years on years. I’ve been lonely like this for about a year. I’m not really depressed at this moment, although that comes and goes. I have a job I like, I have a major I LOVE, I have a big boy internship set up for this summer and I graduate next December. I’m excited for the future. I plan on moving somewhere nice and warm after college and then I plan on meeting new people, and maybe start opening myself up to a girlfriend. I plan on getting a masters, hell maybe more, I’ve never enjoyed school this much. I think I’m gonna get all A’s (except for English whoops). I’m not really sad, I’m just demoralized. I know a lot of this is done by my own hand, but I’ve have tried to make friends. I’ve met a bunch of people and I’ve hung out with different groups of people but, I think I miss my Wisconsin friends too much. I think my Wisconsin friends are so amazing that all other friendships just don’t compare. My last relationship started out amazingly, and went downhill fast, learning even the people you love the most can bring you down without really worrying about it makes me hesitate on meeting anyone new. I’m lonely, I don’t have anyone here I would truly label as a friend however I don’t think this will be my life forever and I have hope this will change.

lonely,dicimagnifi,2018/02/25,"My dad [55] died three months ago and I [23/F] feel completely lost. My dad was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in May 2016.

Before this event, I already had a hard life. My parents were divorced and my mom had full custody except the two weekends per month he got to see me. To say my mom and I had a rotten relationship would be a deep understatement. She has psychological problems that she refuses exist and won’t get treatment. I’ve witnessed (and prevented) her from killing herself twice and after the fact she’s told me it would have been my fault anyway. She also had kicked me out more than once telling me she never wanted to see my fucking face again.
I got pregnant at 18 and gave my son up for adoption because I couldn’t financially support him the way he deserves and I didn’t want him raised the way I was.
I had a drinking problem in high school. I also smoked weed most days.
My oldest brother sexually assaulted me when I was 16.

I was finally free of the life I lived with my mom when I turned 18 (2013) and moved in with my dad. He always wanted to be a bigger part of my life but my mom wouldn’t let him. This was my best opportunity to live with someone supportive and nurturing. I hadn’t felt happy with myself and doubted my ability to keep living. Living with my dad changed me entirely.

Only 3 years later he was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. They detected it in early stages but his prognosis was still only 3 years max. We only got a year and a half. I’m the 5th of 6 kids and I cared for him completely on my own from 21 years old. I did anything he asked to make him happy and we made the best of our time.

Our time was up only a couple days after Thanksgiving. Christmas was his favorite holiday and it was his goal to make it at least until then. I was there with him until his last breath, coaching him on how to leave this world even though I had no idea where the words were coming from. My dad was all I had in this world and our time was so short. My mom STILL has shown no support. She didn’t even come for the funeral that I planned. She never read the eulogy I wrote.

I stayed strong through everything until only recently. I feel weak and alone. I wake up dreading what’s to come. I feel no purpose. I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 3 years and still feel like there’s no one on this earth who understands me.",2.6797295953872187,4.584196651356994,3.8357277065314648,87.87545059151013,76.22338204592901,6.9836166616959945,24.13962620538821,7.8761006319780495,1.2063229545680492,1872,61,388,29,42,608,236,479,0.11,0.7659999999999999,0.123,0.9408,1,1,2,0,1,0,45.0,5,0,1,7,17,24,3,2,19,0,40,15,5,4,4,68,74,31,3,9,3,13,6,1,0,5,8,1,0,1,13,33,1,3,7,5,1,4,12,11,0,5,37,10,79,14,53,28,9,68,0,1,2,1,57,24,1,3,37,262,92,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061766719022218926,0.0,0.0,0.07216700208341742,0.07689311881905543,0.11144542583750912,0.05797896954994448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05734033458269964,0.0,0.06514097549143541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0424760084305484,0.0,0.059292166992367175,0.0,0.14624878281645162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07104294762025751,0.0,0.07371172731186229,0.18006829375617564,0.146115370067151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07709909945829789,0.0,0.08987509376781798,0.0,0.0,0.14144655798489586,0.07231637445924248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682594341171271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204537445780793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06262348877747817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14092830141757495,0.04977908619203607,0.06690329756382693,0.07633054379801428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06441762343754072,0.036404690237014065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16718731032461714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1483503585354628,0.06241919253519072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.073620272835025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865973329039012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061934387798512784,0.07709010089998328,0.0,0.0,0.05679813525172889,0.0,0.07378058511012461,0.0,0.07125206331298492,0.14765018569124638,0.03404190967632607,0.0,0.2461132856033829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606346263875073,0.0,0.0,0.06593247730812359,0.09302328466029576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4080392483907355,0.11123510796580637,0.07405833694865745,0.0,0.0,0.10748233291328917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07311696893263146,0.07420644926336148,0.04721666806027962,0.2649721975908941,0.0,0.0,0.0773708969752817,0.07545616507920402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13334784252873194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06969840872524892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06880015183932052,0.14961952497087294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055411976839713835,0.0,0.07051942709192105,0.11105116371920867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059039258671150736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07426913175093196,0.1669385417830112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2372145911364376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060903000090822376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06845980649850772,0.0,0.1218921221429901,0.0,0.0,0.06658179841642169,0.0,0.0,0.07579134407708428,0.06806679790748521,0.07253887148057334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12329641610771595,0.11061677083527524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09899670971116316,0.0,0.0,0.2243567362157222
lonely,ThinkAgainBucko,2018/02/26,"No friends, No life, No one to talk to... I'm female and I'll be 28 in less than a month. I currently have no friends or anyone to talk to really. I used to have friends but they all moved away and we lost contact. I haven't hung out with anyone in literally years. 

I've never dated and I feel like it's hard for me to get attracted to people. (I've wondered since I was in my early teens if I was asexual but I think I just don't get attached easily and am too nervous around people.)

I lost my job in December and have been searching for a new one but just keep getting rejections. I feel hopeless and alone and I barely leave my room anymore.

I can't afford a cell phone (never had one) so if by some chance I did meet someone it would be hard for us to communicate and get to know each other. I feel like I have nothing to offer anyone. I get anxious and depressed a lot and I don't want to put those burdens on someone else. 

I'm terrified of the thought of aging and I think it's because every birthday I get anxiety attacks about being another year older and having accomplished nothing and not moving forward.

I used to talk to people online but it feels like all the social networks I used to be a part of are dead these days and I have no one to talk to anywhere.

Sorry for being dismal; I just feel so down all the time and alone.",2.0914247311827943,3.761450405017925,3.915793010752687,87.69368951612906,77.2078853046595,6.513799283154122,24.528225806451612,7.333567415737692,1.0770870967741932,1049,36,219,13,24,354,145,279,0.238,0.6729999999999999,0.08900000000000001,-0.992,3,2,0,0,0,1,24.0,2,0,1,3,8,15,1,1,8,0,23,1,0,3,5,54,48,24,1,4,11,0,7,3,3,1,1,0,1,0,7,20,0,1,10,0,0,4,12,8,0,4,8,7,30,7,36,34,8,27,0,5,0,0,16,11,0,6,17,152,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19205012620857764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722004949534876,0.07092693135707719,0.10474187003430506,0.09194863914473812,0.19448602738059906,0.0,0.0,0.08253625124461868,0.0,0.10547700975975492,0.08710905256175555,0.0,0.0,0.056518370892656676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05979368202508206,0.0,0.07985553022457252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745171503066252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07811661769462527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343981433017086,0.1987074322696213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148947736819785,0.0,0.29063942602969395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16610934995421409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0920056039179934,0.08240959614483206,0.0,0.0,0.050953890250037985,0.0,0.0,0.09817208885692387,0.0,0.0,0.06548754042266892,0.1358879999371971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024193492581028,0.07882321100305288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07400444769399186,0.19708332821345195,0.0,0.0,0.1430154710966764,0.08954499003106532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17792561319984884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25130507845243744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10040160744051632,0.0,0.19283129256328727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09320445918376156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593957790700849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669503330823109,0.0,0.0,0.09451154662606,0.15711470272728326,0.0,0.0,0.10378715929254582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980841031813173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188164086720396,0.0,0.07360557169897447,0.05406302226220097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152505970896176,0.2402286868611384,0.0,0.0,0.05468587117600189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10054576042126892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06586227100124847,0.0,0.0,0.11941119420803745
lonely,potatowithglasses,2018/02/26,"I don't have anyone. Scrolling through this sub just makes me feel repetitive. But whatever, I'm just gonna go with it.

I don't have anyone to talk to. To tell em how I'm feeling. I don't have someone to look up to. There are friends. But they just get to that basic level of friends. I have a good friend in Berkeley, but I'm all the way down in socal. I can barely tell him anything either.

I get jealous at other deep friendships.

There are loads of other problems, but I'm just focusing on this. I can't really talk to someone. I typed out how I'm feeling on a google doc, it just feels scripted. I don't have anyone to ask for help. No one to feel a comfort to. I'm sorry, but I'm never able to really connect or feel comforted by people online. And a therapist who I don't know who's job it is to listen to me? I'll prob do that one day, but it doesn't feel comfortable.

lonely,dddesigner,2018/02/26,"Realizing how lonely I am... I've been trying to make the effort in meeting people, going to fun events alone but as a form of exposure therapy, and putting myself out there. So I form these relationships with people, getting to know them and stuff. But I'm still finding that we're not relating enough. I do try to show my interest in their interests, but I'm not getting any kind of recip. or love back for what I have to say. I'm just left feeling hollow. Maybe this is how difficult it is to make connections with people. I had a firm belief and intention to connect with people, but my god, I'm going nowhere and the people around me are terrible or something. It's also how I feel this world works now. We're all disconnected regardless of how connected we feel with our social media, number of friends, follows, likes, whatever. I just want some honest connection and I'm not getting any of it. Nobody wants to talk to me half the time. I'm feeling lonely and unwanted. Often questioning my existence, any purpose I have, sometimes whispering to myself 'kill me now' at life. I'm tired of feeling devalued, people expecting things for free from me (consultations, opinions on work related stuff).",5.1580470588235325,6.8942808622222245,6.091764705882351,74.96117647058824,69.26666666666667,9.56078431372549,31.45751633986928,9.916854025145753,3.3964300653594783,954,41,163,24,17,315,135,225,0.112,0.72,0.16699999999999998,0.9144,0,5,1,0,0,1,34.0,2,0,2,3,15,14,1,0,5,0,9,3,0,7,1,50,33,19,1,5,11,0,5,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,11,13,0,0,10,1,1,4,3,5,0,1,2,7,21,10,30,31,5,18,1,2,0,1,13,8,0,6,7,111,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12626042040655416,0.0,0.09749016802974993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24870584203647225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10852439398668924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09374009675291023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12596404882942774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3082029540938425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1114221428680667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941861898380642,0.0,0.19107644885051772,0.0,0.1385667980105374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13487367173108775,0.126948922942501,0.06699771285057221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1324539210591331,0.0,0.08610756523197836,0.05955832587041195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11002716352238953,0.0,0.16274971510152714,0.0,0.12247345454986408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5070959451521043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255169452506876,0.1365653985321181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13088408537474872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09694651695872697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12427034385095875,0.0,0.09385110440845984,0.12057060467615865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09735627022082508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791120882729177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09798541903406163,0.0,0.0,0.1394129721932354,0.0,0.08099057768025912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108581550069837,0.14011586518643904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16553571232387862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14380956099933612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.177501651851308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Killigans,2018/02/26,"Just need to vent This is my 1st post on reddit in general. And honestly I'm only posting it hoping that it will allow me to simply let go of the loneliness that I've fallen into. Hopefully someone reads this and understands how I feel. I guess I'll begin.

Ever since I finished high school my life has basically turned for the worse. All of the people that I considered to be friends basically abandoned me the moment we were no longer classmates. What made it even worse was stepping out of a relationship on the day I got my degree. Anyway it's now been about 5 months into college. And what I've experienced in these 5 months in a bunch of backstabs from multiple people I considered friends and also a sense of nobody actually understanding me. What I am left with is nobody to really talk to or have an emotional connection with. The people who I've helpes over the years and considered friends either abandoned me or simply forgot that I existed. Ironically what makes me happy now a days is getting a text about a shop coupon since besides that nobody really texts me. And I tried to make new friends I really did expecially now in college however what I'm notixing is that I simply always get the feeling that  I'm annoying to them or that they simply don't want to talk to me... and yes I have family and I could talk to them however the loneliness remains... Heck lately I don't even feel any emotions and simply spend my nights thinking about everything that's wrong with the modern society... In the end it seems like I reach a conclusion that the only friendships I had so far were due to the circumstance...... 

Honestly I just feel so empty having nobody that shares my interests of deep conversations and such that it really eats at me and only deepens the hole of loneliness that I'm in...

Honestly I don't know what I wanted to achieve with this post heck mybe I'm only writing this at 3:40 am with the hopes that I'll actually sleep tonight... Well even if nobody replies at least I finally got something out of my system.. a sort of anger that is pointed towards myself.",4.889141666666667,6.513828297500003,5.9235000000000015,76.34216666666669,69.775,9.333333333333334,29.583333333333336,9.725611199111238,2.968983333333333,1669,65,297,40,30,553,197,400,0.094,0.7759999999999999,0.13,0.8983,2,0,1,0,0,0,37.0,1,0,3,2,19,20,2,0,24,1,24,3,1,5,2,59,56,19,0,8,7,0,4,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,33,21,1,3,10,2,3,3,4,5,1,0,10,5,39,15,48,42,4,49,0,2,0,0,17,22,2,10,21,204,72,5,0.0,0.0,0.17563005872042295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07196314350503627,0.07487698799016114,0.0,0.0,0.061194732291875574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07184786839115909,0.0,0.0,0.11606926388835685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09207989832646528,0.0,0.20244813565112574,0.07970240608793545,0.0,0.0,0.17830811201008406,0.08139904048604092,0.0,0.0,0.0808751561728595,0.0,0.08483240939088951,0.0,0.182001970966862,0.0,0.0,0.09857714367143074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780971428191964,0.0,0.09402973439582453,0.0,0.051142092437581665,0.0,0.14394279310190206,0.0,0.0991316138334374,0.0,0.0,0.09579359637314032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060316868782479466,0.0950769620034724,0.0,0.2681343177288002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04945489500955278,0.0,0.10151006257616152,0.0,0.09777191609798473,0.0920185358652288,0.06356098464993103,0.04396345229627936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08514855213680958,0.12013499761002525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14365467182139555,0.0,0.0,0.0667247507493966,0.0,0.08691069629594148,0.0,0.0844473749811661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737588502969036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18715845407439954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506747766648287,0.0,0.25855006939408953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001206736794798,0.0,0.23059373904581906,0.0,0.0,0.096613129392435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09107237221396723,0.0,0.08192143641082107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1488775361959686,0.0,0.09005270346602938,0.0,0.07624629924924224,0.0692769397278211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21698615092747148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057660494492699235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06109575181743707,0.0978807937476261,0.0,0.1873607706667472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10615417210516463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08090976324749258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834103397452668,0.0,0.09838744029715382,0.0,0.05794913836357572

lonely,bryanthemainlion,2018/02/27,"been crying every night lately. ive been lonely for a couple years now(20M). used to have lots of friends, now i have literally no one. ive had a couple relationships, but they all ended with them being a cheat. i dont think i could ever trust anyone again. my best friend told me he doesnt want to associate with me anymore. i try to meet people or talk to old friends/cousins, but they dont want to talk to me or become disinterested over time. no one messages me wishing me a happy birthday either. people tell me im unapproachable because i look like a model, but thats a bunch of bullshit. im not trying to boast, im just sharing my experiences with people ive met. sorry if it comes off like that.

But hey, atleast ive got myself. i cry pretty much every night nowadays. 

how have you guys been doing?",1.9031707317073163,4.0432755975609735,3.7331097560975617,86.55442073170731,79.60975609756099,5.5634146341463415,21.22560975609756,6.6274283507984215,0.4380073170731711,634,18,127,6,16,213,102,164,0.14,0.65,0.21,0.9574,0,2,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,3,1,5,10,1,0,6,0,17,0,0,2,2,24,27,8,0,5,10,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,3,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,6,2,0,2,7,1,23,8,15,18,6,13,0,1,1,0,18,2,0,4,12,83,26,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1177333680579464,0.08300827961025982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236755458518893,0.13111137687194482,0.0,0.0,0.12458405538260645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10226245009790837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09478425769428464,0.2627117516298716,0.260805678965399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2782661627132235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10514624256302896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107384502870593,0.2000449944235964,0.0,0.0,0.11612603752006165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834378099118561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09494722042640737,0.0,0.0,0.11754650209522388,0.0,0.12637431182594816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846976746963281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13391567690497816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11599629285852794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09969069047364897,0.0,0.0,0.1009272371929679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726917542793046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22281194782963565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124571409504908,0.0,0.160888695969162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2469060744303821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12077582122585385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274554688683102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328917093100586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1908372204227301,0.1037621317615284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07606777057074658,0.0,0.0,0.06922366396637318,0.0,0.0,0.113437258097329,0.0,0.16119936788556385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10253163313553362,0.0,0.0,0.1400423510042153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365163770086035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644855980850218

lonely,TriciaKoz,2018/02/27,"When You Stop Trusting Yourself Ever since I was a little girl I thought: you grow up, you meet someone and you have a family together. It didn't happen for me. There is no guarantee that it ever will and at this point in life (I'm 42 yrs old) I have stopped worrying about it. I've grown comfortable with the idea of growing old alone, but it doesn't mean I don't feel the sting of being lonely from time to time.

I don't trust myself anymore. I meet a man and I pour myself wholly into them and it devours a little bit of my soul every time. I hear: you'll find someone, and there are nice guys out there. At what point can I trust anyone or even myself anymore? I must have terrible judgement.

Three very bad relationships past and I just can't stop my cynicism from getting stronger, that wall getting thicker (cliché). I must sound sad but really I'm not. I'm numb. 

My last relationship ended almost 4 years ago and with it went all my friends. So, I move on, make new friends, meet new people but at the same time close off all romantic feelings. I tell myself I love being single! I tell myself a lot of things these days. 

The need for companionship is a primal desire inside of us. How do you forget how much it hurts when someone hurts you? You don't. You live on. :(",1.4662723214285691,3.839382546875002,2.8179017857142874,91.14406250000002,82.90625,5.5321428571428575,20.470982142857142,6.868970318607317,0.4114200892857141,996,29,205,12,28,322,150,256,0.165,0.684,0.151,-0.6026,0,3,0,0,0,0,35.0,1,9,1,0,13,16,1,0,10,0,21,3,0,3,6,42,36,16,0,4,6,0,2,0,2,4,2,2,0,3,13,12,0,3,6,0,0,5,8,8,0,1,4,4,37,8,23,26,7,42,1,4,0,1,26,16,0,3,21,135,50,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09513448927602733,0.0,0.1074674936028846,0.11115323906581816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21286919764961326,0.07504204700155152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08960939819166508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11716784227387543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06921381999552798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09505544884797378,0.0,0.0,0.07088517755099037,0.19415781050971867,0.09042342489474496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10117364264523354,0.0,0.10853046909514627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980903757769926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1658334423734492,0.0,0.11214264470497344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062656662264748,0.0949045018502968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12095970882048805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2297808696682693,0.12115348964023633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08748176484912855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07580471182328477,0.0,0.2151297034933839,0.09476730389993827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09124133776452,0.096862307058366,0.0,0.07163827719060399,0.0,0.0,0.11690513491823155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11406631554620925,0.07889402834268552,0.07957791292718751,0.0,0.2073045382591321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252327987282224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1024510053533538,0.07440357086211759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20290798405837607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06875322980321788,0.0,0.0,0.23044735610297715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08877787836715251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2728007805738271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691780258300221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18760833991956105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07129997677803744,0.0,0.0,0.08520169050809939,0.2503213158674895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12909516768759308,0.0,0.0,0.08855190057347215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994885814642412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089907139550883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911185782052356
lonely,sAdplaya_owo,2018/02/27,"Nobody wants to talk to me Im a guy im 20 years old and im just lonely. Nobody wants to talk to me. I havnt had friends since highschool but i dropped out in the 9th grade so that didnt last long. My whole life i feel like ive just been a fucking nobody. A let down. I understand why my ex left. And why she had other guys while we were together. Because im fucking lame. I cant blame her kuz idk why she ever liked me in the first place. She was my only friend tho so it hurt kuz she left and then i was completly alone. Idk how to change either. Ever since i was a kid nobodys ever liked me really and i understand why the more i get older. I used to be mad and blame the world like everyone was just out to get me or bring me down, but now i know its just because ive never been any good. I have nothing to offer. If i killed myself right now the only person who would care is my dad but idk why because i fucked his life up when i was a kid and itd be a blessing for him if he didnt have to deal with me anymore. Ive cost him so much money when i was growing up between the trouble i was in and my drug problems that the only reason i dont lock myself in my room and overdose to just end it already is him. I dont want him to feel like he tried so hard for me and always bailed me out of my shit just to have me die and none of it being worth anything. I dont want him to regret being my dad more than he already does by making him feel like he went broke and had is heartbroken by me so many times for me to just end up in a box and die a nobody. But if he just gave up on me, id end it all if i could stop being such a bitch and grow some balls and just fucking do it",1.0985399274047192,1.8862928921052635,3.183502722323052,95.57710526315789,77.97368421052632,5.978221415607988,20.20871143375681,5.935793293072707,-0.22002450090744088,1289,27,327,7,29,440,169,380,0.202,0.691,0.106,-0.9924,0,3,1,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,0,1,24,26,8,0,16,0,38,8,1,4,5,63,60,34,3,12,19,3,4,6,2,1,3,0,1,5,11,19,0,1,7,1,3,4,8,15,0,1,17,4,60,11,39,34,8,47,1,5,0,4,34,21,6,6,27,219,71,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07779744846270575,0.1657845906234961,0.0,0.0625024701770041,0.0,0.0,0.05108140742206785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07449481712196028,0.0,0.0,0.0618140091142419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13736991899527828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658569563049197,0.0,0.07946269265852351,0.0,0.07875762221124859,0.0,0.0,0.05997395691169913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07744122426815413,0.0,0.0,0.15591694964686356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06573445549419743,0.0,0.2641059273741566,0.0,0.08711062968425236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1995912519959232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20383997421547087,0.0,0.07177648899518396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139426117541648,0.1609885036405876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06389357066818374,0.0,0.0,0.11606876052259768,0.2777738631115238,0.07848994500952537,0.0,0.0,0.0630036772301764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14875315845207054,0.0,0.0,0.06728911793685323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041315536989255,0.0,0.3245523722681729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08310464587151423,0.0,0.04128175001974715,0.06122950756519663,0.0,0.0,0.16322735286483006,0.07681112646256258,0.10611320391320618,0.22018709137077533,0.0,0.0,0.06647523323162174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050140465761801964,0.07615576189661981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055218850620906534,0.0,0.057934035044213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07207575957579516,0.0,0.07882153142111352,0.0,0.0,0.17138714612780787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06558833167571718,0.07848015799031087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07187579923820747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04812118744549729,0.0772316853513818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414859277264724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710542147299697,0.12427334506747367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06280027994926843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075067646461482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043800702152247184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05099878491924347,0.0,0.0,0.1563966619821518,0.0,0.06487604479206073,0.0,0.0,0.17722128398218803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06963321855613112,0.33890221105401386,0.0838642519658436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05336020064148789,0.0,0.0,0.04837219537768271
lonely,TheNamesMrGlass,2018/02/27,"I spend too much time in my room. What places are great for either making homework or just sitting and relaxing? I've been trying to get myself out of the house more, as being too much in my room is impacting the way I feel being inside it. I've tried a few options already. Libraries are nice but a bit too quiet for my taste, school is nice for studying but it carries associations with it that don't exactly make it a very relaxing place. I don't mind people around me conversing but don't like places that are exclusively visited by groups of people. I like the idea of being surrounded while not being reminded of how I'm the only one in my position. Also, I don't necessarily need to be around other people to feel ok. In the summer I love sitting in the park, be there people or not. Some places just ooze peace.

All aspects of maintaining and keeping a friendship I do not know how to do, and thus have lost just about every single friendship I made the last year or so. There seems to be some sort of disconnect that doesn’t allow me to create or maintain close friends and I’m not sure why. I’ve tried help with professionals but the generic advice hasn’t worked.

lonely,KBGobbles,2018/02/28,"I thought I had finally made some close friends. They don't want me around anymore. I'm in grad school, missed out for the first few weeks on making friends, which isn't unusual for me. By chance I got invited to some outings, and they kept inviting me even though I am mostly terrible at conversations - I make up for it by cooking, buying alcohol, driving people when possible.  

For the first time in almost ten years I met someone I genuinely enjoyed talking to - we share a lot of similar interests and watch the same shows that very few other people watch.  I love discussing movies and anything I can think of with her.  I have been trying so hard not to develop feelings for her, but she actually seemed to like talking to me too.  I made sure not to be around her too much - made sure to not go to a bunch of extracurricular stuff she does and invited everyone to even though I would've really liked to learn about it.

She has barely spoken to me in the past couple of weeks.  I didn't get invited to a party - not unusual in my life, but it hurts now - and I think they're using a secondary WhatsApp conversation.  She walked around interlocking arms with another guy from her lab who's in our friend group today, but she's a very touchy feely person - though not with me.

I've been trying not to cry when I'm in public the last couple of days - I tear up in the bathroom, I sob when I get home.  I feel lonely often and have for years, but I had a couple months respite from it with them - and I almost felt happy with her.

I don't want to go back to fantasizing about being free to commit suicide again.",5.6629569981736685,5.833939350157733,6.1414477834966,80.74784492777687,67.17034700315457,9.449709447119377,29.617964469533447,9.276330184999452,2.3148839116719246,1262,41,254,22,19,409,172,317,0.07200000000000001,0.77,0.157,0.9794,0,2,1,0,0,2,32.0,2,0,3,2,20,18,0,0,12,0,15,5,1,6,3,56,41,18,1,2,10,0,4,2,3,0,2,0,1,2,9,18,2,1,8,2,2,4,10,5,0,3,13,6,43,14,53,26,9,39,0,4,2,1,31,16,1,8,21,176,52,3,0.0,0.0,0.09435585618892314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333260320178754,0.1936428831124445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10138828656650596,0.0,0.0,0.09589086843092964,0.0,0.0,0.07956793833667551,0.2582247942709047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07434892841365498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3209581755751713,0.10620983439207056,0.062357291520568466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461439690298572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12772615877349233,0.0,0.0,0.09239179487350273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09777911550998562,0.0,0.09283792105191103,0.10591957731543752,0.0,0.16448956357579922,0.0,0.0,0.22410822673727676,0.0,0.10103345817652293,0.0,0.1099027342904358,0.0,0.07733212403564285,0.0,0.0,0.0957386708021586,0.0,0.10292869989404296,0.08661558218677734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09698832766211082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10350904397907676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07881555899939338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682952698478811,0.09447606435159606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220269735258709,0.08726683657950976,0.27447230611834583,0.12908314943733534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717733316267669,0.0,0.07107854941274297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230190166945244,0.13406586022040431,0.08442630408802419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10900386744059247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0619423287733129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785581941966204,0.0,0.08802328404472141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08192543917953518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106873439926584,0.10576357446163114,0.0,0.1822590643348846,0.0,0.0,0.15543211832921994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391057352650466,0.28499340132857354,0.07676135565703618,0.05638093399688781,0.0,0.09165116779335844,0.0,0.0,0.131292832542221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08350943751281054,0.0,0.15955936774237206,0.11406097418612753,0.0,0.15511836972165338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06868606672037264,0.0,0.0,0.12453086004849667
lonely,kyleh81,2018/02/28,"*sigh* My first and only “real” relationship was in high school (10-12th grade). Although she was my gf for only 1 year, we were really good friends and “talking” the whole time in HS. Anyway once we graduated we broke up, now fast forward 6 years and I’m still single. 
I really haven’t found my grove yet to talk with girls. I’ve had a couple hook ups after my break up but that’s just not me. I don’t like to hook up, I want something to build on. I want someone I can trust, talk to, build a life with. 
I’ve taken ever advice that’s come my way.
For ex: “it takes time”...”don’t look for a relationship, it will eventually come”... blah blah blah.
Damn, I’ve been waiting 6 months and I can’t find someone to genuinely talk too. I really don’t know where to find someone. My group of friends suck too. My fiends has gf’s but their gf’s don’t really have any friends to introduce. I commute to school (1 hour away) so I can’t really talk to anyone Bc I go to school for couple days a week and come back. I recently started to stay home on the weekends trying to save up money Bc I have goals to buy a house in a couple years + I got tired of the “bar” game and going out having pointless convos with my friends. I’m not that type of guy to go on social media and DM, Bc there are thousands of guys who DM, and what’s going to make stand out? They would think it’s another typical guy trying to get into their pants. Which I’m not. I’m more than that. 
Also, I have to say, I’ve set a pretty high bar for myself which i know it’s bad. Now I’m not in any way trying to sound egotistical, but my ex gf was very beautiful, she did modeling. I’m not saying I want a model, heck no, it’s just the bar has been set so high at such a young age, where as of now I’m angry at myself because I can’t just really talk with any girl. It’s a shame. And I hate myself because of that. 
But anyway, I’m tired of being alone. I can’t seem to find someone where I can be myself and be comfortable with. I always feel like I’m no good. I mean college made me gain extra 20lbs lol. 
But I’m graduating soon, hitting the work force, and still don’t have a gf, while my cousins, my close friends all have that special someone and are starting their lives together. *sigh*

lonely,ButCaaaaarrll,2018/02/28,"Hate sleeping alone. Combat veteran that suffers from nightmares.. I dated my most recent ex for 11 months. She moved in with me. When I would have a nightmare she would wake me up in the most gentle way possible knowing the risks of even touching me. I’m not too violent associated with these nightmares but there have been times I’ve woken up with my fingers around her neck. And quickly realize it before actually hurting her. We adopted a puppy and I tell you, this dog was my hero. He was 8 weeks old when we got him back in July and every time My breathe would quicken or start talking or having a nightmare while I slept he would crawl over and lick my face.... everything was going great.. except we broke up a couple of weeks ago. The dog went with her because legally it was hers... and here I lay, afraid to sleep. Alone. Many of my friends I can talk to are busy with their own life and I was always raised to try not to ask for help. I’d say it’s the “typical guy” trait but add on that when I open up, it usually scares others away for the stories behind my nightmares. Sorry for editing issues, I’m on mobile.

lonely,Angelareh,2018/02/28,"Is it possible to feel so lonely when you are surrounded by people who you consider to be friends? I consistently feel lonely.  I am in college, I live with 6 of my friends that I've made since freshman year (i'm a senior now).  I have friends from back home that I know I can always talk to.  I have friends at work that I like hanging out with.  I feel very lonely.  I don't know why.  I want to stop feeling lonely.  I fucking hate it.  I don't fucking get it.  Fuck this.

lonely,NordLovingGreek,2018/03/01,"What should I do? So I'm in high school and I'd say I'm like any average teenager. I'm not too athletic but I play the guitar and in general enjoy music. But, at school, I'm not what you'd call popular. Sure, no one really bullies me, but most of my classmates have a sort of strain when they talk to me and its not rare that they judge me behind me back or regard me lowly amongst them. So yeah, I'm a bit of an outcast. I don't get invited to parties and I'm rarely included in activities, except for when it's one of my few friends. Recently, I got the courage to tell a girl who I was talking to for a while that I liked her and although she let me down gently she now seems distant. So what can I do? I feel lonely as hell, like no one that I know can relate to me since my friends are sort of popular big shots and have never truly experienced rejection.

lonely,M_Night_Shamylan,2018/03/01,"Nothing else stings quite like seeing your ex on Tinder This morning when I woke up, I decided to stay in bed a couple minutes and swipe on Tinder before heading to work.  Since I've been single this has been a morning ritual for me while I'm still groggy and waking up.

My ex and I have been broken up a couple months, but discussed getting back together.  But everything fell through a couple weeks ago and we decided to walk away.

This morning as I was swiping I suddenly was confronted with her profile.  Her beautiful smile, her hair I used to love playing with,everything just shoved in my face like a bolt of electricity.  All at once it drove home the point that this is really done for good, that the last discussion we had about getting back together was really the final one. 

The finality of it all is just a little much for me.  Although I have known it was over for a while this really made everything sink in all at once.  Everything about her I loved so much is soon to be someone else's.

Just feeling very, very alone now.",4.547666666666668,6.087539100000001,5.304000000000002,80.78366666666669,70.5,8.933333333333335,28.333333333333336,9.3871,2.523433333333333,820,30,154,18,15,266,116,200,0.036000000000000004,0.804,0.16,0.9816,0,2,0,0,0,0,17.0,2,1,0,2,12,7,1,0,11,0,16,6,4,2,3,21,27,12,0,0,5,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,10,7,0,0,4,1,0,3,0,1,0,1,12,3,19,6,28,14,6,33,1,0,1,2,13,14,0,0,17,110,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433294810210324,0.0,0.0,0.1219005348227266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058196424871436,0.18100633423711807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001530707734466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3906946881673228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12044680979015597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966446088126234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4231206259955595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05951208592052716,0.0,0.0,0.2578667214562192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12298560510572785,0.0,0.0,0.09872022928667952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12079299835474674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11806156476280093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594028938760986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11500344689764035,0.11796518991484176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.212455653722988,0.11136951811795356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939461163733949,0.0,0.1730444264174431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11293524162627935,0.0,0.0,0.25069091389007103,0.07975580144568309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11126347726974928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12518723775377266,0.0,0.0,0.2262027329362665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937907621159747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973617228282002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09972587193287727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12545133675905398,0.0939944708725872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165403510793132,0.0,0.19422779093433898,0.0,0.0,0.09441093528591372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08568618028880197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,greenparka,2018/03/01,"I have some friends but I feel disconnected with all of them I guess I want more out of friendships. Phones are great because they keep us in touch, but a lot of the times my friends are on their phones when I am with them. I want someone to go on adventures with, walks at night, spontaneous stuff. Someone I feel completely comfortable with. Most people in my city don't seem to want to do that without alcohol or drugs. I'm an 18 year old girl and i just come home and do absolutely nothing... Is that a waste of my youth? I do go out, volunteer, ask people to hang out some nights of the week but it's adventure and excitement I want. I have no one to talk about deep personal things with. My friends and I aren't on that type of level, which just makes me feel lonelier than ever... I feel like I'm looking for a person I haven't found yet. Hope this made a bit of sense to anyone out there. :)",1.9172709739633549,3.877623530054649,2.9229893924783035,93.27931533269049,78.72677595628416,6.9288331726133086,22.78656380585021,7.928766900206844,0.92966756669881,698,22,158,12,17,222,108,183,0.063,0.6990000000000001,0.238,0.9876,0,0,2,0,0,0,24.0,1,0,4,0,7,10,0,0,7,0,12,2,0,2,2,42,34,9,0,5,7,0,5,1,3,0,2,0,1,3,8,14,1,1,6,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,2,6,24,10,32,32,7,27,0,0,1,0,15,12,0,8,11,105,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438753172349693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09413432661854416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12585806899664667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08206736788055899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14697781276636834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11596923732821532,0.14115384509247875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15612457541415029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12177782643432808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27228581932619944,0.09617755364088797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14761155352801808,0.31203745205012257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15302324988511906,0.0,0.0,0.14842673959771202,0.14830681530740406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13504185492380927,0.13371498488799513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1196626607754002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06577195051959224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305277090352753,0.0,0.0,0.11445505864279867,0.0,0.12738731981771872,0.08986456597207018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2526766338248085,0.0,0.12917823464496953,0.0,0.14126838677690218,0.0,0.09122673742126804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18666681736375776,0.23510220215627625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255936193988215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22813803555402745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15411570247331596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10820808070348197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08944019479878558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850208466117277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16193970134807706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3176259638618077,0.0,0.10798965651282492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297756210462143,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0866953722245482
lonely,SelfEntitledPrick,2018/03/01,"Loneliness has become a normality for me I'm pretty sure it's just me realizing it just now, but I've been feeling lonely.

People say they care about me, but I don't even believe it. They always brush me aside anyways as if I don't matter so I always ignore everyone in the hall. You know those kids that annoy you everytime they open their mouth to you, I feel like I'm that kid everytime I try to interact with someone. So I start isolating myself and ignoring everyone because I don't want people to be annoyed by me.

I also had a friend leave me a couple days ago. She claimed that she cared about me a lot, yet her reason for leaving was because she didn't help me at all with my depression. I told her that her being there for me was enough to make my day. Ever since then, I've been feeling extremely lonely. The fact that she had other friends to rely on while I was left alone made me feel mad. I just don't understand how anyone would think, ""It will be better for you if the one friend you had left you.""

lonely,nsfw_throwaway212121,2018/03/02,"Missing something Posting on my throwaway because I don't want this on my main account lol.

I have a few close friends that I care about a lot and who are the same with me, however, I've never been in a romantic relationship before and there are certain things that I want to experience, talk about etc. that I'd only feel comfortable doing in that sort of relationship. At my age (approaching 17), the lack of having this sort of person in my life is really getting to me and I get quite sad upon thinking about the possibility that I might just not be able to get a gf or whatever.

For a lot of people, being a virgin is the worry but for me, not being able to be completely honest and open with someone is the real killer.

Any tips for how to make a move in college/uni?

lonely,koxrr,2018/03/02,"It's snowing outside... Recently my country has been hit with a lot of snow, more than we would ever expect over here. Everything is shut down and everyone my age seems to be outside building snowmen and just generally having fun. I have literally been stuck in my room for 3 days straight, no one called to ask me to come outside, or just even to chat about the crazy weather.

Now that I think about it, I can't remember the last time I got a social call, and the last text in my phone from someone who isn't in my family was from May 2016, and trust me, there isn't a lot of others even before that. I guess this shouldn't surprise me then, but it still hurts nearly every day.

lonely,brokeboujeecollegkid,2018/03/02,"Empty feeling So basically I started college last fall, moved away from home and lowkey had a huge glow up. Since finding out I’m mildly attractive I keep hooking up with guys but I feel like they just like me because of my looks and not for me. However, the attention reinforces my ego but then I feel sad they don’t like me for who I am. Lots of conflicted feelings, still just as forever alone as I was when I was ugly but now it’s a different kind of forever alone. I guess it’s mostly because the kind of guys I keep talking to or show interest in know they’re attractive and are kinda assholes bc of that. It was great having attention since I have a decent body and face but now I just want someone to appreciate me for being me. Sorry if any of this sounds kinda rude or mean but I just don’t know how else to phrase my current state of mind.",1.9050608519269758,4.05066705172414,3.5925693035835025,87.53583164300207,79.63218390804597,7.082623394185259,24.603110209601077,8.124751697461798,1.5332951994590935,673,25,139,13,17,224,106,174,0.129,0.698,0.173,0.8089,3,2,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,2,0,10,11,1,0,5,0,11,2,2,1,0,40,25,18,0,2,13,0,4,3,0,0,0,1,1,2,6,6,0,3,10,1,0,2,3,2,0,0,4,7,22,9,22,20,2,17,0,1,2,0,6,6,0,8,11,92,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3052063064350463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10019845120156314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843381784896888,0.0,0.0,0.17963813475591814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16366511594863414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15394231830201988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12308636468114167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2980046635310233,0.10526203525000086,0.0,0.0,0.1346690458115859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16244643478782514,0.1623151830102964,0.29178593230771266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14779727654844804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2619308713898117,0.0,0.30687060721347603,0.1619519752340182,0.1201044007103189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21595338346528706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12373120655980448,0.0,0.0,0.12526594783626646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1604999761210584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14877466271376394,0.0,0.0,0.15660253875237254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437676902382852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484344335695804,0.0,0.0,0.16493868641700962,0.10429029884166534,0.0,0.1176684963772221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11842890959645427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690685648226792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,hzfan,2018/03/02,"Loner in college I commuted from home my first year in college, so I didn't connect with people in the dorms the way my classmates did. I am a music major. I was in the top orchestra my freshman year and as a result anyone who I did befriend was older. I'm now a sophomore and they have mostly graduated and gone off to other states or countries. I have a few people I consider friends or at least acquaintances, but no one I hang out with regularly. I see all my classmates hanging out outside of classes and chatting in class and they all know each other's names and talk to each other and I just sit there silent, do my work, and leave. I live alone in a one bedroom apartment. I'm pretty introverted and maybe even somewhat anti-social idk. I think I also have some social anxiety although I've been told it doesn't show. I had a girlfriend for a little under a year from the second half of my senior year in high school through my first semester in college. We tried long distance and it didn't work. That breakup was the loneliest I've ever felt I think, but I was home and surrounded by family. Now whenever I get lonely I sort of go back to that place and start wishing we were still together even though I know we weren't right for each other. I'm also overweight and have some major self esteem issues because of this, and in the darker moments it becomes pretty easy to convince myself I'll never find anyone again.",5.837734668335422,6.101773929078014,6.403525239883188,78.6979411764706,66.80141843971631,8.479265748852733,31.48185231539424,8.124751697461798,2.2987657071339176,1136,42,209,13,17,371,158,282,0.084,0.84,0.077,0.0432,0,3,0,0,0,0,21.0,3,0,2,5,14,3,0,0,14,0,19,1,0,1,4,47,34,24,0,1,5,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,4,1,11,24,1,0,6,3,0,4,6,1,0,6,15,2,32,2,31,19,13,46,0,1,1,0,14,21,0,7,18,159,43,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13330610615012647,0.0,0.20586078592358129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09846380449779647,0.0,0.0,0.17999588977138328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989710571850583,0.0,0.07846122362310849,0.14215153626855778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17002522072231313,0.11642675425031344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133757378023192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235830480602205,0.0,0.1176398110890024,0.21896355939967746,0.0,0.0,0.09944204351609456,0.0,0.06724635028469593,0.0,0.07314960707796345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13599057217318145,0.2582158890017566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343411737308952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14147274644446622,0.0,0.0,0.1362866992748296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290025523815498,0.1136544501934482,0.11390546441605988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12930781697246246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09927010175675888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17443623769277292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17846444059845712,0.0,0.13447593048954887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618913620001121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10991876066001173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13026272343550518,0.10256625460024152,0.0,0.13427397355955836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312049777386032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09110253199026982,0.0,0.1027890232794125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10345328036180998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16494602840937153,0.12645821453908213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12298917831041935,0.0,0.08738653478116515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216505168045306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14801166138728195,0.0,0.0,0.18740674209164096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3315434703400688
lonely,whetwah,2018/03/02,"How to communicate loneliness to not-that-close-of-friends/ should I mention it at all? I lost my best friend almost a year ago (she didn't die, she just stopped wanting to be friends with me). I have another friend in another state/time zone, and we talk every once in a while. Sometimes I want to talk to her about how lonely I feel or even just other random things, but usually talk myself out of it because I don't want to be a pity party or a nuisance. I also feel bad because she's good friends with my ex, and I don't want to make her feel awkward by increasing our interactions/friendship.

I'm friendly with a couple of coworkers, and we'll comment on each others' social media posts, but we've never hung out or talked seriously about anything in our lives. Sometimes I wonder if it'd be worth it to try and reach out to one of them, and explain that I'm in the market for new friends? But that feels awkward to say...

I'm really embarrassed by not having friends, and I don't exactly know how to make new ones other than being completely honest like, ""I'm super fucking lonely and want a friend. Would you want to be my friend?""

Plus the additional pain of if they say no, or if it doesn't work out that we're actually compatible as friends and we still work together and now it's like ""yeah we hung out once but were on separate wavelengths the whole time...""

tldr: Feeling increasingly lonely, want to reach out, but feel embarrassed about admitting to people that i need friends because i am lonely. Should I talk about loneliness to people? Or hide it and act chill and aloof like ""Yeah it's ok if this doesn't work out, I've got other friends.""

It feels like, to an extent, good friendships just sort of happen on their own, so if I intentionally try to start one, I'm forcing something that just isn't there.

lonely,aaazmah,2018/03/03,"Just my feelings I guess i have much to say and i dont know where to start. I feel alone, not lonely.  The typical 'im surronded by so many people yet i still feel alone'. I had a best friend, who decided to stop talking to me, we were ex's and we or i guess myself, wanted to talk to her evem after what happened with us. Im at fault with basically everything and i thought i waa improving in the friend part but in the end i still lost her. And so, with that i lost the only person i talked yo constantly and im aware that i only miss her because im alone. I am a terrible and shitty persom to want that. And i feel it again but i still feel so alone. To not be able to turn to anyone, to not be able to tell my thoughts and feelings. To complain or whatever. My other friends arent good enough. They just arent, they are proned to judge and stuff. I don't know, maybe i am too picky. 

So today, I saw her at a store and though we didn't interact i felt a sharp pain but tbh its nothing compared to hers. I dont have a right to feel like this. After i left the store, i felt so cold. Literally. I was shivering, and my insides were just, i could feel just, like i wanted just leave the mall and scream aa loud as i can. I feel empty now, and i dont know what else to feel. 

With that, I feel so pressured in school and by others. I feel so under everyone, in all my classes. I feel like i am just too dumb for my major, i feel like people are judging me. I am scared of talking up in my classes and i feel like, i cant go on. Tbh, i feel like im being weak, that others have ot worse and i dont have to do this but even then, i hope for someone to come and talk to me eberyday. I wish for a friend to understand me better thhan i understand myseld. I wish for comfort, attention and affevtion. I wish for confidence, and intelligence. I 
wish to forget all my troubles and to start new. I just feel so tired, so alone. These days i feel like i talk yo myseld more than to others, or how i stress about my grades and studying. Im scared too. I dont know whst i feel anymore. At this point, its just a rant. Idek what im hoping to achieve with this, im a horrible friend and a horrible person. Im selfish, i really am. I pretend to care, i pretend. I am not myself. The real me is ugly and not good enough. The real me passes by, the real me doesnt care for happiness, it never lasts. Tbe real me doesnt ger excited because hes afraid it wont even happen. The real me doesnt know what it means to fight for a friend, to care for them, was i ever a real friend. Did i really care, did i realky try my best, when my other so called best friens stopped talking to me, i thought nothing of it, but maybe they realised how fake i am.

lonely,SpaRkofFiRe,2018/03/04,"ugh It's 2:25 AM and I'm just laying here. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Just so you all know, everything I say here is probably just going to be incredibly incoherent because… well it's late.


But… god, I'm so sick of being lonely. I'm so sick of anxiety, depression, and relationships. I was fortunate enough to have been able to make some online friends (it's possible, everyone! You can do it! *hugs*), but… I just suck so hard at maintaining relationships. Of course I fucking wouldn't. A whole life of having *no one*, I don't know how I expected myself to be good with people. I was so happy to have finally been able to find *someone*. But I just ended up pushing them away, all because I don't understand them. I don't understand relationships, I'm just not used to it at all. I end up just isolating myself from them. Being alone again. Because that's what I'm used to. Being alone. Maybe this is better for me. Maybe this is what I was made for. Just to be alone for my whole life. I'm not *happy* with it, but at least I'm not fucking up when I'm all alone like this. This is better for me anyways. It's better for everyone else too, no one should get to know me, I'm a piece of shit. 



Ugh nevermind I'm going to bed. I'm probably not gonna post this. It doesn't nearly explain everything that's happening. I'm sorry if I do post this. I'm so tired, I don't know what I'm doing anymore. My mind is on autopilot rn. Just ignore this if you see this. Sorry.

lonely,rubber-band,2018/03/04,City life It’s kind of ironic how my city is so jam-packed with people yet it feels weird to socialise. Everyone’s surrounded in their own bubble and doing their own thing and it’s really difficult to try to start a conversation with someone. Anyhow else have the same feeling? ,3.865283018867924,6.369574773584912,4.574188679245285,81.14769811320755,74.84905660377359,8.013584905660379,23.807547169811322,8.841846274778883,1.9678860377358487,225,7,40,5,5,72,42,53,0.121,0.85,0.029,-0.584,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,2,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,3,1,0,1,0,9,6,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,3,1,7,6,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,2,27,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3106972298860411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3553921253319785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3761148673618942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3873046695369751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26270299364343624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2578473070223574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23826591853637896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151324853969354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632517991577121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470917294687802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25251397519617474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,possiblyaKitKat,2018/03/05,"How I'm dealing with feeling lonely right now My heart aches. I had a long weekend being part of a bachelorette party with close college friends whom I've known for 10 years. Still, I often didn't fit into the dynamic and chose to sit elsewhere by myself and being on my phone at times. I've also been facing the fact that I am involved in two casual type relationships and not in a serious monogamous one (the type I think I want). And I feel lonely right now. And I feel sad and a bit frustrated that I'm not making better use of my time. 

But I'm trying something new. I created a new Reddit account I can use to hopefully engage with people, even if it is to upvote or downvote. I cleaned out the dishwasher and prepared some dinner. I'm also going to try to wind down early. I might feel alone but I can still take care of myself and not amplify these shitty feelings through shitty choices that will perpetuate the shittiness. In the past, I may have just laid in bed. A new mantra of mine has been ""Progress, not perfection."" I like it. I find it works for me with dealing with feeling a particular way. I know I may not have the answers right now. I may not feel amazing, but I feel like I'm trying and I have to give myself credit for that. Even the act of sitting by myself was in some ways an act of self-care. It gave me a break from feeling left out.

I'm sorry if your heart is hurting too. Close your eyes and give yourself a soft hug, even if it may seem silly. I hope you feel better.",2.823782894736844,4.453746075657897,4.212926315789478,86.51628421052635,75.08552631578948,6.837684210526318,24.66,7.554174236665415,1.1741059473684214,1173,38,238,15,25,388,161,304,0.103,0.753,0.14400000000000002,0.8892,0,5,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,3,0,5,14,22,1,0,18,0,22,6,4,4,2,67,53,20,0,6,14,0,11,2,1,6,0,0,2,0,11,20,1,0,16,2,2,3,7,6,0,2,6,12,34,16,35,39,4,41,0,4,1,1,13,18,0,15,17,162,45,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10162400159980588,0.0,0.15693502302494092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735605069174335,0.10712296907187277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004113257012948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2023173575593667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19442443937901308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4961304167853332,0.07009782572052761,0.0,0.0,0.08968102584022783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758082182521087,0.0,0.0,0.18825364783535928,0.05576455573868757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325482579899987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19491304056036768,0.0,0.0,0.10504080521191922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053924861456872315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066090025858584,0.0,0.0,0.09587415254990417,0.0,0.0,0.08683420011539597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06549668239100442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10409111817405868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28429828367689397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06648948427910276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10625572934096204,0.09366781588583224,0.06802490568759616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10534547927754358,0.0,0.2513849807430846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932588185554109,0.10236184146329824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553851598021273,0.0,0.10983868274608724,0.0,0.0,0.15671948071794445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07377495299391867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0628721216869018,0.0,0.0,0.1144305555914572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19985362126776507,0.0,0.0958501833212964,0.0,0.0,0.16949047584505206,0.0,0.0,0.05787444319449327,0.15576812908669244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714334234498127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06318685455094658
lonely,jmock_tv,2018/03/05,"All my friends do is drink and smoke Hey guys, junior in highschool. So I’ve always had the same group of guys that I’d hangout with since like 8th grade. We’d always just have a great time together no matter what we were doing and none if it involved alcohol or drugs. But now, every time they hangout, they’re all either shit faced drunk or baked by the end of the night. I don’t drink or smoke, nor do I enjoy it btw. So as this started becoming the norm for them, I began to feel so awkward whenever I was in that situation. This has led to the point where I don’t even spend time with them anymore because I just don’t feel like putting myself in uncomfortable situations. So on weekends, when I’m laying in my bed doing nothing, I just feel so fucking isolated and lonely. I’m starting to distance myself from everyone and lose friendships... I just want to be able to have fun with them without drugs and alcohol again. Am I the problem because I don’t drink or smoke?

One day she just stopped talking to me and said that she never liked me. She just wanted to talk to someone and that she's in love with a guy she's been in love with since pre-school..

lonely,zoey33,2018/03/05,"Help my brain tells me one thing my heart tells me another Me 39f him 38m known 5 or 6 years...serious relationship for first 3 to 4 years...i loved this man with all my heart, i really feel he loved me but there was some fishy stuff that happened so many times i wasnt ready to fully commit.  I think im stupid for wanting him back, but my heart is with him and i dont know what to do
1. I got a pocket dial one night from his phone and heard a woman in the background obviously drunk saying ""no, i dont want to be naked"" he said his cousin borrowed his phone and he denied knowing what i was talking about.
2. I saw text messages from his bm that suggested she was still in  love with him and a text message from a girl he was flirting with.  He said it was because i wasnt giving him enough attention (which i wasnt at the time)
3. He was travelling to another state to see his son graduate and i specifically asked if his bm was going with him (they arent together bc he walked in on her fucking his family member) he said no, then i saw on her facebook page the 2 of them in eachothers arms 
4. He became homeless and i wouldn't let him move in with me because of the above situations i was concerned he wasnt comitted 
5. We start drifting apart bc i kept trying to understand the photo and why he would lie...year passes we still text but rarely see eachother throughout
6. Im missing him terribly and reach out to him start hooking up, suspect he is living with his bm even though he denies and says he stays at a friends house until he gets on his feet..
7. Yep pretty sure he lives with the bm, because he wouldnt let me bring him chicken soup when he got sick (and we always hang out at my place)  basically think he is using her to get on his feet says im his mo to get it together and get his own place,
8. Man i sound stupid even typing this while my heart is yearning for him..
9. When i ask whats going on he says that i am going to be mad but in the end i will be so happy, but wont tell me what that means

My brain tells me he is full of lies and will continue to hurt me so 1. Why doesnt he let me go, why does he do just enough to make me believe he loves me and wants me 2. Why cant i let go when he is clearly only hurting me at this point, why do i want to believe people are better than they are and 3.

lonely,bearpaws6,2018/03/06,"Fuck it, I'll just die alone. So, for the last couple Days, my best friend, whom I've been in love with for a while have given me hope that we could en up together, only to friendzone me this morning.

I'm so madly in love with her it's ridiculous. I'm not even exagerating by saying that I've never loved a girl as much as her and that I would've really died for her. I really thought she was the one, our chemistry, trust, and even sexual attraction just filled me with hope..

I know this is not a rational thought, but I really feel like I am gonna die alone. I've just lost my best friend and the love of my life, I barely had any friends except her. I know I'm a relatively good looking / kind person, but I struggle to create good relationships, and when I do, I ether screw them up or I get rejected... I'm so sick of it..",3.09,3.7181475977011513,4.645459770114943,87.58301724137932,73.02298850574712,8.328735632183909,23.69540229885057,8.59863814320734,1.2027333333333332,638,16,147,11,12,215,102,174,0.172,0.569,0.259,0.9696,0,3,0,0,0,0,27.0,2,0,1,3,9,24,4,1,7,0,8,8,0,0,1,26,29,14,3,3,9,0,1,1,3,1,2,1,0,2,9,8,0,0,5,0,0,1,3,7,0,1,7,3,25,17,18,20,3,10,0,2,1,6,20,4,2,3,6,91,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25108657412688296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08243108125412983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25441756472829274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09678116490549553,0.1341232709713741,0.0,0.07817433432876071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3774094154955959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16012413616768226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06129048488039949,0.08659678145336977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809536946774989,0.11206229935692637,0.0633303912444397,0.0,0.0,0.2033405694623048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24078980770547806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262278790459167,0.1332343591112705,0.09880727192094976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0856184918871941,0.059220046770721686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10179096602087648,0.0,0.13232165462628065,0.0,0.4376089270220908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08910775548297023,0.0,0.09348930249024458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08213914311722519,0.09219028006049958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10584119292195092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329623465299043,0.0,0.0,0.13014069056105484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09639588058680708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12672135054868675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924640321712084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08610841511220638,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,MyCatIsMyLife123,2018/03/06,"Friendship (uk) Hello 

I'm Vanessa and I'm 25 and from uk. I want a friend, someone who is real and true to themselves, isn't afraid to be thier own person. Also someone who understanding and honest. Preferably from uk too but don't mind where you are from. I don't have any friends at all, not even online and I know everyone that reads this will find that shocking but it's the truth. People online in the past when I've tried making friendships only spoke to me wanting sex chat etc not actually a normal and meaningful conversation. I don't use any social media as I don't have any friends and nobody to talk to and I actually can't stand it as it doesn't help introverted and lonely people like myself feel any better in themselves, as all you see on them are people surrounded by friends, bragging about things and it's like a big competition and people copy each other and become way too obsessed with it and themselves rather than concentrate on what's around them and people actually in front of them. I have used it in past but don't have anymore as nobody ever really spoke to me anyway and don't have family that talk to me apart from my mother and brother. 

So if anyone contacts me then atleast you know before hand that I don't have these social platforms. I have this, but have no one here either so mostly browse, YouTube but only to watch things don't have content as nothing to post, email which i only get spam filling up inbox and WhatsApp for talking to my brother sometimes. That's it. I don't have any use for anything else. So whoever speaks to me will need to understand that. I Would prefer someone who doesn't also have or use social media other than this or email so we understand each other.

I'm not that interesting, but I'm a caring and honest person. I an understanding by nature and will listen to how you feel and never say to get over it or stop complaining etc. 

I'm very sensitive and get jealous of other people alot but I am thankful for having a understanding mother who helps me when she can and a brother. Even though he is younger than me by eight years we connect in some way. Also thankful for my cat, she is my companion and best friend and I love her to pieces. She so comforting and loving. In my heart I truly believe pets are great therapy for DEPRESSED and LONELY people. 

I have aspergers, depression, anxiety  issues. I do like to laugh sometimes to the point my sides hurt but don't have much to laugh about. I love animals of many kinds. They help make world a more bearable place. I love cats. Other animals I like are pandas, alpacas, unicorns (I know they are just mythical but they are so beautiful and mystical  creatures, birds, horses, monkeys and reptiles. 

I like horror movies but also like comedy and some animated. I think lion king is one of the best animated movies of all time and the minions! 

I enjoy listening to music i like pop, dance and rock music. I like a wide range of music and artists/bands. I'm always open into listening to new things. 

I like watching tv and I am big fan of soaps and quiz shows. I am not a big sports fan, i don't watch any but I like to play badminton and I enjoy zumba as my way to keep relatively fit. 

I also a big fan of chinese/Japanese culture and language. Everything about it just simply fascinates me. 

Ive been to many groups etc in hope of forming atleast one friendship but nothing ever comes out of it. I believe I deserve a friend and want someone to relate to in some way.

I don't work but I'm planning in volunteering at a cat sanctuary once it opens near me as right now there isn't any, done a few courses here and there and used to do work at Oxfam charity shop. Currently doing a course that helps build confidence, you do quizzes, talking points and projects on what you like etc. I

lonely,Old_Bastard_official,2018/03/06,"So I met this girl Firstly, I'd like to apologize if this is stupid and cliche. It has been affecting my mood heavily lately and my irl friends aren't much help when it comes to talking. I'm sure this is such a trivial problem in comparison to others on this sub

I've always had problems with self esteem and women. I would define my self worth over my romantic life and hit some of the lowest points of my life because of my failed romantic life, including a attempt to hang myself. I realize it is very unhealthy and damaging, and the past year I have been seeing a counsiler, taking anti depressants, and improving my confidence. There's been highs and lows along the way of course, but never to the extremity of suicide again. 

So I went on a trip to Berkeley, California for a Model United nations trip. Cool sights, fun stuff, good food. I had a chair on my model UN committee who was extremely pretty, I see pretty girls all the time, no big deal right? All the other members of my committee were boisterous and loud, being a shy person, it was hard for me to get involved. This chair, her name was Suchi, would walk over to me and give me the cutest smile and ask if I needed any help. She would help me get involved in other people's discussions, give me tips and advice, and answer any question I had. I made a motion to enter a moderated discussion, which the rest of the committee voted no on. Suchi passed me a note saying ""good try! Don't be afraid to make more motions! We recognize the effort :)"" I felt cared for. After 3 days of committee it was over, I bought all the chairs a thank you card and got ready to travel home. I realize Suchi was just being a nice person and helping a lonely loser out, but I couldn't stop thinking of her. I sat on a bench and cried, I would probably never see her again. 

I am torn up about a girl I barely met and barely talked to. I think what got me was that she cared about me. For so long I have been a shoulder for girls to cry on, but they would never reciprocate feelings, ask how I was. Suchi cared about me, even if it was only professional. I feel terrible, I don't eat or talk much anymore. My hobbies bore me and I don't like being around my friends. I expect the feeling will pass, but I just needed to vent I guess. Sorry for the long ass boring story.",4.304816176470588,5.309996651416121,5.27465073529412,82.79374080882354,70.5032679738562,8.26473311546841,26.32632080610022,8.567472430010655,1.7423817538126367,1809,55,359,29,32,594,239,459,0.151,0.677,0.173,0.9461,1,2,0,0,0,2,57.0,1,1,1,5,16,28,1,1,29,1,38,7,2,4,7,70,73,31,1,14,10,0,5,2,2,6,3,2,1,9,19,24,2,1,10,1,2,12,10,13,0,1,25,12,57,14,49,36,8,49,0,6,4,1,42,20,1,7,18,244,76,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838783303081786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142275561324085,0.0,0.0,0.1167433820888906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08512663743828168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07641258859911744,0.16049088174721998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0523250687811495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2625477716478724,0.0,0.0,0.07394045253806407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885744954158212,0.05535737274846166,0.08849355264889258,0.07393075995576541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783205964330941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056694128373272826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302043789662295,0.0,0.08241639871686404,0.0,0.0,0.07301239247292993,0.10379370775439134,0.0,0.1326339694040974,0.0,0.08969194568848562,0.1646841803098982,0.0,0.14399098879781547,0.13730241039283445,0.0,0.09455846473554884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07689254860206506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301373008739625,0.0906908624919006,0.08610090136564769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09682719065321699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18188634966668915,0.08387065221384518,0.0,0.0,0.15192501429110344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08122047097951864,0.05729645920069309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12619925138869448,0.12729319632234068,0.198606954969956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06528244520294657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08194055019888641,0.05950814745229994,0.1498980559036674,0.0,0.0,0.0811431366444172,0.0,0.0,0.17465294188719255,0.09254615009229668,0.16426767226827452,0.0,0.0,0.09615640531647818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07330381105833128,0.0,0.06826054534239709,0.0,0.0,0.20520147706447048,0.0,0.17909215731254194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09608681500917388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07176306847645145,0.0,0.0,0.0982621343955853,0.09389108269320838,0.0,0.08089978505435963,0.0,0.06453828545107608,0.2069761250437451,0.0,0.07902661866393951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11000099008341042,0.0,0.0,0.05005189133563703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05827727674672766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07082401416288164,0.0,0.06813293381566574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07957119674492086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3048785559272727,0.0,0.0,0.05527582316590247

lonely,drummysong,2018/03/06,"Cried again today Not because I was feeling lonely, but because I fooled myself into thinking I was alone. Reached out for a shoulder to cry on from friends and was overwhelmed by how many people were willing to try to cheer me up while I was upset.  A friend of mine messaged me back ""I'm always here for you. Or did you forget about that?"" I cried because I really did forget that I do still have people in my corner that care for me. My message to anyone on this subreddit is to just please reach out to your friends. Even if you guys don't talk often, just knowing you have someone that cares will make you feel that much less lonely.

lonely,AugustBriar,2018/03/06,"I just feel alone Just recently, due to medical complications, I’ve been forced to do an independent study, spending near all my time at home. I’m essentially entirely detached from anyone outside my parents (I’m still doing my studies), and as much as I love them they aren’t always the best company for me. I’ve never been the most popular or a social butterfly, but I never wanted to be. I was happy with what I had. 

Now that I’m away from everyone, I feel detached, alone. I’ve never liked social media, truth be told I actually feel ill to my stomach at the thought of it, but I don’t know what to do. 

To couple with my new isolation, my best friends, whom I’ve known since elementary, some even before, whom I hold as brothers, refuse even to respond to me. Quite literally, they’ve began to ignore my messages.

And to put the icing on he cake, my girlfriend split with me. So I sit alone, doing my schooling, working out, doing what I can to try to entertain myself, but there’s a void that doesn’t seem to ever fill.",4.985672603258809,5.534200246305421,6.310837438423648,77.62971959075409,68.70443349753695,9.201818870784386,30.393709738537325,9.265573868473778,2.5856460022735885,802,30,155,15,13,272,121,203,0.132,0.738,0.131,0.5807,2,4,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,2,4,9,10,0,0,7,0,15,4,1,1,6,32,28,10,0,1,6,2,3,1,2,0,2,0,1,0,8,6,0,3,7,1,1,2,6,1,0,0,7,3,26,9,29,19,6,20,0,0,0,1,16,6,0,4,12,109,34,2,0.0,0.0,0.13580051870410073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4323847525635415,0.0,0.0,0.11579263688855318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973042177247885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307458175339537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11841528775306087,0.0,0.29208059983664325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15397838384000193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838283209342424,0.12587858821611894,0.0,0.13297376733779748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21109110458545727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10751501343256027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14813887976558535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13958927126246712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07647894037825255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798676342028097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12559773342986896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14018950638793987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022989379658525,0.0,0.32198733894991244,0.13440202347949196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15452120395970426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139894682072815,0.0,0.14801426124174433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13740414949846924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14083779822629555,0.0,0.12668644124618572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11511495689348125,0.0,0.0,0.2837130944860678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11113370992639687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11047784775312353,0.08114557369357928,0.0,0.0,0.13297376733779748,0.0,0.0944808063935376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08208043508903874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013104602485067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I used to think that once I left high schoo/uni that I would find a couple of people,  or even just one person who I'd talk to all the time and be able to tell everything. But after it's happened so many times I've finally accepted the fact that there's probably something unlikeable about me but I don't know what it is.

lonely,Drakan7,2018/03/07,"My biggest fear is being rejected I'm 30 and for the past five years have found my social life diminishing to the point I'm pretty much alone except for my girlfriend. 

I've tried joining things and made some interesting contacts there but after one seemingly good friendship falling through as I couldn't meet up for a few weeks due to busy time at work I fear rejection now. 

I've recently started a new group and getting to know people but while I try to chat with them and make connections I'm constantly afraid it'll fail and I'll ruin the fun I have at the group. 

Anyone else get these feelings?",3.868813559322035,5.908812830508477,4.312000000000001,85.16477966101695,73.23728813559322,7.4318644067796615,27.0542372881356,8.238735603445708,1.81109559322034,486,18,93,8,10,153,85,118,0.199,0.68,0.12,-0.8898,0,2,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,1,2,2,10,0,3,6,0,6,1,0,2,0,17,18,9,0,1,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,4,1,0,1,1,7,0,2,2,1,8,3,15,13,3,18,0,4,0,0,8,5,0,2,12,52,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1966183672186621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13274147364661468,0.19451487945702475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20515103795811912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15858807331451594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4272485559696321,0.09598948175647598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20815122226322136,0.0,0.0,0.19836852153645448,0.0,0.0,0.15922990265814746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10433183150862116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13409054735103013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17963245889056428,0.12672056352072625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1395552227394508,0.0,0.0,0.1833499418104843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12864139996818486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18122503277262966,0.13161207663489788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17946142126170786,0.0,0.0,0.19313688424423592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1874454131184086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17282441907736446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19351933110155284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343706721824144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612214573904698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1106980075874105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2577796063778165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15227926580058232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1382067509883245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12225159387459048
lonely,hyrule68,2018/03/07,"Anyone else feel sad their birthday is coming up? [M] here and this is my first reddit post so sorry if I’m doing this wrong. Might be a little long but last year on my 21st birthday I spent it all alone. 

I’m in the Army right now and currently away from my hometown and family. My wife was at a business trip and missed my birthday, which isn’t so bad but she kept ignoring me the whole month she was gone. Not only that, but a couple days before my birthday she told me she wasn’t happy anymore and wanted a divorce. I was devastated. 

A lot of people in my Unit were at some training and I didn’t have any friends I felt comfortable hanging out with. (I’m a pretty shy guy) One friend is stationed an hour and a half away. I told him my story and he said to stop by and we were going to have the best day ever! The morning of my birthday he canceled because something came up. (I’m not mad at him, it was family related)

I didn’t want to spend my birthday alone so I convinced him to grab dinner. I ended up spending 2 hours driving to him and just  getting Denny’s then drove 2 hours back. It’s around 10pm on a Friday night when I got back and I remember I never felt so lonely in my life. When my wife came back I found out she was having an affair with another soldier. She took everything. My bank account, all our furniture, our pets. I moved out and lived with a friend paying him rent until the divorce went through but then I was hit with all the bills from the divorce.  (The Army pays for classes but if you fail them, you pay out of pocket. I failed every class that semester and JUST THAT was around 2k.The Army also wanted money for for other reasons, but I’m not trying to drag this on.) I started getting late with my bills and used credit to pay it, which was the worst thing I’ve ever done but I eventually paid it off last month. 

It’s been a long year. I gained 40lbs, I started using anti-depressants (second biggest mistake), and I literally have done nothing with my life the past year. I stopped taking my anti-depressants because I got out of my rut but I still feel lonely all the time. I think about my ex, who I thought was my angel, being just a story for some guy to tell his friends. 

I think about how in shape I was a year ago, how happy I was, how I had ambition and wanted to be a doctor, and more importantly how I didn’t feel LONELY all the time. 

If anyone has some advice or anything to say, I’m all ears.

lonely,FrumiusBandersnatch,2018/03/07,"Soul-crushing loneliness My loneliness has gotten so profound that I can't function anymore, I can't focus on anything because it gnaws at me all the time. I try to meet people but I end up being an outsider unable to connect to anyone. This goes on until I just fade out of the group and stop showing up. I literally make no impact on anyone, as showcased by the pattern that people I've met keep re-introducing themselves to me because they've forgotten about me. Sometimes 4+ times in a row. Or they tell me anecdotes of situations I was in with them. I just don't register with people. 
I wonder how 'normal' people make friends and go on to form relationships. It boggles me how people go from strangers to acquaintances to friends to lovers... The idea seems too absurd to me. Sometimes I have long periods in which I don't interact with anyone besides the cashiers at the local grocery store. In such times of isolation my frustration can get so severe that I start doubting if love and particularly sex are even things that exist, or just lies portrayed by Hollywood. 
I'm touch-starved to the point of near madness. If I walk outside and see people holding hands, kissing or hugging It fills me with a sad, hollow feeling, the fact that these people have known more intimacy in these 10 seconds than I have in my 3 decades on this planet.
At a recent dentist's appointment I had the crushing realization that her having her hands in my mouth was pretty much the most intimate thing I've ever experienced with a woman. I literally had to hold back tears as I was lying there... yeah I'm that pathetic.
I'm at a loss as to how to overcome any of this. Where to even begin?

lonely,Whilepie,2018/03/07,"Everywhere I go, I'm the one who cannot fit in I'm tired of always being the one nobody talks to, the one whose opinion is unimportant, the ugliest person in the room, the one with no friends, the forgettable one. I don't even know how to make friends... then again I don't know why people would want to be friends with me, I'm quiet and boring as hell... since I don't have any friends I never go out and spend all of my weekends at home, I don't even know what it's like to make spontaneous plans with your friends, or calling them out of the blue when you need to talk... also never dated but I wish I could find someone that could look past my looks. I honestly think I'm too ugly for love. My ugliness is the biggest cause of my loneliness really... Sorry if this post is a mess, just needed to vent.

lonely,BabarLongJohnson,2018/03/07,"I'll probably live alone for the rest of my life, and I'm fine with that I'm not bad with talking to people, I'm not bad with going out and having conversations, but no one would want to be with me. I've tried to date, and get denied each time. It's more of my race than my looks. I am halfway decent looking, but I might be ugly to them, Idk. I've been more and more to myself, and I've figured that I may be happier alone, forever. 

The crazy thing, I'm fine with that. I am willing to pay a hooker for a little sex here and there and end up alright at the end of it all. I would not mind living alone. It's just something that's become something on my mind. It will cost me less, I can hang out at a strip club, buy drinks and chat with the women for self satisfaction. I don't think I'll ever end up being in a committed relationship with anyone because I could never find one.

lonely,JollyRex89,2018/03/07,"How do you make friends? I feel like I've tried everything I know. Ever since I graduated college, making friends is impossible. I have a set of close friends that I love dearly, but I feel like I'm not growing or progressing if I'm not meeting someone new. I've tried going to events, talking to neighbors, plan lunches with coworkers, nothing. I am extroverted, so I'm friendly and outgoing, but maybe I'm doing something wrong? I'm starting to think I must be an asshole because I'm the common denominator, ya know?...

lonely,Jemmy_Time,2018/03/07,"Male, 22 I had a group of people I thought we really good friends/family that dissolved about a year ago. I needed to leave that town. I left for another state where my mother let me live for free for a year so I can save and move to Oregon. But I’m not close with her. I never was. I don’t think I’ve been so alone before. I realized how shallow my old relationships are but I struggle to make new ones. It’s been so long since I’ve had a hug. My hobbies don’t do it for me anymore. I just needed to vent. Reddit has been a recent discovery of mine and it just helps to talk.

lonely,HaruspexLoL,2018/03/07,"I guess I'm tired with everything. Hello.
I feel like I've been lonelier than ever.

I just recently moved to another university because of the shifting education system here in the Philippines.

I'm quite used to being alone, I've been introverted since childhood so its pretty normal for me, and I don't like being around people too. But for some reason, I'm lonely.

I only had a few friends on my old university, and to be honest, they're the best friends I ever had, also my high school friends. But everyone is so busy with their lives that we never got to meet up with each other and stuff.

Its not that I'm just lonely, I'm pretty tired with my life.
Before, my university was 8 hours away from home, so I get to stay at a dorm, and it was a very fun experience for me, I got a chance to be indeoendent, and I got to focus more on my dream and my studies.
But now, my current university is 2 hours away, so my dad forces me to commute for 4 hours a day, 6 times a week. And he reasons out that I'm the same as the working class who are commuting, and I don't think that its a correct argument.

So now, I'm tired physically because of this commuting thing. I'm tired mentally because of this commuting thing, and the problem people that I get to see everyday(the urban side of Philippines is full of toxic and stressful people, don't get fooled by the tourism ads, I can be your tour guide and I'll give you a better experience). I'm also tired of my parents' arguing, which is childish and stressful.

Every single day, this happens. And I'm quite lonely because of it. I guess I'm also stressed, and its bad(I'm hypertensive and my doctor wants me to avoid any kind of stress, but I am experiencing all three of them).

To end this lengthy post of another lonely being, I guess I'm just lonely and I miss having a friend around.

Also, is it bad when I'm hooked to philosophy and I start to change because of it?",4.685234375,5.28704509635417,5.949358333333333,79.76647500000003,69.390625,8.852333333333332,29.4225,8.954980946260402,2.264051375,1503,54,301,26,25,506,186,384,0.128,0.787,0.085,-0.9011,2,12,0,0,0,0,50.0,1,2,2,5,21,26,1,5,16,0,24,7,0,3,5,53,55,32,0,3,8,2,1,2,4,0,7,0,2,0,23,26,0,1,4,1,0,1,5,15,0,1,9,3,36,11,46,40,9,36,0,6,1,0,17,13,0,4,21,197,59,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07544856912540608,0.0,0.2330261108890848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04953914524271888,0.15277498160576805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12970034813970072,0.0,0.0,0.13688620785422226,0.0,0.12165009190144226,0.22203735542036265,0.0,0.06198829147354396,0.0,0.07644949271329787,0.06442814540588565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07706353586662339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396188048598036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07456302563844898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06452171491742269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13179039235020226,0.06137759080225605,0.0696093959190463,0.06547109462078282,0.14251866552184111,0.0,0.0,0.03683414297485825,0.052042633296837205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22512876899265968,0.0,0.11418023647406647,0.0698824497078409,0.0,0.0,0.17478962650183374,0.0,0.2407508897538765,0.0,0.06441925515031002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696792278559904,0.07307249425126477,0.0,0.2152218488498227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07585999284005182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05145470422723295,0.07117971652490987,0.0,0.06432612795825979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07341366060537974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07742590648458315,0.0,0.0,0.056184876678087636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07137558324759387,0.0,0.0,0.076441732724012,0.0,0.0,0.055404194684819934,0.0,0.0,0.08088909474148104,0.0,0.0,0.15151091429850655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06976825706248646,0.1482252321357258,0.0,0.06970570776324789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15496565253006972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497997753409272,0.07192862197444902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07372607585221287,0.058050432749310175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060260627122388714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05156219681810029,0.07764628651633647,0.0,0.0,0.33378859985607223,0.0,0.08339354335265038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679396249338636,0.046678063690460035,0.0,0.0,0.04247826078331268,0.4186403587935605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06291729159245095,0.0,0.060107237969444616,0.04296764405272595,0.0,0.05843427994366344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053034219300294616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,The_Art_ofRaw,2018/03/07,"Square one In high school i enjoyed and loved being alone. It took a long time for me to be that way. I loved it so much that during my free period I would walk from my school to my house and back listening to music and be in pure bliss. The summer leading to my last year of high school i got my first girlfriend, my first for everything. My first love. I started to become more social,made friends, participated in after school activities, prom, etc. It was the best time of my adolescent years. Fast forward four years. Back to square one, still trying to get used to being alone.

Sorry for the speech, i just wanted to let it out to people who might understand. Can't really talk to family they have always been that ""grow some balls"" type.

lonely,ScarceCrimson,2018/03/07,"Why must I constantly crave companionship. It's driving me crazy. Only being one aspect of my horrible episodes of depression, I think this one takes the cake for the biggest. I've been lied to, cheated on, hurt and betrayed by every woman I've ever been with. I don't want another relationship. I can't trust women and I might not ever be able to. That'd be all fine and dandy if I didn't constantly crave the touch of a companion almost every night. It's usually what fuels my nightly episodes, the daytime ones are a whole different topic. I just wish I didn't need to be held, to be loved, or wanted. I'd be completely fine by my lonesome. I'm convinced women are all heartless. I know that probably isn't the truth, but I can't even begin to think otherwise.

I just don't understand why I can't get someone to have genuine interest in me, like the way I have interest in them.

lonely,monologuingrock,2018/03/07,"Bout of loneliness, decided to write it out Hey guys, been feeling a wave of loneliness hit hard today and I decided to write it out in the form of an internal monologue. I've been a lurker for a bit but today I decided to post this. I'm sorry for the cluttered wall of text and weird second person viewpoint. I blame a writing class I'm taking. Making this account and posting this is probably one of those ""lonely decisions"" that I make and then regret, so this might disappear anyway.


You’re going to be blunt here, you have no friends. You’re not going to say you don’t know why and you definitely aren’t going to point fingers and say, “It was Dad’s fault for giving me these genes” or “It was her fault for only going after the bad boys”. Although you’ve done it before, you won’t be stabbing yourself in the heart with the “woe is me” self-pity, spilling those salty tears that reflect the hollow world you view while sitting pretty in the pocket of loneliness. 


You’ve assorted a list of reasons detailing why you have no friends, nicely printed in handwriting you’ve crafted and slaved over because Saturdays weren’t ever about figuring out how to walk in a straight line after having an illegal swig from a friend’s dad’s stash. You’ve had plenty of Friday nights to lay awake and dream and wonder whether friendship is the best thing in the world, or the worst. Hindsight, that bitch, has always had a lot to say and she even draws you some pretty pictures to really drive the point home. Like that time that girl with the midnight hair and the smile that caused a thunderstorm in your heart had her friends approach you and ask, “What do you think of her?” and you, with your middle school lone-wolf idiocy refused to answer or even emote. A part of you wants to leap out of your own head, because if you have to think about how you may have distorted your perception of the world by thinking about your perception of the world too much, you’re probably going to have a hard time digging your head out of your own rear. It’s gotten to the point where you worry about being a narcissist. 


When you look at your fancy list on the stationary that is about as mundane as your personality, you see that word. The one that dances on your tongue and makes you sound like a melancholic hunk of desirable brooding in your own head. Solitary; yes, you are solitary. You say it to yourself and gaze out towards a distant something, an imaginary breeze gently ruffling your hair. Little do you know, you’ve got a massive wad of snot hanging from your nose. What a thing, that solitary nature. Doesn’t it just make you sound deep and thoughtful and prudent and wise? Doesn’t it mask all the times you choked on your own spit while trying to utter a simple greeting? Look how far your lonely mornings have gotten you; your bittersweet piano jinglings and your bouts of profound nothingness that make people appear as shapeless husks. Distance is easy, you think to yourself and shiver with delight. Nobody loves me, and you practically collapse in ecstasy. Look at yourself in the mirror, I know you love to hate doing that, and consider closely that next reason that you have no friends.


You’re afraid and you’re imperfect. You fucked your life in high school because people were scary; life was scary. They were so scary that your brain started ringing the alarm bell at everything. The front door was suddenly Cthulu and the supermarket was a supermassive black hole. If it wasn’t in your head, it was a threat to it. Walk outside and you collide with a yawning beast who will bat you around and devour you whole for fun. Hear a knock at the door and cower at the call of your own shadow who tauntingly sings, “Come out and play!” 


What a blessing, those panic attacks! After you got over it and started shoveling shit for money, you figured out how to use them as an excuse. Yes, my life is pitiful because I feared everything about life for four years. It’s sweet of you to care, but don’t worry, I got through it! Yes, carry on and have a nice day and nothing changes. You still cut conversations with a terse, “yes,” or a final “no”. Small talk, you espouse, is worthless and useless and just plain less but really, you’re still afraid and imperfect. Fearful of a st-stutter in a sentence or an awkward silence. Terrified of the white noise that floods your mind in the unfamiliar cage of conversation. If someone could plug headphones into your brain during a chat, they’d hear the ksshhhh of waves crashing upon a rock. The waves, a question; The rock, your façade of tranquility.


Those fears are puny, miniscule in comparison to the thought of being known. You couldn’t stand it, could you? To have people know that at twenty-three, you still live with your parents. That you’re unemployed, unskilled, obsessed with some far-out dream of developing video games. How would their face subtly contort into disinterest when you say you never finished high school? How fast would they bring down the gavel when they learn that you’re entirely inexperienced with romance? Ah, you don’t even want to think about that. The last time you thought of a kiss—A simple kiss! – your heart sailed off to some fantastic land where everything is made of soft fuzzies and the temperature is always seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit, just how you like it.


You’re so uncomfortable that you move down the list and find the next reason that you have no friends. It’s the last one that matters and the one that always drags you back into the pit. You don’t have any friends because you want them. You want to fill your heart with magic and meaning and mirth because you’re oh so lonely. What a despicable thing! To use people as tools and have them fill a cup with their friendship so you can guzzle it down and then hand it back saying, “hit me again, friend.” What a hero you are, to abstain from friendship for that reason! To stay feeble and alone so that you don’t seek friends explicitly for the purpose of feeling less feeble and alone. You’re a champion of self-restraint! A guru, a martyr! You wouldn’t be a good enough friend to him and you wouldn’t be a good enough boyfriend to her. No, there are too many things broken and you haven’t glued them back together. There are pieces missing and they need to be back before anyone can get close.

That’s the whole story, but you know. You know it’s all wrong. It’s not the type of knowing that’s deep down and buried. It’s on the top, the surface, and you want to scream it and hear it echo and echo across the sky. You know that he is just as imperfect as you and the imperfections in her are a big part of the reason why you’re crush on her is still breaking your spine. You know that this list will never be changed unless you look in the mirror and say “Not bad, could use some polishing though”. You know that programs are rife with errors when they are first written. You know that every artwork is, in some way, a failure. Bugs are detected and removed, and the code is improved. Every artwork is less of a failure than the last. Failure is the start, but you stand still. You know you must step forward, but you’re still alone and afraid and imperfect.

lonely,starfairy42,2018/03/08,"Paranoid about the validity of friendships I have an amazing boyfriend, and he’s my best friend, but he’s my only best friend. The whole 6 years I’ve lived here, all my best friends come and go and turn out to be shifty selfish friends in the end. I’ve been with my man almost 3 years now, which is great, but I wish I had another bestie. Someone that wasn’t having sex with me that would also love me and wanna hang out all the time. I have friends but I’m always second-guessing. It feels like all the girls of the larger friend group always have girls nights and never ever invite me. They were friends before I moved here, but at this point I’ve known them for years! There always seems to be a disconnect to true closeness that I can actually trust. I’ve been feeling super lonely. One of my supposed closest friends will tell my bf vital news before she tells me... further affirmation that everyone loves my man and wants to be his friend and I’m just on the side. He has so many best friends and so many friends in general. I feel like my friendships are shallow and I crave more. We know we’re gunna get married one day, and he’ll have to choose between multiple options for best man while I’ll have nobody to be my maid of honor let alone have any bridesmaids. I’m hoping that finishing my degree will give me more time to build on my friendships more and hopefully make some of them deep. I long for a best girlfriend so bad... it makes me think something’s wrong with me even though I was nothing but supportive and kind to all the other fake best friend I had (one-sided).",3.897738095238097,5.371000079365082,3.9884325396825377,89.84455357142859,72.01587301587301,6.646825396825397,25.823412698412696,6.996647511020387,0.9639126984126988,1255,40,258,11,24,386,171,315,0.056,0.5670000000000001,0.377,0.9993,0,3,1,1,0,0,32.0,1,0,3,9,13,39,0,0,11,0,26,3,0,2,7,54,50,23,0,6,6,0,3,2,14,4,0,0,1,5,10,20,0,0,8,0,0,4,2,5,0,2,7,3,35,34,29,34,16,31,0,1,0,3,35,13,0,6,16,160,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0668174904165891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06856347877708825,0.07091495755781989,0.0,0.054755964742341096,0.17091923093027594,0.0,0.0,0.0465623990363406,0.07179746058843131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057170143874807615,0.0,0.0,0.11652698281451945,0.0,0.5029901581630347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05898141366820255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04415791342338714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06064468455752385,0.0,0.0,0.045224227379738656,0.06193563501853039,0.0,0.06542665307568325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386247410732524,0.0978309111550704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6348031758543746,0.0,0.035773095577384964,0.0656832993987061,0.03891345588823245,0.0,0.0,0.07548914806483151,0.07542815512964902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13601363635763875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07130165932831854,0.03762968591400873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07001589230361649,0.0,0.06690261505094472,0.0,0.06046085017777774,0.06059438241765031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12359489389111095,0.0,0.09140939893760217,0.13883701148042513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727734791511249,0.0,0.0,0.05280879665716902,0.0,0.0,0.06425507922299674,0.0,0.06569944814726611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391924805597178,0.05207502488309183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647269085389501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06233312033456308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058014970859816835,0.05271206181992855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07769969735425405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11969275546716872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043873236349760564,0.06727207909574202,0.0,0.07985158885045751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07447641987765989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040385771256893584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644505040068343,0.07873788372095174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048639594723750415,0.07486192166720898,0.0,0.1322785868934256

lonely,Lonelymuffin1829,2018/03/08,"Broken mess It's been a while since I've been in this constant downward slide. A best friend who I thought would be there for me in my worst times just randomly disappeared because I had become a bit busy. 3 months have passed since and I absolutely feel like shit with no one to talk to. Idk why I feel like I'm the reason she left and I let her down so the guilt is killing me day in and out, giving constant nightmares. I've always hated everything about myself, and most people I add on Reddit disappear usually after a conversation (usually the people I click with) and that's honestly vexing. [this is a throwaway account.]

That said, it's strange. I really need some human connection in my life but at the same I don't really feel like talking most of the times... or starting conversations. I'm a mess ugh.

And people only talk to me when they're going through a break-up and that sort of stuff. It's depressing. I'm not a therapist. The other friends I have barely talk (once every week), maybe because of the time zones or im their last priority so I have nobody to talk to usually which I spend watching stuff.

Yesterday was my 21st birthday and I spent it in such a fashion xD.
I just have this innate talent of being repulsive to people... 

Thanks for reading and have a good day :) 

And oh, don't hesitate to reach out to me if you're on the same boat as me. Maybe our interests could match.",2.85140287769784,4.9098195791366965,4.112267625899282,85.38561007194247,76.23021582733813,7.46958273381295,24.78906474820144,8.364918446050245,1.6428251510791363,1105,38,219,21,25,362,162,278,0.126,0.7170000000000001,0.157,0.9431,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,1,0,1,1,8,20,3,1,18,0,18,2,1,1,0,37,33,19,1,4,7,0,3,3,2,1,1,1,0,1,15,15,0,0,5,1,3,5,4,9,0,1,7,6,27,11,31,21,8,36,0,1,2,0,17,13,1,8,21,141,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08354492127393018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12241179199654675,0.11088932523715636,0.0,0.0,0.10536874957982298,0.0,0.10961614774004574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2170040579417594,0.0,0.0801651437852684,0.0,0.0,0.12950571028778546,0.0,0.08647859449266615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459545989807234,0.0,0.0902374512763012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15230320500596853,0.2151878449695121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15514515558763914,0.0,0.0,0.09631753046294893,0.057062419324923286,0.08421486765653928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912905328923166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845452313174264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1110831472287628,0.0,0.0,0.08184339554403608,0.0,0.0,0.10909021920434037,0.10267081437107252,0.0709189512186272,0.14715828960048982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20174043768161035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014223441738726,0.0,0.0,0.07444896219801797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10692794318093164,0.06803695972063256,0.07636245196956147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.278432466032613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043207244056143,0.0,0.12864390176442175,0.10323296110156098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955080537683998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10306418847946254,0.1661119440672913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07106710602628907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22987918099216045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4035082825703133,0.0,0.09243934342964152,0.0,0.11657782928856407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797102764136152,0.17564071640797455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33174544154297136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08053875561152221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09059980657367868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07132476123150731,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,throwawayxtrash,2018/03/08,Thought I had 1 friend turns out i have 0 I am lonely and only I only have 1 friend. I ask this friend what are you going to do today. he tells me he will visit is grandma. I go back home sit for a few hours alone reading then i open snapchat and look at my colleagues. Turns out he is having a birthday party and i wasn't invited. I thought we were best friends turns out I was mistaken. I was devastated. I kept looking at my desktop monitor for 20 mins without doing anything wanted to type this hear maybe i could relax.,0.60440170940171,2.9594207222222195,2.509259259259263,91.869358974359,87.14814814814815,4.8045584045584055,23.122507122507123,6.297961479604792,0.5785831908831911,410,16,85,4,13,136,73,108,0.099,0.7,0.202,0.91,0,3,0,0,0,0,8.0,1,1,0,1,1,7,0,0,2,0,16,0,0,0,0,14,29,4,0,2,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,1,1,0,3,8,0,1,2,2,0,3,2,1,0,0,8,3,18,6,10,19,2,15,0,1,2,0,13,6,0,0,5,56,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1592523394185302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265340413445611,0.0,0.14374786868692632,0.0,0.0,0.1182344368658968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1613650292256227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12276743172306907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4751883773024696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747743804262473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17330234158664962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542370623002638,0.0,0.15142581372814118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582447831289455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544758372491719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.233887738877905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15380484602110508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13439584522105358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2441416669431276,0.0,0.0,0.14574956819632315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5017507380173079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906935401694071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14822227197377835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,reddit_is_a_resource,2018/03/08,"cannot get over this. long story short: there was a girl. there was a mutual crush. she was waiting for me to ask her out. now I don't see her anymore very much due to schedules (though I occasionally see her around campus) and I fucked it all up by not asking her out when I had a better chance. 

the regret and loneliness is absolutely killing me lately. I can't focus on school or anything else. it honestly feels like I will never get over this. i have never in my life met or seen anyone like her. 

please help me with this.

lonely,Umka1982,2018/03/09,"I am lonely. My life has just no meaning. I am feeling so lonely and feel that i do not belong anywhere or to anyone. Couple of years ago i have lose my dad then my mom the year after. I have lost my job as i became depressed and socially anxious. Its a second year i am struggling with my feelings. I try not to spend my time in my room. Instead i go out and do things. Since i lost my job, the only job i can do at the moment is deliveroo. Again this has taken a lot of courage with my condition.

lonely,throwmeaway-soon,2018/03/09,"Feeling stressed out and alone, nobody seems to care about me as much as I care about them. I’ve never posted here before but I’m hoping someone will talk to me &amp; try to help, or support me in any way, maybe give some advice I don’t know.. I live in a city that all my friends live in and my boyfriend and my mother but my father lives a few hours away, I have the chance to move to his house and get a new job (I hate my current job) but I’m upset about having to leave my friends and boyfriend behind. I’d live with my mom but she makes me a part of the subreddit r/raisedbynarcissists. I can’t live with her, and I can’t live where I’m living now, my only option really is to move away. I’m worried my friends won’t keep in touch and I’ll just lose everything and be so insanely alone even though here I am in this city with my friends and my boyfriend and I’m still writing in the lonely subreddit, why am I lonely when I’m surrounded by loved ones? Why doesn’t anyone worry about me enough to put their own self aside for a second? I do for others &amp; it’s gotten me here.

lonely,Mariluna101,2018/03/09,"Meaningful conversation, anyone? Hi everyone, I'm pretty new on Reddit. Just made my account maybe an hour ago or so, as to release my frustration of some silly dating apps I was trying to use with the hope to find someone interesting enough to have some substantial conversation with. 

Downloaded a few, and deleted it almost straightaway. I got shocked how people are shallow on such apps. They don't know to get past the sentences "" hi, how r u"", "" let's have a drink"" or "" let's hook up"". Seriously... I felt super bad being a part of such a thing. I was not there for dating, and much less to hook up, but really thought I'd happen to meet some "" intellectual people"" to talk with. To my disappointment, that was not found and then I reminded myself of Reddit.

A bit of my background, I've been recently through a messy heartbreak and was missing someone to talk with about random but deep things. I am a chatterbox and love, love to question things. I caught a fair amount of attention from some guys but really couldn't stand their small talks. They'd insist to convince me to going out on a date with them when I clearly had stated I was not there for it for personal reasons and stuff. So well, I'm not yet feeling the weight and the real pain of loneliness as I do have some fair amount of friendly people I am in contact with, however, I can't connect with them on "" THAT intellectual level"", if you know what I mean.
So, I'm here with the attempt to find someone who would be interested in being in contact with, to have meaningful conversations and all. I'm far from being a nerd or super intelligent but I do love to dig deeper the simplest conversation topics haha.

I'm a girl, 25, foreigner, currently living in England.
Recently, I've just realized I may be a mild and spontaneous female version of Sheldon haha. He's boring and hilarious at the same time and it pretty much sums me up too, me just being slightly nicer and smiley.
So, if someone interested pm :)

Ps: By the way, for today I will be unable to talk as it is already quite late, but will be around tomorrow again :)

lonely,LUMPIA1,2018/03/10,"Lonely and wishing Hello there,
I don’t even know why I’m here but there’s nowhere or no one else I can come to so here I am. I’ve been single for the last 21 years of my sad existence and whenever I see someone in a relationship I get jealous because it looks so fun. It is fun to come home to a someone than just a house. I feel like a loser I can’t get a girl because I’m too afraid of being rejected and there’s this small voice that whispers She doesn’t like you and you don’t deserve her. I’m a failure of a man. I don’t even know why I’m alive when I was born I had a disease that should have killed me in a month. But my Mother and Grandmother prayed for me and we believe that God healed me from this disease. Although most nights before I go to sleep I wish God never healed me. I wish I just died instead. I’m literally a waste of space and oxygen. 

Anyways to anyone who actually read my incoherent words thank you.

it's gotta be visible.


 I've put in the effort and turned up with nothing.
Fuck me if they can't see it
I'm a loser..  a weirdo.
It's on my face.. in my looks.

I entertain them with my personality
friendly and funny.
Tiny moments of happiness that disappear.
The glimpse of friendship
But behind my back I know..
they see it on me.
The ways I act subconsciously
how I look when I'm not paying attention.

I'm starting to believe it won't change
Fuck me if it will.
So much effort to learn to open up.
Learn to be social.
But I stink of it 
and god does it linger
I'm a loser.

Years of effort and this is what I have
Has anything really changed?
I hope for a change
but it doesn't change.
It won't change.

lonely,chizaa8,2018/03/10,"I'm Writing Because I'm Tired I'm tired of feeling like a loser, like I don't fit in. I'm angry because I don't want to be alone! I don't want to be a friendless loser! I've always had friends. And I've always had a best friend, at least one person that I could count on and trust. But I moved to a new city last year to pursue a graduate degree, and although I don't regret it, I've never felt more alone in my life. And I'm an introvert! I genuinely enjoy alone time! But this is too much. Grad school doesn't leave me any time to pursue friendships outside of my program, so my social life is based around school... but a lot of the time I feel like I don't fit in here, with my classmates. I'm from a different province 3500km away, and I feel like an outcast because of it. Anyway, if it sounds like I'm complaining, it's because I am. I need to vent, because I have no one to vent to that understands what I'm going through. Even the people I feel closest to here, they don't get it because they have family and friends here, this is their home. I'm just tired of being alone, and I needed to talk about it. Hopefully some of you will understand.

lonely,Ronivader,2018/03/10,"I feel like I just make my own situation worse and it drives me crazy Senior year of high school is being a real pain to me. On one hand, I have more friends than ever, but on the other hand I almost never hang out with them outside of school. I’m very rarely invited to things because my friends don’t really want to hang out with me (most of them like to smoke- I’m not really into that- and one of the only people in my group who doesn’t is an incredibly busy person).
Anyway, tonight was a school dance and I didn’t go because it seemed like a stupid thing and I had to work on a project but seeing all my friends at it together on social media is really bumming me out. I know that if I had gone I wouldn’t have enjoyed it because I’m not terribly keen on the whole crowds, loud music, and rampant hormones thing, but I feel like I’m missing out.
I guess I just wanted to ramble about my problems.

lonely,HypicScreen4293,2018/03/11,"Advice?  I have friends, or atleast people that invite me places but I don't really feel like I have a connection with any of those people. I've only ever been close to one person before, and I really miss her. 
  I don't think there's anything wrong with me, I think if I put effort into socialising I could find someone like that again but it just seems impossible. I don't even know if I really miss her or if I'm just lonely. If I sent her a message I know she'd respond but I don't think it would be out of anything but pity, and I'd just end up feeling more pathetic. We haven't spoken in about six months and she ignored me for a long time before that but I still feel like I need her. I thought she felt the same and I really don't understand how she can carry on like this. 
  I know I don't actually have the confidence or energy to message her but this feels like my last chance. I don't want to grow up and live some mediocre ass life full of acquaintances and shit when I could try and make things work with someone I know understands me. Things are so dead in the water I know we'd never go back but I guess I'm just realising that I can't do this alone and that I made a mistake ",1.495138339920949,3.26256792094862,3.345059288537552,90.672371541502,79.27667984189723,6.771541501976285,20.48616600790514,7.7425588080867325,0.6146347826086953,936,24,211,15,23,314,129,253,0.241,0.7020000000000001,0.056,-0.9943,0,3,0,0,0,0,14.0,2,0,0,3,14,14,1,0,7,0,22,4,2,3,2,66,50,25,1,10,18,0,5,5,1,1,1,0,0,1,13,15,1,1,18,0,0,4,10,8,0,2,5,5,42,6,18,39,4,25,0,4,0,1,17,10,2,10,16,142,55,1,0.0,0.0,0.11066676450246987,0.0,0.0,0.11081789665634084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11745321260682152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07711917967432964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.186645040371869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08720132150876357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19299833149848605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1810890730021548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1004430274530006,0.0,0.0,0.07490282694001206,0.10258116987292447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293635771316056,0.24304931998401386,0.10888643016899303,0.0,0.1036499687966455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876162976810614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06445058370062777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12492821607852825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3116216699687369,0.09244008013082217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08010119191494718,0.277019381388054,0.0,0.1001385509471639,0.10035971431099767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10730640114458752,0.07569861096600235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09051866093972513,0.0,0.0,0.08408825153812705,0.08746480340522905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684605418220697,0.08624949065382109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1572412734099515,0.09902073161856507,0.11848392028270305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140031863194394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2906001763097993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10323950668845468,0.0,0.0,0.11640843807040613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921751049832005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09056525131180504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15068227254112596,0.217995726185252,0.0,0.09003077511562885,0.06612727388716508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699444192801409,0.0,0.0,0.2361168747017799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06688911255229706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256007379756622,0.0,0.0,0.08055954423353279,0.1239903893979603,0.0,0.0
lonely,whathappened2barb,2018/03/11,"It's my birthday today...I'm in bed. So, today I turned 26. 

It's my first birthday I'm spending completely alone. 

I tried arranging a dinner date with my housemates - who are like friends, but they're all busy and dealing with their own problems and issues. We were meant to go out at 6:30. It's 9pm and I've just given up trying to ask them - I don't mind not going out...but I feel like my dream to spend a nice time with them has been shattered.

I'm writing this message and I'm trying to fight back the tears. I recieved the usual birthday messages from distant family (who are in another country) and friends on Facebook and Snapchat...but the friends I thought cared havent really meant their birthday wishes. 

I've just really understood that everyone is fighting their own battles and that not everyone  can go around and make everyone happy. 

I don't blame anyone...i blame myself. I just feel helpless and empty...i hate this feeling. I give my all when celebrating friend's birthdays....

I didn't know birthdays would make this lonely. I would've travelled somewhere or done something! 

Sorry for the rant...

Tl:dr - I've just turned 26 and I'm realizing the world is a lonely place.

Deep conversations that don’t really accomplish anything other than to make you wonder.,2.390029411764708,4.518866517647061,3.6855147058823534,87.56356617647059,77.94117647058823,7.0735294117647065,20.036764705882355,8.07648339933343,0.8720882352941177,334,8,68,6,8,109,61,85,0.07200000000000001,0.782,0.145,0.7483,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,1,0,1,6,3,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,2,1,20,13,7,0,3,4,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,1,0,5,6,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,1,0,2,2,0,9,2,15,11,1,6,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,3,2,48,14,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15964684439973992,0.17270261704610948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826161737604808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2218862278499985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828875087733087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498852090031524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20621470328719085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19459949294333997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024873402679531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10661824425222548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21078338210058808,0.0,0.13702911683483085,0.09477941656109813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949762117533636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19550805368429144,0.0,0.19588638304457925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629211047948069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13449633089248167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2485648750024857,0.0,0.19155324459310755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19634004729891266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16437698543518753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3118623873931547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12888608917892272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3432816341349535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21038653556217132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,The_Crow_Says_Caw,2018/03/12,"Kinda need to vent. Im 26 and I've been lonely for a while now. I have had friends come and go. I had a couple of relationships that didn't last more than 3 months. Right now I have 2 best friends, who are a couple and they are amazing and I do feel lucky to have them in my life. They try and get me involved in a lot of things they do. One of things was a convention that happened over the weekend. I gave it a go thinking this would be a great way to break out of this cycle and try something new. It was pretty fun, loved the panels and ceremonies. But there were alot of times when I was on my own. My mates had their own things going on so I didn't get to spend much time with them. I had to stay at a hotel for this con so I pretty much ended up back in my room every time the loneliness was overwhelming. Didn't know anyone there but also didn't feel like I could talk to anyone and make new friends. Maybe that is on me and my anxiety. It just sucked but coming back home hasn't made it any better either. I just feel hollow inside at the moment like the real me doesn't exist anymore. Sorry if this is tedious for anyone I had to get this off my chest because I don't think my two friends can relate to me on this one.",1.6680331835464912,3.097361003802283,3.0258848945731103,94.66083218112688,77.74524714828897,5.694365710335293,19.17888005530591,6.11248444174946,-0.25798707224334594,956,19,222,6,22,311,139,263,0.057,0.8059999999999999,0.13699999999999998,0.9572,0,2,1,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,6,2,12,16,1,1,14,0,31,3,1,2,0,36,52,18,0,4,7,0,3,2,5,1,1,0,2,0,17,13,0,0,6,2,1,5,7,3,0,3,17,3,30,13,31,32,9,39,1,2,0,1,17,15,1,5,18,160,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08811828016767691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07493244878198096,0.0,0.0842944524105046,0.0,0.10927809843592516,0.23114059590435354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16945741864138364,0.0,0.06717032633972707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11563678923163467,0.09745341148077476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18983651402205606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797712673431864,0.2438445542537568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759494385071074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09283917105589162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16714494275397682,0.07871920144944032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3405276750182184,0.0,0.1727079601310838,0.0,0.18786922069881498,0.0,0.0,0.12148400507775735,0.0,0.0,0.09743996416315724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11052877287298916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11902326716994947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060557114126203175,0.08981892181758684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782990542546354,0.10766577494799756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09367893523109568,0.09945007396399287,0.104263705108134,0.07355216060428588,0.0,0.11069988286239137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08795198488006238,0.0,0.1620035118360267,0.08170391111725485,0.0,0.2128428724139235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14933413564362094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22420410285217768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541945690915374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11830198611436155,0.0,0.09410099261078576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0848290456303953,0.0,0.12334781150706035,0.0,0.11744704836932054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08856592189025499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2196144665416897,0.14120960705277913,0.0,0.0,0.19275666252806636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496224960024712,0.0,0.10763885772886887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08746307468839902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827526106567598,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,chrislikeslemons,2018/03/12,"I hate feeling this way In high school i didnt have a lot friends. Most of the time i just sat there in class did my work and didn't socialize with anyone. Now that im 21 i want things to change. I have friends but sometimes they like to go off and do their own things and i feel left out most of the time. When im not with them i just stay at home all day, bored and play xbox alone. The only time where i didnt feel this way is when i was dating somebody. Who knew only one person can make a huge difference in life. But now theyre gone, and i have no one. I only have me, and itll always be only me.

lonely,Lightly_roasted,2018/03/12,"Just typing this out made me feel better I’m turning 21 this year and I really feel lonely. I often fantasize about being in love but when i meet a girl it never seems to workout and it’s never the fault of the female. I can’t find myself to trust another person it seems. I’ll go on talking to a girl for a period of time and string her along and just ghost her, mind you I’m still a virgin so it’s not like I’m hitting and quitting. I’m feeling depressed and I’m probably not in a place to love just because I can’t love myself. Am I meant to be alone?

lonely,Pavelstodd,2018/03/12,"Being gay can be really lonely I wish I could find a guy like me...someone I could trust.  
You see, I live in Brazil and prejudice is something you'll find everywhere here. I don't drink too much and I'm not really into clubs or any shit like that.  
In the end it feels like the only thing that I do with my life is work. I wake up at morning, go to the hospital, work, come back to home, sleep and get ready to repeat the cycle.  
Sometimes it feels like accepting this Med school chance was the wrost thing I could've done. And it seems that everybody expect me to live like that. That's not the life I dreamt for me...  
Lately I've realized that everybody is going foward, they're getting married or engaged, etc.

lonely,Chrisssssssc,2018/03/12,Do I need friends? Here's some context. I've recently moved overseas due to military. I'm in high school. Due to the timing of the move I had to do online school. After I moved 90% of my friends stopped talking to me. I'm still doing online school because I actually like it now. I've been here for 4 months and haven't made any friends. Only contact I have with kids my age is church and I have talked but I have no similarities. I have anxiety and don't really like socializing. I have the option to go to real school but i like the flexibility because we can easily travel and do things during the day. I'm lonely but I'm still happy. My parents have told me to go to the teen center but I have no interest in that. Is it ok to not have friends? Will it affect me later in life? ,0.13512416009348271,2.4638336196319024,2.711989482909729,89.44378323108387,90.1042944785276,5.558749634823254,20.03184341221151,7.07126945348624,0.5732812737364883,612,20,131,10,21,211,86,163,0.071,0.716,0.213,0.9771,1,2,0,0,0,0,16.0,1,0,0,0,5,11,0,0,6,1,20,1,0,2,0,18,29,8,0,1,5,1,0,3,4,1,1,0,0,1,5,6,0,1,0,1,0,6,5,1,0,0,4,0,18,10,17,24,1,24,1,1,0,0,12,5,0,2,16,83,23,4,0.0,0.0,0.12460055365810367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08682907219959245,0.0,0.0976774309841702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15566919833066642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08234521270757893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3945914294906427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14513080686490926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13592132499362694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13490449404929308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901865425102736,0.18713893977196686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12081709494069265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191565028747357,0.40712165649992893,0.0,0.0946756033294773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971089589228544,0.0,0.0,0.14177727558793576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14533163210618735,0.08179723836720512,0.0,0.12607192716056342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5168895613196156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13015711939232252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2039362134850226,0.10674901724641843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20525411757480566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08482715957900144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07445320169325037,0.0,0.0,0.12200693480703995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Ironicotine,2018/03/13,"Fed up Hey, 26 year old guy based in West Yorkshire here. To be completely honest, I'm really fucking struggling. 

Things really fell apart in my life last year and now I feel so alone and miserable. I have people in my life but I feel like some sort of alien who's completely different to them. Actually I'm under-playing that, interactions seem to be shouting matches more often than not....particularly when it comes to my family. 

I'm so fed up of baggage and people's preconceived notions of me colouring every interaction I seem to have. I would love nothing more than to go for lunch with a stranger and just have a normal conversation. 

I'm working at things, I really am. I took up a new sport before Xmas and have put a lot of effort into that. I'm finally into therapy after months on a waiting list. I'm trying to spend my free time doing activities and hobbies I enjoy. I just hate these long stretches of isolation I seem to have where I don't have anything like a meaningful conversation with anyone.

This ended up as far more of a ramble than I intended. Anyway if anyone wants to talk, please send me a pm and I'll be sure to get back to you. At the risk of sounding like a complete creep, I would prefer to talk to women for the simple reason I find it much easier to open up. I know it's silly but there's some backwards part of my brain that feels like i have to keep up some ridiculous tough guy persona with guys and I often end up lying and pretending I'm fine when I'm not. That said I'm hardly over run with people to talk to so I genuinely would be happy to hear from anyone.

lonely,E-Scope,2018/03/13,"Just messaged a stranger because of a nightmare New low for me

A few hours ago, I made a post on Whisper basically saying I realllly need to make friends (I have literally zero). A random dude messages telling me that I could talk to him any time since he's a night owl. So I thanked him and brushed it off because he's a stranger.

Fast forward to 10 minutes ago, I had a reoccurring nightmare of mine and woke up near crying. My family is asleep, and even if they were awake, it's not like I could talk to them about anything like this. So I just messaged a guy who is probably only interested in sexting, just so I can distract myself enough to sleep again...

lonely,Endless_Depths,2018/03/14,"Are you tired of doing every activity alone too? I'm tired of going to restaurants and eating meals alone. 

I'm tired of going to the theatre or other shows alone. 

I'm tired of going to concerts alone. 

I'm tired of smoking weed or drinking alcohol alone.

I'm tired of going on vacation alone, wandering around some foreign country alone. 

I'm tired of taking walks around the local park or nearby walking trails alone.



Despite me having lots of work colleagues, and having joined various clubs over the years I never end up making friends in them or outside of them.

I'm not a repulsive person. I'm just quiet and find no common grounds with people. In a way, I just want to be left alone.

The worst part of it all is, nobody cares. You're completely invisible as a loner. Nobody gives two shits about your existence, nor does society want to cater for single people in all of the above mentioned places. 

I'd like to be able to go get food for once and not have to awkwardly sit at a table for 2 or something.

But this is life, this is all I've ever known since my memory began. I'm 26 now and I'm practically resigned to being this way.

lonely,Dani212M,2018/03/14,"I shouldn’t be allowed to be left alone with my own thoughts None of my “friends” wanted to go on a spring break trip with me, so fine I went down to visit my grandma in Florida. At least I can get a tan here and she appreciates the company. But I thought a chill spring break with time to spend thinking through my problems would help but it’s actually making it so much worse. I shouldn’t be allowed near social media because I just looked up the guy I’ve been into and was hooking up with for a while who completely pushed me away and it sent me into a spiral freaking out over the reminder that no one has ever loved me. I’m so unwanted. I’m so unloveable. It’s always been this way. 21 years of this shit. I haven’t been able to sleep while I’m down here because every night my mind just brings me back to this. What is so wrong with me that no guy has ever wanted to actually be with me. And I have no real friends to vent this to, so here I am, posting this shit on reddit. How fucking lame is that. No one is even going to read this. I feel so hopeless because I’ve felt this lonely and sad for as long as I can remember, always thinking maybe one day it would change. Maybe some day someone would care, someone would love me. But still... nothing. I even finally cracked and started seeing a therapist. Well guess what that isn’t doing shit to help. I’m still a fucking disaster, hell I think I’m getting worse. I’m so lonely, I’ve always been so lonely. It never changes, it never gets better, I fucking hate it.",2.32729700854701,4.083958759615388,3.515384615384616,90.44072649572651,76.78846153846155,6.032478632478633,24.696581196581203,6.775458762138228,0.8025376068376064,1191,41,252,11,27,386,154,312,0.281,0.6459999999999999,0.073,-0.9979,2,7,0,0,0,1,33.0,0,0,0,1,24,26,8,0,10,0,27,9,4,4,4,50,62,23,0,10,5,0,2,0,2,6,0,0,0,2,22,15,0,0,8,1,1,8,11,18,1,3,10,4,28,8,38,42,5,46,1,6,2,5,13,15,7,2,19,173,50,1,0.08942744298723689,0.0,0.1745365685836108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09261986102909156,0.0,0.0,0.22323238934542255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08402002645791841,0.06876418363056115,0.0,0.16354241762850913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07909130607814051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09117723815213373,0.0,0.18920475404943354,0.0,0.09376297254381497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11534660515799113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181319653655364,0.16178448399937748,0.07534647769073656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045217202168361184,0.0,0.08586436936353575,0.0979633926136382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13818284123515093,0.2480226900812467,0.1401664439377124,0.0,0.10164735341175817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09851441058951152,0.1770944566398449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08829108572918963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988265996949987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09716317846679963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0791404729261878,0.07509652923223467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16142351755292986,0.0,0.059693512609455886,0.0,0.17968377269195807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029622451875073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06573946024908815,0.0,0.13794391411748638,0.0,0.0,0.08392159726239544,0.0,0.08580804341772867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18179504930570145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564677035330924,0.0,0.0,0.08556998549880372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0894516433233509,0.10178800827832417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013038600663894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07126209385075329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2753879553585349,0.0,0.0,0.08949202641706178,0.09116001626203793,0.15154316448012894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632972044268893,0.0,0.1428337429754895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038321539277481,0.0,0.1719044836330112,0.0,0.14199080117910104,0.05214586116230413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10549324571805208,0.0709833417384275,0.0,0.0,0.08040601104967672,0.08290013558438131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18226840880837591,0.2541067587977892,0.09777487035135432,0.0,0.05758834128989144
lonely,GusherGauntlet,2018/03/14,"Realizing that I'll never not be lonely Whenever I see other people talking, laughing, and smiling with each other, I feel left out. The worst part is, I find communicating with other people to be largely unrewarding. It's exhausting and it just feels like a hassle to try to keep up a conversation with someone else. I'm terrible at talking to people and I'm always afraid or nervous when I do talk to others and I get all sweaty and shaky... I've had people say that trying to get me to talk is ""like pulling teeth."" :/ 

Everyday when I get out of class, I see people sitting around on campus and talking to each other. It makes me feel like an alien observing a whole population of a different species or something. I just can't understand how other people find having conversations so enjoyable. I wish I could enjoy it. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere. I wish something, anything would stop that  feeling of loneliness I have. At the same time I don't want the ""hassle"" of talking or keeping up with other people's lives and managing friendships (not that I could ever really make any). I sort of want friends, but I don't really. It's such a conflicting feeling. I feel like a defective human being. There's no winning, so I guess I'll just be like this forever.

lonely,prideagle1991,2018/03/15,"How to succeed in life when everything down on you :,( I look at peoples comments and it hurts me to that people feel the same way as me. Alone scared frustrated and depressed and most of all sad. We cry and cry but no ones hearing us it’s all in your head what to do next. I love me when I was a kid so happy so full of life. Now day in and day out is a struggle cause we’re adapting to life changes. How we do this is. Is we pick ourselves up think what u done and live. We have to flourish ourselves to feel comfortable. We had to strive on for a goal that u didn’t think will succeed. Walking on this dark road is scary and terrifying. But if we face our fears we can do it. We can learn to love agian. We can feel that sensation that everything going to be ok. It’s how we do it guys and girls. We learn and adapt. :,( my best friend is kicking my ass in life right now and he’s a great teacher. But the thing is I feel like he’s pushing me cause what he has. :,( I used to help him out to and now I call my self pathetic and dumb. He saids not to compare. Life will get u down or up. But if it dose go down make sure u pick ur self back up. I cryed and cryed wondering where the fuck my girlfriend. But now it’s just all in my head. :,( the important thing is to love you before u love someone eles. U will win and u be on the highest mountain shouting out as much as u like. Will feel the winds once agian to brush away our proplems and start a new :) well all have a life we all have a special gift. We can all learn something. We can choose what we wanna be. We decide our faith. No I mean that. We do. We can choose the power of what we can. It takes time of course. But if u respect time and dose what it needs to do it can respect you back. I’m 26 years old and I was once a great person.  Now I’m shattered with lose of hope and regrets that I made in the past. I wish my brother knew I was sorry. But he has life to live and so do we. The people that wanna make a change! The people that we fought for so long! We should able to take our courage over the horizon and lift it up to the stars! No one will stop us. Our minds needs to be stronger. There always hope Believe and accept what we have. We can always modified our personality and our change of living. We need to learn and respect others. We need to the kings that teaches the knights what not to do in the future. We need success in our vains. Life isn’t about love and postive it’s how u get there. The path can be so many wonders and terrors.  But that’s life it can’t be picture perfect. Other wise we would live in a really dull world. Our place is our place. Your friend is my friend. Peace will be peace and harmony will lead to good fortune. It dose moving place to place I noticed that. Let others come to of u are. If dosent work on to the next. We have plenty of tools to fix this. Let ur mind flow like the river and frosty as the snow. Let everyone hear your voice that your not alone. Your winning in your success rate. My time will come if I act on my own orders and pry on from sadness and depression. We are leaders of our own selfs and happy to take others so we can teach them. My brother would be proud of this. As soon he reads this he understands my heart and  what I have to believe in. Don’t let anyone get to your mind. It’s the sacred place to live and learn. We can be all be winners :) :,(.  We just need to learn more each day ",0.09011646545256012,2.175052064917132,1.5050419480253758,100.19221233203741,86.36187845303867,4.459286542527795,18.192415251347114,5.668098344346171,-0.6071093854443763,2621,67,632,16,81,835,276,724,0.109,0.657,0.234,0.9992,1,2,1,0,0,0,88.0,46,10,1,15,28,56,4,4,30,1,73,23,5,13,9,156,122,63,0,20,19,2,5,3,4,11,12,5,0,8,47,72,0,1,22,1,0,10,10,17,1,2,10,12,88,39,85,87,16,79,1,8,1,7,93,41,3,11,29,419,135,16,0.053190967959332855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101796024985169,0.0,0.0,0.08851829276353378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03719236154877189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0499746653373872,0.08180114215643801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045261596033485535,0.11985601224115068,0.05582063925138149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05431392539321906,0.0,0.0,0.10928355244139117,0.16880697369094866,0.09163861809357517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23371112259156215,0.10291132186434374,0.0,0.09162660552376906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054432827732022834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050826249333997084,0.09560922445687024,0.0,0.0,0.0598546269235972,0.13447475805001152,0.037999638138205324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12328562969843886,0.0491741927705644,0.083370256147529,0.0,0.06045930575525301,0.044614060295906685,0.0,0.11728645991155436,0.0,0.052667420951809235,0.0,0.11324554894948005,0.0,0.0,0.1091785574418066,0.0,0.11990017338393633,0.06303155313633495,0.03565278460565704,0.0,0.0,0.10566126600332393,0.0,0.0,0.05694203132223199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21756547414701974,0.3381331834213426,0.07795926049607646,0.0,0.23484299605899425,0.047072332821862,0.04466701659823805,0.059507087423818376,0.0,0.0,0.2400346264866964,0.05033057998692148,0.07101076829497986,0.053927292858220316,0.0,0.057940557574301374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16112314379528014,0.0,0.0,0.056533581076795535,0.039101481681323935,0.23664257256922536,0.0,0.051372168309024434,0.11313839572625076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06055826956906234,0.05581497318942152,0.11329328982258252,0.0720871529646292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050776797600661366,0.14750367926217858,0.092888603101625,0.2778662019853512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05320536219067669,0.0,0.03407549610732512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04542479600675897,0.05059679113842578,0.0,0.05325343816667756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16646934030194616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0450685345407275,0.04094900581066866,0.0,0.059542933821785826,0.03764884089402541,0.0,0.0,0.04447003094788468,0.0,0.055606748708411514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050131857812422326,0.0,0.1199789646233374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07067543119374077,0.06816524902237718,0.0,0.0,0.09304824350256108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05537367352590256,0.1279643704478644,0.04593991813428056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04222051453035437,0.0,0.0,0.04782506817388836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061166988098918136,0.0,0.11536667155422815,0.0387236581757652,0.0,0.0,0.07557067502976776,0.0,0.0,0.03425323943142283
lonely,throwawaycockroach,2018/03/15,"18M, i want you to feel a little less lonely for tonight? Time and time again I'm drawn to this part of the internet because the sheer beauty of what a person can be never escapes me

I know times can be rough, so tonight even if it's just for today I want to make you feel a little less lonely.

Want to talk about your dreams? Want me to send you a song? Vent about your friend who you fought with or maybe do the good old escapism by mentally imagining yourself to be in a calm beautiful scenery. Whatever it is, I'd love to talk to you.

Because you're good enough, even though it's hard to believe. Thank you for listening.

I've never posted in this sub before but I totally know how's it like feeling like this and I'd love to try and be of any use if I can.

Although my social interactions aren't at the best but I hope you'll forgive me for that.",1.700499999999998,3.4226617722222237,3.0886111111111134,92.95625000000004,78.5,6.277777777777778,22.36111111111111,7.1686216300943375,0.5639444444444437,669,20,151,8,16,218,104,180,0.073,0.7040000000000001,0.223,0.9805,0,4,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,9,0,1,9,15,1,0,9,0,11,2,0,3,3,28,29,12,0,7,6,0,5,2,1,1,0,2,0,1,10,4,0,0,7,2,0,1,3,3,0,0,1,7,19,12,24,23,6,17,0,2,0,2,22,5,0,4,12,96,29,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09590514728750224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17194099874419752,0.0,0.1200060314876876,0.1588923683596907,0.14800214704554845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14572155471295434,0.0,0.1862977972604994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21392681827096552,0.10075176685242113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10895932723056256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2365783266106301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263350618603369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14007448174875328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15501265590498592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378001409543391,0.28269795795666897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545699265486511,0.0,0.09413853291505324,0.0,0.14168345947850414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14212493773918056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21754185893766986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14798712411950146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15272160526028358,0.0,0.0,0.12314184215260535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13506763059367732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1437621915059032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267089337558353,0.0,0.12984135574944286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1385611306019315,0.0,0.2467069528741597,0.0,0.13367982596685313,0.0,0.0,0.09575002385409404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12180452624970567,0.0,0.0,0.3327322836341685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Wrox26,2018/03/15,"Lost, alone, not fitting in, feeling dumb and worthless. Hey guys, im writing here because i feel like i have to do something to get in contact with others, otherwise i don't know what i'll do to myself. This loneliness is unbearable.

Im a 25 year old guy who lives in Finland. I have been unemployed my whole life and the only school i've finished was the basic school, i haven't done any college or stuff like that, i realized that school wasn't my thing cause i sucked so hard in it. I've had a big passion for gaming since i was a kid...I've almost spent my entire life playing video games. I used to have friends from other countries who'm i'd skype with, i never really had friends here in Finland. Now my life has come to the point where i don't know what will happen to me anymore. Im so lonely it's not possible. I simply have no one (yes i do have my parents around but i don't count them) to talk to daily, and nobody messages me or asks how i feel. I have Facebook with like 300 friends, but it's just dead and nothing happens there. I work in a sh*tty part time job but while im not working i just sit at home and do nothing, sometimes im so depressed and worn out that all i do is sleep in bed all the time and don't do a thing. I have no motivation to do anything cause i feel so outside and left out of everything. I think about suicide daily. I also feel like a very stupid person, my knowledge of things is not good, i feel like i don't know about anything and whenever i confront a new person i can't get any words out of my mouth, i can't be social, which makes me depressed too. My whole life i've felt like i don't fit in anywhere, no matter where i go or what i do i suck at it. I've also experienced two mental breakdowns (psychosis) which has had me hospitalized and im on meds. I feel like this psychosis has somehow broken something in me, like i can't learn anything anymore. Whatever i try to learn or do i just don't learn it, nothing stays in my head. I feel like a small helpess baby who can't do anything. I barely manage to pay my bills and understand it and can so to say ""live by myself"". I just feel like my brains are broken somehow because i don't learn anything and can't memorize anything.
Everyday is a living nightmare for me, i think about death everyday and i don't feel like taking part in life anymore. These past days all i've done is been at the sh*tty work, and after the days i've gone to the liqour store and bought me alchohol and just drank myself drunk and listen to music or play games alone. I see no f*cking future for me anymore. The few friends i have i've lost em all, they don't give a f*ck about me anymore, i have no friends who i could simply chill with or do something fun, and it's just driving me crazy, i don't wanna live like this anymore...But im too much of a pussy to commit suicide. The worst fear i have is that i will loose my job, my apartment and end up homeless soon because i just can't take care of myself anymore cause i don't care about my life. People say to me that ""Be happy what you got"". I understand that there are people who literally have nothing, who live on the side of the streets fighting to find food everyday...I may not be a bum physically yet, but i feel like a bum emotionally and spiritually. What good is a life if you have no one to share it with it, absolutely no one. Thanks for reading and are there any other people who feel the same as me who'd want to connect with me in some way?

Anyway this is a long text. But yeah i hope i'd find some online friends here in Reddit who i could talk to with skype or something, maybe play games together.",2.9508986894112748,4.102199288537552,4.077202690520768,89.5479321822343,73.90118577075098,6.643838846127176,25.96401081755773,6.912458644323713,0.9537715415019768,2856,96,621,25,57,931,289,759,0.17,0.705,0.125,-0.9897,5,4,4,0,2,5,83.0,0,2,2,6,37,46,6,1,27,2,76,15,4,7,6,116,125,45,4,6,25,1,14,13,6,3,7,3,2,4,42,34,3,0,30,10,5,4,33,14,0,4,19,19,90,32,70,97,14,61,0,6,1,1,41,34,3,15,33,402,132,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04546022639770833,0.09403869474136614,0.0,0.07261062589617548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09261799019975453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2701397862876238,0.0,0.0,0.2241555031186192,0.040414455794003726,0.042441643220215534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08302385318739466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05067994804064637,0.0,0.0,0.0925739724793608,0.1399108690979312,0.0,0.03910694828263856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249431360406043,0.0,0.0,0.05855679371241013,0.0,0.07820364379289965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09291723612943636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05106741147332357,0.04020976092484847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04080141182792616,0.0,0.0,0.051086143555494117,0.2754592778173291,0.2594626439106398,0.0435898582119512,0.0,0.0829871534314573,0.0,0.05489627155209397,0.0,0.210449474027911,0.0,0.04743787955048225,0.04355055657140106,0.025801119577780703,0.07615652810866051,0.03630947659909179,0.0,0.0,0.08990367380875039,0.0802918165416378,0.048327745639770034,0.04066830562002886,0.0,0.046592149557405434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04553858383625069,0.045091138987393864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3432686008102279,0.0,0.09010238183277787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484979196375635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04932580538568461,0.0,0.22446504260753927,0.2883335636829095,0.0,0.200439358263585,0.040176408669278484,0.0,0.0,0.09911605772107283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303975561771432,0.0,0.04560908228109063,0.0,0.0504277059615063,0.0,0.045751197799660095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033373257993144764,0.0,0.035014265533849835,0.04384633402429874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17424505525395134,0.0,0.04763828428068797,0.0,0.09228997407899774,0.03452774659448494,0.0,0.0,0.05040986844731392,0.0983247061591308,0.043338182941593036,0.09442119833989536,0.07928076335311895,0.0,0.0,0.04291643260650484,0.05118019740697266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0454109717242828,0.0,0.029083560876347243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072205714864285,0.0,0.1378376824487141,0.03617687510973856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037554262357623616,0.0,0.045431472583277815,0.04627824338448934,0.0,0.13980050644832318,0.0449004614883044,0.0,0.0,0.04838895899651775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05197063415282208,0.09931758838489724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826832416493828,0.07297948858382422,0.0,0.041797010742550114,0.0,0.0,0.09048260951702126,0.05817928999036659,0.0,0.0,0.052944678013793774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030822727878410724,0.0,0.04434791972545487,0.0945232667994153,0.0,0.039209888581065735,0.0,0.037458670645961256,0.026777321357240685,0.036035363966727435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10137202371244317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09915235273721763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029235265455217607
lonely,lonelypanda9,2018/03/15,"""I've been lonely since the beginning"" Last year, same date as today, when I saw her. I tried getting out of my comfort zone. I did everything in my power, knowledge, effort, wisdom, every shit there is since that day. But It wasn't enough even though I was struggling at that time seeing her smile or laugh or be thankful for what I did made every pain and exhaustion go away. But it was only me that fell in love. Since the beginning my life was shit I thought she was the ""worth the wait"" but I'm wrong. I just wanted let this out of my system because today would be my greatest day, yet here I am still lonely.

lonely,ShaneCage,2018/03/15,"16 year old going through some rough times..... This maybe a long post, so bare with me here.....

My name is Sean, I'm 16 (Male), and I currently live in the state of Kentucky. As long as I can remember, I've always been a shy and awkward kid. I was kind of quirky in Elementary School, but that's irrelevant. I started to feel lonely in Middle School. I didn't feel lonely as much as I do now though. At the time, I didn't have much friends at the school, but I thought nothing of it really. I was sometimes called ""names"" for not knowing some adult stuff, like porn, sex, condoms, etc, because I was never educated on sex education, Middle School basically taught me sex ed because kids basically non stop made dirty jokes and shit. What basically got me through Middle School was my love of professional wrestling. I watched it basically every time it was on TV. At the time I loved John Cena and Daniel Bryan, etc. Let's move on from Middle School though, nothing really much to talk about it.

When I got to High School, I was shy as I could ever be at first. At the time I was medically confirmed to have Anxiety. I'd be nervous of a shit ton of stuff as simple as talking to someone at the cash register at McDonald's or not answering the phone when there is a number I don't recognize. I then actually had a crush on this one girl named Hailey. She was as beautiful as she could be to me. So, as the year went on, my confidence boosted up, and I started actually making more friends in 9th grade. I didn't feel depressed or lonely anymore, but I still had Anxiety. The year was so good, and it got to the point where I found out Hailey liked me, so I asked her out and she said yes. I was so happy at the time, and I never felt happier. I never had these many friends, and I never even had a girlfriend. 

Then.......2016 happened. My grandpa died, one of my dearest and bestest friends......I wasn't really depressed, but I was sad. I got over it though, as my belief is that I knew that he was in a better place, and that he's at peace. A month went past, and things at home got worse. I forgot to mention that my parents divorced in 2010, and I lived with my mother and my brother. My brother has autism. My mom started drinking more and more as months went past. I started getting depressed about it as I felt like I could do nothing. 

Then, April came, and my girlfriend broke up with me, which made things worse for me. I felt so lonely, even though I had friends who cared about me. I had no family I felt like that cared about me though, at the time. Eventually, I just felt like dropping out. I stopped hanging out with friends and talking to them. I never wanted to do anything anymore. My girlfriend was usually the one to talk to me about stuff when I was down, and now I had no one to talk to. 

2017 came by and my mom was taken to get help. My grandma took me and my brother in, same with my dad. Now I live with her, my bro, and my dad still. Things sometimes are chaotic here, as my Grandma also suffers with depression and anxiety. I am now homeschooled, but I want to go back to school, but at the same time I am scared too. I have a few friends, couple which I talk to daily, but not on a personal level, just on Xbox. I hangout with only one of them occasionally, but that's it. I still feel lonely, and I've never felt this lonely in my entire life. I have no one to talk to I feel like when I'm down. Sometimes I talk to my grandma, but sometimes it doesn't help. I want to hangout with more people, but I never do. I feel scared to ask them if they want to hangout. The friend I just told you about that I hangout with sometimes, I feel like he doesn't want to hangout with me anymore, as now he doesn't even talk to me on anything. I have a couple of other close friends, which they are actually dating, and one is my ex. You see, my ex promised me that we could still talk to each other if we were ever feeling down, etc, but that kind of close friendship never happened. We still talk, but not on a personal level as we use to. She now dates my other best friend, which is kind of awkward and depressing to me. I try to show that I don't really care. I kind of still have a bit of feelings for her, but not as much as I use to. Her bf, my best friend, is a really cool dude, but it seems like he is always busy when he isn't on the xbox. He's always either with his gf, or doing something else. I have a few other friends, but I don't know them on a personal level, it's just people to hangout with on occasion. I want to get a job, but I'm too scared to. I want to drive, but I feel anxious about it. I had a therapist at one point, but it never really worked out. I want to date, but at the same time I'm not really desperate. I guess what I really just want is to feel loved and for someone to care about me, as I want to love them and care about them as well as helping them out. I just want someone to talk to I guess. I have never felt suicidal, as I guess I just don't want to die. I still have some hope in some things.

I've felt scared posting this, but now I feel like I have to. Sorry for such the long post, I am kind of new to reddit.

A few things about me before I go. Again, I love professional wrestling (yes the fake stuff), I love basketball, I love football, and I love slasher movies, like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. I'm also kind of a gamer.

lonely,Julianhyde88,2018/03/15,"I searched for this sub specifically I don’t know why I’m even posting. I have a job that takes me out of town pretty frequently. Lately, it’s been 4-6 days at a time. I have left my wife at home for 6 of the past 8 weeks only to return on the weekends. She doesn’t talk to me much anymore while I’m out of town (maybe one 5-minute phone conversation a day) and I have felt so alone lately. 

This post isn’t asking for company. This post is primarily to let you know that, even if you’re lonely, we’re alone *together*. Any time I feel alone, it helps me to know that I’m not alone *in* feeling alone. If you’re feeling alone, remember that my heart is with you, too.

lonely,WhirlyTwirlyMustache,2018/03/15,"Something that helped me. This may not be for everyone, but if it can help at least one of you, I want to share. I've always been shy and anxious around people I didn't know. Meeting new people was always a nightmare, especially when there was conversation expected. In my life I've found myself in a few customer service jobs. What I've managed to do is go into ""customer service"" mode where I can plant a smile on my face and go in with an attitude of ""how to make this person's day."" Yeah, sometimes they're assholes, but the nice thing about social interaction vs work environments is that you can call audibles and not deal with it. You'll end up putting your best foot forward, and if you're not forcing it too hard, then you don't have to be fake. Basically, it's an easier way to be the best you and be outgoing. When you feel that rejection, just thank them for their time and wish them a nice day. That last bit helps to keep you from dwelling on any perceived awkwardness. I hope that helps.",4.433852813852816,5.5671776666666695,4.884300144300144,85.23454545454548,70.31313131313132,8.283405483405483,28.284271284271284,8.634040054169528,1.9023119769119767,790,28,163,13,14,251,127,198,0.096,0.659,0.245,0.9884,1,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,8,3,3,9,11,0,2,8,1,18,3,2,2,0,31,29,14,0,6,9,0,2,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,13,10,0,1,4,0,0,4,5,4,0,1,5,3,19,7,23,18,5,24,0,1,0,0,23,11,0,4,10,106,32,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25106937422139963,0.0,0.0,0.1025957610914192,0.0,0.0,0.170438474597959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13430496091543298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3166543892327857,0.0,0.16470933958640085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15405361800652634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19459541731711646,0.15553881039327333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13362472074242127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416132774269338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07628365233473956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16541953536599266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714841033184162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13514855240498494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4044959314389431,0.0,0.0,0.14984647300961082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14971371793448845,0.13409886470958318,0.0,0.0,0.08291338818186025,0.12297797274846227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10656289114521464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10070590271340008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14570974820084495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223240767069916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2091864590443485,0.13173256467635205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15166452387956406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1537914478093977,0.0,0.11614595066058983,0.14921281523643198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13889945525365713,0.0,0.0,0.10023033504522204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08797264211062038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08898615675131234,0.119752401808731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17349134224750604,0.0,0.0,0.10983407296076986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,blesste69,2018/03/15,"I never realized the weight of lonliness, until now. My whole life ive always felt like an outsider, having sparingly few relationships which all felt good i guess but then all ending up coming to a stop for one reason or another. I get this is natural, but wow i really didnt spend alot of time investing in people, and here I am, 19 years old alone in my parents house, feeling the weight of social deprivation. Its so so important to surround yourself with people that have a similar experience of the world as you.  If you dont you could end up like me, waiting until the end of another lonely day comes.
I really miss having people I could spend time with who understood and valued me. Wow. just a rant. i dont really know what im talking about here anymore.

I would just sit and laugh at every thing . I was just that guy who sat with them and laughed. I found a secluded area and eat lunch alone now.

Everytime I see co workers laughing and joking I get mad at myself for not being able to make jokes or just be normal.

lonely,zahat1,2018/03/15,"My roommates think I'm weird I'm in college. I spend most of my days alone. I go one of three places in a day class, work (I'm a grocery store cashier) or back to my apartment that I share with 3 other guys that I don't know (random room assignment). Because I keep to myself and have made no real effort to be friendly, because honestly idk how to be friendly, the situation with me and my roommates is kind of tense. It doesn't help that they are good friends with one another. We give each other passing nods if we see each other in the apartment or on campus but thats about it. I hate it because i wanna be friends with my roommates but at this point we've lived together for months so that ship has sailed. Every so often I hear them talk about me and how I'm weird or how they always see me alone (thin walls). It happens so often I keep my headphones in and listen to music or podcasts to drown it out. I feel like a prisoner when I'm in the apartment. I get anxious when I here my roommates voices in the common room. its gotten to the point where I will stay in my room even if i have to go to the bathroom if they are in the common room which sometimes lasts for hours. I think its social anxiety. I've never felt more alone and its driving me crazy tbh. I wanna be different, better. I feel trapped inside myself. Why can't I relate to people in the same way everyone else does. Its a skill I used to have. I was never a social butterfly but I never shied away from a conversation. Since I git to college I have shut down socially. Anyway this is getting long I just needed to get this off my chest. I can't talk to anyone around me. Although coming here doesn't solve the problem it is therapeutic to talk about the issue  ",3.201285341679707,4.491085157746478,4.329327073552424,87.44174230568598,73.47887323943661,6.7240479916536255,25.26082420448617,7.0931098945946705,1.0146098069900886,1361,43,281,13,27,445,177,355,0.128,0.799,0.073,-0.9533,1,4,0,0,0,0,32.0,2,0,4,4,21,14,1,0,16,0,21,1,1,5,3,53,51,24,1,7,11,0,4,1,4,1,0,3,4,1,22,16,0,2,6,0,2,5,9,4,0,3,4,9,47,10,46,42,5,51,0,0,2,0,23,30,0,11,15,197,69,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3093555676595723,0.0,0.0,0.08284542112801023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10440178368454184,0.07616636880342452,0.11247924800284204,0.0,0.06961762951041839,0.0,0.0,0.08863327979467787,0.0,0.0,0.09354387813753257,0.0765587525372399,0.0,0.18208030430246228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880564766450939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08576577417542203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284213922722505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10402343652158877,0.0,0.0,0.08712933477052956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08317314422900872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06576123954112077,0.0,0.0838871638623523,0.09513789520728076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10068533961902172,0.07112871082322808,0.09559728129961444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3076923301773313,0.0,0.15605461344680352,0.09551108854420473,0.11316930071802055,0.08350975822180502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0985842481199846,0.08804432598364721,0.0,0.0,0.09829907121272258,0.0,0.0,0.11221613123344992,0.0,0.06673580935258837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0980507177795574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391919585131687,0.0,0.176994537133101,0.0,0.10368083150204703,0.05471790083818934,0.08115814183557991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048642057025651636,0.0,0.08791704539284123,0.08811121666168323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09421008843386226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07947122409366568,0.0,0.0,0.0738256201788143,0.23037023259835504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13493460749921454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690253056453,0.0,0.10402343652158877,0.0,0.18824077198466946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09526952838725443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11332589911785668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1586796125644883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08236056573400277,0.1119143739920463,0.0,0.30447960367529364,0.0,0.0,0.098471576266864,0.0,0.0,0.10612222922343273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2400778868788693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12759348571351908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08599153340175307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07902945701522693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08984123768699777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0724839503572078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,throwaway81926,2018/03/16,"They went out without me :( I'm 19, soon turning 20, in college. Lost contact with high school friends and made no new friends (social awkwardness) at uni. Just saw a post from a friend of all my former friends at her birthday together where I wasn't invited. :(

I have one best friend that I met online 4 years ago and we started meeting every now and then. Our last meeting was pretty lame (I'm awkward and despite knowing him very well, when he's there in person it feels like I'm talking to a stranger). He's not texting me now because he's out with other friends and I have no one else to talk to and I'm really sad.",1.949761904761904,4.014119611111116,3.020873015873015,92.10607142857144,79.07936507936508,5.469841269841268,27.96031746031746,6.42735559955562,1.1382984126984126,485,22,101,4,12,155,88,126,0.1,0.6509999999999999,0.249,0.9698,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,2,0,1,2,8,14,0,2,3,0,4,0,0,1,1,18,17,8,0,0,3,0,1,1,6,0,0,0,0,1,3,11,0,0,2,0,0,1,5,5,1,2,7,2,12,9,14,10,2,21,0,3,1,0,22,8,0,0,12,58,15,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303472312334832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08963775606699168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15431549718978949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228378990624926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12389243021509395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07435077572118848,0.10504955032710624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6816433311555107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15536196318355766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08081252719707467,0.11986195456852025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0718391512849053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16051786317848799,0.0,0.0,0.1391382932673964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420177518681579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1992840820155576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283947224819495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14082923109821904,0.14959844455003038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09420130608161162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14881820202068388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14989467722045755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407977549338124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23637969129685696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15994360730668591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12132818652891375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13221183548532206,0.13631293163917224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14174690578249444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469267539945092

lonely,StellaLuxx,2018/03/16,"Lonely with no one to talk to I've felt lonely for a long time but I didn't really realize how much until recently. 

I was recently broken up with by a guy that liked more than I've liked any guy. To me this was devastating. To my friends, I'm just overreacting. I don't feel like I can tell anyone how I really feel. They think it's silly because he and I weren't actually dating that long and he didn't put in much effort to see me. I don't know who I can talk to anymore. I'm also afraid to try and meet someone new because I'm scared to feel unwanted again. 

I'm also trying not to spend too much money lately because I'm trying to save up for better things. So all I do is work, then come home and watch movies in bed. I hate having no one to talk to and no one to be around.

I want a smart  guy who is kind and a compassionate but still grounded. I doubt he exhists. The 1 I’ve met is too worried what others would think. I really done care about how people feel. But I know he does to a point and I don’t like seeing him unhappy even when it means I’m miserable.,2.6160439560439563,3.827311703296701,3.873406593406596,90.44659340659344,74.82417582417581,6.958241758241758,20.69230769230769,7.447530270364453,0.41585274725274735,339,7,76,4,7,111,65,91,0.2,0.589,0.211,0.0689,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,2,0,9,7,0,2,4,0,6,2,1,1,0,23,20,8,0,3,8,0,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,7,3,0,1,6,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,3,4,8,5,7,15,0,4,0,1,1,0,11,2,0,1,3,47,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18580856590593428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2276754540054273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19541667507531674,0.22851967301517045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14749157460919707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129102749894592,0.0,0.2144088774120783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22110814954739666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325389424185895,0.2454463878798385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10909608202347833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24324580998033624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3096246691378253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21109644571335084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430556073002726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17794605210322376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17833254186191902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430855337359893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2566575150958765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2634234497571425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2267781865602729,0.2275679959566898,0.15863024820570412,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Bigmatt44,2018/03/16,"my friend I'm starting to get worried about losing possibly the only friend i have and going back to a life of loneliness.  imma start with some background here:

so for most of my life i haven't had friends, had some in grade school but after that not really (just turned 22 a few weeks ago).  partly because of mental illness and autism and blah blah thats kinda important but not really.  so i graduate high school and I'm still at this point of having no social life, never dated anyone didn't go to prom or any dances or whatever (this is still true now) and continues when i start college.  first year of college is fine still I'm getting good grades, As and Bs mostly and then second year hits and i crash hard.  gpa goes over about 2 years from 3.4 or so (highest in my schooling career) to like 2.1 or so.  but thats what depression will do.  so i move into my parents third house several addresses away from them as a caretaker and because i have a nice house with no adult supervision and a pool it becomes very popular with my younger brother and his friends.  eventually they start coming over frequently, i start hanging with them and stuff at my house, they introduce me to marijuana and I'm still a frequent user so that part i consider all positive and such.  eventually i start forming my own friend group out of my brothers friends, friends that actually came over to hang and smoke with me, occasionally doing stuff elsewhere.  best time of my life.

  that was around 2 years ago, and since then things have changed a bit.  my brother and his girl moved in with me, they broke up, and she's still living here but leaving once her lease is up at the end of the month.  that brother goes to college now and is gone 4-5 days a week.  most of the people that use to come around to the house no longer do, for a variety of reasons.  some we didn't think should be coming around the house because they're with a bad crowd, for example or others just started hanging out elsewhere.  for most of the 2 years, I've had about 2-3 real good friends.  one of them moved away about 1.5 hours away and we still see him almost every week driving there.  the other friend still lives nearby, although his dad is currently moving in with his girlfriend and he's been having a tough time because he may not be invited to move in with them (he's about to turn 19).  I've long considered this friend to be my best friend because we have a lot in common, like video games, weed, similar humor that kind of stuff.  so for the past idk 2 months maybe it seems like the dynamic is changing and its whats making me worried.  whereas he use to come to my house every day, hang out for hours playing games or listening to music or smoking, he now comes to my house maybe once a day, often not even, for only about 30 minutes maybe an hour or two if he wants.  i frequently want to play video games with him and while we use to frequently, he's flat out not played any game with me in at least 2 weeks, possibly longer.  i do know he is more busy than he use to be because he's struggling to find a job (high school incomplete for him) but i still think i see him playing other games that i don't own, even a game i do own that he's been using the disk for, but just never wants to play with me anymore.  I'm just worried that if this friendship fades then ill go back to how things were before and i don't want that. its hard/impossible for me to make new friends on my own.  i don't think id be able to handle going back to not talking to anyone, sitting in my room most of the day, mindlessly playing video game after video game.

tldr:  friend spending less time with me, worried about going back to how i was most of my childhood, friendless and alone.  is there anything to do?",6.747871931989579,5.861517165775402,6.576898395721932,82.07022692993283,65.17647058823529,9.65040449746332,32.01371177841766,8.69343788997812,2.2868503633621287,2952,96,610,37,39,931,306,748,0.105,0.769,0.126,0.9735,3,1,1,0,0,0,76.0,4,0,7,4,47,39,0,1,28,0,42,6,0,10,4,123,90,58,0,7,26,6,1,5,14,3,6,1,2,2,31,56,0,0,7,20,1,23,17,6,0,5,12,4,64,33,109,69,25,126,0,3,2,0,67,33,0,26,72,397,95,15,0.042259585902005035,0.0,0.04123925982180312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07492114620924052,0.0,0.0423168708963219,0.043768186170203734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05747593511262398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0419101537253146,0.059097770093991274,0.0,0.03477603844727318,0.11285997301585217,0.0,0.0,0.11911281616630445,0.1299800521203177,0.03528498904409183,0.1545663079594021,0.046672392461722216,0.03595979503703175,0.0,0.08869765638978898,0.0,0.046136522668200654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0483337081897532,0.0,0.0,0.08941007692639634,0.1820144566755805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10901574743391627,0.0,0.03639811941381912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037429449799540764,0.0,0.0,0.05582411585725491,0.0,0.07121104752686767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038624495917482536,0.03594598217992602,0.0,0.0,0.42444546609989897,0.0,0.04415777886742379,0.0,0.1200854827032437,0.07089067132425797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0757125766791904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08929914543547238,0.0,0.0,0.12485153870442985,0.34133321775210806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041936118246663295,0.0,0.0,0.04400685563665208,0.023224763228092943,0.0,0.0,0.044746799667718384,0.0,0.0,0.1193967811480708,0.06193769717275235,0.0,0.07463197716595021,0.037398403691659365,0.0,0.047277667040908605,0.0,0.03592758871679182,0.0,0.0,0.05641720348130164,0.0,0.12736630233891194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04258772302853951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06746239657402678,0.2245762596094681,0.0,0.0,0.06518639573691827,0.04081457140030411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001015956390633,0.028636189093878005,0.06428063873669544,0.0,0.0,0.0469242690593615,0.09152602673057678,0.04034155651527997,0.02929747588635543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03994896818269507,0.09528266697010154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04810066055724923,0.054145145694731785,0.043449892631354174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17107582825777531,0.06735083719373385,0.03847153984613821,0.0,0.04774130335637335,0.0,0.03495756615664965,0.0,0.0,0.0430783259519517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093808668723388,0.0,0.2699884791221899,0.0,0.0,0.044178894724588455,0.14513134602135289,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0339666543833685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05615078217746718,0.08123470883614399,0.0,0.0,0.07392571314613998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09193258863161312,0.041281474868262516,0.0,0.0,0.1824935690408009,0.0,0.03486858415102157,0.09970319469247507,0.0,0.13559236300664826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17166664325040604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13606893892971328
lonely,KoldGlaze,2018/03/16,"Is making friends as an Adult possible or am I doomed? Growing up, I always struggled with friendships. I would make them and then people would just leave. I was bullied a lot too. 


As I grew, I tried to self reflect and be a better person. I made 'friends,' but I consider them more of acquaintances that would only talk to me at school/work. I would try so hard, but so many people just seem uninterested. I don't think its because i am boring, but nothing just clicks.


I want friends I can hang out with outside of work. I just feel like I am never going to make a decent friendship.",2.4324901185770758,4.632866652173917,3.3655335968379454,89.55407114624504,78.13043478260869,5.5731225296442695,24.367588932806324,6.574015621080383,0.7629999999999999,455,16,91,4,11,145,76,115,0.128,0.711,0.161,0.7066,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,2,2,7,8,0,1,4,0,12,0,0,4,1,28,21,11,0,5,8,0,2,1,3,4,0,0,0,3,2,5,0,0,4,0,0,4,2,3,0,0,2,3,18,5,12,14,2,9,1,1,1,0,9,3,0,3,3,65,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13050390138328433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0956085432080804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13871272048329827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07930329433705237,0.11204691987082252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3635238583537017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913609864870589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14049832569065673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.166071495888149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07662437014288373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13334022647783322,0.0,0.14840632014273586,0.31407685394957274,0.15901170005248802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096510065497243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.150492737217698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1192843053684361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174669778542448,0.13694711816447794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17681415378799464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15873100936852694,0.0,0.14278174570723387,0.16361889873724442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16396379602741684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12606249263969735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049709114869056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2129688755954796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09250861966868218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22836357593430515,0.0,0.0,0.44566010543827056,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,RickyRicardo1838,2018/03/17,"I'm feeling really lonely and frustrated Well I'm an introverted person, I'm used to spending time on my own and I enjoy my own company. I don't have any friends, but I've always thought that it's ok as long as I'm happy. But recently I've met a new girl at work that I've started to crush on. I've noticed I crush on girls or lust, if you will, after having a nice conversation with them. During our conversation she showed interest in what I had to say, and that made me happy I suppose. After that I've started crushing on her really bad. I can't think of anything but her, and I'm constantly distracted. This leads to severe frustration because I know I don't have a chance with her for obvious reasons, such as I'm 16, she's 21 and has a baby. Since I rarely get to see her I've realized that I'm really lonely and I desire to connect with people, or perhaps desire to find a ""girlfriend"", but I don't know and that's why I'm here. I honestly don't know how I feel, so I didn't know how to title this. All I know is I don't feel well and I really need help.

lonely,-Sugarholic-,2018/03/17,"Discord group chat. For those of you who haven't heard of Discord, its a free messaging app you can download on your phone, PC, tablet etc.

It was originally made for gamers but now it's used by non-gamers as well.
It allows voice and text chat. You can join servers and chat with people. You don't need to provide your phone number to the app, some servers require you to have your account verified through your phone but most don't. 

I was planning to make a server for this sub but then realized its probably better to just recommend one to people. 

There's the /r/Casualconversation discord, just people who want to talk.
I just joined it right now but I've been on other servers and it's nice to have someone to talk to. Before I used to use my phone just for games and browsing the web now I actually get to talk to people, whether its for casual conversation or a game or other hobby I enjoy.

This is the invite address if any of you decide to get the app: https://discordapp.com/invite/rhKe8pr    When you copy the address you automatically join, no need to wait to be accepted.

It has voice channels as well but if you got anxiety like me you can just text people, most people just text...

It's nice to have people to talk to without relying on Facebook or other of the really bad social media apps.",4.304243027888447,6.1340959482071735,4.959480079681274,81.85850298804783,71.58964143426293,7.569800796812749,26.095816733067732,8.238735603445708,1.6211687649402389,1037,34,199,16,20,333,125,251,0.063,0.773,0.16399999999999998,0.9763,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,14,0,3,13,11,0,0,10,0,15,0,0,7,0,41,28,19,0,5,18,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,2,0,18,5,0,2,3,7,2,0,5,1,2,1,6,3,21,11,37,21,4,10,0,0,0,0,34,4,0,8,7,136,39,2,0.0,0.0,0.12537012949803386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08736535838939309,0.0,0.09828072036599847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10726874499953327,0.0,0.0,0.10932020070185408,0.0,0.0,0.11362303459558445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14328022839015864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13424262411294668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275078618644036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06276492472554475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12156330283935116,0.08575605062906841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19052070478418925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08705594500344498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6234641099758987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13851453376972994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230244622200436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10971437712063503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13096101449181047,0.10885389984228004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4130436750861816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328756502720843,0.0,0.0,0.07577610803379803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23102349495061364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384241339703178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I got abused when living at home, my family never cared about me, being isolated on the outside of a very small town with no neighbours didn't help. I got bullied in school, I had no close friends because I was shy. I explored online dating only to be cheated &amp; betrayed.  I tried making online friends, but eventually they all left me, the last one recently...

lonely,IREALLYTHIS00,2018/03/17,"No replys.. or textback.. what is wrong with people Or is something wrong with me?

Im having normal conversations on the phone with people, either friends or acquaintances that dont seem too bad. But it always seems like they dont really care about me.. because always when im coming to an end of a conversation I never get that last text back and im always left on Seen.

lonely,Kerrman7,2018/03/17,"Feel like I need someone This may come off as a little weird to some, but everyday I am surrounded by people and yet am still lonely. Everywhere I look and turn I see nothing but friends and other having that one special person that they can relate to, eg girlfriends/boyfriends, etc. I feel at ease when talking to people but I feel like I need someone to just rely on who I can show my love and affection to that nobody else will understand.. my family ain’t the most supportive for this and I feel any attempts that I have made to get this special ‘someone’ has gone south. For example, a few weeks ago this girl asked me out but when immediately dumped me a few days later. This took a huge chunk of my self esteem out and I am wondering if I will ever find that one person who I can love. All my friends seem to be in closer relationships with each other then with me and i always feel perpetually alone. I don’t know what I can do, as I have been trying to find someone for ages. It just hurts everyday watching everyone else fall in love with people around me, whereas I’m just left with myself. This might seem selfish, and I apologise, but I just needed to get this off my chest.. thanks..",5.236751412429378,5.78822329661017,5.795999999999999,81.53092090395481,68.15254237288136,8.835706214689266,28.445197740112995,8.841846274778883,2.043155706214689,942,30,187,15,15,305,131,236,0.097,0.723,0.18,0.9763,0,3,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,0,1,1,10,16,1,0,5,0,20,4,1,2,2,50,49,19,0,4,10,0,5,2,2,4,0,0,0,4,18,17,0,0,12,1,0,4,2,5,0,2,4,8,30,11,29,40,7,32,0,2,3,3,15,15,0,8,15,135,48,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09651701194122388,0.0,0.0,0.11276855096256505,0.0,0.0,0.09059825396228104,0.0,0.0,0.0740432547588806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969277515040982,0.10178964349892354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09379189922892914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07021965579300636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18191329203475912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12143181975306964,0.0,0.098489684750799,0.0,0.10404108125792227,0.0,0.0,0.10264392808158768,0.0,0.2752691652984581,0.15557014303096325,0.0,0.0,0.1990317085261905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16824338323163418,0.0,0.11377233493844778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11656005677020895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05983850656949705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183002297873947,0.0,0.0,0.10638814736298728,0.10912801613271007,0.0,0.0,0.09143316228014073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2948098166548711,0.10302644855352444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11550622274043708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24220308840780574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044748783860817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14756204594126093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2264544769836151,0.1901425115932521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11689814277701305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08676457697970036,0.19824352715356744,0.11358730569509475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3690202700981837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0869530252201858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12355760452546265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08751494478120145,0.0,0.10024359332011856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12097151787010528,0.07392349222033319,0.11843196752441908,0.0,0.11334963611026345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0873382908671873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807750332662167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I like video games, creativity, music, webcomics, anime, buncha stuff. I'm usually pretty optimistic, but lately Ive gotten kinda depressed. I'm used to having friends to hang out with and talk to, often online, but they all kinda left me. Even my childhood best friend told me straight out she can't talk to me anymore cuz her boyfriend doesn't want it. It's complicated and I get it, I don't really mind all THAT much. But now I've got nothing. I sit on the bus for hours on end going to and from college, then doing chores for my family and helping watch my niece+nephew, or helping my little brother. I used to at least be able to ignore my problems by playing league of legends or other online games but Cox internet has been so bad these last weeks, I'm unable to do anything. I've got nothing to look forward to. I think I'll feel better if I can meet anyone new.

I rarely have people connect with me so on the rare occasion that I do, I treat them like a god. I will do ANYTHING for them. God it's crazy, recently this week I traveled 2 hours from my house to my high school best friend's house, just to meet her because I miss her so much and it's been a year since our last hang out. To think that I would do such a time-sucking, money-sucking thing for her (I even made the visit at night, which made my parents super mad because I did not tell them where I went), but I know she wouldn't do the same for me. I know I love her more than she loves me, yet I still let my emotions rule.

This online friend I had, I just met him about a couple months ago, and I literally can't stop thinking about him it's so disgusting. Mostly due to the fact that someone out there who I haven't even met in person, cares about me more than the people I'm near to everyday, will ever do. He, a stranger, gives a fuck about me. He likes me even. But I think he doesn't like me as much as I like him, because I think about him all the time. I would try to make a way to respond to his messages no matter how busy I am in school, I would sacrifice sleep and grades for him. See how crazy I am? But what's worrying me is that lately he hasn't shown much enthusiasm to talk to me, like he's slowly losing interest in me.

Before anyone asks, here is what my family life is like: Father is overseas most of the time, so we're not really close. Mother knows almost everything about me (mostly because I don't have anyone else to tell stuff to) but I've slowly realized as I get older that she has a controlling behavior. Wouldn't allow me to get a boyfriend, wouldn't allow me to go to a bar with my acquaintance, wouldn't allow me to go to far places, wouldn't allow me to go visit my friends' dorms, wouldn't allow me to do anything after school other than go to university and go straight home. I am still treated like a 10 year old ffs. Basically I've had 2 relationships in the past (high school) which I've kept secret from her, because she'll get mad at me if she knew that I've been flirting with guys in high school. I am grateful I got to experience some form of romance in hs no matter how shitty it is, because I don't want to spend my 20s figuring out stuff that 14 year olds have been doing. Another problem is my family is so conservative they treat virginity as this really sacred thing, bleughhfdh. I'm still virgin, but I've had some sexual experiences in the past (that I was reluctant to experience at first because of what has been drilled into my mind all these years about ""purity"" and shit) which, though they suck, I am so grateful for because at least I know what to do in the future.

This is getting too long, what I'm trying to say is that I give all my love to people I deem worthy but I think it's so unfair that they don't do the same to me.

My plan of action is to go into online dating and meet a bunch of guys.

lonely,ComplexMind96,2018/03/18,"Deleted all social media. Kind of feel more like an outcast. As the title suggests, I recently deleted all social media, including Snapchat, as a way to cleanse myself of all of the Facebook rants and fake instagram happiness. I also wanted to see how many of my “friends” would reach out before I reached out to them. After a few days of going about my business and getting no Snapchats, instagram messages, or even texts, I deleted everything. I grew tired of seeing the Snapchat stories I was never involved in.

I feel it’s the right choice, however, it’s brought to my attention how few friends I have. Before I deleted everything, I guess I felt more connected to people who I knew nothing about, and felt as if I was a part of their lives when I wasn’t. This isn’t all bad though as it’s made me appreciate the few close friends I have a lot more and has helped me to stay more grounded.

Unfortunately, I do still have a longing for companionship, and living at the age of 21 in 2018 with no social media definitely has made me feel disconnected from people the same age as me. That combined with growing up in a small town with few opportunities to meet new people has really made me feel like an outcast.

I just want to meet new people and form bonds and connections that I’ve never experienced before.

Anyways if you’ve read my story, thank you. I just needed to vent while at work.

lonely,Onedamnedday,2018/03/18,"How did this happen? There was a time when I had everything I ever wanted. Every day was a happy one, and if anyone asked I could honestly say “My life is great.” And then one by one, I started losing things. The possessions by which I identified myself, I lost. I downgraded and felt miserable. I had women fawning over me left and right, and I pushed them aside because I knew there were always more to be had. I had money. I had things to do, I chose to do new things whenever I could. I was interesting and felt like I was moving forward. 

One day, it just seemed to hit me that all that went away. No more things to point to and say “That’s mine” and have people be impressed. Instead I’m insulted for the things I own. Every woman I’ve ever cared for has a new significant other, and seems like they couldn’t be happier. I sit at home and play video games and study. I’ve probably never been smarter or more intelligent, but I am so, so, so alone. I feel like I was on the summit and slowly, imperceptibly, everything was taken from me. I went from a cool guy to a loser. I don’t know how it happened. Maybe I squandered opportunities. All I know now is that I am sad. I have loads of friends, but they all seem happier than me. I think I made a horrible miscalculation in treating women the way I did, and now I am paying a heavier price than I should. 

It just totally sucks. I was somebody great, and now I couldn’t be paid to want to be me.

lonely,Toasty_Toad,2018/03/18,"Its so quiet and i hate it New to Reddit as a whole, sorry of this isn't the right place for this.

I have been feeling really lonely recently as my relationship of the past 6 years came to an end.

 I've always been someone who considered having a few close friends to be better then a bunch of fake ones. But this got me into a pretty bad spiral of lonelyness after my S/O cheated on me with someone I considered to be my closest friend. 

Now while I still have a few close friends, they aren't exactly the type that have time to hang out and go do things with. They are hard working individuals and all around amazing people, but it leaves me with the desire to connect with people, to go on adventures, and just set around and bullshit. 

I don't have any friends of the opposite sex either as my ex had a very extreme jealousy problem, so I did what I thought was right and cut the ties with my friends that they got jealous of. So now in my mid 20s I'm left with a couple same sex friends and not even the faintest idea where to go from here. I'm not really that attractive, especially in photos, so online dating (tender, POF, ECT...) Has gotten me nowhere. On top of that I work a job that pretty much confines me to a small room, sometimes by myself, sometimes with another person. There is little to no social interaction with the outside world and the pay is shit. Without the financial help having a roommate provided, I've started to become very broke very quickly, which prompted me to find another job. 

The new job(if I get it) is much better pay but very long hours and while it will be nice to be able to socialize with new people and get out of the house, I'm afraid that this overwhelming feeling of lonelyness is here to stay,and that finding a new relationship might just be a waste of time. After what happened I have some major trust issues on top of being socially awkward with the opposite sex. 

I know I wasn't perfect in the relationship but I was always faithful and did everything I could to keep things together. 
I just feel lost, lonely,and helpless. 

I guess I'm not really asking for help, I just needed to vent, while i love the couple of friends I have left, they are not exactly the best listeners.

lonely,Peter2025,2018/03/18,"I don't know I'm currently in a closely tied group of friends in my school but they don't feel like friends. They are litteraly the worst friends. The reason I can't leave them is that I've stayed with them since last year of secondary school and they think I'm good with them. But the problem is that they never take anything seriosuly (including me (they joke around my asexuality)) I literally can't change anythign about my personality or looks or else, they'll make fun of me for about 2 weeks afterwards. If I left them, it would be awkward for the rest of secondary school since the school I'm in is as big as the primary school right next to it. Now let me explain the bullshit that these guys give me.

*Note: I won't disclose any information about them out of respect. These are random names, not their actual names*

Hugo: This guy seems to be the guy I should stay with if I ever leave the group. He actually knows when to stop joking around. 

Seb: This guy always tries to roast me and can't. But it still works because the rest are idiots and he just shoves the analogies down their throats.

Jacob: This guy... he's the pussy of the group but he's no particularly insecure about it but he tries to not be a pussy by talking shit. He's a child.

Jordan: 6'2'' racist cunt. He's takes advantage of his strenght and is a general idiot. This year, he stole 300$ and got caught. Had to report him since he's always punching me. When I said racist, I mean he calledd a black kid the n-word since he didn't know his name and also, there was one of my classmate's basketball coach in the same room as him and apparently, *he's never seen a tall black guy in his life* and just gave him a patronizing look until he left. He's not **openly** racist but it's definitely remarkable how much of an asshole he is.

Last but not least, Jimmy: The guy that we've built this group around. He's a big computer nerd that can't stop. He just can't stop. Never. He's alwasy joking around. He's always taking ~~jokes~~ roasts from last year and saying them again. He's always tackling and pushing around and he calls that ""joking aroung"". He's clingy and always has to proove that he's physically superior. He literally calls himself ""The brain"". He always holds grudges. He gave me scars because of his disgusting ass long nails. He doesn't know when to end it. He is just the most backwards human I've seen. *Ever*. Now, I have seen backwards people before, but not up close like that and I'm telling you. They are *NOT FUN*. 

If I break my friendship with these guys, it'll be awkward for the rest of the year, since we almost broke apart last year and he had to write a letter of apology ('cause he can't let go) Plus, everyone knows how close we are. So they'll be many questions. Literally won't be able to make friends with the other people because my personality is not compatible at all. These guys follow trends and listen to mumble rap. I *hate that shit*. They are just millenials in the wild. I feel like I'm the ony one in my school like me. No one else can comprehend me. The problem is that I won't meet new people. Since the school is tiny. I have explored every corner of it. I'm becoming claustrophobic. Also, you might be thinking: ""If they aren't compatible, how did you stay together for so long?"" I just realized how big of cunts they are. I can't escape them. I just can't

**tl;dr: My friends aren't compatible, I can't leave them because it would be awkward for many reasons. If I do, I have no one to turn to.**

Note: Sorry for the swearing. I just have to relieve this off of my chest. If you've made it here, thanks for understanding and thanks for offering up minutes of your life into this post.

Then, other times, I meet people who will NOT LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, and these people are usually psychotic. Every hour of every day, they're trying to get me to hang out, and it's just too much for me.

lonely,_Haise,2018/03/18,"How to stop feeling lonely? Just as the title says, how do you stop feeling lonely? I’ve been so, so lonely ever since my ex ghosted me (even though he resumed contact with me, a relationship is out of the question now). I’m a really affectionate person, most days I just cry and wish that I had someone to hug and cuddle me and tell me that everything is going to be ok. I’m tired of this, and I don’t know what to do.",3.2446969696969674,3.830423772727276,5.282272727272732,83.31424242424245,72.63636363636363,7.684848484848485,26.03030303030303,7.793537801064563,1.3666984848484849,324,10,69,4,6,113,59,88,0.188,0.669,0.14400000000000002,-0.652,0,6,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,1,0,0,10,6,0,0,4,1,8,3,0,2,1,19,15,10,1,1,2,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,4,6,0,2,4,0,0,1,1,3,0,0,2,3,9,3,9,12,1,7,0,3,0,2,9,1,0,2,5,49,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2580782727552162,0.15152139330068742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15518029300487451,0.21252303348192775,0.0,0.0,0.2111552350070796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2375925486259288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13352580765754735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291207395714058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20514667835477424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2631944361691783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505130792431196,0.0,0.0,0.2522451764794868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868393029550373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1943506054909128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19906985035036895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3928524633021618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20535405401173906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2308342574317003,0.0,0.0,0.2700370410988721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27017748172465605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,starryhyunwoo,2018/03/18,"alone in the world It’s hard for me to articulate my emotions, but I’ll try as best as I can. I like solitude, but for the past three years, I have felt more lonely than solitary. 

My severe depression, my upbringing, and my IQ are really what separate me from everyone else around me. I try to not let the past define me, but these three things are what have molded my personality, my opinions, and my likes and dislikes. I feel like there’s no one like me in the entire world, and not in a conceited way. I just feel like I’m on my own wavelength, begging to be loved or heard or appreciated. I have never been in love and I have never been understood. Yes, I know that no one is ever truly understood, but I am so far from being even SLIGHTLY “relatable.” Everyone just thinks I’m a loser. I have had a few meaningful friendships, but they always end up being “meaningful” because I am the more kind and understanding person in the friendship.

I’m 19 years old and I’m a girl, and apparently I have a lot of time left to live and learn, but I don’t see myself ever been fulfilled in any way, shape, or form. 

I pray to the god that I no longer believe in and I beg for him to give me a soulmate, if they even exist. Your soulmate is supposed to understand you and love you, right? 

This was all over the place, but if you read until the very end, thanks. Thank you for listening to a fraction of my daily thoughts ",3.8963732394366213,4.868951806338033,5.113492957746477,83.69312676056339,71.42957746478874,8.35605633802817,26.876056338028175,8.697196308434329,1.8011414084507047,1099,36,229,19,20,365,152,284,0.126,0.634,0.239,0.9922,1,3,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,5,2,2,9,15,0,0,16,1,23,3,0,0,5,48,46,27,0,2,16,0,4,5,0,0,0,2,0,3,8,12,0,0,13,1,0,0,8,3,0,4,10,7,41,12,31,32,8,33,1,3,1,3,17,18,0,7,18,169,49,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741767423603547,0.0,0.0,0.09433335960509144,0.0,0.0,0.07709584536153262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10092380414037312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06910962041876538,0.0,0.0,0.12772976015003454,0.1189753726939466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976458679716916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947065271346477,0.12752658256143673,0.20082527186783186,0.0,0.0,0.14976032647896567,0.2051002628120691,0.0,0.21666079207425407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464708875781965,0.1619838529389896,0.10885348388984896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10875533903065564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10155772310870992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11805795696451188,0.062305476226971086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12317740828145955,0.1159290439841042,0.0,0.2769355623313233,0.0,0.1001082515549672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09638356708751153,0.30696397814899823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1748766775368324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.118963296124376,0.0,0.15364560502054864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21644999053264216,0.0,0.1979815409004369,0.11844807004584927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340120573405132,0.0,0.07262806201202356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968178098088852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034163113802728,0.0,0.0,0.1280764248100963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20875269717030645,0.0,0.0,0.07531833994871874,0.07264325539779884,0.0,0.09000353408069076,0.06610726544698439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15394229071540694,0.0,0.0,0.23604543170881484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09354255712117356,0.0,0.17997649324500636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14601380356738428

lonely,heartlexxpt,2018/03/19,"After Break my worst fears are here. Hey everyone,

Im a 28 man, and all my life ive been a huge introvert, meeting new people has allways been the hardest part of my life, i just simply can't meet new people...
I just had a relationship for the past 3 years which i thought it was perfect ( give me a break on this one ), on the 2-4 months before everything ended and i we were feeling things going downhill i was allready scared to death to the point that i was not sure anymore if i was afraid of losing a loved one or simply becoming super lonely again ( we lived together ).

It is now the 4th week and im literally feeling like im going down into a major depression. At work everything is going wrong, i keep doing mistake after mistake, at home i can't seem to enjoy anything i used to do, everything seems boring without having her next to me to share and whatnot....We used to have pretty much the same tastes in everything.

And now i just can't seem to move on, it is feeling literally impossible, i don't know how to meet new people and i am too scared at the same time to meet new people...even ONLINE....

Ive added some girls that accepted me on facebook and then i simply dont even say hi, i just let it linger, i simply dont have the guts.

I am an IT Assistant that manages the informatics in other big companies, and at home i mostly just spend time taking care of my cat, my hamsters, my fish tank and thats it...even playing games which was my #1 hobby seems boring..

I just needed to throw this words somewhere out there...I really don't know to cope with how lonely i feel right now...",4.3538227513227525,4.839078447530866,5.650599647266315,82.03055555555558,70.08024691358024,8.393650793650794,27.156966490299826,8.418075326091056,1.7474040564373894,1243,38,253,18,21,418,171,324,0.13,0.769,0.101,-0.8857,0,4,0,0,0,0,51.0,2,0,0,4,15,24,0,4,16,0,31,5,1,4,3,52,53,14,1,4,10,0,4,1,0,0,2,1,2,2,15,14,1,1,12,2,1,5,9,14,0,2,10,6,35,10,33,42,9,43,0,4,0,1,17,17,0,8,20,166,50,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08992169189572342,0.0,0.0,0.07461485908892493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001394679314736,0.0771547064977763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924455632239497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0780951676046047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21253247538274989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08030797201938647,0.0,0.0,0.17966286807372825,0.0,0.0,0.08664043457164305,0.32595852987563184,0.0,0.0,0.10203056404390803,0.18338479237068347,0.0647756858906586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698029528455757,0.15459198523914622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18190166926678333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2938221028384962,0.0,0.0,0.08059293082219214,0.0,0.0,0.09966129053285996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927176777496094,0.12808782136789154,0.04429747946366784,0.0,0.08006453162007418,0.0,0.0,0.10143813446891073,0.0,0.0,0.0818345033267632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07237306833847944,0.0963693779605434,0.06665393196737432,0.06723171456418804,0.0,0.3502841185807749,0.0964300917430101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12288261167660725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09818832006735727,0.08655613719139821,0.18858045359904946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08571380654007367,0.0,0.0,0.09224543868802693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058086438202084874,0.0,0.0,0.09734718025190818,0.0,0.07743290362606672,0.0,0.07210555839661027,0.1815558332811657,0.0,0.0,0.33017544869647397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08545674732380479,0.0,0.06817362924757217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06023806745925006,0.0,0.0,0.07198298530231734,0.10574247701830126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15662200235095558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0727311498879821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740402044891425,0.0,0.06600987907852393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09913497208259194,0.0,0.0583894265013166

lonely,Says_Watt,2018/03/19,"I think some of us are meant to be alone. Specifically, me. It's not that I can't get someone to fall in love with me or stay with me but rather that I honestly just don't think anyone will ever be good enough for me.

You can say ""oh well that's narcissistic"", which is true, but when I say not good enough I mean someone that I won't want to forcibly remove from my life. When it comes to friends it doesn't matter, I'll be friends with anyone, but for relationships they are closer to you and more intimate with your everyday life. I honestly don't think there's anyone that I could stomach being in my life for a very long period of time. Definitely not forever.

I figure that I will still have kids at some point (probably by accident, lol), which I'm sure will be great. However, even that I don't think I could handle. Not that I would abandon them but sometimes it's better to be separated for some amount of time.

I don't know. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm okay with being alone forever. It's more difficult than being in a relationship, but other people are boring and they bring the worst out of me.

Anyone else feel this way?

edit:
another point about this is that I even have very close friends. one of which I honestly almost cry when i think about them because I'm so in love with them (like cry in a good way). However, even them I can't stomach for more than say a day or two of spending time together. People just piss me off and I like to be alone and quiet.

also, just a note. This is not me saying ""i don't need anyone"" because I just got dumped or something. I really am confident that I could find someone to love me and do anything for me and get married and have kids; I just don't want that. Also, I fucking love random sex... I'm not very safe about it though, which is something that needs to change, lol.",3.5253174603174595,4.5008063994709016,4.604391534391535,86.98690476190477,72.3068783068783,8.033862433862435,24.582010582010582,8.401726058763845,1.3079693121693117,1441,40,313,23,27,472,158,378,0.104,0.6729999999999999,0.223,0.9957,2,3,2,0,0,0,49.0,1,3,6,1,23,29,3,0,6,3,40,12,3,0,3,67,69,22,0,9,20,0,1,2,3,5,3,6,0,2,28,16,0,2,11,0,1,4,16,7,1,2,2,7,47,22,43,50,10,31,0,1,0,6,26,12,2,9,14,216,75,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07848728614391175,0.24353734663113044,0.0,0.12536257347123425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821893511548824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2740292165740784,0.08031063474782989,0.06450091471201022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09556070493917374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06932165739920121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08291674388052618,0.06751832279104839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877426396605625,0.0,0.1721957766635255,0.050549284374083424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06547729853303108,0.0,0.0,0.1619771269785325,0.0,0.15530980654574145,0.07090013509974817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03963180724527046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163884755721148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1816709835798028,0.07246200541963396,0.08190171324194749,0.0,0.0,0.19722688447805276,0.06268847529787591,0.08641536967789444,0.08634554868803497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043076167932501096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16608853268458165,0.07658603071106412,0.0,0.0,0.0693647509775569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2829677833091421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537992716128223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11623709111019614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05311301898925904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10867908351827588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14819082935462244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.084508014496987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05021289917510868,0.0,0.0,0.16830380027655922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3116587318659133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19923599413512086,0.1206831028147547,0.07752084950029832,0.0,0.0,0.08354375619997255,0.06259519716244162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07387319949407625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511170171687549,0.07700897060152931,0.0,0.13711383848086328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053215578857097386,0.0,0.07656688365182604,0.0,0.09428273635499043,0.0,0.0,0.19401769202638527,0.09246233246384253,0.12443043720077558,0.0,0.0,0.07047396518291411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05567963961424046,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,jProficiency,2018/03/19,"20 and alone I'm turning 21 in May, live at home and have no stable job to get me out. All my friends are still up at the college I dropped out of. Thought about deleting social media, but it's a bad idea because I still need it to communicate with so many people who I don't have numbers for, including my local Melee scene. 

I want to look for a girl, because the happiest time of my life was coming home, waiting for a phone call from my long distance gf. Virgin, btw.

Being 20 I can't go to bars, so that's out. Tinder just sucks, but I'm deep into it now. 

Idk if this is the place to ask, but anyone who's interested in scooping me up, I live in Rockland, NY and can drive for about 15 miles. 

I promise I'm more interesting than I sell myself. I'm a jazz trumpet player, I have an interest in drug culture, martial arts, and the Joe Rogan Experience. Would kill to do stand up for life. I also cuddle like a bear on ecstacy.",2.9304270986745213,3.825541865979382,4.6555228276877765,86.36587628865982,73.63917525773195,7.192341678939616,26.743740795287188,7.447530270364453,1.2817596465390275,718,25,156,8,14,244,127,194,0.093,0.741,0.166,0.9463,1,1,1,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,0,9,9,2,0,10,0,13,6,0,0,1,23,28,11,1,4,5,0,0,1,2,2,3,0,2,1,7,10,1,1,2,3,1,3,3,3,0,0,2,1,17,6,32,23,2,28,0,0,1,2,10,18,1,2,6,97,24,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17598949255084345,0.0,0.135887755996744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188144572553522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15885552801200367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14187901898386773,0.20716756837527675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17351088498482575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14637404320428474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1970573047940655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16621778196033626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312824692134312,0.0,0.08877801178268586,0.0,0.09657143698613807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3408942364786112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19182294048960308,0.0,0.0,0.1686228472224598,0.0,0.1879951687947256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24004397674535036,0.08301603553481808,0.0,0.300091115003603,0.15037694416469544,0.14269293783284126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17227575140120274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259961170004061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11780355471459705,0.0,0.17753388386054622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17321560218972448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2714022420903707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349002728396924,0.09908375528330947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848279656740425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10022527876407633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12070877411626665,0.0,0.0,0.0

Hi, dear people. I'm a graphic design student from Oslo, Norway with a background in social anthropology. I'm working on a final thesis / project right now, and my very loose subject covers globalization, urban loneliness and graphic design for a social change.

Please be kind and help me do the good work, by answering this one question and sharing your reflections :)

lonely,DelToroGrande,2018/03/19,"So damn lonely So lately nothing has gone my way. I lost my girlfriend of 5 years when she phoned me and told me she didn't love me anymore, then I lost my job on my teacher training course all in the same week. My closest school friend invited me to stay with him in his houseshare halfway up the country and that's great because it's given me an opportunity to just run away from it. The 2 problems I have are that I have no idea where to start with finding someone new and my best mate has near 0 time between his girlfriend and his Uni work, which I totally understand, I'm just so goddamn alone in a place I have no clue about.

lonely,mab604,2018/03/20,"College senior with no social life So I’m a senior in college right now, and feel as if I have nothing to work towards or look forward too. I wake up late , sleep late, and work part time at a mall which doesn’t help my weird sleeping schedule. I feel as if I have no social life and on my birthday last month I only had one person to celebrate with. I’ve worked hard at work and college the past few years, and thought I would have so much going for me. Barely any friends, a not so great job, and I commute at school so no typical college experience. How can I get motivated? What’s the reason I’m so behind in my social skills and I can’t make friends? What do I work for everyday? Sorry for the long post by the way!

lonely,dathgr,2018/03/20,"I'm pulling out my own hair I don't usually want to call attention to myself like this. Actually, for most of my life I've tried not to be noticed. But this is a massive problem I have. I don't know why the fuck I do it, it's just an impulse, a mindless habit, sometimes when I'm angry at myself or others, avoiding homework. 

Point is, I feel very lonely, so much so that I no longer feel a connection with old friends. I have a best friend who I no longer feel like I have fulfilling conversations with anymore. He'll just drone on about The Melvins and The Who and all of these rock bands I couldn't give a shit about, but I don't want to hurt his feelings, so I stay quiet. I value his voice over my own. I value everyone's voice over my own. I give and I give and I give and then I have nothing left. And I let this happen every single day. 

I'm going to a therapist for this, and I'm really trying to be honest and speak and be heard, but I fucking hate that I do this to myself",1.8594705882352933,3.1674938714285763,3.6685994397759134,90.76247899159668,76.95238095238095,6.655462184873952,23.305322128851554,7.285733465282438,0.7307927170868349,763,23,174,9,17,257,111,210,0.116,0.748,0.136,0.7969,0,3,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,8,14,4,1,10,0,16,5,2,0,1,32,38,18,0,4,7,0,5,2,2,1,1,5,1,0,13,12,0,1,6,2,0,2,7,8,0,0,1,10,30,6,20,31,8,15,0,2,0,2,16,7,3,2,7,120,43,1,0.0,0.0,0.13159068014486786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373144080472446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14151302644643085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13769329881670708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696480255294108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361394722383875,0.12885155853883934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727296605344799,0.0963343284656771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083640604378338,0.2493267341738853,0.0,0.51742799606187,0.07663634319687787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924426747908952,0.0,0.0,0.13313294876961246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14435591015230234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07410808056677293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14651105889432434,0.1378896278764646,0.09524603318702106,0.1317583250004603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09912765395510732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1293888024368958,0.15352357332354835,0.14149866219717214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12747347835441047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12902983808095114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08638608669627174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1384179397414713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13336658380046446,0.0,0.0,0.1437283702909671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15656711790702627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1831037715113788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14851431007694496,0.11126244078938634,0.15907185602859014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12167794412317492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,yurixtaka,2018/03/20,"Feel like I'm losing hope. I have been fighting a war inside me with all the emotions that I have built up. I was dating this girl for almost 4 years and about a month ago I proposed to her and she accepted it, we have never been the perfect couple and what i mean by that we argued a lot, but regardless of that I was still happy having her with me, and she claimed to feel the same way. I honestly thought she was the one, I lost a lot of friends since when I started working I barely had free time and I would have to choose who to spend time with her or my friends and of course I choose her, eventually we moved in together but by that time friends werent interested in hanging out with me which I dont blame them for it, but I never been good at socializing I was usually just that guy being silent through out all our plans. Anywho recently she left me without saying a word after a small argument. I'm assuming she got tired of the arguments, now I'm alone and I'm having mixed emotions. I feel like I lost everything that I cared about and just cant build the motivation to do anything anymore, but I also feel angry I feel like I was betrayed but if she doesnt want to be in the relationship I cant force her, I just would have appreciated to have ended it properly instead of leaving without saying anything, but I also want her to be happy, but the thought of her maybe with someone else. Makes me feel hurt and more angry. I feel like I'm losing hope in myself, I feel like all these emotions are just going to cause me to explode. I want to go get her back, but i dont want to force it, I cant sleep properly anymore and I stopped eating. I have been told that I'll get over it  and so on, but I've never been one to let go so easily. At this point i have no one, the friends I have left dont have the same days off as me so it's difficult to make plans with them. Now I mostly sit at home heart broken feeling lost and like I dont belong in this world. I don't like having those kind of thoughts.",4.286498359460445,4.349091135071095,5.336208530805688,85.71337586584033,70.11374407582936,8.38804228946409,28.079110462996717,8.139509932561175,1.5882395916879333,1577,50,349,20,26,522,183,422,0.172,0.6579999999999999,0.17,0.7151,1,1,0,0,2,0,30.0,4,0,2,10,17,33,3,0,16,0,41,4,2,4,7,85,79,30,1,10,17,0,9,7,4,2,1,2,1,2,21,23,1,1,18,0,2,5,15,10,0,3,19,11,65,24,52,54,9,48,0,6,0,0,34,19,0,9,29,249,86,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062082155845788425,0.0,0.07013033587485464,0.0725355521742121,0.0,0.11201456714344266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13891259420027535,0.0,0.0,0.11526633255466473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053852899087000417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07140575727065011,0.07194564728986452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749283730641714,0.0,0.04516703870851063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3283238658527514,0.0,0.0,0.07166369791037118,0.05850558942603715,0.2363411933468149,0.062030576232444415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06294330104359032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31870802024010625,0.2501665165121716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2164367032864564,0.0,0.07318121113083426,0.0,0.1194081942822174,0.05874237018309709,0.056013706730304515,0.0,0.0,0.06934605632440133,0.0,0.14910796986098895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08299228545871347,0.0,0.0,0.07025121590380994,0.13912190821491793,0.0,0.0,0.07497434353032767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07293109110444408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741573756176448,0.15218733266890008,0.0716159408975485,0.0,0.2395103095467292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1567033950634876,0.22935573476116886,0.11908318410666074,0.0,0.0,0.09349834582423244,0.0,0.0703599720629198,0.07628908149292424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055901587599076985,0.07443654590868852,0.0,0.0,0.16204685261470814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14237339742698712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06620608984464868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915150774264266,0.0751918089049963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113899211855126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05793400608328955,0.0,0.07008597809612176,0.07139226989014982,0.05934076661128314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04957141614309147,0.0,0.05593036040392253,0.058552729849475287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16680085220517438,0.12251461374422118,0.08049538895039382,0.0,0.0669218253974965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0771340978774667,0.0,0.16523477240816148,0.05559084013903251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350232515439362,0.0,0.05098660485768917,0.0,0.0,0.09950227659490664,0.0,0.0,0.045100500992408185
lonely,IssaUser,2018/03/20,What would you do? Just like everyone else here I’m a loner. Always have been as a child. You know...all the typical social problems. Well right now I do have one friend sort of. This guy asked for my number about 4 months ago in one of my college classes. We’ve been texting a lot and I’m pretty sure we’re friends but he’s so rude. He also makes me feel bad about myself and talks to me condescendingly (At least in my opinion) over text. I’ve tried cutting him off before but then I realize that I don’t have anyone else to talk to and he’s the only person who makes an effort to talk to me lol. Fail. Should I keep talking to him because I’m terribly lonely (literally nobody else to talk to) or...what would you really do? ,0.2295782502614152,2.5549390264900684,2.357155803415825,92.3180899268038,89.19867549668871,5.033252004182644,17.881143255489718,6.5966054737557815,-0.0027562913907281947,567,15,122,7,19,190,100,151,0.17800000000000002,0.722,0.1,-0.9553,0,2,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,3,0,2,8,12,2,0,6,1,12,0,0,2,1,19,20,9,0,4,3,0,1,1,2,3,0,0,0,3,4,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,7,1,2,2,1,16,5,19,15,2,10,0,2,0,0,21,6,0,3,5,73,20,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12631564010622945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11395538345263535,0.11856952688010408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963772627590403,0.1460057643139159,0.0,0.0,0.1332161420681087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11897965268171608,0.08686529378599933,0.0,0.12125507304722065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3571157063149961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13616268792533487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07205113402672816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22018678592622887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14109515647649062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12665853008223366,0.0,0.0,0.07831302594541335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06961719319520203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12114647454966933,0.0,0.0,0.19023668300112231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11374032883252225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19312029986802814,0.10837594510081752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244235217203681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449714205926244,0.0,0.13635108317589534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128769490490728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216922830975674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14525849089731205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13430242443375084,0.0,0.0,0.5726713895593175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967466050895323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12812257284570538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20245259831719206,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Vabracoral,2018/03/20,"Have a friend who feels he is always going to be lonely. Please help Recently, I’ve had a situation in my friend group. Majority of my friends believe something is going on with a friend in the group, and we can’t tell if he’s displaying signs of depression. Now for context, he is a very chill person, however he is quite sheltered and sometimes does not catch certain social norms. He also has a very horrible habit of over analyzing and speculating over many things. We’ve been concerned as he seems to be acting differently recently and we aren’t able to pinpoint specifically why. However, it could possibly be due to his recent relationship troubles. Ever since he started thinking of getting a relationship, it’s basically set in his mind that he must be in a relationship. Due to how some of his relationships, he stated many times that he will be lonely forever and will never find love. He constantly provides the aura that he is alone and that he doesn’t belong. For example, in group chats, he would bring up out of nowhere, jokes about suicide and being alone and to clarify, these weren’t just jokes. They basically seemed like actual warnings to us. Even if it was unintentional. We don’t know what we should do at this point, but as every single day passes, it seems the gap between us only grows. So my question for those who read this is “What action should we take next to help our friend?”",6.953997148288972,7.573020129277568,7.2867846958174916,72.09694510456275,64.43726235741445,10.529372623574146,33.167538022813694,10.411451182825502,3.4819051330798483,1126,44,199,26,16,367,157,263,0.078,0.8340000000000001,0.08800000000000001,0.7627,5,6,1,0,0,1,28.0,8,0,1,1,8,14,0,0,10,0,30,1,0,1,4,40,43,16,1,7,5,0,1,1,5,6,0,0,0,1,17,15,0,0,8,4,0,8,7,4,0,0,4,1,15,10,33,26,3,35,0,3,0,1,48,12,0,7,14,127,32,1,0.09777831310841968,0.0,0.09541752890258258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20253768796796165,0.0,0.07819328166647169,0.0813593893635558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101626755674179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.105663620088086,0.0,0.07806802672332287,0.0,0.0,0.06305892295691026,0.0,0.08421631780431615,0.0,0.0,0.10215752614520318,0.0,0.0,0.08556646071760242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06458165363887758,0.08844608212063572,0.08238244593790807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04943965301720343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08936760677759742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3777164107898615,0.0,0.051085132948101915,0.0,0.11113933728324946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13107748439638295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05373640376058773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0477695448114059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08824874510057006,0.0,0.0,0.1982637251576967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872822277567136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07541266291101234,0.0,0.1039883452615814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07436481317848892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08537625152092017,0.0,0.1073312255166942,0.09243211063127156,0.11023035656823407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10953408829962463,0.1039992717612652,0.0978047733085869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28963286439293395,0.4199092630650995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26704111187187024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088323101649254,0.10990692068458786,0.0,0.09967267670071152,0.0,0.07527452244703005,0.09670525184921938,0.0,0.06920799328035511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10695360447821196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07351712279632315,0.0,0.08546255541036324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0649595664964924,0.0626523949246344,0.0,0.0,0.0570153206858844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2352305430865489,0.0,0.0,0.1613546969755852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0882297191366305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06945890823536673,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,DesertArtist,2018/03/20,23 year old [m] full time artist can’t find someone down for just me. I’m always getting cheated on or my girl always has someone else they are close too and it always leads to more. I’m clingy and I only want one girl to be my ride or die. I’m a tattooist in a shop and I spend all of my time hustling and painting. I focus on realism and neotraditional. I wear my heart in my sleeve and want nothing but someone to just talk to. I have a girlfriend now but she only wants me on her time and tells me she wants and needs space from me and time with other people but she has been the girl I feel closest and most connected too. I feel like I’m on the back burner. I feel like I should stay single for a while but work has taken away all my free time for friends so without a girlfriend I’m alone with no one. What should I do? Anyone down to talk about art and music? ,0.9194834834834856,2.8057270054054047,2.3869819819819824,96.25494744744749,81.64864864864866,4.75975975975976,19.466966966966968,5.46131890053228,-0.4083393393393391,676,17,156,3,18,219,101,185,0.041,0.85,0.11,0.9094,0,1,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,2,8,5,1,0,7,0,11,2,2,1,2,38,26,19,1,7,9,0,3,2,3,2,0,0,0,3,3,14,0,0,4,3,3,2,3,1,0,2,2,3,25,5,23,21,6,26,0,0,0,0,14,13,0,3,12,103,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14154884864078907,0.0,0.0,0.3411610354419773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09556280538462608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12840591505693855,0.10509075388887132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1418418286345033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11417020445941392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2073132965621368,0.19527407633557164,0.0,0.0,0.1249138564981813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10559086280967836,0.0,0.07140440699223646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16195454643447324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13354006626596202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10133903471234347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13113850112648415,0.0,0.14341212007885898,0.0,0.1852221876380986,0.2078873080938413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0947497336002944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3474000103197041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14567198006568025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21970025449300196,0.11945555853437148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3984667287822957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3224459053351397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13174495280518916,0.0,0.09949734988402822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08801096561952915
lonely,Fidgetspinerfordiner,2018/03/21,"I feel like i've had the past three years taken from me Im a High School senior. About two years ago i was diagnosed with an eating disorder. Needless to say that was not an easy fight. I missed a lot of school and didn't really get to expand my social life very much. About 6 months ago is when i was mostly free of my ED, and about that time is when i started going out with a girl. I lost my virginity to her and was just generaly an amazing relationship... for about 2 months. She left me because ""she couldn't deal with my depression"". So that made my self esteem plummet.

My friends are never actually there for me. I haven't hung out with anyone since I left treatment. They actually mock me occasionally about being (Romantically) alone. Them talking about how much they want to cuddle/fuck their boyfriend/girlfriend doesn't help.

On top of all this my school refuses to show any mercy towards me despite missing months of class. So my entire day consists of making up credits. They also like to make slick remarks about how ""if you did your work in the first place none of this would have happened"" Yeah cuz nothing puts me in a productive mood like suicidal thoughts and a body thats eating itself from the inside. I guess if i just had someone would take me seriously i would be in a better state.

lonely,Aberrant262,2018/03/21,"My Own Loneliness This comes from a strange place. It feels as though I'm having some sort of acid trip, even though I haven't taken a thing. It's raining here, it has been for days really. Hollywood loves to use rain for dramatic effect; here it just makes things more real. The sunny days are the truly surreal things. Every one exactly the same as the next. I could say things about rejection and disillusionment, but they're just a facet. The whole, the hole is the alienation. The sense of being in a plastic bubble, hoping the light refraction doesn't obscure the parade of masks I go through trying to convince people that I fit, that I really exist. Nothing reaches me just as I reach nothing. My friends, I'm someone different to each and every one. Just adapt to the situation. See what they want to see. I don't know if it's an absence, or something that was just never there. But my existence has no substance.

This is my little piece of loneliness. Just wanted to share, for a moment. Gibberish, probably. So be it.

lonely,lolwheretfami,2018/03/21,"I've ruined my life This is it. I don't know what to do anymore. I have nobody and I doubt there will ever be someone relevant to me in the rest of this whole shitty fucking life.

I destroyed myself as a person. I always thought I was doing the right thing but I've been wrong my entire fucking life. I come from a pretty poor family, I've been working my ass off for nearly ten years and I managed to get to a point where I'm not lacking anything financially. This has always been my objective, but now that I got it I'm realizing that having all these nice things I can buy isn't worth shit. It's not like I can love or even talk to my fucking furniture. I could drink myself happy but even that I can't do with these 70 wasted hours of work a week...

I've always been shit at talking to people, but this is something you fix when you're young or a teen, instead of working like a fucking idiot. At least I learned to do some small talk without sweating bullets when someone comes to talk with me, but it's some really soulless, boring, smalltalk. I'm 22 and I can't even start or maintain a fucking conversation. I can't talk about myself or my feelings. I can't flirt. I can't even talk with my family as they are either dead or they don't give a shit about me, as I've been too much of a shitbag to have kept my relationship with them.

Sure, I have ""friends"" that I see one or two times a month to get absolutely shitfaced with, but they don't even talk to me outside of rare random sightings while walking in the street. I don't want to live without anyone for the rest of my life.",3.556276679841897,4.373579660606064,4.6662582345191055,87.16286561264822,72.0909090909091,7.072463768115942,26.772068511198945,7.079830092131019,1.1445625823451908,1248,41,266,11,23,410,161,330,0.158,0.759,0.08199999999999999,-0.9734,0,0,2,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,4,3,15,22,10,1,14,0,33,16,5,0,3,43,55,21,1,3,17,0,1,2,1,1,4,0,0,1,17,10,1,1,5,1,3,3,14,14,0,3,9,3,42,8,39,43,10,26,0,1,2,7,18,11,9,10,14,189,59,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21421961917586935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510731020843038,0.06000517541621185,0.0,0.07062000085589433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14784733005978742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06851781576904285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406789620004734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2834062824318051,0.07762630380953235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16180108131375606,0.0,0.04339160574819719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06630192803300887,0.396681729833013,0.08967158194686142,0.0823233951312673,0.0,0.0,0.06863561856381516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09135369128023467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451236506361283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047162726758903484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2424600720306868,0.08385161014403136,0.0,0.07577789947707163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.077453107404387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06849823494159409,0.0,0.06308529949744783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058151755881722236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0594946366679151,0.0749320114557762,0.0,0.0,0.08112471383224025,0.0,0.0,0.08730664426152801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497650690003053,0.0,0.0,0.09213524003999707,0.0,0.07328716809382642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06838496264429496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26426945971196875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14542477047721944,0.06606604621130299,0.0,0.0,0.06074164715517085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808814174929509,0.0,0.0,0.4828346436537269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11402587708327072,0.0,0.0,0.06812903683971458,0.0500405275083152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08383064663760949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050617034090825866,0.0,0.06883714490726486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09581150989027623,0.0,0.1654488683428234,0.0,0.18742718704864908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09382731400696094,0.0,0.05526327329230595

lonely,Souldex,2018/03/21,"Feeling lost and lonely I am feeling much loneliness since i never had any friend or social interactions. I tried it many times but it always felt like i was conversing with myself. The only friend i had was my dog and he too passed away last year due to cancer.

I always try to contact my college mates, but i have never heard back from them. And also whenever i try to make plans for a meetup, they always ditch at the last moment making me look like an idiot at the venue.

I tried meeting some new people, and that just led to me being used either by giving them money or helping them in getting their final projects done since i thought of them as my friends and help them and then suddenly no contact with me whatsoever. I have come to a situation where most of the time, i am talking to myself imagining different things.

Now it is getting harder and harder for me to pass even a single day. This has made me even forget how to smile. I just feel sad and lonely.",6.17031100478469,6.160385131578948,6.548468899521534,78.8779186602871,66.10526315789474,8.803827751196172,28.85167464114833,8.296473431620573,1.9530526315789483,765,22,144,9,11,248,120,190,0.158,0.721,0.121,-0.8319,1,4,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,7,2,10,10,1,0,8,0,12,1,0,6,2,35,28,16,0,0,7,0,4,2,4,0,1,1,0,0,6,11,0,0,6,0,1,4,3,5,0,0,10,6,30,5,21,17,5,25,0,4,1,0,23,5,0,4,18,108,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10479557561877427,0.3271164935900765,0.0,0.0,0.08911418933380934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1231198417346658,0.10076449344905307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11288251837500285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08451232622972142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13691274401093467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13410317188303889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1731062163720509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19877885104361376,0.0,0.12582247366918195,0.14355193520943438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3037320433094469,0.0,0.13692981797829987,0.12570902917002275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1756716195461819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21363616256288184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12804263585997158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11004367867613384,0.0,0.14304964588510152,0.0,0.0,0.1239966891337604,0.1749453346993047,0.132857713344523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09633217558725594,0.0,0.20213791390450875,0.1265627931487492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09966461615031492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09084918089713524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2168013561173792,0.14729857568526922,0.0,0.13358251892878226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053279381648803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08705959153860306,0.0,0.0,0.10403403632409683,0.1528252356986892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3558802002095428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11317965636809688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08438782709649023
lonely,crossroads_xx,2018/03/21,"I'm so fucking tired... I feel like I'm going insane. When I was mentally unstable two years ago, cutting, depressed, and having panic attacks everyday, people called me weak. Pathetic. Said I was toxic and manipulating people into caring about me. That I was using my instability as an excuse to gain attention. 

Now, my mom threatens to kill herself everyday, my best friend says she's mentally unstable and doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and tons of my classmates pretend to have mental disorders because they think it's ""cool."" 

When did drowning in your mind and feeling like you were suffocating every second of the day become fucking ""cool."" 

I hate the world for looking down at my pain and glamorizing the pain of others. 

I know for a fact that no one in this world loves me and I'm tired of caring about people who won't ever care as much. I'm tired of trying to live every day like nothing is wrong and then having a massive breakdown after being triggered by something miniscule. I'm tired of people saying that I can  tolerate more pain since I've been through more. Just because I can tolerate it doesn't mean I don't get hurt. 

I'm tired of people. Everyone ends up disappointing or hurting me one way or another. I'm always the ""second choice"" or ""backup"" friend...  I'm so done with putting up with everyone's bullshit. 

I want to die. I've always wanted to die. But I'm tired of even trying to die. 

Everything is too much.

lonely,guestaccount1200,2018/03/21,"Really glad I found this sub A few months ago I lost everyone in my life. My girlfriend died. My best friend decided they didn’t want me in their life. My ex who was a bit of support now feels the same way.

I’m carrying all of this sadness alone while I just fade into nothingness. 

I don’t know what to do when people let you know they don’t care about you... get mad? I don’t think it accomplishes anything?

But it makes me happy to read your guy’s posts. I know that I’m not the only one who is feeling this way or going through something like this. When I want to message someone who doesn’t care about me, I’ll just message you guys instead. I’ll work on having something to offer others and one day I’ll have people that care about me in my life again. 

Much love.

lonely,carlycanaries,2018/03/21,"New in town. I just moved cross country with my boyfriend in February, and neither of us have friends or really anyone outside of family around here. He recently got a job, so he is out for long hours, and I am left alone. I have been applying to jobs nonstop, but in between that I sleep and just lay in bed. I don’t talk to anyone from where I moved from and I don’t have a car here. I hardly eat or shower and I almost never go outside. I hardly even leave my bedroom. It has become my safe place and a prison at the same time. When I do go out, its anxiety provoking to talk to people. There are no good days any more, just days, and they all seem to blend into each other. I’m a recovering alcoholic and there is alcohol in the house. Not sure how long I’m going to remain sober, but I don’t mean to make it seem like I’m guilting people into talking to me for that reason. I really just want someone to talk to and start new with. I’m new to reddit and am hoping someone would actually talk to me for me, not just for the photos I post. If anyone is feeling or going through similar issues, I wish you all the best, because this is brutal.

Yes I’ve tried to fit in to be social. No one likes me. No chance for a relationship. I’m a loser and I hate myself. Women love a man with confidence.

lonely,mohannad559,2018/03/22,"Depression You know that feeling when your happy because your depression disappeared and your finally a normal person then boom your depression comes back 
When people start ignoring your text again, hating you again, pushing you again, talk to you when only needing someone to help them, using you 

thats my life now 
being that calm student that doesn’t talk and everyone laughs at cause he is not like them cause he have other interests and does not like football 
When you try to talk to anyone but they just ignore you  and talk to others and don’t give a fuck about you 
Getting to the point that your that you cant cry anymore because of how much you cried,being good and nice to other then get ignored, when you see everyone hating you even your family 
When you have no one to talk with 
There too busy to talk to you 
When music  is the inly thing that is left for you 
When you do self harm
When you get emotional at anything and cry
 
When you start not knowing what your doing cause you don’t know how to thunk right anymore, no you just start acting very weird
You just want to die 
When you do self harm

Sometimes i imagine my self dying and everyone being happy about it  
I’ll probably go to hell and burn forever in there if its even real or maybe i will see and feel  nothing
When you pray and you get no response
When 
When you want to commit suicide  but  your a pussy and too afraid so you cant throw yourself 
Acting like everything is okay  when its not 
Trying to tell people that your hurt, but no answer 
When every night you imagine ways you die while listening to that deep emotional music 
When all you care about is just drinking so you can forget everything
When you get called as an idiot because you asked a question 



Isn’t there a way that i can kill myself in it  peacefully while i’m sleeping

Or do i have to throw my self from a cliff/building

And no thank you i dont want a dam doc cause he’s not gonna help in anyway ",8.193232584916522,6.415046152849745,7.569188255613128,78.99013241220497,62.86010362694301,10.546689694876225,32.84340817501439,8.998388855275968,2.540666551525618,1549,44,307,19,18,484,177,386,0.22,0.654,0.125,-0.9945,0,0,1,0,0,4,9.0,0,43,3,0,43,30,6,1,10,1,24,4,1,7,2,58,56,46,5,6,15,0,2,3,0,2,1,2,0,5,19,15,1,3,9,1,0,8,17,17,0,1,0,6,55,13,31,52,2,52,2,4,2,1,68,10,2,4,35,214,74,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14732063493265735,0.05193443735862635,0.0,0.06112156135328435,0.0,0.06943660442668292,0.0,0.0,0.05711248380418987,0.0,0.1358310850934778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584253966600793,0.0,0.07572777370922168,0.3052013678213448,0.0,0.06398088038549159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16317403830796165,0.0,0.0,0.191917480100758,0.0,0.2312555246071729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06499809043428686,0.0,0.08704912729373694,0.07276070536897845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16709756647116972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09811517569878928,0.0,0.06257944557204698,0.21291732110763675,0.13350621126735454,0.0,0.07001936136142836,0.0,0.07511080885903433,0.0,0.0,0.08136405289283953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06866555195090113,0.19402672865989112,0.07125084091395119,0.042211893742949314,0.062297902667819524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15813311183124454,0.0,0.14666132679925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09956922505902206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795123577968941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08217369790707227,0.0,0.12245792108094693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08069943048204002,0.0,0.05246225569504665,0.10886026490813164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0746186896719321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054600282596877714,0.055073579402248884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06970155990247437,0.0727732119920831,0.07126835848577147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050330304047698636,0.05648908242280407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298513285803278,0.06485360351191445,0.0,0.0,0.07021338308793076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800804425175082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320440646052768,0.0,0.0,0.08454060918528633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06342999273245405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11837427468839982,0.0,0.3099378892520205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07432811151817442,0.0,0.06293251857323344,0.0,0.07345935139132133,0.0,0.15771555940095044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812442164587237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3581940397851701,0.0649191617687806,0.06838195415972702,0.0,0.0,0.049344658436275585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008549811297164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06414929574925039,0.0,0.06128421754306905,0.13142702282106272,0.11791123638386262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Oats_in-boats,2018/03/22,"Lonelyness  Hello everyone, 21 m here. 
 Long story short - the girl I had been dating and talking to all day every day for the last four months dumped me without warning this morning and I feel super lonely and useless. 
I'd be happy to talk to anyone - I'm a university student and part time theatrical actor.

lonely,Garbageaccount1338,2018/03/22,"Growing up as a shy introverted guy I have been lurking around for some time and would like to share my story and hopefully receive some useful comments or questions. English is not my first language ;)

So, first of all, in my childhood I was extremely shy and introverted. I did have some friends but at some point someone decided that I was ""boring"" and, behind my back, told classmates that I had done all kinds of things. That resulted in me being looked at in a different way. I was suddenly ""excluded"" and I felt that there was something very wrong with me. I thought about suicide several times, just to get away from all the mental pain. I never talked to anyone about this and tried to hide it as well as I could. To this day I am not sure whether or not my parents could sense anything or to which degree. My teachers must have been able to see what was going on, to some degree, but never did anything to help me and I was to shy and afraid to ask for help.

This feeling of being ""different"" and inadequate has haunted me ever since. My self-esteem has for a long time been completely broken and I have had no confidence. So, at the age of 26 I have never had any relationship with a woman, never had sex and I am often lonely as I do not have many friends either.

I have tried kissing one girl, multiple times. Someone that I met online but at the end I fell in love with her while she saw me as a friend. So i decided to cut her off, to avoid pain.

Mu current situation is that I am trying dating apps (Tinder etc) to improve my skills with women, understand myself better and what I want/need in this life.

I do not feel that I am ugly. I am well-educated with a nice job, I have interesting hobbies and I work out regularly. In my mind this should be ""enough"" to attract at least some women. But somehow I barely receive any attention from women, in the real world, or using dating apps.

It feels like running into a wall again and again. Constantly trying to improve myself while having the exact same results. At this point I am not sure what to do, except hoping to win ""the lottery"" and find a woman by complete chance.",5.170314280626781,5.868943016826925,5.934754273504275,79.95561609686612,68.35096153846155,8.47065527065527,29.590099715099715,8.515128840125781,2.16515698005698,1669,59,317,24,27,547,209,416,0.13,0.695,0.17600000000000002,0.9678,5,3,1,0,0,1,56.0,0,0,0,6,15,27,1,2,14,0,46,6,0,4,12,86,65,34,1,7,18,1,4,2,3,3,3,0,0,7,20,23,0,1,11,0,0,6,11,8,1,3,21,7,48,19,62,36,14,57,0,1,3,3,27,24,0,15,28,256,68,2,0.0914070308620524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12431983093368824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06391392129807451,0.0,0.15044039603137715,0.08137163688314751,0.08545323481386277,0.0,0.08587991443035559,0.07028636451362713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084209068391253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916770655346472,0.09877852741924807,0.0,0.14596215257110684,0.0,0.0,0.058949972991032724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19100178451210004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09354112841514453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08095949829962569,0.09444789752003988,0.10194300176857833,0.0,0.08268289256600404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13865442383348506,0.06530120111183857,0.08776508416419257,0.0,0.08354437022992774,0.1555015475119168,0.0,0.0,0.21186253589723364,0.0,0.04775640093935213,0.0,0.05194872211475721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09050733154635213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12253641201863455,0.0,0.0,0.1815756127971485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09070737379434564,0.0,0.0,0.09518635654994644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06456348912492313,0.08931371626345591,0.0,0.0,0.08089234590140196,0.07675888447513339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249841412175674,0.0,0.0,0.09267238239332293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09211678794584577,0.0,0.09229504395524574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2819949490620894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061939769744679025,0.0,0.1945270510241662,0.0,0.1014966904795156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17281837905607605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023967940472519,0.0,0.0,0.1040412126668042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09813694301949484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728395690888751,0.0,0.0953574683218101,0.10326392689720076,0.0,0.07561284050328346,0.10274533249340936,0.0,0.0,0.1548977612447804,0.07036959810108896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999844558016396,0.0,0.17230008965941687,0.0,0.0,0.07346950897012748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060726769676896025,0.0,0.0,0.07256697224004266,0.21320069908613215,0.0,0.0,0.08734333515094225,0.0,0.2482374953609772,0.0,0.0,0.09515794276947903,0.0,0.15789265267407296,0.0,0.07542037337988396,0.05391423507694551,0.07255464645122503,0.0,0.0,0.16437179657616455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654540712005746,0.0,0.0,0.0649329321285654,0.09993923893155428,0.0,0.0
lonely,distressedconnection,2018/03/22,"Alone at college I've never written anything on here before but I often come here to read other people's stories so I don't feel alone. 
Pretty much every day and night I spend alone in my dorm room and I kind of confided in the internet to help me deal with my loneliness/depression. I’m actually a somewhat outgoing person yet I feel like I have no friends at college. I have friends at home so it’s not like I’m not able to make friends… I just haven’t been able to connect with too many people here at school. I’m already a sophomore so I feel like I should have a strong group of friends already and I keep stressing that I won’t make friends because everyone already has their group of friends by now.
My parents constantly ask me about my social life and I lie to them just so they don’t pity me. Is anyone going through anything similar? I know my situation’s somewhat specific but I really hate feeling like I’m alone in this.

lonely,ParkingWheel,2018/03/22,"Isolation and talking to myself. I don't have anyone else to talk to so I just talk to myself. Turns out I am a terrible listener haha. I talk to myself as if I was having a casual conversation with another person. My family always asks who I am talking to. I give them the same answer ""who do you think?"". I can't talk to anyone. I don't have any ""true"" friends because they wouldn't be willing to listen to my problems. I tried before and all I got was ""that sucks bro"".  I tried talking to my family but they gave me the same ""sorry about that"" responses. I often isolate myself in video games because I can talk to people in them. The responses may be scripted but it still feels like I am talking to someone. In games like skyrim they respect me for being the dragonborn (not all of them though lol). It makes me feel powerful and like I have some worth. In strategy games I can take over the world and they respect me as a king. This is all temporary and fiction. I've tried lifting. I was okay at it. I just never have any motivation to actually keep going. I talk to people and I put up a barrier and no one really knows I am depressed. This was just kinda me ranting. I had to get this off my chest. Not sure who to turn to if anyone.

lonely,edomarc,2018/03/22,"always wishing for a better tomorrow It's been over two years since my life was taken out of control and I went through several traumatizing experiences as well as severe depression. Since then I've gotten better and I feel hopeful again, but the hard reality is there for me every day when I really feel alone.

I still struggle with a lot of difficult emotions in what I perceive as other former friend's apathy in caring about me. From my viewpoint, there is really only one person from my former life who actually put effort in keeping contact and maintaining a friendship with me and I am truly grateful for her. However we rarely can meet in person and it's still entirely valid to feel upset thinking about those others who used to be important in your life and cared about you but in reality didn't really care enough.

I really am just utterly lost. It's extremely frustrating to hear the typical suggestions of escaping lonliness, as if I'm not trying. I've literally been to so many clubs, meetups, classes, etc the past several months. It's not easy at all. It's even more difficult when I no longer have the benefit of having a mutual friends to connect to other relationships.

I don't know what to do anymore.",6.503639010189223,7.603579131004365,7.626008733624456,67.57950800582245,65.55021834061135,11.52151382823872,34.04395924308588,11.34169021259432,4.433438195050947,987,43,161,31,15,335,143,229,0.17,0.675,0.155,-0.5884,1,1,0,0,0,0,17.0,1,2,0,5,14,17,1,2,8,0,14,3,0,2,1,29,32,17,0,3,6,0,4,0,2,0,3,1,0,2,13,10,0,2,6,1,0,2,5,7,1,2,8,5,19,10,35,23,5,24,0,2,0,0,15,9,0,3,13,120,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.10995788797025538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167008654461858,0.0,0.0,0.09375747542257007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174671921991908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19930981899636094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3446494893143339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12637843399170606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266826196159469,0.0,0.0970497616622283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674806113428114,0.0,0.11642693304969183,0.12566622818974396,0.07442303649476856,0.0,0.09493643217699103,0.0,0.0,0.11022112017120923,0.0,0.0,0.17092079066428684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17411014206650416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009377357935541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1269967733024037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11191509959289908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100153760698159,0.0,0.0,0.06192511515010728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23876430994793696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12300181055761927,0.09579516684423546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11423823657031144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993884318905601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763538163848163,0.08569701909549175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10756430573731207,0.0,0.19677290762040672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11327293832002562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2887387353779212,0.0,0.0,0.1209744588777938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818836401548599,0.0,0.1864175137854163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17997027025253334,0.0,0.0,0.11779595409245645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07219978447801413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0765012536321504,0.0,0.11007044763716743,0.0,0.0,0.09731798051948196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131143549897516,0.1044540281189227,0.0,0.0,0.12957462699098735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07256121088358927

lonely,bootysmoothie99,2018/03/23,"Dealing with loneliness in new country I'm 23 years old who constantly moving country cause of my family issue but last time we moved was 4 years ago, I've made some good friends and memories that I could never forget about in that pervious country. I don't want to sound ungrateful to my family but since I've moved to this new place I feel weightless and dead inside, it's been couple of months that I moved here and I don't feel very welcomed here by the local. I worked part time but my coworkers treat me like shit expect for the manager and I hate going home cause everyone is on the edge and constantly trying to fight with each other. I literally have nothing to do here, all I have is the Internet to keep in touch with my friends back in pervious country that I've lived but I also don't want to keep texting them everyday since they also have their problems and stuff. I knew I had to leave my friends one day but my stupid self keep thinking ""there are still more times"" and I took them forgranted. Now I'm all alone again but this time I'm stuck in old rural town with less than 5000 people. My bad if I went on I just needed a place to whine.",3.6080769230769216,5.065741858974358,4.305641025641027,87.34769230769234,72.71794871794873,7.935042735042735,24.96581196581197,8.515128840125781,1.504540170940171,921,28,191,16,18,294,134,234,0.203,0.7020000000000001,0.096,-0.98,0,1,0,0,1,0,12.0,1,0,4,1,12,14,4,0,5,0,14,1,1,3,3,42,33,16,1,7,8,0,4,1,3,0,0,1,1,1,10,13,0,3,4,0,0,7,4,7,0,1,8,5,28,7,26,24,7,40,0,1,0,0,13,11,1,2,23,117,38,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886301090389462,0.0,0.0,0.10382576886969197,0.0,0.16033514889831332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07708383662870331,0.08370214618478991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2059627843945339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21666301629622514,0.0,0.08003915695898355,0.11092151605751673,0.0,0.06465109013322533,0.10335036444936528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09579040577743872,0.0,0.0,0.1890080995438873,0.0,0.10137589776326296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.232351996263498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05697274053472316,0.08408251632027193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09897326295160082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055602096645964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046319336472032,0.0,0.2673127016647337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08171477119222814,0.0,0.10614721071356004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04897567231422106,0.0,0.08852003120928062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0948562355699186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08001628359526101,0.4261872353249324,0.0,0.07433195887182606,0.07731674818451872,0.19363855930627388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618980188548633,0.0,0.21038494873535016,0.0,0.06793003344044983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.108557846787804,0.0,0.06949872101195083,0.0,0.20947377852025606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09592294177369952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1045795946384457,0.0,0.10290221371840017,0.16585088401484374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800574683453054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475895245893195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06423429772346106,0.0,0.0,0.23381957469566456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1113782233343302,0.06806120458049209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08271436117546838,0.11825668086238897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929300715938952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07298108710457682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12911169906582295

lonely,IcyBarracuda,2018/03/23,"I feel abandoned and lonely. I feel cursed. I only feel attracted to older women in their 40s and all it has brought me is pain. I got used by my therapist for two years straight. All she did was mess with my head and confuse me. She made me reliant on her so that when she left I was totally unable to function like a human being.

She pulled me along for 2 years straight. Saying things like: ""when your life ends it wont matter because you'll still have me"" or ""i never do things like this for other college students, only for you"".

She made me feel special and like I had a value. Nobody has ever seemed interested in me before and it hurts so much to have the only person in your life who seemed to care about you abandon you like you were nothing.

I feel suicidal and alone. Nobody would ever love me. Nobody ever has loved me. My life has fallen to pieces. It's been months since I've left the house. Every time I try and reach out to people they distance themselves further. They can see I'm a sinking ship and want nothing to do with me. I'm not sure if I should just try and keep surviving for as long as I can or just end it now. My therapist abandoned me during summer last year. I'm still not over her. I can't get past this and every time I try and move on I can't. I feel like I cant move on because she is the best I will ever have.",2.261578214451493,3.7275100889679753,3.5363484449945837,91.46922327092683,76.22419928825623,5.883397802877921,21.82593222961473,6.280692351149826,0.2427656196812631,1049,27,228,7,23,342,145,281,0.098,0.721,0.181,0.9714,0,3,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,7,3,2,14,22,0,1,6,0,28,7,1,3,9,51,51,20,1,4,7,0,6,6,0,5,4,1,0,3,12,15,0,4,8,0,0,5,7,8,0,1,10,8,50,14,27,35,6,41,0,5,1,2,25,13,0,6,29,159,62,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09749398619788698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476589743557528,0.0,0.08010073223929763,0.0,0.09878737097104108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09597544521442873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1667488000512654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3405968023448735,0.15862318026438782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28558055918857017,0.06724903906275681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049180903529888284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0752872127827862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09660819726119436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1086174976858914,0.10077193037402836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367023951228053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673142093247874,0.0,0.0,0.20455279192029044,0.0,0.19946796666513486,0.2759334357520219,0.0,0.0,0.08330524457099457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16991843884732802,0.17814291427100115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07513651508069714,0.20009816874379885,0.06919900288090514,0.0,0.07260161000904837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18064739263661966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2147784585389036,0.1001647521818356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986114112216763,0.06526036282585955,0.08219379979023553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07485879071108102,0.0,0.0,0.07501226537292734,0.17139132794697667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786825935931305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15035037638278234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1029668437852663,0.0,0.08871977285822075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21859265322691745,0.1250763182491065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10978007982192443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917315386792881,0.0,0.09195481680195182,0.0,0.0,0.0813011781300608,0.0,0.0,0.05552241672428985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0668697851620617,0.0,0.0,0.18185679254406506

lonely,nxnjakid,2018/03/23,"I feel horrible for being a weak and something I can't even find a word for I already know this is going to be ignored or downvoted to oblivion but I have to say something btw I am a male and no I am not gay. I noticed people talk about men being dominate and having genes that make them dominate. I also not complaining about stupid shit like feeling oppressed or anything. I just noticed that when men talk about love it's always I want to hold her, I want to protect her, I want to take care of her, etc. But I have never had these feelings in fact I want to be the one to be held the one to be protected and the one too be cared for by a woman. I am also very hated for this no matter where I seemed to go they also say it's ok to be ""effeminate"" as they call it but knowing their is no woman who will do this for me which doesn't matter that much since I can't get one I always feel depressed. I just want someone to hold me and to never let go since I am always just thrown into the waste in the end. I just want to live for someone just to help them so I can have their good caring and protection. I am also too clingy and people just think I weird and run away I hate them for this even though in the end it's my fault. I feel like everywhere I go and speak my mind people just hate me. I been exiled from a community of people who are exiles they literally delete my posts or downvote them. I am biologically programmed this way it seems everything I say in person or on the internet I get hated or ignored for. I know even now I am going to get hated for this. It feels so horrible to know that you will never be loved because no one will accept the way I work. I would love to just live by someones side that is my life goal it's impossible but I still dream but there is no hope in the end. I don't want to do anything no special skills no nothing. I gave up trying to find a SO a long time ago. I even have what some would call a waifu so I could have someone who holds and protects me. But even other people who have waifus are against that mentality. Sorry for all the text I just really wanted to let everything out. I know this will never be seen and even if someone does they will hate it.

lonely,Falvarius,2018/03/23,"Willing to talk. I am willing to lend an ear out and a friendly face to talk to you guys to prove that you don’t have to feel or be alone any longer.  You can PM me whenever and I will try to respond as soon as possible.

I am doing this because I went through long periods of loneliness for more then half my life. I had social anxiety and had been accustomed to bouts of melancholy which had led me to be isolated for most if not all of my life growing up . You guys shouldn’t feel the way you do now,  you guys deserve more. 

Just PM me whenever, I am here and I don’t think I am going anywhere 😊",2.0911023622047225,3.3054811417322867,3.764574803149608,90.692531496063,76.16535433070865,7.599685039370079,26.87322834645669,8.238735603445708,1.5505659842519677,463,18,107,8,10,155,78,127,0.095,0.866,0.04,-0.7003,0,1,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,6,0,0,4,1,0,0,3,0,20,4,2,1,2,17,25,9,0,2,4,0,2,0,1,4,2,1,0,3,3,5,0,0,4,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,5,3,19,1,19,14,4,12,0,0,0,0,14,2,0,3,5,81,22,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21459985396375436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.140905168352581,0.0,0.15850975380037186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263090462816026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2095361593974321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16008455000837146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11775825916600052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6154907399520513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2927072611425865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183368164709812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2335902879039236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2112173993763839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3330838998884777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13276733763676446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14067725885952442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16446812380922465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19207928831156176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,ofthesunshine,2018/03/23,"I spent the last 4 years building a relationship with you... Since high school, I had been building an intimate relationship with my significant other. Things got terrible, dark, and twisted. He blocked me and cut me out. I picked my chin up, went to therapy, and did my best to move on.

&amp;nbsp;

Then, he contacted me. He needed me, he needed closure, he was depressed. We have since stayed in each other's lives, for emotional support. My one condition was no lying, but then he did. He lied, thought I was the bad guy, that he deserved to lie, then he blocked me again. I thought he was dead, so I had to contact his friends and family. But nope, just ignoring me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, he's gone. He has blocked me again. I tried reaching out to him, calling to the fact that I was there for him when he needed me. But he ignored me. I feel invisible, insignificant, and so fucking lonely man. I can't even imagine going on.

lonely,highandout,2018/03/23,"No friends. I have no friends really. I used to try and talk to people, but no matter what, they’d always stop talking to me. People will make plans with me only to ghost me or just fall through and werent serious about them.

I leave for basic training in a few months and people have said how they want to start hanging out but when I ask, they just don’t answer. 

I don’t get why no one really likes me. I have a dry sense of humor but it’s not an overly dominant trait. People just don’t like me and I don’t know why. I used to be outgoing and talkative but now I get embarrassed around people because they don’t like me and I just stay quiet",0.8245359749739336,2.8495816569343084,2.6965015641293038,93.15943430656937,82.7956204379562,5.958081334723673,18.544838373305527,7.1686216300943375,0.1887626694473408,505,12,113,7,14,168,80,137,0.134,0.696,0.17,0.6152,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,5,1,9,8,0,1,3,0,11,0,0,4,0,28,21,13,1,1,10,0,0,3,2,1,0,2,0,0,2,9,0,1,2,0,0,2,10,2,0,1,1,2,21,6,15,17,1,12,0,0,0,0,11,4,0,1,8,76,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13421808761135334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14359501286597404,0.15079773275492564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09832959545789977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2492465821694013,0.0,0.1685496634943355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08864861701000364,0.0,0.0,0.1707979481732114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2364153787586219,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076718633268931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12875154200138111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1093039586530021,0.12267917800847325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5591404083869753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20667131184515672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15343731411566985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141720037253569,0.17192890645596645,0.0,0.13485760566547333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2593005496736464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10951502177400314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2786302249853339,0.0,0.0,0.09514144702103826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2911040573347739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,McHorseyPie,2018/03/24,"Well- hi there. I'm McHorseyPie. I'm an 18M who's lonely. :( I just posted a similar post to another subreddit so I'm just going to copy paste what I said there. :)

I'm not really sure what about myself to post so.. here goes. I'm nerdy, I like computers, cars, movies, tv shows, netflix, cameras, and other nerdy stuff. I'm not really that interesting, but there is a twist to me- I'm also a heavy outdoorsman. I love to hike, climb, drive, swim, all that jazz. I learned to ski but I'm not very good, I want to learn to snowboard, surf, and all of that. Maybe you and I have something in common, I'd love to chat! :D",-0.44435661764705614,1.7678405937500017,1.8199080882352945,95.4254595588235,92.28125,5.511764705882354,16.904411764705884,7.048011613610866,0.05016764705882304,468,12,108,8,17,157,79,128,0.108,0.7190000000000001,0.172,0.9376,0,2,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,0,1,11,8,0,0,4,0,2,2,0,0,3,16,15,8,0,1,7,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,3,0,0,2,7,0,5,3,1,1,0,1,1,10,7,12,14,2,11,0,1,0,2,7,1,0,0,3,56,18,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16456953213121692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21578789731579565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11695473286370885,0.17260619977991773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10053819806753482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3714655372648247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20674289029447984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19644905692765047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5912674444203677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2636676352562515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1957526345178488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15842656397704685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23557937537467394,0.0,0.0,0.1939538658332632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1697976246969079,0.1213797896134222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850291862466448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,SillySunrise,2018/03/24,"I'm just painfully lonely I don't even know why I'm typing this. But I don't know what else to do, I just can't stop crying. This feeling is creeping into me slowly, I push it out and away, only for it to come back stronger. I have no friends in real life, well, the ones I had have lives and families now and no time for the loner me. I go to work, and back home, and all I do is just sit staring at the laptop watching whatever. I've never dated, and I feel stupid for that alone. But these days I just despise seeing couples and friends, hate hearing family and relationship stories. I can't show any of this to anyone. Most of my time I spend trying to help people, and when I do, it's all about them. At times when I'm broken like this I just wonder, can't it be about me for once? I'm just a crying mess right now. Oh well. xD",1.4032029795158325,2.7755942737430175,3.2371843575419,93.10814152700186,78.3296089385475,5.667188081936686,20.31322160148976,6.079149491110277,-0.06416007448789562,641,15,148,4,15,215,102,179,0.156,0.684,0.16,-0.0526,0,3,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,1,1,18,11,3,0,4,0,14,2,0,0,3,31,28,13,0,0,8,0,2,1,2,0,2,1,1,0,11,12,0,1,5,1,1,3,8,6,2,1,1,6,19,5,19,26,3,24,0,1,3,0,6,7,0,2,14,100,30,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15355133211636324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008210206250819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10366595142588582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13929395751320742,0.2280036242993367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12771176844425938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16404546517131705,0.3257105071224786,0.09561461591670144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12385114503636302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09792349311399154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27953027251039303,0.0,0.14992813745090694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22908865454480445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08425885306379256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14637480208978965,0.0,0.0,0.16709836418527801,0.0,0.09937470177259168,0.0,0.14871559478745267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16295824176458906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471952575551992,0.0724317267958937,0.0,0.13091517509710315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434627268244453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15789070914770212,0.10046395262992401,0.11275744520148505,0.15775774207660415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1027839360877944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16875089306923982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15917439208115627,0.0,0.12661214562007134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1181430129413334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12395093713276935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25935257374155657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10065794592761862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26660480742813697,0.0,0.13378044394211955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1607802687364128,0.10793412142483426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,bastardchild9,2018/03/24,"Calling all misfits and outliers Hey all! SO I've lurked behind the screen at these posts for a long time now, and its just taken me /this/ long to post something!

To keep it short and sweet, I'm looking to form a friendship group of redditors, introverts, extroverts, misfits - a group for those who don't feel like they belong anywhere and are continuously searching just for friendship and comfort whilst figuring life out. Sometimes life gets lonely. Or maybe you have a story to be shared but just want to be able to just go into messages and go straight ahead into telling your friends about it. Or sharing what you got for brunch. If this sounds like you, send me a PM! And hopefully we can get a skype/discord/other group running!

P.S: Not looking for anyone from a particular location, just be nice and not creepy, and willing to not ghost and leave!",6.781886792452831,7.6328141383647825,5.8248364779874215,81.62102830188681,64.84905660377359,8.372578616352202,34.13899371069182,8.238735603445708,2.572473710691824,684,29,124,8,10,205,109,159,0.035,0.77,0.195,0.9753,0,2,1,0,0,0,24.0,1,4,1,1,8,10,0,0,8,0,8,3,0,0,2,33,21,15,1,3,12,0,1,2,1,1,2,1,0,0,9,14,1,1,2,0,0,4,4,1,0,0,2,6,8,9,21,15,3,19,0,1,3,0,18,6,0,4,9,81,17,0,0.19454971576440253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13603368476867292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1986570117576832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09837018185538088,0.13898635581496047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1503086277981413,0.0,0.20328839348700384,0.0,0.22113417373773828,0.0,0.1555991801515566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193231765249788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17292472639087947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20600005823313652,0.0,0.0,0.274832435526062,0.19009432807352536,0.0,0.0,0.3443407526579433,0.3267455252882395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19545133874444506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37264969838740575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497738760345804,0.1924146435143452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17004502670392202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344350378959354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11475046296717024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,ljdriley,2018/03/24,"Any UK/EU gamers 20+ who play co-op games? (PC) I'm 29 and I decided this year, because of lack of interest (and stress) that playing against others is not really my cup of tea anymore. No more Battlefield, RB6 Siege, etc.

I have a ton of games though. I still sometimes play MMORPGs. I also play stuff like Torchlight 2, Killing Floor 2, Guild Wars 2, etc.

PC only tho :)",-0.11744471744471595,2.208086567567573,1.384987714987716,97.1149262899263,95.4864864864865,4.853071253071254,21.592137592137593,6.574015621080383,0.4839891891891885,282,11,62,4,11,90,59,74,0.177,0.621,0.201,0.0276,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,0,0,4,9,2,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,0,5,3,5,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,0,1,6,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,5,6,5,3,5,3,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,3,31,10,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20310788343901445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17271525322612005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2518801233674392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.154823979619319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5665101450944663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2809914738129305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1240819023413627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19316339569230606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16270622707235893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2511929235085917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20282892504641484,0.0,0.29093347425391264,0.0,0.290746578024444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2495342683481673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16355492918839426

lonely,Sad-Machine-9,2018/03/24,"I grew up too fast At this point, during this time of the night, I do not even feel like typing but I have to let it out. People talk about how suicide survivors regret about having making an attempt. I regret having failed my one attempt. I wish I had gone through. 
Anyway, I have just hit a dead end with no one to talk to. I am 21, in fact it was my Birthday a few weeks ago, not that it matters. People everywhere online tell me I have an entire life ahead of me then why do I feel like all my good days ended 3 years ago. For the past 3 years I feel dead. I don’t eat for days. I don’t sleep, or sleep a lot. I just, when I was a kid, things were good. I wish there was a way to realize you are in the good old days before they are gone. 
I had a friend, we went our seperate ways, he never thinks about me now, didn’t even wish me on my birthday and we just stopped talking like 5 years ago. We used to do EVERYTHING together. Now I understand no one from school and all that lasts forever and I have made my peace with that. But I cannot help but think about it.

lonely,Gage_the_Film_guy,2018/03/24,"High school blues I moved to a new town 9 hours away from my old one. I only had one really close friend that I could count on and tell him anything. I had other friends but I wasn’t  very popular. I got depressed sometimes back then but it was nothing bad, mainly over my body image and self-esteem issues. But since I’ve moved sadness and loneliness is the new normal for me. I don’t fit in at my new school, and I’m not confident enough to talk to anybody. Mainly because, as mentioned before, my body image and self-esteem issues. Everyone at my new school wants to smoke weed and fuck, but I just want someone to go eat with or play video games with. I don’t really leave my room anymore, I just can’t get over my loneliness. My parents have started to notice that I look sad or am not as talkative as I used to be. Suicide has never seriously crossed my mind but it’s one of the main things I think about now. I hope this empty, lonely, depressed feeling doesn’t last forever but it probably will.

lonely,Xtraspicy4me,2018/03/25,"Anyone else have overprotective parents? Long post; TL;DR: parents overprotectiveness caused my social skills to take a big hit and as a result I have no friends (or real friends I guess, sometimes I have decent convos at school but it's usually over schoolwork.)


I know my parents love me and I love them back but they severely hurt my social skills when I tried to do something with people back when I was younger and they wanted me to focus on school so I did. Fast forward couple years to when I found gaming and I figured that I could make up for the lack of social skills by just talking to people online. It felt pretty amazing to have conversations with people, even though I couldn't see them. Then my parents got mad af when they found out and they gave me this speech about how there are dangerous people on the internet (keep in mind that I was 14 at the time and I was getting the ""stranger danger"" talk that most 6 year olds get) and so that cut off my only socialization I've pretty much ever had. Like I can't even date because it ""hurts my education"" or some bs like that (I wouldn't have found anyone anyway but that's beside the point). Now, I have some acquaintances but they kind of depress me because they talk about the friends and dates they have and I'm just seen as the weird gamer kid (No, I don't have bad hygiene or obsess about the newest game or anything like that, I just really like videogames). I'm really awkward when I talk and sometimes can't make up coherent sentences. It's really frustrating when you see other people going out and having fun while your just stuck at home. I just really hope that these last two years fly by and I get to do whatever the I want.",4.1350973123262325,5.826573325301207,4.4598795180722925,85.83085727525491,71.77108433734941,7.155885078776648,24.516218721037998,7.748469712250963,1.1840214087117706,1352,39,263,17,26,424,172,332,0.13699999999999998,0.6990000000000001,0.16399999999999998,0.9017,5,1,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,2,9,3,26,25,5,2,11,0,23,2,0,5,1,55,51,34,0,7,13,4,1,4,3,1,0,1,1,1,15,16,0,1,6,2,0,2,7,12,0,1,13,5,44,13,31,34,5,41,0,3,3,2,33,15,0,9,29,177,59,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11277893232494104,0.08263122226923282,0.06636467806377243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12402338936270678,0.0673359313754297,0.09832194546621746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08284552157877005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643891635518986,0.08923311926576159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06946016811797769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06736927463791463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10653167072720293,0.0729488048592996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774326804428476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2652720957973517,0.1869203931856418,0.0,0.12640241281325204,0.0,0.04583290538867213,0.0,0.06449986794803744,0.0,0.08884051592921417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0808943812770981,0.08009954377547414,0.0,0.0,0.17266613975327755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07168175311912561,0.0,0.08398026162046422,0.04432086009671937,0.06573714625203579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1575979905096002,0.0,0.0,0.0713690555886357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1455720893694072,0.0,0.10766348651160128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08142933733960789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05928399236709087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08462427259147819,0.0,0.0,0.061334816815929616,0.0,0.0,0.3581907714099096,0.0,0.0,0.2795484537761617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07623641250696653,0.0,0.07723644916847333,0.16409168136567662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0917926536507767,0.20665523292396087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16323584821247386,0.1285286314156974,0.0,0.0,0.09110687614388256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288332266669316,0.0,0.062085129348925586,0.15952165153898218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06063565639200748,0.25928037622496103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07923415605517588,0.0,0.0470252542903149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054753250780968606,0.0,0.07877929493848865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08882003027119699,0.0,0.0951340450656558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557998851463358
lonely,fiftythrowaways,2018/03/25,"Anyone wanna play Overwatch? Hi all. I just got Overwatch on PC and was looking for some people to play with. Ideally I'd like to play casually with some girls around my age (I'm 25) but I wouldn't mind having some guy friends to chill with as well. I'm a new player so I'm not very good so don't worry about your skill or anything. I'm on Pacific time if it matters.

So why am I posting this here instead of some ""looking for team"" subreddit? Cause I tried asking people before, got a bunch of friends, but pretty much all of them never spoke to me, let alone actually played any games with me, lol. So as a loner looking for other fellow loners, I thought it'd make a bit more sense trying here. 

Mic not required but I can use mine if you want. Just know that I tend to not have much to talk about in game (I'm quiet when I'm concentrating!) but I'll try. :) Also the only requirement I have is please don't be toxic or rude or a super angry rager, but that's all pretty obvious stuff anyway lol.",1.999565217391304,3.6971341014492793,3.7162560386473436,88.90163043478262,77.55072463768116,6.1458937198067645,21.644927536231886,6.937597516519254,0.5049014492753621,777,21,165,8,18,260,130,207,0.085,0.6629999999999999,0.252,0.9883,0,1,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,2,1,6,16,13,1,0,6,2,13,0,0,3,5,43,32,19,0,6,15,0,0,1,3,1,0,2,0,2,7,6,0,2,2,8,0,0,7,1,1,0,5,5,15,12,25,23,12,10,0,0,3,0,15,4,0,9,6,104,22,4,0.0,0.0,0.1395284994044195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14808484352944376,0.0,0.11434158251539675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09723175213113666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09997540226222043,0.0,0.11766090081987968,0.12728310147312286,0.13366761656323667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1216660110314306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560978495600593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468805241318874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2209330071909092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11992539432553212,0.2287093914095897,0.0,0.0,0.14157333324655993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07857843172358528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620741256034367,0.0,0.06985312847047788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3602032325701767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954407011225987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14436970786383266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2102144740130537,0.0,0.1102754998277898,0.13809161284481009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10874323523802468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1982495740429904,0.0,0.0,0.15694982890273054,0.0,0.0,0.13693594921923194,0.29092546833394034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16367864840772287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492243886962993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1135106733134869,0.08337317293644449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2912234488735802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12348938341399385,0.0,0.1179740190287451,0.08433369804271304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12855678504395712,0.0,0.12901780684947342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1452038011473923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,BananasArentBad,2018/03/25,"What have I been doing for 6 months of my life For 6 months I've dedicated a great portion of my time into a single girl I like over the internet. Now I only learn she was already dating someone else but never told me.

lonely,Bamian,2018/03/25,"never had family, never hat a relationship. will it ever get better? just have one of those nights and need to vent

i was an outsider in kindergarden and elementary school because of my very bad eyesight and thick glasses and therefore my inability of nonverbal communication
my father was an choleric alcoholic and was constantly fighting with my mom.

at 10 i got into a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children and had friends for the first time in life. thats why my grades sucked and i had to change the school 2 years later. lost my entire social life.

got into another boarding school and had to start over. also the educator werent much of a parents substitue. in this time i fell in love with a girl next door but got friendzoned. i saw her 14 h a day and loved here for 2 years. that fucked me up good. since then im gay.

at the age of 16 i had to leave again because of financial problems. i lifed at my parents and was driven to the same school everyday for 3 years. one ride taking 1h30m when traffic was good (paid by social services. no other school accepted me because of my eyesight).

then i studied computer science for 5 years and lifed in the student dorm where i had one close friend. but now i finished studying and my friend is gone. again no social life. 

i am 26 now, unemployed and life at my parents for one year now to avoid rent. my parents are good to me but we have no connection. i never had any relationship. i never cuddeld with anyone oder kissed someone on the mouth. i am bad at dating because of my inability to observe nonverbal communication. i feel so lonely",3.6137794729542323,5.8938409546925605,4.638200416088769,81.46481796116508,74.72815533980581,7.391631992602867,28.51144244105409,8.306716005460428,2.2007539528432734,1281,54,234,23,28,417,165,309,0.138,0.7490000000000001,0.113,-0.6806,8,3,1,0,3,0,28.0,1,0,0,4,12,20,3,1,14,0,19,14,1,1,5,37,36,22,0,2,4,6,2,0,3,1,8,0,3,2,6,21,1,1,2,0,2,4,7,9,0,5,20,4,32,11,41,15,2,53,0,2,2,5,21,18,2,0,31,157,38,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183727694207231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06123841402667665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052074828444358484,0.0802974185235837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05354425696699616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12787680600805554,0.18672194903813152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772592870872758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08100806725485256,0.0,0.0,0.08275228224992406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049385680582931635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06926807112462417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07218976209392877,0.0,0.038719514979775264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06513616008563125,0.0,0.0,0.17748906393735353,0.07079398844837935,0.04000820090180577,0.0,0.0,0.19268688053264807,0.1837363113420754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08271605051632355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108374092790402,0.0,0.0,0.3245306170092454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08359258861222323,0.0,0.13822704648347356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08968578564550014,0.0,0.0,0.05629273581322871,0.056780703471248285,0.2362428984063976,0.0,0.08144026194271207,0.0718621096950934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075616003730056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3401177562546819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732736254446626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644295824218063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4649986671835883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06334509414671566,0.0,0.0,0.23418111554572946,0.0648832473681505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05420143081518886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05757619974379075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0893050589414782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06318385370169681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06909862273069342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24656464092271546

lonely,throwaway1239191123,2018/03/25,I hate that I still get optimistic each time something seem to be going well. It just makes the crash that much worse. I start talking with someone new and it seems promising and I have a good few days. I think this is the one that will get me out of this pit of loneliness. It is nice at least having those few good days but I'm not sure it's worth it because once it fails the crash is even worse than the one before. Each time I get rejected again it gets a little worse. I just don't understand why no one will give me a real chance. People change their mind so quickly before they even really know me.,2.22517818181818,4.033026776,2.813018181818183,95.1345090909091,77.24000000000002,6.1454545454545455,19.363636363636363,6.980632752743323,0.03747999999999997,477,10,107,5,11,148,82,125,0.231,0.6579999999999999,0.111,-0.9634,0,1,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,2,1,9,9,1,0,7,0,9,0,0,1,1,19,24,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,13,6,0,0,5,0,1,1,3,3,1,3,0,0,12,6,7,21,6,13,0,2,0,0,4,3,0,2,9,71,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08619557642962038,0.0,0.2406404321171011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14958149459023756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18238143837479295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18678553852449584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2955007662598005,0.13564289719352535,0.08036036473216931,0.23719770597931844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13960233323647314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07770924518994378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14171904094731794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0943849944820172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14277277848781228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039446050604515,0.0,0.0,0.13656412791464803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15058542234516262,0.287447060417393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09802832927680204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16094312731335708,0.09058388155164494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2574488526214121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11980699508189635,0.108855932143387,0.0,0.0,0.10008300784116844,0.0,0.11292150062259775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13326697447753885,0.0,0.0,0.11365123716596012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09060283119478987,0.0,0.0,0.16490189981832176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14720144551825165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12713476854505928,0.0,0.1275906908094384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4322932762939671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,vogel-chen,2018/03/26,"Maybe going on a solo road trip to see a movie by myself. There’s a lot of stuff I like doing by myself but seeing movies has never been one of them. If I go to see a movie it’s because there’s someone else with me. I’ve always actually kind of hated the thought of going to see a movie by myself. I’m not really sure why, I just don’t like the thought of it for me personally. But there’s a new Tommy Wiseau movie coming out that I really want to see and I have no friends to go see it with, so I might just learn to suck it up and go by myself. It’s also not playing anywhere close to me because of its limited release so I’m going to have to travel at least an hour to get to a theatre where it’s showing, so solo mini road trip. Maybe I’ll go sightseeing by myself too. 

Hoping the whole thing will be more on the peaceful side and less on the sad side, although whichever one it weighs more of will most likely depend heavily on my mood/outlook at the time, which doesn’t seem like it’ll improve very much over the next week :/ crossing my fingers that it’ll be fine since I’m not going to see very many movies in theatres ever if I hate seeing them alone as much as I feel like I will lol.

lonely,colochitaa,2018/03/26,"I haven't had friends in six years and I don't think I can take it anymore. I'm 22 years old and I've been depressed almost all my life but I always had friends. When I was a junior in high school my depression and anxiety got to a really bad point and I had to change schools and do independent study instead (a program where I only went to school twice a week &amp; would do most of my schoolwork at home) and after that I lost contact with all of my friends. I was so depressed at the time I wasn't thinking about the effects it would have on me later, but now I regret it so much because I'm alone. I see people my age and younger going out and enjoying their lives with their friends and significant others, and I am always just alone. I know I can still go out by myself and I do sometimes but it's so hard to go out and see groups of people laughing together while I'm just by myself. The lack of friends is just making my mental health worse and I don't know what to do anymore. At times I feel like I am losing my sanity because I have no one to talk to and I am always just inside my own head.",3.293397435897436,3.9114807649572683,4.485544871794873,88.95216346153849,72.54700854700855,7.217521367521367,26.163461538461537,7.1686216300943375,1.0313256410256413,865,27,193,8,16,285,120,234,0.241,0.7020000000000001,0.057,-0.9927,0,2,0,0,0,1,14.0,0,0,2,3,13,15,0,0,7,0,24,3,1,3,2,42,42,22,0,4,7,0,2,1,5,2,2,0,1,0,7,19,0,0,6,0,0,4,5,7,0,3,10,4,34,8,26,30,6,29,0,6,2,0,10,12,0,2,14,138,41,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10681624136584102,0.22095930247564224,0.0,0.0,0.2662780557630219,0.11557868017802887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816035146073107,0.0,0.21157921184535453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08906636588416475,0.13005208646349006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11284445370390644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27562838836274656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053936387617138606,0.07620624277944442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41207123226830267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818718581965584,0.0,0.0853150572182689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09555683931366818,0.0,0.10947588006574606,0.11338696788101076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270444707465165,0.10700035499068147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11724789012469775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07534533581572864,0.05211437637609865,0.0,0.09419301472100312,0.0,0.0,0.11933828250742658,0.11644469884666535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07120414974690713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10749992629141816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841593109927708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193394479524704,0.0,0.07228346570198327,0.08112859099709671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14790537151738475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10083918156836016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06833658572590484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3238721916812144,0.17000697663830902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10550098210716664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08518811156479791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0802037997770632,0.0857386256628759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13670176271751985,0.0,0.0,0.12440218524831675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556555735044757,0.0,0.0,0.09888568137727814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870751701137313,0.15155294867228886,0.0,0.0,0.13738608092001842
lonely,InCaseJoeyShowsUp,2018/03/26,"In the presence of absence I made this mildly entertaining but I understand any TLDRs.

You know this all too well. A meaningful relationship you had right at your fingertips; held lovingly like a kitten, yet falls away like sand right before your awestruck eyes. You ask yourself, ""wtf have I done""?! Then of course you remember, ""oh yeah, I'm me"". After which, depression and self-loathing rears their shiny head, with that ""there-there"" attitude. Yes, I choose to personify depression cause that is not me, nor you. Depression is voidal ghost that, when fills your heart, makes you emptier than ever before. 

So yeah, I fucked up.

Now, I won't go into details about the one that got away. That story happened over a year ago and since then I have gotten over it. We all have gotten over the one that got away. But, all of us whom fell hard for that one that got away still lives on don't they? They left something broken within you didn't they? Okay, I maybe speaking for you, which, I really shouldn't. But I exercise my awareness of your existence cause, the more you do it, the less lonely you actually feel.  And also, I go out of my way to acknowledge your existence. After all, that's all we ever really wanted.

Now, Even though I feel lonely, and boy do I miss being in that mundane yet heartfelt life of love and relationship; I am not alone. You're not alone. It's important to accept that. Suffer with me if you have to. But don't accept that you're alone. I, of course repeat this to myself during my weak days. 

I am happy. That could be the weed coursing through my head but, even in a clean state of sobriety, I do smile. I am happy for others without envy bashing my friends' achievements into disregard. I am happy for you if you found your way. You are making it out alive. Today you won. Today I'm winning. Or as I prefer to say, ""I'm Charlie Sheening"". I'm happy cause I see a portion of my purpose in life in bloom on the daily. My love for people and their love for me is a currency I'm constantly indebted too. Friends, true friends, has been the mightiest influence to why I am alive today. 

Chances are, you can say the same. Cheers to your friends. They are the oblivious heroes that kept you on your feet when so badly you wanted to lay 6 feet away from life itself. 

Loneliness has this way of making life feel so halved. The presence of absence, although nonchalant and invisible, is a personal black hole that will not be ignored until full. 

Today, at the moment of writing this, I'm warm, safe, sober and free from depression. Hell, I'm outside under the Sun and listening to a banzai water fountain tinkle its blessings to keep my mind at ease. Many of you could very well be in a similar setting. And I am happy to know you're safe where you are. Alive and in relative ease. It looks good on you.

But the absence is still there.

It sits beside me. Awaiting for my anxieties to come out and play. Lurking just behind my every step. Fanboying all over my sanity, wanting to steal my attention and make feel low. But I refrain. 

I don't know what it is but, being alone makes pursuing life goals less desirable. Less worthy of my time. Pathetic right? But you know this feeling don't you? Life just isn't fun without a player two. And for some of you, players 3, 4, 5, and the occasional 60 manned online team. You know who you are. You're an oblivious hero in some regard. So no judgement whatsoever.

Pursuing my life goals has been something I have struggled with a lot. I am ambitious and creative. I am inspired and have proven that I have the will power to overcome my obstacles post breakup, breakdown and suicide attempt(s). And if you can share the sentiments, than allow me to say I'm proud of you. Well done! You fucking told your brain who's boss! I just can't seem to get my shit together. I want to achieve great things, even in small doses. But lethargy has me stuck. And the rut I'm in has left me hobbling over obstacles.

I'm looking for you. Or you. Or maybe even you. Or someone that'll never see this post. I just miss trying for someone. Living for someone. Showing off to someone. 

I've spent the past year being alone with myself. Save for a few random occurances that did temporarily perk me right up. I did get to know myself. I don't even look like the sad sack I did a year ago! I have evolved. I have become anew. I want to share that part with you the most. That despite my problems and constant feeling of being utterly pathetic, I can still be happy with me. I think I'm awesome. My cat likes being around me often. That's gotta mean something, right? 

The point is I've grown up. Definitely not in the financial or career affirming way, not at all! I'm still hopelessly lost there. High fives to anyone who's right there with me! But I am at one with myself. I hold myself accountable to all my failures. I do not blame those who had really nothing to do with my actions. I am an idiot. But I'm an idiot that tries. I try harder for my friends. They deserve the world. I want to try hard for you. A stranger. Many a stranger. Lest we forget that we all want to be validated,  cared for or sought by some stranger after all. I want to love someone I can call my own. This chapter of my life seems to insist I wait however. Wait for love, huh? Yeah, right. That's what my anxieties are known for - waiting.

My purpose of rambling on is to ultimately let my mind purge. Maybe waste some time trying to open up to someone new. Maybe find that one person on accident. Who knows what Reddit has in store for me. Perhaps nothing. But for however long it took me to write this bullshit, I did not feel alone. I felt at ease. Perhaps I'm sharing this feeling with you right now. Maybe reading this helped in some way. Maybe you want to talk? Or call me a faggot. That also is very much an option. 

Thank you for giving me your valuable attention. Open up to me if you prefer. Otherwise, I love you.

lonely,SnortingSmarties94,2018/03/26,"It's so difficult for me to make friends I struggle with substance abuse, depression, and ptsd so I am already a mess. My ptsd and the event that triggered it makes me so distrusting of people. I get so paranoid people want to hurt me sometimes. My depression makes me feel hopeless at times. I know I self isolate and that I want to make friends but I'm too scared or too sad to go and I don't even know where to make friends anymore anyway. I don't connect well with people, my therapist thinks it is a defense mechanism because people always leave me. (For example, I never really made friends as a kid bc I was ashamed of my alcoholic mom and abusive dad, then as I got older and I had some good friends we graduated and they all left and we would still keep in contact but they all stopped talking to me after mom died. Then I made a suicide attempt almost 2 years later and my family turned their backs on me because my cunt of an Aunt thought I did it for attention. So my ex gave me drugs to cope with the pain and so on...) I know that makes me sound pathetic. I've tried meetup, I've tried meet meetme, and I tried my therapy group but whenever I go online most guys just see me as an attractive girl to fuck and no girls really talk to me.

lonely,iDislikeSn0w,2018/03/26,"I've been feeling lonely for years, and I don't even know if I should call it depression now or not I'm a 17 year old guy now and just feel like I don't fit in *anywhere*.  

Apart from 2 ""friends"" who I just sometimes hang out with and joke around with I'm not that social. I literally have 0 friends outside of them.  

Do I talk with people in class? Sure, I've even had a few girlfriends before but it never lasted long. I just want people to spend time with but nobody gives the littlest fuck about me it seems.  

I'm literally that guy in class that people talk too to ask for a pencil.  

I've been debating with myself if I should call this depression for a few years or not, but I kinda always described it to myself ""as a feeling of sadness"".  

I'm not even considering talking to my parents about it right now, one of those 2 friends happens to actually have diagnosed depression and all I got back from my mom was: ""Well now you're not just gonna say you have it too do you?"" (I'm sorry if that translates crappily from Dutch to English).  

I'm sure that if I told them I would get an answer back along the lines of: ""You're just saying that so you can relate to him"" or something along those lines.  

The worst part is that I don't even have friends online.  

I'll be honest, I ""tried"" being part of , ugh, even the brony community but I always ended up being ignored/feeling like people don't want to communicate.  

How do some people even end up with NETWORKS of friends online? I even fail too make myself appealing online it seems...",2.0863114571746384,4.1161981806451635,3.386062291434932,89.82564516129034,78.48387096774194,5.953281423804227,22.30255839822025,6.953978226594392,0.5928587319243608,1196,36,250,13,29,389,148,310,0.113,0.763,0.123,-0.5987,1,2,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,3,2,1,27,21,1,0,10,0,23,2,0,2,4,55,46,18,0,9,21,2,3,2,6,4,1,2,0,2,18,14,0,0,7,1,1,1,10,9,1,1,6,5,28,12,38,33,7,27,0,6,0,1,28,10,1,11,18,170,46,4,0.0,0.0,0.08697546363384524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14832223580399756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934226205136106,0.08332206662469359,0.0,0.0,0.1370669035424713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07584083368708565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18201803487408705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2302958388508655,0.09046241201746068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1578808040659181,0.0,0.0,0.4120745456792928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18026192011146575,0.12734523254889005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3442979537240036,0.08239682429338026,0.04656537613224155,0.0854991018457164,0.0,0.0,0.07128330570519119,0.0,0.0,0.1765002325670881,0.07881504555075101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04898207577628981,0.0726507083122379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08708626927011774,0.0,0.0,0.07887492438765993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059493216547947377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438490729808868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06874052803489293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09352418981814857,0.0,0.060395017609644476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989654051685843,0.19303252880515853,0.0,0.30894850677823715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07611429337731862,0.0,0.14175533575335092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16227643412051526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085413725733273,0.0,0.06861460954759149,0.08814925530088816,0.09977080211396716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16800299697623178,0.0,0.0,0.21491162978066905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05197089054727076,0.0,0.0,0.08516502864428871,0.0,0.060511638828735635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10513927288734737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801362161150039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06331353176667961,0.0,0.0,0.1721853268082211

lonely,WildFlower2807,2018/03/26,"Tired of Feeling Empty &amp; Alone I’ve never posted to here - only lurked. This is sort of a throw away account also. 

I don’t really know how to start this so here goes. I’m so lonely it hurts. I don’t make friends easily. It takes a bit for me to warm up to new people and I’m certain that’s part of the problem. It also doesn’t help that I have RBF and I don’t always look approachable. 

I have a husband who ignores me. In all situations, I am an after thought to him. It’s been this way for years. Once we were married, he took that an an invitation to quit trying. As long as we look good on paper, right? 

My girl best friend I think has good intentions but is incredibly self serving. If it doesn’t directly affect her, she doesn’t care much. If I told her any of this she would interrupt me, brush me off, and then change the subject to something centered around her. I cannot talk to her about how I feel. 

My boy best friend isn’t much of a better option. He’s a good guy but emotions aren’t really his area. He’s also busy all the time with activities I cannot physically participate in. He doesn’t have much time for me now days. Also, I feel sometimes like he uses me. I’ve taken care of him like a brother for years. He’s currently living in my rental rent free. I feel like when he does make time for me, it’s out of obligation. 

Any suggestions for a 34 year old female to meet new friends? It would be nice to have just one person I feel like is on my team. I am slightly introverted but everyone deserves to feel like someone genuinely wants to spend time with them. And that’s all I want, just time. I’m so tired of feeling empty and alone.

lonely,Yellow-Head,2018/03/26,"I don’t understand why I feel so alone and sad, when I shouldn’t. I have a couple of great friends. I’m always around family. I just don’t get it. I’ve always been an anxious person. Always self-conscious. Hives when Im nervous. But At some point, something changed. I’m not sure what but I feel so crappy. I’ve never had much love for myself, but lately my self hate has been affecting me more. I cry so much about my failures, how I disappoint people, and about my existence in general, the way I look, talk, and think. I don’t understand the sudden hate. I dread everything like classes, socializing, even just going to the store. I just wish I can avoid everything and have no responsibilities. I have tried little things to maybe fix it. Like hanging out with friends more. Positive self talk to boost my confidence. But it doesn’t seem to be working. I just feel so restless all the time, I can’t sleep well at night. I get so lazy and unproductive. I can feel myself on the daily becoming irritated with little things that shouldn’t irritate me. I’m so frustrated with myself. My heart just feels so heavy.",2.1934722222222227,4.785004365740743,3.4348148148148177,86.4666666666667,81.73148148148148,6.933333333333335,22.425925925925927,8.07648339933343,1.3797537037037042,877,29,172,18,24,284,121,216,0.28,0.5870000000000001,0.133,-0.9907,0,2,1,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,0,1,20,17,3,4,7,0,17,3,2,2,3,40,37,19,0,3,10,0,5,2,2,2,0,0,0,3,7,10,0,1,9,0,1,2,10,9,1,0,3,6,28,8,17,31,6,19,0,2,1,1,9,9,0,2,9,111,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163250125754844,0.0,0.0,0.2803665456775562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1268845752872627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09998463061186774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12404367452937355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1188149342354809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242749934891063,0.12337333162397275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07418334579662396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018839056426519,0.0,0.10588108229617543,0.0,0.28395052380885794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17354939389669646,0.0,0.11736045359712514,0.0,0.06383150186423599,0.0,0.0,0.1238282641683088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22177665877786712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13309443935115253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12132004176074185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12669680569830366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10974338567133153,0.22513932724362493,0.0,0.0,0.09431675463830708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1013691475062002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11283604232270088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16512966992638425,0.0,0.08662465785490679,0.0,0.0,0.10540051289686797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0778654440386736,0.0980695852851816,0.0,0.0,0.10617447586606256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224783679628197,0.3515087668666646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11239663915173118,0.11449153475551192,0.0,0.08646597932577828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585605426450727,0.0,0.0,0.1805499310813264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14923488986993474,0.07196725410082852,0.0,0.0,0.06549208655753892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0762548697199149,0.0,0.0,0.2338488476335931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08915083685753909,0.0,0.0,0.1009851466259528,0.0,0.10134729285271092,0.0,0.1291573122149707,0.0,0.0,0.08176704076102073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,BeTheMonster,2018/03/26,"Don't know what to do So... In 2015 I was diagnosed with depression, and since then I've been fighting against it. Now I really have more good days than bad days, but I feel like the bad ones are getting worse.

I moved to a small country city and I have no social life here, I was in a relationship so things were a little bit better. But in October we broke up and since then I couldn't even find a date.

Moving out of my home town made me lonely, but all this rejection is making everything worse than ever. My best friend said I'm not trying hard enough, but I can guarantee this is not the case.

Finding a relationship when you are a transgender is hard, but something is making it harder. I'm using tons of apps, I'm subscribed to a few subs to help me make friends, but every person I start to talk, goes away in the next day and I keep thinking what I did wrong.

When I found a girl who's into me and I'm into her, we share compliments and normally I hear that I'm good looking, funny, caring... But apparently this is not enough, I keep being rejected, over and over again.

I'm feeling lonely and hopeless.

lonely,Nalv03,2018/03/26,"Lost and alone First time posting(on this account anyways) just wanted to get my feelings off my chest. 

Backstory:
I’m finishing up my freshman spring semester in college. It’s been a wild year, losing all my friends at home from distance, just to make new ones at school. It’s comforting to know I still have friends but disheartening to know that I don’t have much to look forward to over the summer

Anyways, about 90% of my friends, and all my of close friends, share the same friend group. They are also all girls living on the same hall, and I’m the only guy in our friend group. Recently I had a falling out with one of them (nothing romantic related, just dumb stuff) and now she will not speak to me. She was the first friend I really made on campus, and is the reason why I am in the friend group in the first place. Ever since this happened, I’ve been forced to somewhat avoid the rest of my friends because I don’t feel comfortable being around her. I would say I’m a reasonably genuine person and so I honestly just can’t make myself behave like we’re still good friends when we aren’t. 

So anyways, I’ve been left to sit in my room for the past week or two playing video games or working on homework. It was fine for the first week but I’m really tired of it now and it’s starting to affect me mentally. Exactly a year ago March 27 (tomorrow, as of writing this) was the day I reached the lowest point of my life, and while I don’t feel nearly that alone at the moment, I certainly feel somewhat similarly. I just feel alone and without direction, like I have nowhere and no one to turn to.

lonely,Addisorousrex,2018/03/26,"What do you say to someone that is always on your mind, the only person who you believe is worth your time, that they mean a whole lot to you? There’s this girl. This girl is getting over a faulty relationship. He ex cheated on her multiple times. Her and I hung out a little while back. It was magical. I was just getting off this wave of watching romantic comedies/ romances and that day was everything a perfect plot of one of those movies needs. Now she’s ghosting me and not ever talking to me anymore. It was odd that the day after she wanted to get lunch, but it didn’t work and we kept trying to figure out a good day. It was just this slow journey down a hill to find a box with nothing inside it. 

I thought we clicked and had a good time. It’s not necessarily love but I felt like I had a new friend to hang out with, laugh with, and just have a good time. She made sense. She made life make sense. Or at least point me in the right direction life wants me to go. 

I don’t know how to talk to her without coming off creepy or weird or annoying. If anyone has some advice it would be appreciated. I’m just lost and I’m trying to find the right people to help me become found. That was kinda cringy lol. 

Other than that I hope everyone who sees this or even reads this an awesome day, night, afternoon, or whatever you want it to be. Life is cool there is just a bunch of shit making it not cool right now. Eventually it will be cool.

&gt; The half life of love is forever.. I know I shouldn't be sending this.. I know that what happened, and how I felt.? Well.. That may as well have been in a whole-nother reality.. A whole-nother timeline, or Universe, or however you want to define it. 
&gt; 
&gt; For me it was love. For me it was pure, unadulterated perfection. I felt so fuckin high when I was with you. I can try and lie to myself... I can be angry about how things turned out... But I always arrive at the very same conclusion. 
&gt; 
&gt; I love you. I love you. I love you. I miss you. However, for you.. I have to accept it was something different. Because, if you felt the same.. Well, I'd be next to you right now. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, I know in my heart of hearts, that it must have been something different for you. I still think it was ""something"" though. It meant something to you. And now I know in this same dying heart sometimes.. 'Something' is all you will ever get in a lifetime. 
&gt; 
&gt;  I hope you're well. I doubt you will get this email. I doubt this account still exsists. But I feel so alone.. I miss my brother. So, I had try to send it either way.. Should it find u? I hope your heart has found it's home. In these situations I suppose someone has to lose, and in this reality it was me.. 
&gt; 
&gt; So, I just push forward. Day by Day. I imagine you happy and it makes me happy.. But I would be a liar if I told you I didn't imagine how our lives may have turned out.. 
&gt; 
&gt; A small homewith a wrap around porch where we would sit and complain to one another about the mundane things in life; the price of fuel. Work. Mortgage payments. Bills. But it would just be an excuse for us to talk, to be with one another.. 
&gt; 
&gt; The joke, as they say, would have been on everyone else. Because we would of had one another, and that was enough. Love was enough. 
&gt; 
&gt; And we would have birthdays for our kids, and Christmases. And while we set out presents with the children in bed, I would surprise you with an overpriced piece of jewelery that I had saved up for all year, secretly.. You tear up and become speechless trying to ask how I paid for it. But before the words found your lips I would say not to worry.. And kiss you deeply. We would fall asleep next to one another and never know lonely.. 
&gt; 
&gt; But hey, that's why dreams are dreams.. because they give us hope. Even long after they die with barely a soft whimper.. 
&gt; 
&gt; Even the dead have to dream. Even though you're long gone. Even though I am now certain I don't cross your mind nearly as often as you cross mine.. I hold onto it's ghost because to me, it still feels of hope... Like you were just here yesterday.. And sometimes kiddo.. That's all someone like myself can ever hope to get.

No one will ever be able to understand or care about me they way I want them to so deeply. They have their own problems to solve, their own way of seeing things. No one has any obligation to help you. We are born into this world alone, and will die alone. It makes me feel so lonely.

lonely,SolidusTheSnake,2018/03/27,"So a girl I used to like messaged me I had spent the past ~2 days straight coding with no sleep. My phone had long since died so I took a break to charge it. Upon booting I saw a SnapChat notification from a familiar name. So I had to do a double take. Yep, it was her, alright. What could she want? I haven't heard from her in over a year.

The message went something like ""Hey, what are you doing?""

So I replied with what I was up to, and asked her whats up with her.

I don't remember the last time I felt so happy. Like, for once in my life, I actually had something to look forward to. Like, I didn't have to be alone anymore. I remember my body shaking a lot. I didn't know how to handle it. A few hours later, I went to sleep.

Waking up, I didn't think it actually happened. Could it have been some sort of hallucination in my sleep deprived state? I checked my phone again. It was true, she had sent it, and she had also read my message. No response.

Its been days now. I don't think she plans on responding. Could it have been a mistake? Wouldn't she have had to scroll down a lot to find my name? I just wish I knew why she sent the message in the first place.

God, I just feel like shit.",0.3010714285714293,2.3319237896825413,2.003968253968253,97.3188095238095,84.91269841269842,5.003174603174603,20.047619047619047,6.238725200709706,-0.16529999999999978,913,27,220,8,27,298,126,252,0.084,0.779,0.13699999999999998,0.8992,0,1,2,0,0,0,41.0,0,1,0,2,11,12,1,1,15,2,31,7,6,2,1,32,52,9,1,7,2,0,2,5,0,1,1,1,0,1,13,5,0,0,9,1,2,7,9,4,0,1,26,5,40,8,29,21,5,34,0,1,2,0,26,14,1,4,18,149,53,1,0.0,0.0,0.23617473440570802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12532887094523368,0.0,0.09677088550859457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12000845150651142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11312711731015185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13441376382128206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28984761535455345,0.0,0.0,0.1560816398469442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12558827857853014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06118580650086582,0.08644888230111053,0.11618765507946904,0.0,0.11060007022777528,0.10293022754263814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10700789436711312,0.12881637315402888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11916952891119012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06650340368294318,0.0986385184002196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08547226356143756,0.2955945225230517,0.0,0.0,0.10708919240113693,0.10161711663144804,0.0,0.0,0.2057551168398933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12887067821220838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551682106660716,0.0,0.0,0.12642869126028322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1210417866896823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27415930586479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124214040536298,0.10009992829880662,0.0,0.3632892936190595,0.0,0.0,0.18631734180199092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909837382627056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550754133060195,0.0,0.0,0.07056134430914064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13444549585659227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10451295776209303,0.0,0.0,0.07137426698383187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2243531846961832,0.10919183678010723,0.0,0.13915442393543118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779258542744292
lonely,sadepagy,2018/03/27,"I just need to say things because I have no one to talk to Okay so I have exactly 2 friends. One that lives in another country, we don't have the same first language. The other one is my ex.

I had a bestfriend since I was 10, and we stopped being friends lately. Probably cause she has a boyfriend and thats all she cares about. 

I was trying to make plans to see her every. single. week. She ALWAYS had a reason not to come. I felt so fcking annoying everytime, but I kept trying cause she was my only girl friend left. I saw her ONCE in the past 6 months because I gave her tickets to go see a show. 

I went through a breakup, I texted her to talk and she answered me a shitty two lines text. But I had to listen to her tell me all about her meaningless fights with her boyfriend. So yeah, I stopped talking to her.

Now I have those 2 friends, I can't really go talk to them cause we are not that close. I feel so lonely. Tomorrow is my birthday and I have nothing planned. I go to college everyday; I talk to no one then go back home. I'm tired.

lonely,lipmystockings_,2018/03/28,"no one at all I’m 18. This is supposed to be like the zenith of my teenage years, and I’m squandering it. 
I lost all my friends years ago, when I finished secondary school and now I’m here. Alone. 

I’ve tried r/makenewfriendshere dozens and dozens of times using various accounts with no luck. Either, no one lives close, or they ghost me after a while. 

I don’t have a job or go to college as I was diagnosed with epilepsy a few months ago, and  I’m stuck at home all the time l. 

I can’t even drive anymore.. 

All I want is friends to hang out with and share some experiences with, because sure I have family, but when they’re at work, I’m stuck with my own thoughts. I mean, I talk with my cats. We’ve come up with some secret language that we talk to each other with. They’re the only friends I have. 

This is the time when I’m supposed to being have fun before I work for the rest of my life, and I’m wasting it.

lonely,stdev3542,2018/03/28,"Losing my best friend I usually just lurk on Reddit but I've felt so lonely the past few days I decided to write my first post.

I have only one friend, and she's my best friend. I haven't had a best friend or even a close friend for years, but I think she doesn't want to be friends anymore. I'm not even sure she considers me a close friend. Whenever I see her she's always talking to other people and laughing, but I just stand there awkwardly and don't say anything. She doesn't seem to want to give me rides home from school anymore, but that's usually the only time I get to see her all day.

She's the only person that I can comfortably talk to. She's definitely the only person that is willing to talk to me. I feel like such a burden because I'm not social and don't talk to anyone and she has to always keep the conversation up and include me into other conversations and social events. I feel really sorry for her but I'm also hurt by her. Especially when she lies to me that I'm her only friend at some event so I go with her to the event like a good friend, but when we get there she's always talking and laughing with other people and I can't join in and all of a sudden I become the one in need of a friend.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I hate most people and can't make friends. I'm not good at talking and cant hold a conversation for my life. I just stay inside my house all day and play cs go. I don't even want to play cs go anymore but I have nothing else to do.

lonely,monkey_7k,2018/03/28,Females who claim to be lonely wouldn’t be able to last a week living as me Females can never understand the loneliness that men have to suffer through every single day of their lives. They will always have someone who will be willing to talk to them. Notice how nearly every female poster here talks about their boyfriends or ex boyfriends? You can never understand how it is to be truly alone. All you have to do is download tinder to relieve your so called “loneliness.” ,7.896551724137929,8.24846991954023,6.793701149425285,77.34641379310345,62.44827586206897,8.799080459770115,32.342528735632186,8.238735603445708,2.4940501149425294,381,13,63,4,5,115,62,87,0.083,0.812,0.105,0.2649,0,3,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,3,4,0,5,3,0,0,2,0,16,0,0,2,3,9,18,5,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,8,1,13,10,2,6,0,2,0,0,14,1,0,1,5,52,12,0,0.20941534922706792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2168911454343821,0.0,0.0,0.1742503464707748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2138364856005253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13505557575186894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35288292746751176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1707014599143935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3698351800691092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32302805474137203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23842076309060595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17743694582160033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3366402503925503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4360175279486669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16798036141081413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,hella_lonley,2018/03/28,"I moved to a new city 6 months ago Using throwaway cuz being lonely is embarrassing. I’m 17 and in the 11th grade, I moved cities 6 months ago and I still don’t have a group of friends or anything. Im alone In all my classes, I don’t eat lunch cuz I don’t want people to see me eating alone. And I hate it. I hate not talking to anyone every day. I’m not anti social by any stretch (although I do have some social anxieties) and had quite a few friends at my old school, my best friends I still talk too. I’ve made several friends but I don’t have any classes with them this semester so they rarely talk to me anymore besides the greetings in the hall.  I find it difficult to initiate conversation and I especially if I don’t have a reason for it.  I haven’t left my house outside of school and running errands and I just sit at home all day

lonely,PM_TASTFUL_FEET_PICS,2018/03/28,"I have never genuinely been in love and I am not sure how I should feel... This is an alt since people know my real account.

Let me introduce myself. I am a 22 yearold man, I lived in Saudi Arabia for most of my life and I still do. I never dated or even tried to date, online or real life. I was a firm believe that when I finish my studies ill get married to a random woman and just be expected to live on.

I feel like one of my biggest regrets is that I have never experienced teen love (I know it's not like all happiness but I needed to build expectations). not because I was ugly or unsocial, but because it was a huge taboo and I was so scared that I have yet to even shake hands with woman that's not directly related to me by blood.

I have been stuck in the mentality of being 17 and still find myself attracted to people of that age which I know is wrong.

If I could say the closest thing I have had was a girl in an online group chat that I talked to for more than a year (as friends). I grew so attached to her it was kind of harsh but I knew she wasn't interested in dating in general so I wasn't gonna force that idea on to her and ruin our friendship. We still talk from time to time but I avoid her because I am still in love with her and just talking to her hurts.

This whole ordeal has made me grow to feel inadequate and honestly makes me feel pathetic and not worth being loved.

I know this post is a huge mess but I am just venting and  I don't know how to feel.",2.67608695652174,3.6039122802547823,4.3528191636665765,88.17103710883413,74.28662420382166,7.3716975906950974,23.84325671559125,7.7425588080867325,0.9565606757130992,1152,32,259,15,23,389,158,314,0.173,0.722,0.105,-0.9712,0,1,0,0,0,0,23.0,2,0,0,0,16,21,0,3,11,0,33,9,2,4,5,65,54,26,0,7,17,0,6,2,1,2,3,1,0,4,15,13,0,2,13,1,2,3,11,8,0,1,14,8,47,13,36,33,4,34,0,3,0,4,23,13,0,6,19,190,62,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19382111563812932,0.0,0.0,0.11940799974715804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461983033023535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000324595716232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26794420363206234,0.07571519686587826,0.0,0.0,0.09686771960229718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08188319837328434,0.0,0.0553724163899541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11282224585546136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134583728356899,0.1196433612405725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036632714889363,0.2912309660966162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083761156247536,0.14971967456063556,0.10355713975504176,0.0,0.18717213689781945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3826198330198335,0.10028489635147804,0.07074533554105045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680723501589047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07858600698494703,0.2452248509968286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07181769676814292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1469523219294619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150365159935901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2412666464048747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08428296009615467,0.10610876187583866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767129864103611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3385567587384524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09988893761868443,0.0,0.0,0.25555846939716365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07041125190393256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12360058183005498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07195637488565843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832767316937633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11587718175917068,0.0,0.06825040694892077

lonely,Rugbug23,2018/03/28,"The ""lonliness"" doublethink ""You need to be happy on your own""
Then says
""Humans are social creatures, we can't be lonely to be healthy""

""Relationships aren't everything in the world. Buck up""
Then says
""I don't know what id ever do had I not found my SO""

""Sex and emotional intimacy aren't everything you creep""
Then says
""Oh man I've been on a dry spell since I broke up. This lack of touch sucks. I Need to get out there""


At least be consistent, people. Either validate or invalidate my hurt caused by lonliness.

I know I'm not healthy enough for friends, yet I can't be healthy until I have them. 

I know I'm not healthy for a relationship or romantic affection but then you say it's unhealthy for me not to exprience this by now.

What's the fucking answer,  God dammit? Why do people say to accept lonliness then say to despise it?  Yes, I'm lonely; but I'm getting conflicted messages on how I should feel about it from people. Dang it.

lonely,throwemawaybae,2018/03/28,"Truly feel alone I mostly just want to vent, I'll try to keep it concise as possible but I know that's a useless expectation. 

Back in January of this year I found out that I really don't have any real friends. I dropped two of my friends because I didn't feel any connection and then dropped another two because they were an asshole to me and contributed to my self-consciousness/ low self-esteem. One was pretty recent. He kept trying to contact me but I just ignored him. Then he went through my best friend (who was also his best friend) and she tried to get me to talk to him despite me telling her how shitty he made me feel. Basically, it seemed like she was making me feel guilty that I wasn't giving him another chance because ""he was trying to change.""

I haven't really felt that she was my friend for at least a year but this event made me really see that she didn't give a fuck about me since I repeatedly said that I don't want to talk to him. 

Looking back, whenever I tried to open up, I felt she was distant and was just uncomfortable, so I rarely expressed my feelings to her or anyone else. But I tried to always be there for her when she was going through shit (she's had a lot more difficulties than I've ever had).  

But whatever, I could just talk to my family right? Nah, they're probably worse. At least my friend has experienced similar things to me, my parents or grandmother (they are the ones I live) don't understand or appear to want to understand anxiety or depression. They're pretty close-minded. Sure, they mean well but they just want to give advice that chalks up to ""don't think about"" or basically shit like ""don't be sad, you've got a lot to offer!"" I feel better staying in my head at that point. 

I've tried therapy for two years. This included four therapists; two were one-on-one, the other two were group therapy. The group therapy was terrible since I was anxious going every single time and I felt that I wasn't being tactful enough (or I would say something stupid) and that I always shifted the conversation to be about me. The individual therapy was decent at first, but then I just felt like my problems were stupid, I rambled, and I just eventually lied saying I was getting better just to end the sessions. In short, I hated therapy and have no desire to continue.

Another issue I had with therapy was that I didn't know my therapist(s). I couldn't help to shake the idea that I'm just talking to a service worker and not someone who truly wants to listen. 

Like, I need a friend that I have a bond with to not only trust, but that I know *cares*. The problem is, I hate talking online and I seemed to forgotten how to make friends. The friends I used to have were all childhood friends. But I didn't make any friends all throughout college besides one who ended up just as bad (probably worse) than the friends I just dropped. The best I can hope for is when I eventually get a job (I'm in the process of finding one) I can maybe get friends through work but work friends are rarely ones that you can open up to, they seem predicated on whether or not you're useful at the job you're in and to make the *workplace* enjoyable. 

I can just hope that whatever job I get, it might break the monotony and I can get by without friends because I'll have something to occupy my mind.

lonely,aquastorm404,2018/03/29,"Ready to make friends. My girlfriend recently broke up with me and before I met her and even during I’ve never really had other people to talk to apart from family and a few work friends. My older brother was my best friend until we had a falling out a few months ago and haven’t spoke since. 
My girlfriend was my best friend and we’re still on talking terms but it’s not the same. 

I need new people to talk to and try and take my mind off the break up. 
I love games, films, YouTube. I’m open to talk about anything. :)",3.1290887850467293,4.2975255887850485,3.6318574766355134,92.84629088785047,73.48598130841121,6.471495327102804,22.72079439252337,6.6274283507984215,0.3655056074766354,406,10,90,3,8,127,72,107,0.028,0.753,0.219,0.9676,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,1,0,0,3,3,8,0,0,5,0,5,1,0,1,1,18,12,9,0,1,2,1,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,0,2,11,0,0,0,2,0,1,3,1,0,0,6,1,12,7,15,6,6,18,0,1,0,1,17,7,0,0,9,56,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419718462784455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13179772692801214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13628404666804764,0.0,0.3361552959443745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057839234464198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15098424294246954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4949557235790297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1445503168463551,0.0,0.1069077950000617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16171556737307805,0.0,0.1278378866392993,0.0,0.0,0.1187563343981192,0.1235249782372689,0.1546831662340461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22206903942807585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10260235848271627,0.0,0.15813831033103865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13248569889199946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12790368538888972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12042010775031706,0.5149209673051064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10873787390208677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11659811629442232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,Tanniiee,2018/03/29,"Ms Lonely It has been exactly one month since I broke up with my boyfriend/best friend of 7 years. He broke my heart and my trust and I never thought I would live through 24 hours. 
I'm currently feeling extremely lonely and lost in this world. I met him right out of school and moulded my life around him. Now that he's gone I feel like an empty shell. I will never take him back but some days it just feels like it's the easiest thing to do. I haven't even told my family yet because I don't want to hurt them. 

I don't know how to be me anymore. I'm determined to pick up the pieces but at this moment, sitting in our big king bed I feel so low.

Any advice for a lonely, ""poor me"" newly single gal?

lonely,miji6,2018/03/29,"Feeling lonely..... Feeling lonely...

So I'm a college student in my second year were almost at the end of the school year and I'm just feeling so exhausted and lonely at this point. I really enjoy my program and am super grateful to be surrounded by such great people at school but it's getting to the point where school is basically my whole life right now. I went to high school in a small town, being a fairly quiet guy I didn't have many good or close friends, I'm now in college and making fairly decent friendships with my classmates but that's my only social life I don't have friends outside of school like many of my classmates. It's quite embarrassing to me that they are pretty much my only friends here and besides school I've really got no social life. I've barely got hobbies anymore, when I'm at home for the summer I've got lots I can do but here I just feel so limited. This is not to say I'm not entirely happy with where I am i just feel so stuck in a rut. I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting just wanted to get this out.

lonely,Human_80,2018/03/30,"i feel truly worthless Hi, this is my first time making a post of my own but i have been part of the subreddit for quite some time.
I’m not sure if I’m venting or asking for help… here is what’s on my mind:
For most of my teenage years and all of my adult years, I have had only one friend. He was the kind of friend that is with you for the good and the bad, a real friend. He’s always been the kind of person that feels superior to the rest, but i was ok with that because it was something that he shared only in private and was not actually rude to people irl. Now the problem is that he is doing it to me and I feel truly worthless. Anything that I accomplish has no value in his eyes and if we are doing or playing something even when I do things better than him, he finds the way to make me feel like garbage. We joke busting each other’s balls all the time, but a few months ago he started to mean the things he says. And this week it has been even worse to the point I don’t really want to say anything because he might turn it against me.
I feel so alone right now because I have no one else to talk to. 
That’s my rant I guess.. Thank you if you read the whole thing I hope it made you feel a little less lonely if you are going through something similar.

lonely,aloneon_theinternet,2018/03/30,"Groundcontrol to Major Tom- is there anyone out there to listen I write this as i weep and listen to the Weeknds latest album. I took a quiz and it says i'm severely depressed - but i've been feeling this way for the past couple of years - i just feel it more now, i dont know why. I am so alone these past couple of days, i live in a house full of people (my family) but i feel so detached, speaking with them is vexatious - when i go to work i am in a bad mood - i am not motivated to complete my tasks - getting out of bed.... its so difficult so i force myself to go back to sleep.

i went out for an event - and felt awkward and flittish - people looked at me and averted their eyes (or did they? idk i just felt like they didnt want to see me or acknowledge me) 

I came home and looked at wsocial media - wondering how, how can people be so happy and inclusive in all their snaps and instas, i'm just a shell of what i used to be and i know its only going to get worse.

Just needed to talk to someone- because i cant tell my family or my two friends.",0.9882396035337244,2.8052918144796415,3.037362637362637,92.03025641025644,81.08144796380091,6.019478560655031,20.47856065503125,7.07126945348624,0.3731329885800472,805,22,181,10,21,272,127,221,0.155,0.7759999999999999,0.069,-0.9373,0,1,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,5,2,16,9,0,1,7,0,13,2,2,4,1,42,39,23,0,2,10,0,5,1,1,0,0,4,2,0,8,14,0,1,10,0,0,6,4,5,0,1,8,13,31,3,29,29,4,25,0,2,4,0,13,9,0,4,10,123,39,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13457205508079756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085261542840728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09991094139313583,0.1084891539873644,0.07920633504383336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14860945837409806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13623293930167255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2875381811479186,0.0,0.08379644241653876,0.0,0.11191164540257928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228124704200194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24497972574091595,0.0,0.19709504267844866,0.0,0.2495133228463453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003864004723406,0.0,0.13576991806066824,0.0,0.22153282930074675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13831676558362718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13033402535345354,0.0,0.0,0.14992596416824913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14281625033376874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06347900857406867,0.0,0.11473377606863633,0.0,0.21822304969865552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09634414050058583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09882038089337578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480727048778268,0.2702388572860941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10332843798597116,0.0,0.0,0.10354028080267133,0.0,0.0,0.1467880181262041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13002746683571814,0.0,0.11009234332111968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10443573025424743,0.11356771995786165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14436104416582993,0.0,0.0,0.126926276729519,0.0,0.0,0.11222093842019357,0.0,0.0,0.07663822162809532,0.10313526783680206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204497770576753,0.1172448914820841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14090747948643995,0.09459323037636114,0.0,0.1324134698385364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367299788585149
lonely,BabyJo32,2018/03/30,"Being alone and in your 30s in literally the worst. Everyone else my age is settling down, and I'm too old to be going out in town with my 22 year old workmates. 

If you are lonely and in your 30s, it is a kind of isolation that I didn't feel when i was alone in my 20s. I didn't feel like such a failure. I feel like the person 20 year olds look at and think 'i hope I'm not like that at 33'. 

Lonely 30+ year olds are the kind of lonely everyone is trying desperately to avoid being.

I pretty much cry every night once my kids are asleep.

lonely,CGYTN,2018/03/30,"After a ten year relationship with five years of marriage, my wife left me. I've never been so unhappy and lonely Firstly, I'm a 33 year old male.

Last week, I got home from work to discover my house empty. I found a note my wife left me to explain that she was unhappy and that she was staying at a friends house. I don't want to go into a lot of detail as this still really hurts me. She didn't cheat on me, I didn't cheat on her. She was just unhappy and ""felt distant"". She won't even give us a chance to work on things. She's now living at her friends house. I have been left alone in the house which we've lived in for nearly six years. I used to miss her if I wouldn't see her for a day. I've always had a problem with loneliness but it's not been so bad when I was with my partner.

Each day I come home from work I have to relive that evening, coming home to an empty house. It's almost torture.

I don't have any friends. She was my friend. My best friend. I have work colleagues. My family live miles away and because of my job I can't always see them as often as I'd like. I keep in contact online but it's not the same. When I speak to them over the phone it just upsets me that when I get off the phone I'll be back to on my own.

I've never been this lonely and depressed in my whole life and I just can't cope with it.

I'm just reaching out in the hope to make friends somehow.

lonely,volatile_dream,2018/03/30,"I am completely alone in this life, I literally have no one, no family, no friends, etc Well, I have a family, but we do not talk or anything, I have no friends because I hate the world, and I hate the world because I have no friends

No one to play PS4 with, no one to argue with, eat with, laugh with, play board games with(I play monopoly by myself on my laptop with computer players, which isn't any fun)

I'm not suicidal or anything, but I'm fairly certain that if I died tomorrow, no one would know for like a month

I have 3 contacts in my phone, and I still talk to 0 of those, old work buddies, and they've long since forgotten me, I'm in school, but with no drive to finish it, everyone already has their own friends there, I'm pretty sure I'm like the oldest person in all my classes, I also don't have any teeth(getting dentures in the next couple of weeks), every time I try to make friends, I always seem to gravitate to the people who don't want to put in any effort to talk to me after a few days

To get a glimpse of what my life is like, its kind of like that Spongebob episode where he draws faces on his fingers, link for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4zsj5LdPNo

and the sad part is, to know who I am, if I didn't say anything, no one would ever know or even think this is the way I felt, on the outside, I act like everything is cool, on the inside, I'm just empty.

I feel like I just needed to vent, I don't expect anyone to talk to me, I gave up on that long ago.

I like video games like counterstrike and kerbal space program, and sports like airsoft and hockey. 

anyone can talk to me, I’m a very friendly person

lonely,Infinity1007,2018/03/30,"25/M- To all introverts, heed my call! Feel alone? Have no one to talk to? Yeah I know the feeling, still do matter of fact. I got no job( even after getting a stupid college degree) still live with parents, no girlfriend or that many friends for that matter. But am I unhappy? Nope, cause I know my best friend is out there somewhere and I've started searching for him/her. I'd like to think that my best friend would be around my age, loves all things nerdy (Games,Movies,Comics etc.) has a fun personality but is dug in deep beneath tons of shyness. So if that sounds like you, i think its time we chat and develop a genuine friendship. I'm an introvert and i hope to be a loyal friend (maybe a bit too clingy :D ). Who knows maybe that friendship can grow into something better, something akin to family maybe, I think a bond like that is where true happiness lies. So if I haven't bored you, send me a PM and lets see what happens.",1.9474480796586064,4.266727659459459,2.4949359886202025,94.51751066856329,80.51351351351352,5.408250355618777,22.16927453769559,6.5966054737557815,0.3579189189189189,727,23,155,7,19,224,126,185,0.083,0.594,0.32299999999999995,0.9947,2,1,2,0,0,0,34.0,1,2,0,3,9,18,1,0,9,1,13,1,0,1,4,31,29,11,0,4,5,1,2,3,5,1,0,1,0,1,10,9,0,0,8,1,0,2,5,2,0,1,1,4,16,16,17,24,7,15,0,0,1,1,16,7,0,4,9,93,26,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336626922985132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11488685554521146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2708718041804206,0.11413920071084464,0.14089530256388005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178020854551484,0.0,0.0,0.13257566293596604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14393112104713596,0.08524001419259733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12166214479455705,0.0,0.13050878964568893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3988321809972692,0.0,0.06742623039471939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1032175619096426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11412345096887826,0.13738209813939306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12818134178568802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12806778073005373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21277676682720725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1319681064654625,0.0,0.18915015867200954,0.0,0.11395846929513775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647772797696095,0.0,0.0,0.13084213390399801,0.388961123783443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745142228586987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14330098378360295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11268638198779445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284061341799262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19870662952065413,0.0,0.0,0.0913462260109631,0.0,0.20612795598107397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10373001192233314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085738813705022,0.2480808742884737,0.0,0.0,0.07525336485863231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09167740356869368,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Sand_Tee_Bear,2018/03/30,"The story of me f***ing up my life with the girl pineapple. I really don't know what to say so here I go.(also my since of humor is weird  =/ ) 

I really don't cry over being lonely anymore i just sit and stare at my life over and over and see how much I fucked myself during high school. I don't have a lot of hobbies and i considered myself a minimalist. I don't like emotions but i still need human connection in my life. I sometimes feel like if i would just go live in Wyoming in the middle of nowhere I would feel happier than being in a city. I just want someone i can spend the rest of my life with. This one girl(lets call here Pineapple) Why pineapple you may ask? because its my damn story ahhahahaha). So Pineapple was the one person in my life besides my best friend and family who I've known for over a decade.(I'm 20)  Shes would always bring a smile to myself like right now as i type this(wow). Then one day i did something incredibly stupid. I left the state i lived in. Not only that i stopped talking to her. I was so scared of being rejected I ran. Not just one state or 2 over but 4 states over. Pineapple was the person that made me stumble over words/ just not know what to say. I would always be so nervous around her.(also the song Hey There Delilah is like makes me cry on the inside cause its speak to my heart.)


So i'm just lonely I wish i could have someone take all this love and affection i have for other people but then again I Don't deserve any in return.

lonely,mmdumbledore,2018/03/31,Home from uni Im home from uni for another week and im so lonely. I have another week until I go back and I don't have any friends here. I was mostly bullied at school and I used to play on a football team but the captain sent me a weird message where I think  she was trying to kick me out the team.

lonely,surgicalstrike92,2018/03/31,"Did I want that much? I'm rather ugly dude so romantic relationships are out of concern. But there was a girl from another country I used to chat for a while. First month, it was almost every day. Then it got into once a week, then once in a month, now she ghosted me completely. 

That one month year and half ago was best time of my life. I unfortunately fell in one-sided love with her. It would never work, but I just wanted for us to be friends. Now it's all over, I've never felt so lonely and hopeless. She listened to things I've never told anyone else.

I want to kill myself so much but I can't do it to mom and dad, life feels like prison...",1.2416410256410266,3.1708308962962946,2.882222222222225,92.8946153846154,80.77777777777777,5.635327635327637,18.532763532763525,6.67199483983844,-0.10232193732193773,501,11,113,5,13,165,91,135,0.134,0.746,0.12,-0.715,0,2,0,0,0,2,20.0,1,0,0,3,8,7,1,0,4,0,9,3,0,1,4,23,20,12,2,5,5,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,0,1,8,6,0,0,2,1,0,1,4,3,0,3,7,3,13,4,16,11,4,23,0,2,0,1,13,5,0,1,18,77,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12844269031244568,0.0,0.14509368899264513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519374250386009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10131554262583382,0.14846437981736024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520607490346733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15192203442660104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934467543230626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104307915565675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12208220224999992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07326441513238365,0.10351464110470636,0.13912410543906073,0.0,0.0,0.12324954677598042,0.0,0.0,0.11194727403443944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11588758619600555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16030736475560384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20469045871875716,0.07078948876380711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13077544645611255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16970193543070136,0.3469668638021078,0.0,0.2130323361598021,0.0,0.33526112975520106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3086217345781805,0.196372284921608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555654453947609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626331003906197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08449076538185016,0.0,0.0,0.13845555421795686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.174293579229936,0.1251447216616636,0.0,0.0,0.25639249811959475,0.0,0.11622785269299328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10548694078998344,0.0,0.0,0.10293086575318974,0.0,0.0,0.09330909345824548
lonely,tallnut66,2018/03/31,"Heartbreak I am 21 years old and just went on my first date ever a little over a month ago.  We were moving very slowly as neither of us have very much experience.  I thought things were going really well and suggested that take things to the next level.  She agreed with me.  That happened on Monday.  Then, we went on a date Wednesday and held hands for the first time.  The next day she said we need to talk and today she ended it because she wasn't comfortable with taking things to the next level.  I am in a lot of pain now and just wish she would have told me that she wasn't ready when I asked on Monday, or at least talked to me about her concerns before ending things.  I was caught so off guard.  On Wednesday she even suggested that we hang out at her house next time we see each other.  I just don't understand why she would say those things and then end it the same week.  I know I should be fine, but I thought I had finally found someone special and now I just feel more alone than ever.  It's just so hard to go from thinking things are going well and we are getting more serious to this in a matter of days.  I'm not asking for help, I just want someone to listen.

lonely,smashing__,2018/03/31,"A place for people often in solitude to find solidarity Hi. Basically, I am alone all the time. I have shit luck with relationships, and I don't get along with my family. I tried for awhile to make friends within the ForeverAlone community, but I found myself really tired of the constantly influx of incels and really sexist people.  I get that being lonely sucks. There aren't many places that allow a small and close knit community to grow. I want to make genuine friendships with people online, where we can get to know one another and have some solidarity in being alone wherever we may be. So, to solve my issue [I made a server on discord](https://discord.gg/v2C5Vjd). I don't see a rule here against advertising, but if you're looking for something like this too, please PM me.

lonely,AssuageMyRage,2018/03/31,"My situation I have always taken friends for granted. For my whole life I have been in school or college and there's always been hundreds of people  around me. I had lots of friends in college, but looking back I should have treated them much better knowing what it's like to have none.

&amp;nbsp;

When I finished college I moved back home with my parents so that I could begin my job hunt. The job hunt isn't going so well and I have been stuck at home for a while now but the real problem is that my parents live in the countryside, it's very isolated and I can go days and days without seeing anyone but my parents.

&amp;nbsp;

I knew that finishing college would be a shock. But I didn't expect this. The boredom and loneliness is crushing. I do nothing all day and speak to no-one. The days a melting into one another and there is just nothing happening.

&amp;nbsp;

The worst part about this is that the more lonely I get the less likely I am to get out of this situation. When I'm lonely I'm down and have no energy to apply for jobs or work on personal projects. It's a vicious circle and I don't see how it can improve. I often wonder what kind of permenant damage I am doing to my psyche with this kind of isolation. Surely prolonged loneliness and negative feelings will fuck your brain irreparably? I dunno.

I have only about 4-5 friends, I hate majority of people in my life because I think they're toxic. The friends I do have I have to keep it a secret how lonely I am so I dont seem like a drag. 

I started ""seeing"" my ex again. It felt so nice to be wanted and I felt listened too and thats gone downhill again. He says hes not ready for a relationship again and probably wants to see other people. Seeing him on social media surrounded by his huge group of friends, brings me to tears because he was becoming my anchor and now I just watch him be outgoing and not even feel the loneliness. 

I cant tell my friends because they hate him, and would just tell me they told me so. So here I am on easter. Alone. All my friends are at family events.

lonely,prettyisles,2018/04/01,"Between a rock and a hard place I’m 23 and am sick of living my life the way I do now. I have three lovely housemates and a full time job I don’t like much, and I constantly feel that I’m doing things for everyone else and never for myself. I have been single for the last 2 and a bit years, I don’t have many friends and those I do have I rarely see as I work evenings and they have 9-5 jobs. During the day I’m by myself a lot - I’m a very social creature who needs some kind of social interaction or I become very very low. I have anxiety, I used to have depression - I think I still do, but never quite sure as this sadness and emptiness I feel usually comes out as feeling overwhelmingly lonely and isolated. I want to change a lot of things but I don’t know where to start or if I even can. Any tips? I want to just get up and travel somewhere else, this seems to be a common thing for me; I live in a big city and sometimes all I want is to see trees and hills and green. I want to surround myself with people who care about me the way I care about them but I can never shake the feeling that there aren’t many of those around me right now. I need some suggestions to get me out of this horrible, never ending funk. Thanks in advance.

lonely,suckcity3033,2018/04/01,"So I have give up on trying to find someone. I’m officially done with trying for a relationship After a very long time of no human affection, nobody really wanting to be with me I decided to completely give up. I’m ugly, I know this it is a fact I live with my whole life, but I held on to this notion I would someday find someone. I realize being attractive drastically makes a world of difference. I can’t deny what I am. I am never gonna have someone and I’m not okay with it but it’s something I have to come to terms with. So is anybody in the same boat as me?? How do you find ways to distract yourself from the loneliness? I think that’s the only thing that gets me. Is when I see a couple and I’m by myself at a bar or at the movies. It kind of stings because I want that, but I know I have to be realistic with myself.

lonely,outofthemixer,2018/04/02,"Feel so alone/lost on the weekends On the face of it I probably shouldn't consider myself lonely.
Recently started a new job, there are people at work who I get along with.
I have hobbies: I play D&amp;D once a week, bowl in a league once a week, code games with people once a week.

But despite all of the above I have never felt more alone...as soon as the weekend starts, a dark cloud hits me. 

I spend every weekend/day off sat in my room, finding excuses to go out, alone.

Nobody ever messages and asks how I am, tells me what they are up to, invites me out.
If I do ever have plans for the weekend (which isn't very often) it's 95% of the time things I have arranged.
I have some friends that I message from time to time, but everything feels one way, I get the impression that I bug them, or that they are just not interested.
If I hold off on messaging for 2/3 weeks, I hear nothing from them, I'm certain we would just lose contact.

I find no enjoyment in doing things alone anymore. I can't play games, find it hard to concentrate on any hobbies I have tried to take up (coding, piano etc.)

This weekend I went to the cinema, twice, on my own.
After the second trip I felt so low, 
the movie ended on the typical ""friends pulling together"" thing. I realised I was the only person on my own at that theatre. 

It's insane how there is such a glaring contrast between my weekday and weekend life.
I've come to realise that loneliness isn't just about  hobbies/general interactions with people.
It's about the lack of meaningful interactions, and meaningful friendships.
It's about not having anyone to call or hang out with when you need it.

I've never felt so low...",4.686847195357835,5.489912844984803,5.377835037303123,83.14185064935066,69.48632218844985,8.29184857695496,30.1521138436032,8.438071523408619,2.1496857142857144,1302,50,258,19,22,422,180,329,0.08800000000000001,0.8140000000000001,0.098,0.4777,1,6,0,0,0,0,57.0,1,1,4,3,19,12,0,0,20,0,20,2,1,2,6,49,39,16,0,6,11,0,6,0,2,2,1,1,1,1,19,13,0,1,10,10,1,6,9,4,0,3,6,7,36,8,46,30,7,53,0,4,0,0,23,22,0,6,24,181,55,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21653258324820532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11326316614402593,0.0,0.07108709426605861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10367020711324038,0.07309300397380909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09772571460128332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067414866731102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09004727849406001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06741615163924079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09258660415051714,0.0,0.1165836813332435,0.0,0.1891150119457632,0.08807488627036479,0.0,0.09394893376150217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10571164201699984,0.0,0.30110874979759433,0.0,0.28662811768628504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16152630354209752,0.0,0.10922999974780287,0.0,0.05940940682171296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09364244470269886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11781806108386042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1037344337281905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07383586034664337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11694744825050205,0.1141118349140665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775110613079903,0.1612470140602244,0.10096014197513904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1003037420822677,0.0,0.0,0.33397772573605383,0.07083533202368286,0.07950325325553999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21741333231133364,0.0912755570350822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270595005655484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10321527966768616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14798021757600244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07859698938886621,0.0,0.09136782432771777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2083443760214258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828648504389803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07097211322024982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625197045026403,0.0,0.0829746783434718,0.33540531604832186,0.0,0.0,0.09690459643463696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07610241412635152,0.0,0.0,0.07425836139782102,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,ALONE2LONG,2018/04/02,I was so lonely I hired a professional cuddler Terrible decision. All the psuedo intimacy and genuine arousal of close physical contact. But it wasn't real and you can't act on those feelings or urges. I felt more like crying afterwards and spent money I could have used. I want sleep to come quickly so I can stop crying.,4.668196721311475,6.7392781147541,5.804065573770496,75.17986885245901,71.13114754098359,8.814426229508197,31.872131147540983,9.3871,3.2609055737704913,259,12,44,6,5,86,50,61,0.236,0.701,0.064,-0.9008,0,2,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,1,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,0,6,2,2,1,1,16,12,7,0,2,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,1,3,0,2,2,2,2,0,0,4,2,7,1,3,7,2,7,0,1,0,1,2,2,0,1,4,30,9,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2517075835887567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2333008493698352,0.0,0.6419440095142835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14774695256922146,0.0,0.2805613416881652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14275595075572622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3325917418600456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2924146906111938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2442953476356288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523701475296643,0.0,0.0,0.17234929212829667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,souldunes,2018/04/02,"Speck floating in a void For a while now, i’ve been feeling so alone. It’s like i’m a speck of dust floating in a void of emptiness. Lately. my mind physically leaves my body and makes me think about how lonely I am. Like today at a family gathering, everyone was talking and laughing &amp; I just kinda sat back and understood how lonely I am. Everyday I have this “Alone at 2 am in my thoughts” feeling and i can’t seem to get it out. It’s like no matter how social I am or optimistic, i will always feel and be alone. I don’t really have friends, i just have people who I talk to. it’s just a short conversation though. On Friday nights i go to gas stations or fast food joints just to feel social or get out of the house for a little while. I don’t do anything, I just sit there and reflect a lot. I don’t know, sometimes it feels like I’m on top of the world and am OKAY with being alone &amp; other times I am extremely sad that I don’t have anyone else watching out for me or is interested in me. I don’t have anyone to tell this too so this post really is just rambling. Thanks for listening, if you’re reading this, hope you have an amazing day.

lonely,Youngblood__,2018/04/02,"I don’t even look at people anymore. I feel so disgusted with myself. If I could skin my face off and replace it with something else, then that’ll make my day! I was always made fun of for my face.

Now that I realized how much of a waste of space I am, I’m just going to avoid looking at people. That’ll make things easier.

lonely,girlwithlostlook,2018/04/02,Doomed to be alone I am a 27 year old female with a fairly good career and a decent social life. But I have had trouble in the relationship department. I am not the most physical person. I wouldn't reach for someone's hand myself but will not avoid it either. My last date felt I was too sweet and innocent. But I am guessing he just felt different because of my physical distance. We went on threw dates but I barely gave him a hug. I felt he was perfect in every way and now I feel like I screwed up. Is there a solution for this? I feel like I am doomed to be alone my entire life. ,0.9739287984742512,3.1791746446281017,2.960661157024795,90.41413858868404,83.54545454545455,6.037126509853784,20.87794024157661,7.321109707123232,0.6799238397965675,456,14,97,7,13,153,80,121,0.14400000000000002,0.624,0.233,0.9209,1,3,0,0,0,0,10.0,1,0,0,1,4,11,1,1,7,0,13,5,1,0,1,23,22,7,0,1,8,0,6,2,0,2,2,0,0,1,2,5,0,1,5,0,0,3,3,5,0,0,9,7,18,6,10,9,2,14,2,2,0,2,8,4,1,2,8,65,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779688306058311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11123232759994914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906428432262688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15373927226089773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18452514219898045,0.2607139337017583,0.5256009065191058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1530476042409835,0.0,0.0,0.20101183566149425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873781743679154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2577686311533675,0.17829174581864504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914721025335469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15932620872998238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19590503712373009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1860057031058847,0.1546066686681555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14483659536554735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16915198833029804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11750502414937194

Does anyone have ideas about ways to combat loneliness while working retail?",3.4645054945054947,5.666392923076928,4.0352014652014665,85.97884615384619,74.8974358974359,7.021245421245422,23.96336996336997,7.957251820313856,1.2920600732600738,320,10,62,5,7,101,57,78,0.107,0.775,0.118,-0.2047,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,1,3,1,1,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,0,1,15,13,4,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,0,7,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,6,1,15,12,2,10,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,2,5,35,7,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2178982382021992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380662268265949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17279557753223995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20402542321698644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0998399761361614,0.14106301509351787,0.0,0.0,0.18047173035208086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20632581918309054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44580887248868734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09646730757488302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21508809420511307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2071974574291437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2737830510179276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21199446317505768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1797570479670385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22194946098286614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13406005157129594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11646500258684912,0.15673183667671506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4312522101808241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12715555904356526

I made a stupid mistake last night having too much to drink and making a fool of myself in front of a lot of people. This morning, I was cringing as I recall what happened, I stayed in my room ll day, couldn't eat, and can't help but hate myself so much. If anyone can take some time to talk, I would really appreciate it.

lonely,StrangerFeelings,2018/04/03,"Married, but never felt so lonely. I've been married for 4 years to the woman that I love.  We had a child together and all went well.  However, things slowly started changing about  years a go.


It's been going on for a while as well.  Divorce has been brought up, and I don't want to go through with that because of my son.  I work full time in a crappy job for her to spend all the money on yarn and stamps for her reddit swaps.  She barely does any house work so on my days off all I do is clean.  I'm so tired of her constant complaining and being ungrateful.  

A few weeks ago the reason why we don't have relations often any more is because she says it's like a chore.  She said she doesn't like how it feels when we kiss since my jaw surgery that was 4 years ago, but just now bringing it up.

I've thought about going out to find someone even if it's just to hold me.  These thoughts scare me, and I feel so alone even with a wife and child.

It's so tempting to find some one to have relations with as well just to get rid of these feelings but I don't want to hurt her or my son.

lonely,LoudSeagull,2018/04/03,"Just realized how lonely I am welp
I don't have friends and never really did.
Weird thing is that I'm quite confident and want to hang out all the time but I just feel awkward speaking my native language? I feel like if I were talking to people in English I would have a social life and wouldn't be awkward?

Not really relatable I know :/

Really don't know what to do and this goes horribly with my depression.

I have low self esteem and I think negatively of myself, I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror because I think I'm ugly lmfao, I just believe that I'll always be lonely, I literally just want somebody to talk to, I can't even fucking get a girl to be JUST my friend like for fuck sake.

But im just lonely and need people so i chat in a groupchat filled with only my chatting bubbles , so today there was someone who replied but the thing is there were also reads like ""read by 2"" or something like that so i called them out ""this is a group chat yet its seems like a private convo"" and then this person decides to say ""People are busy , Understand"" and so i decided that maybe I'll stop , stop chatting and say nothing and die within the sadness and loneliness *sighs* sorry.. Im just rumbling on now.. Any thoughts? I dont know what to feel or say right now (i know it's not that big of a problem but yeah.)",-0.07334615384615263,2.147291364102568,1.436185897435898,99.2373557692308,89.20512820512822,3.8653846153846163,17.868589743589748,5.148860815047168,-0.7052179487179489,716,19,164,3,24,229,110,195,0.108,0.787,0.105,-0.3779,0,2,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,2,2,0,15,10,0,1,8,2,13,1,0,0,1,41,25,24,1,3,12,0,1,3,1,0,1,4,0,1,12,12,0,2,11,8,0,1,3,4,1,0,3,6,19,5,15,21,2,19,0,2,0,0,23,9,0,4,12,104,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097897155041187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08324803368911217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12500185821819046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12704993981135168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14347228766214218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13652776683917034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06189791850983261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09457938390773843,0.0,0.06395804184113668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820538065347865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39669541498561744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691096185344925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08646703389783596,0.17942088252273825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459694759134896,0.13334844260565906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907709551173385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11746280230215415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09310395330888196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3394752610551372,0.10689015672254032,0.0,0.13437755010701732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11713692434067899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449010670046974,0.13933780816935104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20908759103373567,0.0,0.29205370325699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11144420839461562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372387051709916,0.09424289961484014,0.0,0.13703626312406436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2046928651634532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08132868473075258,0.0,0.0,0.09718574590047857,0.07138257366812062,0.0,0.116037386630378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1274408365256805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,icnirvana,2018/04/03,"Dreams and Erections Hey Reddit Family, I hope every one is well no matter where you are in this world I just wanted to share that as a Internet stranger I care and wanted to share out the love for all you lonely hearts. Each and every single one of us humans want to be desired and love, even animals and micro-organism with out sex we would not exist. 

I just wanted to vent as I haven't vent in a while. I have been feeling lonely for a very long time I am in my mid 20's with no friends and never been in a relationship, my introvert traits tends to keep me away from people but at the same time I can be a extrovert. I have been trying to force myself to meet people but work just wares you out. At the same time it keeps me busy as it numbs my true emotions. 

As a single lonely guy a lot of us guys tend to get horny especially with morning erections, what's the most worse feeling is when you have a beautiful dream, dreaming you are with a girl spooning and having sex it feels so real but when you wake up you realise it was just a dream and you wake up to nothing but emptiness and loneliness. These are my worst dreams but also a big wake up call that if you don't change nothing will come your way. 

Sexual frustration and loneliness is the worse combo. 

Any one experiences the same ?

lonely,xenokv,2018/04/03,"I just need to scream into the void here Things have been pretty awful in the past year for me. I am, was, and most likely always will be a shy girl. However things have gotten so much worse after I was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After the tumor (which was remarkably large) was resected from my brain stem, the right side of my face was left paralyzed. Im scarred, disfigured, self conscious, and isolated because of it. I was shy before but now I straight up cannot talk to people without looking down, mumbling etc.. 
I’m relatively young (17) but I’m already starting to feel hopeless about finding friendships let alone a boyfriend. I’ve been in and out of the hospital so much I haven’t been able to get connected to anyone at my school. Because of my various traumas everyone seems like an alien to  me. I don’t have any friends, I don’t hang out, go to parties or do any normal “teenage girl things” I just sit on my bed playing video games. I feel like I’m wasting away.... Can anybody relate? 

Pm/ reply if you wanna talk, I won’t reply instantly since I’m going to bed now but I’m desperate I just want to have a friendly convo with someone...",2.752515208726664,4.9037434669603535,3.9085336689741967,86.2932892804699,76.88546255506608,6.790769876232432,27.10908328088945,7.793537801064563,1.7188722047409275,905,37,175,14,21,294,139,227,0.133,0.741,0.126,0.3423,1,1,0,0,0,1,34.0,0,1,0,0,9,9,0,0,10,1,24,4,3,0,0,27,40,10,0,5,9,0,2,3,2,2,1,1,2,3,5,8,0,0,5,3,0,3,6,3,0,0,10,4,20,6,32,26,5,26,0,1,1,0,9,14,0,4,11,112,25,1,0.1398737245607964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14486699493679306,0.1543541332333371,0.0,0.11638614388503557,0.0,0.0,0.19023785835146909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09780296043899488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1314159685863207,0.0,0.0,0.17053144846257534,0.0,0.11902223741463187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3122906712558479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14196888611043695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559961768345611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133655337974621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14144871574623605,0.09992581677432463,0.0,0.0,0.12784205022239065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21613218524779115,0.0,0.07307824800793354,0.0,0.15898692211829607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15108762497730366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15197321100029987,0.1430303600981931,0.0,0.2050057095770202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11745870053335335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2056465632584111,0.10371459442830208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13704655206586308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1335252971351134,0.09697082886607804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14230186339001427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11945139651787345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14155967675728484,0.0,0.1273357855504478,0.14591880004273286,0.0,0.0,0.11570499037187773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11851455291297025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09900334217024104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22485040295890066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2787776621277191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250114674919855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13483327907110684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14254327507405085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900740926769542

However today is just one of those days that i need a break from all of it. What do you do when failure is not an option but have no one to give you that small nudge to see the day through?

I'm from Australia and I would like to get to know some people from Asia and Europe as I am looking to travel again to these places. Of course anyone from anywhere can contact me and we can see if we enjoy talking.

I have found myself a bit alone these days and life just feels like going to work and sleeping. So what I am looking for is just a friend . Someone I can become close talking to. So please only people who really want to talk and don't disappear after 2 msgs or less!

lonely,mrpotatovii,2018/04/04,"18yr old, grad early, and have very few ""friends"" (fyi i'm just tossing my thoughts and whatever i'm thinking into this, just tired of this feeling) i'm just fucking lonely man. i'm not even trying to look for a girl, i'm just looking for happiness. i have like 1  actual friend i share somewhat qualities with, but none of it even feels close or tight. i just want somebody to actually have a good close bond with. just being able to talk everyday on the basis and actually have the convos be nice and meaningful and always checking my phone for that certain notificiation from somebody type friendship. like shit man i used to have these when i was young, then i moved towns 2 years ago and lost it all since, and barely any of my buddies message or talk to me now except swiping up on my snap stories to say some dumb shit which doesnt even feel meaningful to me or they even care now. just tired of all this loneliness shit and just trying to make a change for the good of it. the thing that really upsets me with all of this is that i believe of me starting fresh when i moved (couldnt control this part in life i was 16), i feel nobody wants to be friends with me because of my facial looks (i feel ugly lmfao), nobody wants to talk to me or befriend me, when i literally have proper interests and can hold a conversation forever, but get the short end of the stick because of my looks? why does society label me like this? am i mad for thinking like this or is this the truth? (probably doesnt help i have manic depression and smoke pot to ease the thoughts and slow myself down)

idek where i really went with that, i kinda just typed how i felt there, and just want somebody with interests in common with me to talk to me and see if we can actually understand each other, because it all feels useless to me when i dont understand or feel the bond between somebody and i.

all around person, mainly gaming, computer stuff, weed, and just dumb teenager shit in general. make my day :)

lonely,_Temporary_Account_-,2018/04/05,"My friend and I just made a discord group to find and make everlasting friendships. Hello strangers, my name is u/_Temporary_Account_- and a reddit friend (whose name is u/Lissie314) and I started a discord server called ""The Lonely Circle (Alone Together)"", which is pretty self explanatory for those wondering what it is about. Our mission is to help the lonely and the depressed by getting them connected to other people in similar situations. It has already been one week since this server has been created and we are already like a big family. 

Feel free to join us at your own convenience and we can get a lot of discussions going.

lonely,SecurityPractice,2018/04/05,"I want to share movie recommendations/reviews/ memes with someone other than family Doesn't it suck when the only people you can talk to are your family members? There are many limitations and restrictions to sharing your thoughts with your family, the most obvious being the intrusion of privacy associated with revealing your choice of reading matter and films, especially if you have a nosy, suspicious mother. 

I just want someone to talk to talk on Telegram (u can give username instead of phone no. to me) and share details about my day and vice versa without judgement.

I like movies, languages, gaming, reading, history and video editing.",7.268124362895001,10.022649247706426,7.103975535168196,65.70185524974517,65.69724770642202,9.982059123343527,36.881753312945975,10.25414643259724,4.688051172273191,524,27,72,14,9,166,78,109,0.06,0.8220000000000001,0.118,0.5417,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,6,0,1,5,5,1,0,4,0,7,0,0,0,1,20,12,7,0,3,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,2,2,5,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,11,4,16,10,1,3,0,0,0,0,16,1,1,2,3,52,13,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12343216397734133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5412827228714558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18360088041795916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0935045828853356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1940416953453658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14556242612427495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1326872835475056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3828880751750698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3243320547169238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4615015080625226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15194406311661324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22577620877766186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18449529349136407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm really having a hard time adjusting to living alone and having no friends. ,2.54418918918919,5.155634702702706,4.122905405405408,81.97868243243248,80.35135135135134,5.8621621621621625,28.16891891891892,7.1686216300943375,1.9176810810810807,304,14,51,4,8,101,56,74,0.276,0.591,0.133,-0.8959999999999999,0,5,0,0,0,0,5.0,1,2,0,1,6,10,2,1,2,0,6,0,0,2,0,11,12,8,0,0,3,2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,6,0,0,3,2,9,4,6,9,1,7,0,3,0,0,10,3,0,0,3,36,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2232138087730386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33302056337020464,0.0,0.11260034822582388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3861273242364333,0.21278146293189915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486812397705613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1184442014077301,0.0,0.0,0.2282046495003077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19030818200566813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14386132909887334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2988289784090548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27613536805233163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826094671341812,0.0,0.2131548731516552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34645375829399233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12567149369973676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2592441238413105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I was adopted in a good and caring family (but i didnt have siblings) but i couldnt trust anyone since i had severe trust issues.I was constantly bullied at school and they proclaimed me a madman and called me a lot of disqusting things.I was gossiped every day.One day i met a girl who lacked social skills just like me.We got along and were great friends and i fell in love with her.It was true love and she was the second person i trusted in my whole life.Unfortunately,we had to part ways and i was traumatized because of that.I tried to find love again but couldnt. the bullying continued in the middle school.I couldnt pronounce R and they made fun of me sooo many times i cant even remeber.I am now at university in another city,away from all those people.I am finally happy",1.8110317460317449,4.183236703703706,3.266928571428572,88.47182142857146,81.43386243386244,6.742962962962962,22.1484126984127,7.908726449838941,1.1555161904761904,743,24,152,14,20,243,113,189,0.12,0.611,0.269,0.9892,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,2,2,5,17,0,0,8,0,18,3,0,1,2,26,26,13,0,5,4,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,12,0,0,1,0,1,1,7,2,0,1,14,0,20,15,17,9,6,20,0,1,0,3,17,9,0,1,10,91,22,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14316638867349685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954668038539633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12827691963511095,0.0,0.0,0.16645807313229266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13941510154588335,0.0,0.27840827345729435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1475432912047095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17610452916776048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09017852806272524,0.0,0.11503464675013085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12871083190739438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14956484508816975,0.12478836916682315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10548478718315264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11451710959017755,0.1091976331937676,0.15052772930832914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14534154539658967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964370488812774,0.06670295656111425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11607517710115972,0.36967814331846,0.12919049523560852,0.0,0.13842267807920233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15160335096082195,0.14785155560901567,0.13033586400578534,0.0,0.11921504420931694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2763566631103717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15424303272379666,0.0,0.1129412194802299,0.0,0.0,0.4175335300270705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961328654152226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092696707530678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083732629883472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15243382855232568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792255059884639
lonely,SwegFella,2018/04/05,"Watch 'Her' by Spike Jonze, not an ad, it's a legit study of loneliness. I write this directly after finishing the film, and I have that kind of feeling you get after you absorb a meaningful piece of media, y'know, the weird, 'out of body', floaty kind.

It's about a man that falls in love with a computer and... I can't explain it better than the film can.

I'm not going to pretend that most of us are dudes, and that lonely on this board has a lot of different meanings for a lot of different people here. This film, it's for you. It's for us.

I understand that this may come across as pretentious, as arrogant or obnoxious, and I'm really sorry if I came across that way, but this is a film I genuinely think you should see.",4.743605442176872,4.8671602312925195,5.871156462585037,82.06074829931974,69.1360544217687,10.070748299319726,27.217687074829932,9.994966539143718,2.3317156462585023,562,16,119,13,9,188,90,147,0.09,0.862,0.048,-0.5571,2,2,0,0,0,0,22.0,2,4,0,1,2,6,0,0,11,0,8,2,1,0,0,25,21,9,0,2,5,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,16,8,0,0,6,5,0,4,3,2,0,0,1,3,13,4,24,18,4,13,0,1,2,1,11,5,0,6,3,86,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.162814947347471,0.0,0.20448538137795255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2105528951590281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15857947692896288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846751763286477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0930827515096052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618078699679944,0.0,0.10462406877814376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3834082344671763,0.10117248024629316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3130178959456317,0.16615076178573682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.200530813411499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127626631594381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11793443552971655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14669797015006786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20607659732783887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11795910675631345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916468922393852,0.4428814696975247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14612413956435874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Nigra112,2018/04/05,"Getting sick of life (Sorry grammer not perfect im on my phone) 

   Im 17 and i would say im not good looking and im just getting sick of life. Never really do anything on weekends or after school.  I have 4 close friends to which i only rarely see ourside of school. I have two friends i never see that i play games with. 
   My life is a routine wake up, go to school, go to bed. Never had a gf let alone been on a date before.  The only saving grace in my pathetic exist is video games, sleep, and porn. But lately ive been getting bored of video games because i play the same ones and cant afford new ones cause i cant get a job and i am starting to loose interest in porn prolly cause how much i watch. Everyone says it will get better when i go to college but i know there lying and plus i have no idea what i want to do.

lonely,Lashside,2018/04/05,"Didn’t feel lonely for a long time until today I was in a social setting today and seeing everyone interact, their easy going mannerisms and the jokes between them. I don’t go outside a lot so when events like this happen and I’m the loner, it just feels bad man. I felt as if I was looking down on something that I just didn’t have. I miss being laid back like them and having friends that I could joke with. I think it’s worse when you actually had what they had at one point but something just shifted and you became an awkward human being with no social skills. 

I’m normally independent and fine with being alone but it’s like everytime I get put in these situations, it makes me miss it . I wish I could be normal again.",3.2352511415525096,4.964585150684933,4.5111643835616455,84.38994292237444,74.2054794520548,7.0584474885844735,23.81050228310503,7.793537801064563,1.1988557077625566,576,17,113,8,12,190,96,146,0.125,0.736,0.139,0.487,0,3,2,0,0,0,10.0,0,2,4,1,8,12,0,1,6,0,15,0,0,2,0,27,31,14,0,6,6,0,3,3,1,0,0,0,0,2,10,9,0,0,4,2,0,3,4,5,0,1,7,5,18,7,12,18,1,20,0,3,2,0,12,6,0,2,13,81,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.15871471513653562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16844762078814174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12506133133117833,0.13579892095366794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2597121255427582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15541099404514422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644729335442311,0.0,0.15616141688248514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12565647681384245,0.0,0.0849735097609575,0.0,0.18486590944294368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438234069751229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23837537350243784,0.0,0.0,0.143932675177276,0.1365779600408146,0.0,0.0,0.13827205030759215,0.0,0.0,0.10856451374280808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3187084213734829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102101399072127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15374885806662245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16349970402309358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296042773997498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18281594386915676,0.0,0.3315852060180793,0.0,0.2504188596084209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421415359894044,0.0,0.0,0.09483760987268078,0.0,0.30833039041325305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870297837783184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16574565901673996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,ame1832,2018/04/06,"feeling isolated I’m probably gonna post way more back story than I need to, but for the past 4 months I’ve been really isolated. At New Years I thought everything was going fantastically as well, I’d been dating a great guy, was with my friends, was waiting on picking up the keys to my new place and now. I’m just lonely constantly. My friend group have gone through major changes and no one’s talking (I especially feel like no one wants to talk to me even though I wasn’t involved in drama - no one messages me first). I’ve moved farther away from them all, too, so it’s not like I can hop in on last minute plans. 
The guy I was dating broke up with me because he ‘couldn’t be in a relationship’ in January. He’s been in a relationship since the end of February. 
I live with my best friend but other than her I have no one. I’ve started a new job, gone from a really social job where I have to talk to a lot of people to working in a really small place with no one my own age to talk to. I don’t know how to get back out there and speak to new people and it’s horrible. I used to be a really introverted person but over the past year or so I became far more extroverted but now I don’t have any outlet for that energy. I’m aware I’m rambling here but I just feel isolated and alone and lonely and it’s horrible.

lonely,PuddlesDown,2018/04/06,"Invisible I'm in my 30s with no family due to tragedy, but I've fought hard, not only to survive, but to build a nice life for myself, except the loneliness is crushing.  I have a good career, nice car, decent house, and I'm active in my neighborhood.  All my neighbors know me.  We chitchat and get along great, but other times I feel invisible.  When I smell their cookouts, I daydream of them thinking of me and bringing me a plate, but it never happens.  I can't remember the last hot meal I had.  Cooking for one is too depressing.  Seeing their parties and family gathering is depressing.

lonely,Dweebler7724,2018/04/06,Don't understand anything I'm a 16 year old guy heavy into music and playing with my band and am extremely confused and lonely constantly. I have a few decent friends but I've recently pretty much lost all my old ones and have been single for over a year. The world makes no sense to me and I've been smoking alot of weed on weekends and starting to get into psychedelics and such. I know what to do with myself since I have my music to work on but I'm just so confused and feel extremely melancholic at all times. Im really extroverted most of the time too which makes it more painful that I can't share my life with people at all times.

lonely,Clay-mazing,2018/04/06,"Somewhere out there... Somewhere out there, there is someone who is just as ready to start her next relationship as I am.

...who may not be thrilled with nor optimistical about the idea of meeting someone online but is just as willing to give it a shot and open to being surprised as I am.

...who knows exactly what she wants and isn't willing to settle for less but, at the same time, understands that no relationship can work without some compromise, just like I do.

...who knows herself well enough to know all of her best qualities and is ready to share them, as well as all of her worst qualities and is ready to own up to them, just as I am.

...who is just as honest to a fault as I am.

...who requires open communication in a relationship just as much as I do.

...who has so much loving energy in her heart that sometimes she feels like she'll burst just like I do.

...who is just as accepting and adoring of every aspect of the one she loves as I am.

...who will not only be there when she says she will but will truly BE there (and knows what that means) just like I will.

...who is just as comfortable with her emotions as I am.

...who is just as sensual, affectionate and in need of physical connection as I am.

...who likes the idea of her next partner being more than just a partner in romance but also being a true friend just as much as I do.

...who cares as little about age difference as I do.

..who is just as passionate about her dreams and goals, and supportive of her love's passions and goals, as I am.

...who is just as much of a bookworm as I am.

...who is just as nerdy and adorkable about videogames, RPGs, fantasy, sci-fi, cartoons, anime and comics as I am.

...who is just as committed to self-betterment and staying healthy as I am.

...who is just as laid back and chill, and maybe sometimes a little bit lazy, as I am.

...who enjoys a fun night out on the town as much as a quiet night at home just as much as I do.

...who is just as paradoxically introverted and simultaneously extroverted as I am.

...who thinks spending hours in used bookstores, thrift shops and vintage boutiques is as much fun as I do.

...who loves going on walks, bike rides and the occasional camping trip as much as I do.

...who is just as old fashioned about some things while totally new wave about other things as I am.

...who dances like she sings: horribly and as often as possible, just like I do.

...who yearns to travel and explore the world as badly as I do.

...who is just as brilliantly intelligent, stunningly attractive, devilishly charming, Wilde-ly witty, Shakespeareanly articulate, scathingly sarcastic, tenderly warm-hearted, hopelessly romantic, fantastically fun-loving, shamelessly silly, impeccably polite and above all MODEST as I am.
(And whose sense of humor finds the ridiculousness of that statement amusing)

...who is just as understanding of the facts that while these traits are important aspects of her being, they by no means define her, nor do they equal the sum of who she is; and also that it is impossible for two people to have everything in common and that's fine because she is just as excited to learn about what new and different things her future love will bring into her life as I am.

…and someday, hopefully soon, I'll meet her.",3.5205739285184663,5.735384942903753,4.464394483167734,82.90637668693462,74.77487765089721,7.916583123238914,26.31674328933709,8.737016336426894,2.031374812398042,2522,93,487,53,55,816,256,613,0.062,0.6809999999999999,0.257,0.9993,1,0,0,0,0,1,152.0,0,0,4,5,46,48,1,0,19,0,70,10,1,1,8,101,95,89,0,4,32,0,1,7,3,9,2,2,1,2,46,33,0,1,17,9,3,8,8,6,2,2,0,3,54,42,108,79,23,48,0,2,0,7,72,21,0,5,25,396,100,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12294372729220066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05910727781296584,0.06418214536876872,0.04685843997366592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08066894776649712,0.06798410966480653,0.0839207006979577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837275251649978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16062284083195255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08646693004233674,0.0,0.07942590509835197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0647651866707467,0.0,0.06908462207834429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03886711932551093,0.05491500751741772,0.0,0.0,0.07025659009482861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05938855923711608,0.0,0.0,0.07373945182890795,0.04368624798441805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821795355906947,0.0,0.0,0.07710556359123621,0.07634795357483429,0.07570017566231815,0.0,0.0,0.17355078911235294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1689800870050474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05429462904631165,0.2628791141323213,0.15408524308153168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3468849695361871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07722493099056588,0.16746507654540554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4520586543824361,0.05699715965853942,0.0,0.14848051966262024,0.16350144780902567,0.14427211673292312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806607594823352,0.0,0.05208821374251139,0.05846210260460177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05329107099697153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08665789827732727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24758461736816054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06112906759615627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08019080814096659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13026118323030636,0.0,0.15205019993644794,0.0,0.05440805444509725,0.08193179586866371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08722967851227661,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15320442609947635,0.04925435275036127,0.0,0.0,0.044822751318854034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750895407030214,0.16004603448497934,0.0,0.0663898677276383,0.0,0.0,0.04533914497951765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13822836779330086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07409867412452739,0.0,0.055961321844431984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Y3w,2018/04/07,"I let my feelings escalate to fast. I'm such a lonely person, I've been trying my luck at dating apps and forcing myself out there, finally went on a date with a girl who I found to be pretty awesome, we talked and related on a whole lot of things and then there were the emotions, they came rushing in and at first I thought she felt the same way, she was saying very sweet things over text, telling me how I was handsome and how she enjoyed talking to me.

The 2nd date comes around and I felt like it was going fairly well also. We talked and enjoyed each others company eating ice cream while walking around town while it was snowing out, after the date we hugged goodbye, and again I expected her to feel similar, but this time it doesn't feel that way, she doesn't seem to be interested in me anymore, the way she's texting and responding to me is completely different from the 1st date.

I should be ok with this, because hey not all people you go on dates with is going to work out, in fact majority of them probably won't work out, but fuck man we just related so well on so many subjects, I just let my emotions get the best of me, far too fast. 

Guess that's what you get when you're lonely, have 0 friends, and someone shows interest in you, you cling onto whatever comes your way, which in turn causes them you to push them away. Sigh. 

I needa learn to take things slow man, just hard when you haven't had that in so long.",11.3684375,6.140027857638893,10.269083333333338,72.73425000000002,60.35416666666666,13.603333333333332,41.3,10.125756701596842,3.8898391666666665,1125,36,236,15,10,357,165,288,0.038,0.8140000000000001,0.14800000000000002,0.9819,1,4,0,0,0,0,29.0,4,7,4,4,21,18,1,0,11,1,20,3,0,3,2,53,42,23,0,2,6,0,6,1,1,2,0,1,0,4,15,27,1,0,9,1,0,10,5,3,3,1,13,9,39,14,38,22,7,57,0,2,1,2,34,23,1,4,21,164,54,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0883735302460616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959464164510288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19675181627528865,0.0,0.0,0.10382628267637993,0.0,0.0,0.06736489698988861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11597175150574356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12639217367593214,0.0,0.11352257119739315,0.0,0.19038640883380453,0.11586595841870635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1154577610025932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307768509638084,0.0,0.24861415952419386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16762910744328274,0.0,0.21221079452605607,0.12105655427917585,0.0,0.09399839144972437,0.0,0.12116676036697857,0.0853785183124873,0.10216323820301446,0.11547215938499113,0.0,0.1884134168998552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12173746513501145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989938233532566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22600465922990126,0.0,0.053988823889476525,0.0,0.0,0.09779645948209974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09395029272372073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1120381760331812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661261258824133,0.09649167531121287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11242677471119092,0.1191467495982406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788071783903313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060270001887626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09363341155853774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08308856639060984,0.2664674059245812,0.09658921539677397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2202506184240518,0.0,0.0,0.08773132836402255,0.06443833868764988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0750279519232826,0.12020140957515266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09118100615305337,0.0,0.35086570739604794,0.0,0.0,0.1987206523031769,0.10244239705643432,0.0,0.12337868587534008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16090286759810093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm not a crazy outgoing person like wanting to go out every weekend etc despite being relatively young, I don't feel this is a negative thing though. I'm down for socialising, it just seems that the friends I usually make either disappear or are only friends for a short time when it suits them. The other friends only want to know when it's their terms. I don't feel as lonely or paranoid as I used to but sometimes it crashes over me like a wave when it gets too much...

lonely,taaronjones,2018/04/07,"Post Graduation Loneliness Wow, never expected it to be this bad.
After college, I moved to another state to start a career. All my friends are back in Ohio and long distance didn’t work out with my ex-girlfriend.

Weekends have been lonely, and the weekdays are just a grind. My coworkers are simply that, coworkers. They all have their own lives, married with kids.

Any suggestions? I try to workout to keep busy and remain healthy, but the remaining time I just watch TV and it’s unfulfilling. Moving states to start a career was a bad move, but my management has been extremely supportive and I’m not going to quit for at least another year.",3.832787114845938,6.563197705882356,4.440525210084033,80.88891106442578,76.14285714285714,8.336414565826331,28.404061624649852,9.075114841892004,2.821638095238095,513,22,90,13,12,163,85,119,0.098,0.823,0.079,-0.5204,0,2,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,2,2,3,6,0,0,6,0,11,0,0,0,3,18,17,7,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,8,0,1,0,3,0,4,3,3,0,0,4,1,9,3,14,12,4,19,0,1,1,0,5,3,0,0,9,60,13,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12550104841331522,0.3870357526135737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14190837245146734,0.30818485055414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14258369012094793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488461961650426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1640374605447084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1629619659276866,0.1633218794297359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5884457063534824,0.0,0.0,0.14233715364940008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1767488995704597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962927677222664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2612523783953013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20942635433680087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10761320642413587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12529805457954488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13435536869596895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11884483103200973

lonely,KanekiKenmademerelat,2018/04/07,"What should I do? Haven't felt this much loneliness in a while. Someday, I just feel so stuck. 

I've been experiencing existential crisis pretty much since last year. I'm trying to look for my purpose in life, I accepted for a while that love probably doesn't exist, That I'm probably inadequate. I genuinely don't know what my purpose in life is and what makes me happy. Some days, I just evaluate my self thinking is what I am good? would people accept me for this? I don't know. 

And I feel pretty lonely, I have faith that love may exist but I'm not sure. i just feel like I need someone to actually love me, and somehow help me. It's been 2 years since I've been in a relationship which fucked me up as a person and I mean like being in meds for a while, going therapy and trying to ignore people that you did something bad and then experiencing betrayal by people in general and experiencing grades deflating. 

However, I got over my ex. And slowly starting to get better. Experiencing grades increase although math could get better.

But right now, at this moment when I'm typing this, I feel so much uncertainty from every aspect of my life including my grades and the feeling of being loved/intimacy.  I don't know what to belive anymore. 

What do I do? How do i get to speaking to people to not feeling worthless anymore...

Someday I feel fine and confident and speak to people but some days I feel like this and always think about my value as a person and what I'm doing with my life.

lonely,TheLaughingJester,2018/04/07,"Just Lonely (I apologize in advance for the long post) I (M 18) feel so alone and I don't know why. I just feel so unloved despite the fact that I have good friends and a loving family. Really I just want to be loved by someone. .All of this is compounded by the fact that in recent months I seem to have pissed off an eldritch god or a voodoo priest and caused myself to become the unfortunate victim of a curse. (No I do not actually believe I have been cursed but honestly, it feels like it). This ""curse"" manifests itself by causing me to fall for girls that almost immediately get a boyfriend once I fall for them (Two in the past four months). The first time was the worst I really thought I had something with this girl and to be honest it really hurt. This took me months to recover enough confidence to actually want to try again with another girl. The second time wasn't as bad, I didn't really have enough time to fall for her. I just struggle really making connections with people due to the fact that I'm really awkward and pretty oblivious at times. 


I just feel like everyone else has their life together. Lots of my friends are in happy relationships and are going off to their dream schools and I really have no idea what I'm doing. In addition, I lack a passion for really anything. I've never really had a childhood hero and I don't really get outwardly excited over anything.

lonely,HugsForThugs1,2018/04/07,"Loneliness is my new normal. Loneliness is my new normal. There was a point in my life where I had plenty of friends, and there was one best friend I truly loved. She was my everything. Anyway, that friendship came to an abrupt end, and for the past year and a half, I have been lonely. For a long while, this loneliness was called solitude, and I appreciated it. After many months, the solitude has become loneliness. I try to meet people, but we just don't click or I get paranoid that they're only talking to me due to moral obligation. 

I'm not even sure what a friend is anymore. Recently, I've decided I'd go to the internet to kind of escape from this loneliness, even if it is temporary. I've started trying different mmorpgs, and I'm typing this post trying to meet people.

lonely,astralorange,2018/04/07,"If you have a special person in your life - don't let that go It's hard to find good support these days. I try not to count on others too much, partially because I need to learn to rely on myself more, and partially because the vast majority of people in my lives are disappointing. I am always here when people need me, but they are never around when I need them. But sometimes we get lucky and we get that one person in our life that makes everything bad go away. It could be a sibling, a parent, a friend, spouse, whoever it is, when you find them - don't let that person go. I am often so alone and lost in my dark thoughts, but whenever this one great person in my life contacts me it's like..all the darkness disappears. My life feels so dismal most of the time but in those moments of interacting with her, I feel like a totally different person. I am trying to work towards being happy even when she is not around. But when she's here my world is lit up. I understand it's incredibly difficult to even find such a person in your life. I got super lucky. But most of my life I didn't have it so I know how hard it is not to have that person in your life.

lonely,klife7272,2018/04/08,"I’m just miserable Having no one is extremely difficult. I feel this way everyday. It always get worse over breaks or when summer comes around because everyone is out with their friends and going to the beach having fun. While I’m alone everyday with no one. 

There are OVER 6 billion people and I can’t find anyone with a similar personality to me or anyone who even likes me for that matter. 

How much longer will my life be like this. To top things off I have no motivation to do anything because I know I will have to do it alone. It’s especially unbearable when I see people I know from other schools. I was at the store and overheard a few talking about prom.

lonely,nobeingPChere,2018/04/08,"Coming to terms with the reality of not ever being wanted For too long I’ve chased being wanted. I chased with sadness and depression. I chased it with confidence and strength. I found it once, twice, in all the decades I’ve lived. Heck, I’m even married - somehow to a woman that shows no affection towards me; it doesn’t matter how many counseling sessions we go to or what I say. I’ve never been the guy any woman looks at with desire. Even she admitted she got with me because I could get her out of her dismal living situation. Even if I could leave her, I’d end up alone.

I’m not the guy people want to be friends with. I’ve done things to better myself, I do things on my own. I’m not boring. But that doesn’t change the fact that I’m butt ass ugly. I’m also from a conservative, foreign, culture, one that is low in numbers in he states, and while I fancy women of every race, none look at me. This feeling to need to be desired and loved and not getting it destroys you from the inside.

The only reason I have put myself out of my misery, ended this pathetic sad existence, is that I have two kids. They need me. I need them. 

I’m just feeling super sad today and wanted to write it down someplace.

lonely,youngcm6039,2018/04/08,"Pathetic weekend... I’ve been struggling with loneliness for the past year in college, my first year actually. I’ve had a girlfriend for most of the year until a few weeks ago. Despite having a girlfriend, I’ve still felt extremely lonely and unfulfilled because i never took the time to make real friends here. Anyways this weekend has been the first weekend here since my girlfriend broke up with me and it was absolutely terrible. Friday night I sat in my room and played Xbox, today I did the same and the only time i left was to get food. I have no friends here that I can just dial up to do anything with. I’m lucky enough to have some friends to hang out with back home but the lack of real friendship at school where I spend most of my time is really starting to take its toll on me. At this point I sometimes get legitimately anxious just to leave my room on the weekends because I’m afraid people on my floor will see that I’m alone. I’m getting worried about myself and I don’t want to get any worse.

lonely,Computedbeast27,2018/04/09,"Woes of a lonely high schooler I was in the library today and I overheard the boyfriend of a girl I have known since I was younger and used to have a crush on and still kind of do. She’s always been way out of my league. But anyway her boyfriend was complaining to his friends about her and he called her a bitch and shit and I just felt bad. I also felt sad about how I am never going to be with this girl but scumbags always will be for the time being. She’s very sweet, but I’ve never really talked to her. I just feel sad.

lonely,connectedsouls,2018/04/09,"Older lady friends, mentors, or something similar Hello,

I wouldn't consider myself lonely, but could use more people to talk to. I am interested in meeting people that are older than me, preferably late 40s, 50s, &amp; 60s. It would be nice to have some older lady friends, a mentor, or something similar that I can talk to, relate to, show some guidance, and give advice. Looking for people I can connect with on a deeper level. Please feel free to message me or respond to this post if you want to talk and find out more about me. I can find out more about you as well. No hard feelings if we do not relate to one another. I am open to eventually meeting in person as well if we live close or maybe doing some distance traveling. Open to meeting nice, caring, genuine, and overall good people. Looking for people who want to talk and make effort to get to know each other.

lonely,gibsonsg_87_2,2018/04/09,"Lamenting I recently came back from a trip to hang out with friends and aside from the post-travel high/crash, my mind fell back into the hyper loop of negative thought.
I've been single for approaching four years and I live in a frame of mind in which I feel compelled to get back in the saddle, but pull back immediately when I have any opportunity. 
It doesn't help that I know I have no value, like stocks on the market, to women. 

I know that Ill miss 100% of the opportunities I don't take, I know that Ill feel a lot better if I ignore social media...

Sometimes I feel like I'm just waiting to die, but no worries, reader, its more like in a ""Groundhogs Day"" kind of way.",6.535535714285714,5.460743919117651,6.997436974789918,79.49882352941178,65.69117647058823,9.536134453781512,29.72268907563025,8.418075326091056,1.8933836134453768,527,14,111,6,7,173,89,136,0.22,0.607,0.172,-0.8170000000000001,0,1,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,3,6,10,0,0,9,0,5,2,0,1,0,23,18,6,1,1,4,0,3,3,1,0,2,0,0,1,6,6,0,2,7,0,0,6,5,2,0,1,3,3,12,8,19,15,3,22,0,1,0,0,4,7,0,2,11,69,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110048335641556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5025006235727205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14449175619160248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1868572762415163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053632464581582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1695572747839062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2478216611414512,0.11671500761852803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1262229845204863,0.0,0.0853566030113872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950670139901307,0.17261447250497627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17012973943434595,0.2693595935853892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2394500613306132,0.0,0.14426296363398994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13889543386965672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3299240006302416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15646792137004345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16131292999442134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665400598030759,0.0,0.0,0.1615818794011132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12283753614657697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12970136189906328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967933160695133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16591506518268415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052080308411746

lonely,stuffandwords40,2018/04/10,"Life is finally good, and I just want to give up, collapse, and sob. Life is finally good. I went through a shitty patch a few years back and I fought and clawed my way up to being where I am now. I have a car, a good job, an apartment, friends, and I'm even moving to a city I've always wanted to live in soon and will be closer to friends...

But I'm lonely. So very lovely. I'm starved for any sort of intimacy. Any sort of physical touch. I haven't had anyone who wants to get to know me and be with me in years. Everything I try is met with rejection. I've worked so hard, and sure there's room to go up and grow from here but my gut is just an aching void that I can't escape. The more I try to fill it the more it consumes and the bigger it gets. There's nothing more I can do but despair.

I've made it, and that makes it all hurt that much more.",0.4668449197860979,1.9788710855615008,2.329946524064173,97.9502139037433,81.45989304812835,5.683422459893047,19.021390374331556,6.522977012572876,-0.2598641711229943,651,15,165,6,17,216,106,187,0.157,0.7709999999999999,0.073,-0.9385,1,2,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,1,12,13,1,0,10,0,15,4,1,2,2,28,32,16,0,3,5,0,2,0,2,1,2,0,1,0,9,13,0,0,1,0,0,6,2,6,0,0,5,2,14,7,21,23,7,24,0,5,0,1,7,10,1,2,7,102,23,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12885452031116104,0.0,0.0,0.2106179237892332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1082805317858675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11907648243544955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10228245400606116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13917666473327406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3392794208841753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2392862940919886,0.0,0.16181415206167102,0.14855420289002902,0.08800954693342572,0.3896634125503964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13872262951143993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657790249337474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153672978779462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510607790917153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21876200972849275,0.0,0.0,0.1367427258745497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397656718781806,0.14653067832028951,0.10336912518206763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16458987727164132,0.11383867691533878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14859072609291266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459521255789102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21027725619839416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277743247668415,0.274018332456898,0.12291931932380012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14355520588806575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11273869486527585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19944735029311852

lonely,januskanus,2018/04/10,"The Forest of Isolation I’ve always been somewhat awkward with social interactions. Throughout high school I coped through humor and making people laugh at my own expense. Now I’ve been alone for 6 months - I’m doing volunteer work in Alaska while all of my other friends have gone off to college in the lower 48. Humor doesn’t help when there’s no one around to laugh at you. I’ve never had a real relationship with anyone. And the only people that have ever loved me are +3,500 miles away. Every day I feel like a part of me dies. I feel like I’ll never find anyone and I’ve never gone out with anyone that actually liked me (every time it’s been out of pity). I wish I had an SO that loved and cared about me. But I guess I’ll just have to wait a few more months until I attend a college to find someone. I wish girls wouldn’t look at me as a joke - but that’s the only way I’ve been able to interact with them. 

There’s a cute girl that I might have a chance with at my work - but I’m betting that she already has a boyfriend. Even if it did work out, once I’d go back it’d be an instant long-distance relationship.

Any advice would be great",2.9649976754997667,4.137165502092054,4.153186889818688,88.93546141329617,73.89539748953975,6.4826592282659234,22.064388656438865,6.691623216298621,0.3970946536494653,901,21,194,7,18,295,134,239,0.034,0.7859999999999999,0.18,0.9827,1,2,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,1,3,11,16,0,1,14,0,21,2,0,1,5,38,37,13,1,5,5,0,2,3,1,3,0,0,0,2,10,13,0,1,4,1,2,4,6,2,0,1,9,3,20,14,31,22,6,32,0,1,1,2,14,14,0,5,16,124,30,6,0.11581217537107813,0.0,0.11301597705503115,0.0,0.0,0.1131703174128698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11994648655980165,0.12780161537415924,0.0,0.09636500742867277,0.0,0.0,0.07875625062104663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2429356973599774,0.0,0.0,0.10309738968728573,0.0,0.0,0.10880935106481596,0.08905241420140074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11807823126769387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07468927221212346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12019475365074432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07649284958195778,0.10475874299530953,0.1951535053765988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11711623126827242,0.16547248245093008,0.0,0.0,0.2117004603494113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947619940717269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06581872815601246,0.0,0.0,0.1276833321995089,0.12758016795134386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07762645993534982,0.12236192180919665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16973993696211753,0.0,0.0,0.10249013080677948,0.09725305927000627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20905001976322135,0.0,0.0773055263564746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228584164223986,0.0,0.0,0.18488034693718372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2679644677209542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233361870696804,0.07847732727409915,0.1761607561323946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12541330011277546,0.0,0.16057916057902236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13181961008417134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2486778697036445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11720810439248705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11805592821966555,0.09812728036720036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753101079571923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091926314196518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2663565723432045,0.0,0.0,0.2529379289594894,0.0,0.0,0.08226964656997371,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,lovedcraft,2018/04/10,"Therapy groups as a crutch for social interaction? Has anyone here who's dealt with mental health issues been in any form of group therapy? 

Christmas 2016 I was hospitalized for a few weeks following a suicide attempt, in order to be released I had to agree to attend talk therapy &amp; group therapy. I was in a really bad place so I rejected the idea at the time, feeling too shy for it, going to the group sessions but not really participating. Eventually I talked my therapist into pulling me out of the group and only doing solo sessions. A year and a half later and I'm really regretting that... I miss the feeling of going there each week and being surrounded by peers. Feeling like I belonged somewhere, like I wasn't alone. 

My therapist moved away in October, and I struggled with phone calls too much to see the process of getting a new therapist through. I've been trying again to psych myself up enough to do that, so that I can be placed in a group again. I want to feel like I belong somewhere again.

lonely,Ezaver,2018/04/10,"The lack of close friends and memories I'm in college now, and have a decently sized group of friends. None of which I'm super close with. Although everyone seems to like me, and I like everyone else, it always frustrates me when I get left out of things. It might be a small get together, or just a drunken night under the stars, but I feel like I'm missing out on so many memories. I desperately want to have a close group of friends that I can think of as family.
I know this is meant to happen naturally, but it feels like I'm just not the type of person to have that. To have a Friendsgiving or a night of drunken mistakes on the town. I want to make memories, and more than that, I want to share them with others.",5.825273972602742,5.211374232876711,6.317910958904111,82.27152397260275,66.94520547945207,10.313698630136988,31.948630136986303,9.827888789773867,2.678523287671233,562,20,122,11,8,183,78,146,0.08800000000000001,0.7290000000000001,0.183,0.8861,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,1,5,12,1,0,10,0,8,0,0,1,0,31,26,12,0,5,7,0,2,4,3,1,0,0,0,1,10,11,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,1,2,11,9,25,23,3,16,0,1,0,0,8,12,0,4,8,82,21,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14432640341955896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448973353532808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3314826590828029,0.0,0.0,0.16351561233220954,0.0,0.1754056258804758,0.2478290501323915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4020269928888968,0.0,0.18124358022559586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153383503127884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09532497660240467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884566858874613,0.0,0.0,0.3389605870718569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1157809134373204,0.1758536451933597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840057282742585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3255469066372182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15145206245829576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1579046726838359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523415641971425,0.11114138018770296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3069203959552789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,lizpalm,2018/04/10,"Happily in a relationship, good family, still lonely. Does anyone else feel this way? I feel as though I’ve isolated myself from everyone, but at the same time feel very happy in my relationship with my partner. My family and I aren’t always great, and I think I’m struggling with the fact that maybe we aren’t as close as I thought we were, but I can’t help but feel this deep rooted, insane vacuum of loneliness. It feels terrible. Would love to chat with someone if they’ve had similar feelings. Or just anyone really.

lonely,beautyjunkbunny,2018/04/11,"Let's befriend each other, Lets discuss below People here seem to know what's it like to put effort for others who seem tuck in their world. People who don't initiate conversation, checks up, asks me to hang out, keep in contact, try to have deep conversation, maintains plans made, etc.

I don't consider the people on self.lonely to be self destructive people, with social anxiety and issues. 

And if you are, hopefully we can all create an environment where we can understand each other.

I was thinking of creating a discord group for those of you interested. You can keep your anonymity, chat or be on call. 

I'm an on call person. Leave your age, gender, location and what you'd like to accomplish below. We can open a honest discussion below, what have you got to lose? The worst thing to happen, is you block the person on reddit you don't like and continue your ""lonely"" life, so nothing new really. If the worst case scenario is you continue to be lonely, then you've got nothing to lose. 

Maybe you'll meet someone cool from your area, maybe you'll make a nice group of friends online to keep in contact with as the emotional support or shit talking shenanigans you need. Be open to what happens and don't take any ""bad"" experiences as determining factors. 

Only rules are to not be an asshole, or judgemental. Think before you speak and be open to different personalities.  

Me: F, 22, living in Florida. What I want? What I wrote above. Whether its for shit and giggles, or serious convo. I'm open to seeing where things go. 

PM me any ideas if you want. Cheers.

lonely,MuteFawn,2018/04/11,Dreams are so much better than the waking world I had so many dreams last night. The person who I’m in love with who will never feel the same was in most of them. In dreams we can be together. In dreams I get to experience physical touch. In dreams I know what it feels like to be loved. Being awake is painful.,1.7866145833333316,3.750447765625001,2.5825,95.54583333333336,79.15625,6.141666666666668,16.916666666666664,7.1686216300943375,-0.23512708333333346,243,4,56,3,6,76,47,64,0.036000000000000004,0.615,0.349,0.9764,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,1,0,1,1,2,5,0,0,3,0,9,4,1,0,1,8,16,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,4,2,0,0,3,5,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,3,5,4,10,10,3,9,0,0,0,2,7,6,0,1,4,37,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2457959049636265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27185715299938795,0.0,0.0,0.2810474040197289,0.198544689860306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14520069542226416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15273647625534506,0.22654028048434474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13577670696614805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5016637295145182,0.0,0.0,0.2817652525163473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20430172322329251,0.0,0.21434751103511876,0.0,0.0,0.26080723619260865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29572436921095985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426672962949459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,ilovecats2099,2018/04/11,"Feeling lonely So technically I shouldn't feel alone. But I do. I've never been much of a group person and more so a loner. I'm school I had a few ""friends"" but at some point they all more or less used me. 
I finished highschool in June 17 and right after worked for a couple months and came to Canada on a WHV. I was in a LDR with my bf from Toronto and he was basically the only person I really talked to. Aside from my mom. 
I never met anyone new and the old ""highschool friends"" decided to abandon me. I have a relatively good relationship with one of my cousins but we have our issues as well. 
However when I came over in September everything was fine at first. 
But I realized that apart from my bf and his friends who I met now and then, there is no one in my social circle. And I get emotionally dependant on him. Which scares me because I don't want that. And I already see how it makes me crazy, it eats me up. I get moody, jealous. That's not how it should be and it's not who I am. I crave having friends so bad. 
My boyfriends friends are all his age (around 26) and I'm 19. They are all fun but they are his highschool friends and I don't think I will ever be close friends with them. 
I tried making friends at work but that didn't turn out so well. Because of constant competition it is hard to find someone who means it. It's all about one upping the other. And once again I opened up, craving friendship and end up being used for someone's benefit. 
I tried different apps, FB sites and met a few people. Some showed interest but ended up ghosting me and others are so busy they don't find time to meet me. I am busy myself but I would even appreciate texting or calling. But yeah. Meeting someone who's not my bf or any of his friends and making my own .. that's my dream. 
I just don't know what to do anymore at this point. I'm helpless and stuck. At the same time I live with my bf who still lives at home which means I have no privacy either. And we can't move out yet because of financial reasons. We do plan on me coming back next year and to move out then but until August I'm stuck. 

I feel lonely.

But how am I supposed to get that when people won't even give me a chance and talk to me...?",1.4126126126126124,2.6180781891891907,3.7308108108108087,90.28153153153154,77.91891891891892,6.284684684684683,24.495495495495497,6.816661863887847,0.7006468468468472,524,18,123,5,12,182,80,148,0.13,0.7290000000000001,0.141,-0.4741,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,0,13,6,0,0,8,0,7,2,2,1,0,24,28,10,1,7,7,0,3,2,0,1,0,1,0,3,4,3,0,1,3,0,1,1,5,2,0,1,0,6,15,4,18,27,1,11,0,0,2,0,10,5,0,1,7,72,19,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1224461630164948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945767615584214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2905817307453719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14830073384330586,0.1047663945150976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07661828352689044,0.14067951277588533,0.08334426048777763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14520600910623727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329102488698858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2462972023956453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10780421753100193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15596335099760272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3050047857917509,0.12804864092530507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1403237157087196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11662152663982965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1467553558638918,0.0,0.24851120175083635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379923366096272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35361381248159524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396704444032787,0.0,0.0,0.08551247209487753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325520109880782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5189858617495147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14136483408317185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,steampunker13,2018/04/11,"I've never had a girl say yes to a date. I don't understand it. People tell me I am great, I have close friends, handsome, cute etc. Yet whenever I ask someone out I either get a ""no"" or some tip toeing response about why she can't. I've been ghosted a lot too. I either have some glaring problem which I don't know about or just pick the worst girls to go after. 

Due to this I have incredible self esteem issues, compounded with a depression problem. I hardly ever approach girls at parties anymore, and I get sad watching all my friends be happy in relations. I'm about to enter my junior year of college and I haven't had a date or even hooked up with anyone in years. I just want to be loved too. I want someone to be excited when they see me. I want someone who I can watch movies or tv shows with and have them fall asleep on my chest like halfway through. I want someone to go explore stuff with. I want someone to watch the sunsets with. I just want someone.

lonely,--Pascal--,2018/04/12,"Never thought life could become so hard I have pretty much always been lonely, don’t mistake me, but I still had something which made me feel good: my childhood friends, I used to work hard for school and get paid off for it, I had hobbies I loved which made me happy no matter what.
But now all of that disappeared.
I lost my friends because of the beginning of highschool, and I also lost myself. Nobody knows what I got, how I feel, who I am and who I am not. I got cool classmates, but my old friends knew me truly.
I’ve always had a bad family, and now I suck at everything. I have no hobbies anymore, and I can never feel comfortable. Sometimes I want to organize myself to pick up my hobbies again, but I just can’t make a decision on what to do.
I am stressed put all the time, and days seem so short. I feel like I am constantly losing the bus because I am too slow to reach the doors before they close. I am so tired all the time. I never want to do anything.
I am also extremely closed in myself. I am just frightened, I can’t open up on anything and I don’t want to talk to anyone, I don’t want to leave my room.
I feel completely alone and I am nothing.
I can’t imagine to live til adulthood. Everything is so difficult. I wish I didn’t grow. I wish I could just quit.

Being a teenager is pitiful and embarrassing. This age is just trash. I hate this. I am powerless and I am treated like a stupid fish who doesn’t know how to swim.",1.7747265722097936,3.5975071040268465,3.325853840417597,90.87603156848124,78.63087248322148,6.294009445687298,24.12428535918469,7.2427474758485975,0.9213657469550088,1119,39,242,14,27,369,146,298,0.238,0.597,0.16399999999999998,-0.9782,1,3,1,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,1,5,17,24,3,2,9,1,34,3,0,7,6,57,64,23,0,9,9,0,7,2,3,0,2,0,2,0,12,13,0,0,12,1,1,4,14,13,0,0,14,8,51,11,24,47,4,33,0,5,0,1,9,12,1,1,19,171,63,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10730110387210078,0.0,0.16570200879397254,0.17241141392806925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10274599318984666,0.0724413840546796,0.0,0.17051231226170144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865038880026408,0.12631043166820913,0.11442099090009875,0.08815822724485632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10862541084056193,0.1119576626782407,0.0,0.16543657683807048,0.0,0.0,0.06681514053159876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18622276885988448,0.0,0.0976673611118676,0.0,0.261923072047644,0.07401375620364391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24012945877868105,0.0,0.0541281102967014,0.0,0.0,0.08689699017622958,0.16572101222017285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102869508995079,0.18561525540687926,0.1022861711899208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11387461759788745,0.0,0.0,0.10970025078075073,0.0,0.0,0.07317761790575017,0.1012300464403928,0.0,0.09148304093437147,0.0,0.0,0.1159048684873458,0.22618906896085805,0.0,0.09350543950236748,0.19606267108079045,0.06915557555183482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07615987083448157,0.0,0.23971425933033055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994095400006642,0.0,0.10871355677467172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10540114421140233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414928179071513,0.0,0.11019417446538217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10485141620050699,0.0,0.09431596450209777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0797583840622217,0.1024656732063829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273721273798951,0.0,0.1186764892948085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08327188830728294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08224893417523067,0.12082308055545615,0.11907600937877855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947942842085671,0.0,0.0,0.2444301166256842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23827587664908895,0.0,0.0,0.07542396548910107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,Beonedge94,2018/04/12,"So so lonely 24 Male here...

I've never really had many people around me.  I was in a relationship for 4 years and we had a very good friendship circle.  When my relationship came crashing down so did that circle.  I was struggling to keep up with payments living on my own and running my car so I looked for a better job.

I found a job that was around 50 miles from my home town and couldn't afford the commute daily.  As it was a great opportunity I decided it would be best to move, start a fresh if you will.

So I went with my heart and gave it my all.  I've been here for 8 months now and I've never been so lonely.  I go to work and although I have a good social during work, everything is kept at work.  I don't see colleagues in my free time, I mean why would they?  They have all their own busy lives to get on with.

I literally come back from work and sit in front of the TV for a few hours and go to bed.  It's soul destroying.  I would kill to just have someone with me a couple of nights a week.  But what do I do?

I blame myself for moving but I know that I would have seriously struggled on my own in my old house with my old job and I dread to think what position I would be in if I stayed.

I look at my phone constantly, hoping for any sort of communication but it never happens.

Is this really what life is about?  Working, to come home to an empty house every day?  Just earning enough to pay bills and feed yourself?

I don't even cook properly anymore, it seems so pointless putting the effort into a meal just for one person.

Where do I go and what can I do?  I literally just cry and cry.  It's so depressing.

I don't blame this person for leaving me, because I have very strong opinions about specific subject matters and sometimes it can lead to debates when the topic is brought up in conversation.

Regardless, I am more than happy to put the past behind by engaging with someone else.

lonely,fIungoutofspace,2018/04/12,"I talk aloud while alone I talk out loud all the time while I’m alone. Considering that statement you can safely assume I’m alone quite often.

It’s bad, honestly it’s crazy. I’m crazy.

No, I don’t talk *to* myself, however I imagine a conversation with someone else, as if they themselves were in the room with me, and I respond out loud as if it were all real. I can hold a conversation with someone who’s not even there, only through my imagination. 

That’s fucking crazy, right?
I’m young and my family doesn’t get me. My friends are too busy to talk to me much, I’m most definitely lonely and I have been most of my life. 

Can ANYONE relate to this problem?

lonely,PowerfulSausages,2018/04/12,"Writing from the middle of the same four walls again... Well here we go... Approaching 21 years old... Cue the ""You're still really young!"". Yep... I never envisioned this... Nor did I ask for it.... But it's happening again. For the past 3 years I've been lonely. 3 years where I've lived an existence that has slowly made me a hollow shell that can act like everything is fine. I moved out of my parents place. Into a big city 6 months ago for school. 

Thought it would be a new chapter... A new start.... The closer the day came the more I believed things would be different for me. And here I am today, the exact FUCKING same. I go home to the same four walls, boot up my console and mindlessly play video games. I try social media, and apps like tinder. Matches don't talk to me or stop responding early on... That's if I get matches in the first place. Then one girl who I was interested in actually gave me her social media and I've asked her out a few times and only gotten maybes. I just sit around sometimes lobbing texts her way and we talk but it's going nowhere and I don't feel she wants it to go anywhere. It doesn't even feel like I'm talking to a real person. My loneliness, my hollowness is still there.

She likely will never agree to meet me but instead use me as an emotional crutch, I don't even want a relationship from her anymore I just want a friend. I will into the college building and see the cliques isolate themselves and me sit by myself. I go home, eat once, then sleep for the next day. On weekends I sleep and call my mom back home just so that there's a voice to talk to, but I act like everything is fine.

I hang up and it's just the same thing Everytime. I wish I had friends, but almost most of all I wish I had a significant other. Someone I could give my all to and get the same in return. I want the highs and lows of relationships. The holds and exploring together, and even the times where we argue over something s and make up. I want that in my life so so bad. I've never had it.

I feel so empty right now, I'm wasting my life like this and it's not feeling worth it at all. I just started crying and it's only downhill from here. I feel like it's only a matter of time before I start going into the darkest paths of wanting to just disappear. No one feels motivated to talk to me... Girls don't find me attractive enough to match with or even give me a reply once they've matched with me (rare). If you don't win the lottery in those regards what is anything else worth? Everytime I try taking initiative nothing happens

I don't feel human, I can't talk to anyone, and people online just don't feel real enough for me to quell my loneliness.

Without giving away too much information, I work in the mental health field and I'm studying to go for post grad next year (clinical psychology). I got into the field because I grew up with depression and anxiety. And I still have days where it has it's effects on me.

But I wanted to make this post to all of you that give it all you got. You're all beautiful, wonderful, and special. There's absolutely nobody like you in this world, you're truly a masterpiece of a person. Even on the days when you feel alone, know that you ARE someone in this world. Someone does care about you. I care about you. I don't even know you personally, but I care. I understand you. You're never alone. And I'm so happy you're here to experience life. Love yourself, because you deserve it.

lonely,fijimcintosh4,2018/04/12,"Looking for friends Hey everyone, I don’t even know where to start with this but I could really use some friends. I’m a freshman at a small university and I’m alone 99% of the time. Sometimes being alone is awesome and other times it’s the worst thing ever. I have so many issues that are out of my control and I’m really trying to stay positive. I can talk about pretty much anything and everything and would love to meet some moderately decent people on here. If I don’t meet anyone here I honestly don’t know what I’m going to do, certainly not go around in this depressed state forever. Chances are my interests are the same as yours so just go for it, you never know we could become great friends. If you have read it all the way to this point thanks for reading even if you don’t message, I still appreciate it :)",2.061212338593976,4.436509353658536,3.42601147776184,87.68225968436155,80.46341463414635,6.785652797704447,23.67144906743185,7.928766900206844,1.3607931133428983,650,23,131,12,17,212,103,164,0.078,0.628,0.294,0.9931,0,2,0,0,0,0,14.0,1,4,0,1,12,11,0,0,6,0,16,1,0,2,4,30,31,12,0,6,6,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,11,9,0,1,3,2,0,3,6,2,0,0,0,1,14,9,18,27,6,20,0,1,1,1,14,8,0,5,6,92,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2922667415207471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09865791918669707,0.0,0.1161103569663582,0.12560575556406486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15582994473108114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15825166745778388,0.2253080699824068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12152616648530447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18638575033049648,0.1276298178429076,0.0,0.1348237054745984,0.12680839219632928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3270323040853337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2405650939963984,0.0,0.0,0.1555593353284931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472680368226481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2326287584160812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11848548278067972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12734505578990574,0.0,0.0,0.14304965533814906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372212624190183,0.0,0.10882228132223253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09781851341508203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13338175258700632,0.0,0.0,0.14354581574455985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28226926738294505,0.0,0.18077999896804625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13954799785403613,0.0,0.09986879422875004,0.15039004327302968,0.11267980802072812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340798266557806,0.0,0.1299026551637069,0.0,0.0,0.09373821248287056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1645489504774027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0957952284065584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12186203139566412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11199579529506952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10023087052692363,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,InadequateThought,2018/04/12,"I don't have much agency I am straddled with debt. Im the weirdo at my job, but any other job I could get would most likely be the same.

I have no friends. I don't have much time outside of work including going to the gym. I try online dating (and tried a lot I think) to no avail. I mean it's frustrating because either there's something I can do about this or there isn't really much and I should stop caring.

lonely,puseadestroyer,2018/04/13,"I have friends, but I'm still lonely. No one really talks to me daily. I want friends who care, and vice versa? I try so hard, lol. I have a few friends irl, and I make a lot of friends online (by reaching out, playing games, etc) but then I get ghosted or they find someone else to talk to. It's hard relating to anyone...even though I like relatively normal, nerdy hobbies such as: league, memes, and anime. I'm even starting to think that liking these hobbies might actually be making me so easily replaceable and abandoned bcuz gee, everyone else online likes it too. 


I'm also female and I think that makes it even fucking WORSE. Guys message me cuz they want a relationship (dating/sexual wise) without even getting to know me FIRST lol. Girls don't want to be friends with me because they want to only find guy friends online.

lonely,BoStaffNinja,2018/04/13,"College So I've heard that college is supposed to be when you make lifelong friends right? Well I've been in college for the past 2 years and I haven't made a single friend. I walk around campus watching people having fun with friends. I can't seem to get away from it. When I'm in my room my roommate has her friend to hang out with. Her friend is always in my room. They always seem to be having fun with each other. 

This is driving me insane, I just want to not feel so alone. Thanks for listening to my rant.

lonely,milaqt,2018/04/14,"I swear, I'll die like this. I'm probably doing the wrong thing. I've just been isolating myself. I don't use digital media, never really did, but I've recently taken down all of my dating site profiles and no longer make an effort to make friends anymore. Actually trying never helped, and as far as I can remember I never ""tried"" to make friends. When you're young, that stuff just happened naturally and unexpectedly.

So, yeah, I've been alone. I don't know if I don't really feel lonely anymore or if I've just gotten used to the feeling. I do feel lonely tonight though. And I don't know if I should continue in this isolation. Honestly, I don't think I like people that much. And i can't seem to firm any meaningful connections to anyone. But I'd really love to have just one awesome friend who'll be there for years to come.

lonely,zojojo,2018/04/14,"2 years of university and so lonely I just left my last final for the year and I feel so lonely. When I am alone I start to notice more things around me. Trivial things like friends cramming before the exam or friends leaving the exam comparing answers and going out to celebrate. Seeing these normal university settings makes me feel so crappy because I don’t have that. After two years of university I have made no progress. Seeing people laughing and talking with their friends feels so shitty. Sometimes I can’t stand being at school because of that. I’m so fucking lonely. 
I just needed to get that off my chest.

lonely,misspennyfoolish,2018/04/15,"Embarrassing confession: I'm so lonely and pathetic that I've started talking a bit to my giant stuffed animal duck I don't have anyone else. Well, except for my abusive mom and dad who doesn't give a shit. I think the purpose of this post is to vent and maybe someone who is in a similar place won't feel as alone in their situation. I really just want someone to hug and cuddle me and tbh the duck is pretty great at that even if he won't reply to my questions. haha gotta laugh at myself sometimes!

I'm 26 and mentally ill (bipolar 2). I live at home bc I struggle to live independently. I'm ashamed of myself and working to get better (new job tomorrow) but it's daunting. I have to change basically everything about myself to be likable and that's a lot

lonely,thebettaqueen,2018/04/15,"I'm lonely but I'm not alone. I'm 21 and pregnant with my first baby. My (ex) boyfriend is going to school and starting his own life and wasn't really ready to be a father so we decided to keep in touch but go our separate ways. Not having that companionship especially with a little one on the way is making me feel so incredibly lonely. I'm struggling because I feel like now that I'm having a baby, it's going to make it so much harder for me to be in a relationship and I just miss having someone there. I'm experiencing this all on my own and it's so tough. I don't really know what to do with myself most days.

lonely,xomacroonxo,2018/04/15,"Life is funny I do not know where I am. And in terms of life I know where I am. It’s just so funny. I am very lonely. I have made 1 friend. Life cannot be bad. But no, I decided to search the entire internet and my search history to look for one of my old friends, who by the way, left me: probably does not remember me or care for me at all. And all my current friends I am uncomfortable with. I thought that r/kik , kikpals would work. But really it is more male hassle and people who want to speak for a brief period of time or people I cannot connect with. I wish I could say sorry to those I could not hold a conversation with, it was rude of me. I cannot help it. So much is going through my head. I’m lonely and I have no one to talk about it because of some stupid ideas I have about communication in my head. I thought I was a good communicator and now I am a horrible one. 
And maybe I am this way because of chemicals or because I accustomed myself to feel this way when people talk to me. But I do not want pity out of this, I do not want to be noticed. I just want to share and help others realize if they too, feel sadness and loneliness. 
Maybe I do over react or just react enough. That is me. I act how I care to act and how you perceive it is up to you. 

I am lonely. I am sorry for my messy rant, I just wish for someone to understand me.

lonely,Zixbit,2018/04/15,"19/M/UK Looking for a longlasting friendship. Hello everyone,

I put a post up yesterday, but it was fairly vague because it was pretty late. I thought I would remove my old posts and put a more clear and informative post up.

I am currently 19 and I live in the UK, currently, I am in university studying towards a degree in English. I enjoy reading/studying the humanities, my first year of university compromises of literature, philosophy, classics, history, and theology. I would eventually like to pursue something related to English but I am not entirely sure yet.

In my spare time, I usually read fiction, primarily American literature from the 1920’s through the great depression - it is my favorite period of literature closely followed by dystopian fiction. I play games a lot, I currently only play PC, I am not a huge fan of consoles. I am currently playing a lot of Fortnite and PUBG, I have strayed away from AAA games recently, I used to be hugely into the CS series.

I am looking for some long-term friends essentially. I have fallen pretty ill over the last year and my sphere of interaction has diminished to discussions with my university lecturers every few months. It would be great to meet some new people from different walks of life. University has been pretty lonesome so far. 

I have a week of university, I am hoping to meet some like-minded new friends.

lonely,293810475,2018/04/15,"22/f looking for friends! I'm looking for a small group of people around my age that will joke/meme/troll around and just generally have fun. Preferably people who have a sense of humor and like to joke around and don't get offended by playful insults and just overall dick around like real life friends do. 

I'm pretty outgoing/confident/friendly and have no problem striking convos in social settings but I just never made efforts to make new friends since I enjoy my time alone as well. The few friends that I do have say I'm fun and engaging. I don't really care if you are shy, but I am looking for people that are more optimistic (or at least pretend to be optimistic) about their future. I know this sounds bad but I'm not looking for someone who talks about how miserable they are all day. Trust me I am pretty lonely too, but I found that friendships never get anywhere when you are just going back and forth complaining about how lonely you are. Of course if you have a bad day, I will be there to support you but I don't want to be an emotional trash can. I've been there and I don't want to go through that again. I can barely take care of myself.

I don't really care if you are shy and awkward as long as you are making an active effort to pursue the friendship. I usually don't have problem keeping up with conversations and opening people up. For reference, my existing friends were incredibly shy at first as well. 

If you are interested, please comment on this thread or message me with a quick 1-2 sentence intro of yourself and I will message you with my discord. Please chime into chat regularly and also be able to talk in voice chat once in a while. I know text can only convey so much but I am actually really friendly so don't be shy. Thanks!",4.532413793103451,5.795830494252876,5.233052873563222,82.33723448275866,70.20689655172414,7.981793103448275,29.43724137931035,8.364918446050245,2.1050102068965515,1404,54,269,21,25,454,174,348,0.16899999999999998,0.608,0.223,0.9731,0,5,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,9,2,3,25,35,2,2,9,0,39,2,1,5,3,58,66,35,0,9,17,0,0,2,6,3,1,3,0,0,9,21,0,1,5,5,0,2,11,11,2,1,4,7,35,24,43,54,5,34,0,3,4,1,32,15,1,6,18,188,44,0,0.08798870095002942,0.0,0.0858642796045249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09112975818044046,0.0,0.07036453236029648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3133143941336808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06765787981219458,0.14693378000556118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691310342742113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1134908659783116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098975445613409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484314407904633,0.0,0.0964750690291057,0.4758589646200805,0.0,0.09194092929336857,0.0,0.10001201290062167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07820840024098752,0.0,0.0,0.0967125778776244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062149021616035714,0.08597366960645363,0.0,0.0,0.07786723149783079,0.29555339310968715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0832570363167032,0.11746628225520983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06468181930796016,0.0,0.13572462100803132,0.08498003566983828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09370509487123513,0.0,0.06691937199521424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24400114571240214,0.0,0.0,0.19317034226427784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17903228275034094,0.0,0.16838660735110508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10015040485926467,0.1691034447241291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997214660332422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278516267601144,0.0,0.0,0.08969339994016201,0.07455254078083301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09984853512481273,0.0,0.0,0.0661565527854791,0.1414439697417583,0.0,0.08100817417999243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0513069191103515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09690712314642028,0.0,0.10379603105792054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15822481834450952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,beverlynotcleary,2018/04/16,"Self esteem is getting in the way of being social I’ve been feeling really disconnected from my friends and people in general lately. I’ve been having a rough time since someone left me around 5 months ago. I used to be pretty social and didn’t have too hard of a time making friends; however, now I have such low self esteem I can’t bring myself to have a conversation with someone for more than 5 minutes. It’s hard for me to form any kind of friendship or relationship with anyone because there’s a fear in the back of my mind that they could just start ignoring me at any second.",9.172413793103454,6.646039689655175,9.021793103448278,71.70251724137933,61.58620689655172,11.693793103448277,36.131034482758615,9.888512548439397,3.3399882758620683,468,15,89,7,5,153,80,116,0.094,0.789,0.117,0.5729,1,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,0,7,6,0,1,6,0,12,0,0,2,0,14,18,3,0,1,2,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,2,5,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,0,1,3,4,10,3,18,12,2,17,0,1,0,0,9,7,0,1,8,60,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458666203895919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22380384798693606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11505953168544013,0.0,0.0,0.1464873730495816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12653137251733154,0.0,0.1003101977162673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1313824639260263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18516827263051916,0.0832031204281413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25426702734906714,0.0,0.08597233615878155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2948149685360583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17135699680204272,0.0,0.0,0.18562335157854584,0.0,0.17878770139411113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098406420620725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661519793919703,0.0,0.13134491781736748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1140805769723034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16740991976243275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10541709267147437,0.0,0.0,0.17666872060944838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433300734795379,0.0,0.0,0.13612023548265334,0.0,0.0,0.3354828449155485,0.2788510469390411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11647171143154395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19190476889576974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14212126485343654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13061479365892278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,jsdapjspoasjdp23,2018/04/16,"17/M/AU looking for friends Hey guys. Throwaway account here. I'm 17 and live in Australia. Currently finishing high school but I'm very lonely and it's honestly one of the worst feelings in the world. 

I recently also went through a nasty breakup with a girl I was really in love with and my loneliness has become worse. I'm hoping to meet anybody who wants to be good friends and maybe play some games together or just have conversations with in general. 

I love gaming, reading, watching movies/netflix, and cooking. My favourite games include: Overwatch, R6 Siege, CSGO, PUBG/Fortnite, (mostly FPS games, but I'm willing to play any game that looks interesting!)

Reading some of the comments/posts on this subreddit inspire me and give me hope that I won't be lonely anymore one day.
 
If anyone wants to talk feel free to PM me and i'll give you my Discord.

lonely,throwaway64748383877,2018/04/16,Going to prom alone My senior year has been rough. I have lost all my friends through out high school and I don’t have a girlfriend.  I don’t have no one and I decided to buy a ticket. I am not planning to spend to much  money on this and I am hoping to have a good time. It just feels shitty that everyone is going with friends and everyone is making a big deal about it when I have nothing to be excited for.  Anybody who has been in the same situation as me how did it go. Nothing more than this experience makes me feel lonely ,1.2967272727272745,3.3700890363636367,3.113636363636364,90.55045454545456,81.36363636363637,6.181818181818183,22.72727272727273,7.348242739294969,0.8277272727272726,414,14,90,6,11,138,74,110,0.129,0.7659999999999999,0.105,-0.1867,0,3,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,2,4,7,0,0,5,0,17,0,0,3,1,17,26,7,0,1,2,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,3,1,3,3,4,2,0,1,4,3,11,5,15,21,4,12,0,2,0,0,5,5,0,1,4,69,18,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2009386635019072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000185920217408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3707749304005901,0.0,0.18978166521908812,0.0,0.0,0.19619731815732686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2997874875666912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3307856940637602,0.16272866203839612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2049850874090121,0.0,0.19269840417978634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2117877988930595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590099900864849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1426216702877522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3723208687747073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13146803803875692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1963512273156599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21807842257451496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11313037541503393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12493782870660801

lonely,WWS390a,2018/04/16,"Hi I'm a loner but I have some great friends

They just had a poker party for my birthday, got me a cake and everything. 

I've made some shitty choices in my past and that makes me feel like I really don't deserve people like that in my life.

Anyway, I'm pretty buzzed and I just drove home.

Sitting here feeling sorry for myself. Can't seem to keep a good girl in my life, so I'll be sleeping alone again tonight. This should probably go in r/depression lol

lonely,toiletpaper4000,2018/04/17,"Maybe this will help. Maybe by typing this out and putting how I feel into the universe it will somehow cure this loneliness. Maybe I'm hoping someone will reach out and let me know I'm not alone in feeling this way. It's been awhile since I had a meaningful conversation with someone who isn't my BF, dog or cat. My only friends are in different states and I'm pretty much only useful as a sounding board to them. Can't remember the last time someone asked me how I was (and genuinely cared) to know the honest answer. To be fair, I'm not sure I would even tell anyone how I actually feel because I feel SO guilty. I have a loving boyfriend and he tries, he really does try to make me happy. There's nothing I would make him do different. I commend his effort and for the majority of the time he makes me happy but it's when he's at work or playing video games, this empty feeling creeps in. It's a deep deep loneliness. A feeling I wouldn't want anyone to experience. Maybe it's the lack of friendship in my life or the codependency or my crippling social anxiety.. I'll be 25 soon and I'm not too sure I want to live like this forever. I guess I'll just talk to my doggo about it for now.

The last friend i made was 8 years ago, she was my boyfriend's friend's gf so we met at a party and were around eachother a lot so we became friends and remained close. 

Before that, all of my current friends are from highschool or earlier. I know some people make friends with. coworkers but i dont really have any.

lonely,Jaggerbomb99,2018/04/17,"Finally I let them know, found closure. I am tired of making excuses on your behalf. I am tired of telling myself that each and every one of you, just like everyone else on the planet, is simply busy with your own life, and that’s why we haven’t talked in a while. I’m tired of reassuring myself that you really are my good friends – though you do little to prove it. I am tired of one-sided relationships.

I am a temporary fixture prioritized behind your immediate friends. I’m the friend you hang out with when I ask, but you have two group messages – one with me and one without me. You forget about me. You fill your life with things and activities and people, and I exist only when my name lights up your phone because I want to know how you’re doing. But you’ll never ask how I’m doing, and you’ll never spend time with me unless I reach out to you first. I’m there for you for a period of time when you need me. You’ll thank me for bringing joy to your life by caring about you more than most people do; yet that never ends up being enough, and I watch as friends and significant others move on to fulfilling lives without me.

Here’s the difference: I care. You do not.

My claim may sound bold, but after years of watching friends make decisions that affect me without my input, I’m tired of being under-appreciated. I have been there and I will continue to be there for you anytime you need me because I am grateful for your friendship and I want the best for you. I’m thankful for the time you spend with me. Since I was young, I’ve been quick to refer to people as my “best friends” when I cared about them and they were close with me – in my opinion, that’s all it should take to build a strong friendship. 

I was also always hesitant to do what most people do when they settle into a specific friend group; I found it cruel to say, “This group of people is the only kind I want to associate with.” That lifestyle is too exclusive in my opinion – too restrictive. I would rather keep my options open so that my life can be filled with various people and perspectives, because everyone has a lot to offer in his or her own way. I never saw an issue with this lifestyle until I realized I was calling so many people my friends, yet I had almost no one to go to when I needed advice or had nothing to do on a Saturday night.

I’ve been blaming it on myself. At first, I thought maybe I was unaware of something wrong with me that everyone else could clearly see. Then I blamed it on my passivity: maybe I’m not aggressive enough to maintain a friend group that cares enough about me to keep me included. Yet I decided that a hostile or assertive disposition is not what should win you loyal friendship. After those two options didn’t add up, I accepted that perhaps my role in life isn’t to be surrounded with committed friends in the same way everyone else is; maybe I’m meant to be there for others when they need me, and that is enough. But it isn’t.

So, then I realized: my problem is you. You care only for status, appearance and yourself. I understand; and with a bitter taste in my mouth I’ll admit that, in the past, I cared a lot about it, too. I think it’s just a side effect of growing up and trying to identify yourself through the people you associate with. However, I never lost sight of the fact that being a good person and friend is more important than caring about what others think of me. I feel as if I’m alone in that understanding.

Despite this harsh realization, I do want to say thank you. Thank you for the years of memories and laughs and the time spent by your side. While I cared for each of you wholeheartedly, you all cared for me similarly in your own ways, at least temporarily. That kind of friendship is still worth something, and means a lot to me. I won’t forget it.

But as time has gone on, I’ve realized that now is the time to stop saying thank you. I would prefer to live a life free from friendships than live one saturated with people who hollowly appreciate me. I can promise you, however, that I will never refrain from being who I am. I will always care, I will always be quick to call you my best friend and I will always go out of my way to show you my support and make plans with you… but I’m standing up for myself. I won’t waste time doing this in a place where that loyalty isn’t reciprocated anymore, because I can assure you that nothing feels worse than being constantly surrounded by people yet feeling entirely alone. So I’m letting you go.",5.726844392622433,5.857562241573036,6.299056603773584,79.81066037735852,67.03370786516854,9.413610345558617,30.050879796480807,9.207406926631759,2.3775520457918167,3545,118,702,60,53,1157,321,890,0.062,0.69,0.248,0.9996,2,2,2,0,0,0,87.0,1,42,5,10,41,54,4,0,30,0,77,13,1,7,13,147,145,58,0,17,20,0,3,1,12,15,11,4,0,1,44,49,1,5,25,1,5,11,20,7,0,9,19,15,139,48,130,98,24,103,0,1,5,0,87,38,0,16,50,532,183,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0401045152902599,0.0,0.0,0.04109635142167563,0.08501161460387452,0.0,0.03282024788736506,0.1365966625248582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040701364943826236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07673506372063647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10007216468365482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12920910667773278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08381432476513219,0.0,0.4184374789765812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044350436892513036,0.0,0.03276767433890093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04287881593135897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285276263934663,0.0,0.03634989520493095,0.16962413301888654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03457857554543532,0.15686466177622505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06225426147521671,0.0,0.0,0.04495810124106565,0.0,0.06981842865852962,0.0,0.08999805937096017,0.3804954891994913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06997315860010342,0.06884601530198281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04283584757093355,0.0,0.07295775290995361,0.0,0.08547518594358045,0.04510981133956559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08393383085378545,0.17392963986041682,0.02005042209207076,0.04113358188418604,0.1087191194413059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044800792499370766,0.10467405413241733,0.0,0.0,0.08218499518228592,0.0416088471289866,0.1236927544341249,0.04470537412318594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04361978894180643,0.0,0.12172469145484645,0.18991879387870755,0.0,0.0,0.038513934290894,0.0,0.07875935286330486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16686151865002685,0.09363994772694627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03917800981814642,0.2845246681267214,0.035835172522399976,0.04287881593135897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03927042509056754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026291735283313827,0.0,0.0,0.04406237278408888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979116802044419,0.0,0.0,0.03270413921481995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033949306581291146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06319030059007957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0327751709388963,0.03431187848417617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046572521184489866,0.0,0.0,0.030857512854276112,0.032986975066694735,0.035871397054543896,0.1889238987531726,0.0,0.0,0.02726562985506241,0.052594470735592515,0.04032229771149283,0.032581746325827714,0.1675182116526384,0.23585134384875836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02786395398879273,0.0,0.08018163736859124,0.08544967101416368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968275167836628,0.13030484874657572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03703286511810975,0.0,0.0,0.11868536474961827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04182399852449627,0.05830829804520068,0.044871583178268656,0.0,0.05285775449258047
lonely,Aetheth,2018/04/17,"Stale friendships all my life i’ve had very stale friendships, and never was part of a group of friends. i do blame the fact that before, i was quite shy, and potentially unapproachable because i was quite awkward and didnt talk much. that impression has stayed on the people around me. thankfully im good now, in fact i’d say i chat a lot and im confident and because of that i have managed to get more friends
the only issue is that- they’re all so stale, we have nothing in common, and even if we did, we’ve talked about it way too much to the point we’re bored of even mentioning it
i’m feeeling really alone and abandoned right now, because all those people left me to be with others... if you’d ever like to talk and maybe be friends then im up for it

lonely,assholedorito,2018/04/17,"I hate being boring and uninteresting I've met someone on reddit a few months ago, unintentionally, on 1 particular sub.

We had lots of long written conversations in the span of ~2 months, and we liked each other. We exchanged social media. He even told me he'd ask me out if he lived near me. I like him so much I think about him everyday. He said he likes me too.

But now I'm just sad that I can feel our little ""friendship"" (I feel like this is more than a friendship) dying because he hasn't really responded to my messages that much these last couple of weeks.

How the heck do I stop getting attached to people? 

I've had very few friends in my life, and so I make a big deal out of every new interaction with a potential friend or partner.",3.239004474272928,4.862186765100674,4.774647651006713,82.9461772930649,73.96644295302012,7.382774049217002,25.168344519015665,8.07648339933343,1.4121404921700218,584,19,119,9,12,196,105,149,0.075,0.812,0.113,0.7076,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,4,0,0,0,8,9,1,0,6,0,8,1,0,2,0,21,20,9,1,1,4,0,2,4,3,0,1,1,0,1,5,10,0,1,3,0,1,0,1,3,0,0,6,3,20,6,16,12,7,20,0,1,0,0,25,10,1,3,14,74,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15437802882611168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628115521007414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616336042635724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19269935633716906,0.0,0.0,0.17954630818675082,0.0,0.0,0.1807455457825573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11502783130059188,0.0,0.14673322158123225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17611614898009328,0.12441647095302638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691036672597433,0.0,0.09098887568876288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1719421510203062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1419596879997236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301092985379646,0.3403336292748394,0.17454920828393675,0.15378218440621966,0.15412182368479216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14806047710704925,0.0,0.0,0.11624991215431756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780179516714113,0.0,0.25604814141288,0.0,0.0,0.16820012503717974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12073724991565207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11156824589296488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16566142477712556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17752923926224726,0.14756108987638672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456015000349418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115915853481722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664127050609114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14369623428233658,0.0,0.0,0.13969675307943433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

lonely,styxnkrons,2018/04/17,"When it really sinks in So I was watching That 70s Show, and it's one of my favorite shows because it genuinely makes me laugh, but I connect it with highschool. Back then, I had a group of loyal friends, and usually a girlfriend/crush. Looking and Donna and Erik and how happy they are in that show made me wish that I could have something innocent and romantic like that again.
Lately that just seems like a lost hope because I just don't have that same kind of social interaction anynore. I don't even have a close group of friends like that that I can talk to about anything and that I know are in my corner. 
There's a part of me that wants to say that it's my depression isolating me apart from everybody, but I had depression in highschool and was doing just fine. I guess I just miss the whole courting process; all the ups and downs of getting to know somebody and those great moments of reward when your faith/feelings pay off in that relationship. 
I wish we didn't have technology and that we were still forced to just talk to each other. but it all just feels so forced and unnatural now. Where would I even go to meet people anymore? I don't want to cruise bars or clubs trying to find semi-decent people. I guess it's just a product of moving states right after high school and not going straight to college, but I just feel kind of lost. Out here on an island all by myself, struggling with life by myself, and sometimes I wonder if I'm gonna die by myself. 
My parents are all out of my life and I don't really have any family to fall back on. Just feels so dark and alone sometimes. 
Anyways, this is all just a shout into the void, and I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Guess the written word can cleanse the soul sometimes, but for me it just makes me realize how little I have that's worth writing about anymore.

lonely,i_am_ghost7,2018/04/17,"hello. sometimes i think i am just too fucking retarded to have friends/so. excuse the title, didnt mean to offend anyone, its just how I feel rn. probly delete this in a couple hours but who cares.

I am a software engineer, and in my free time I produce music. I am decently fit, ""kind of cute"", etc... but I am so bad at social interactions and am never around people my age. I am 18. The last time I saw someone 18/19 was when I graduate hs a year ago. Now I am just doing my own thing having adventures etc. and it is completely awesome, but there is still this void of having no friends/relationships etc...

And it is not like I am hard to talk to. If we start talking about any subject that is not just small talk I can get really into the conversation, but small talk sucks and I unconsciously try to avoid people in general.

I also think I might have a problem with closeness. I have a hard time truly opening up to anyone and people just don't seem to like the things I do.

I feel like I should just cry and let it out but it won't fix anything. and this is my own fucking fault for not talking to people. my own fault for always wearing headphones when i go to the coffee shop, never initiating conversations with strangers, deleting all social media from my phone, and not really texting anyone. My own fault for loving my music more than people.

and I can't complain, but sometimes I just get fucking lonely man. gonna go eat some beans now. RIP. in peace.",2.3287093596059094,4.537491531034488,3.8299753694581287,86.05077586206897,78.51724137931033,6.211822660098523,23.11576354679803,7.310402129719878,0.9978522167487688,1144,37,223,15,28,378,156,290,0.153,0.713,0.134,-0.7876,0,3,0,0,0,0,43.0,1,0,0,1,19,22,5,1,10,0,29,6,1,2,3,53,48,22,0,3,18,0,4,3,0,4,0,0,0,1,12,18,1,1,6,1,2,2,11,13,0,0,3,5,32,10,28,40,10,32,0,1,1,4,18,14,4,4,19,162,44,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876976055927056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911620655043408,0.08231968420458699,0.0,0.0,0.0672774262489481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2075275084007732,0.0,0.08141293768539756,0.08807081312847356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260442369340178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1008681778661969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372874177250492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10946682166191077,0.10867259865840223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10123254627738383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3310073412217008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10004639059849184,0.0706773281265612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743842358574705,0.1033761940627549,0.0,0.11245112849829683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17724800070397714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974284880654346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030228730943322,0.0,0.0806431123841217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10116508445010428,0.0,0.14500012380500749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08929035585146777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10776638936983872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049516449137765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526055356222302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3429363557743475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946649480970184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675726072408966,0.0,0.0,0.10621637588636977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006434361129853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20169825103195366,0.08382510360580749,0.0,0.19569335157077114,0.0,0.07002486370459426,0.0,0.07900754444715087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3975905882562433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13145258443774568,0.12678377763654256,0.0,0.0,0.17306483850483506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06716860721633333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370922359542958
lonely,EskoBomb,2018/04/17,"This Couch Sucks and I Kind of want to Quit Life My couch is a piece of crap.  Random, I know.  But I don't even try to throw parties anymore.  The couch is a great enough excuse not to throw any I suppose. I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't rely on anyone to show anyway. Everyone is busy with their loved ones, their own lives and responsibilities.  My life with my ex shaped my world.  Between her and my son, I was caught up in living, and doing healthy things.  Now I cannot get off the couch.  I don't want to go outside and clean up my yard.  I'm lazy.  I seriously don't care about anything except for my son. I wish I cared enough about myself to make things better.  I do care for me, I just don't feel motivated any more.
I know the next Mrs. EskoBomb won't just show up.  I have to put myself out there. I have to fix my couch.  Or buy a new one. Lol I'm so damn pitiful.  I should go to bed.

lonely,goobermcskink,2018/04/17,"How can being together make me feel so alone? I’ve been in a long distance relationship for about a year now, and I swear I feel lonelier now than I ever did when I was single. Being in an LDR is such a tease. Like you have none of the benefits and only the title telling everyone you’re not a lonely old spinster. 

But god. I’m so so so alone. Our schedules don’t match up. We rarely talk. I go to sleep alone. I wake up alone. Nothing indicates the fact that I’m in a relationship besides the shared title. 

I don’t know what to do. How do I stop feeling so alone? :( I can’t handle it anymore. I feel like I can feel my heart sinking into my chest every time I get to see couples who are actually together. Posting pictures with each other. Going on dates. Being in love. And here I am; just me. As always.

Tonight I tried to go on discord in the hope of making friends but it was so damn hard to find people who would actually use the voice chat and when they did, well, I just went flat. Couldn’t think of a thing to say, no joke, no conversation, no anything. I’m drunk and it’s the only time I feel I can speak to people online, what a mess..

I don't have a lot of friends, my only ones are my classmates and a few others from my childhood city. In the past 5 months I felt really lonely after a 2 year relationship brake up, a painfull one I must admit, so I started listening to music, any kind of music, but it's not enough for me. Sure it helps me now and then but I need people to socialize and speak with.

lonely,lionthoughts,2018/04/18,"Losing it. I’m 22 and just  moved across the country, 36 hours from everyone I know and love. I have a job that everyone constantly tells me I’m lucky to have. And I am blessed for it. But, I’ve realized that job isn’t everything. That I can have my dream job but no matter what, I’m gonna feel empty or lonely without loved ones, or love. If someone doesn’t respond to me in a good amount of time, I just start to feel like I’m not important to everyone. Knowing if something happened to me like a car accident, or I got taken by someone, nobody would even know.. at least not for awhile. That terrifies me. I try all these apps and it’s just seemed to waste my time, they end up “ghosting” you, and it just feels helpless to make friends or meet anyone. I work about 6 days a week and it just feels impossible. I don’t look forward to anything when I wake up in the morning / afternoon, often times I try and sleep longer so that I don’t have to be sad or think about everything and wanting to just not exist anymore. I never feel motivated for anything. I just feel so lost and idk anymore :(",3.5127858744394618,4.514696991031394,4.555938901345289,87.2229666479821,72.36322869955157,7.906838565022423,28.287275784753362,8.278499904357787,1.7610899103139015,851,32,183,13,16,278,125,223,0.201,0.679,0.12,-0.9691,3,2,1,0,0,0,28.0,0,1,1,4,14,14,0,0,6,0,12,5,2,2,2,50,39,21,1,4,20,0,6,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,12,9,0,0,13,1,0,3,10,5,0,1,3,7,22,9,25,33,3,21,1,5,1,3,9,7,0,10,15,115,34,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228627774389819,0.08059736392609121,0.0,0.18970983319234205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12456267368361827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433767683308531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10209234569253807,0.0,0.0,0.07613276396797437,0.0,0.0,0.3304276639598606,0.2071890876877153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3496947403853487,0.08234676521060655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08905499543351353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09668048771720177,0.0921895468067514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193022418077988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11351477261820307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3431541236088942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.190043180074122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11262726409331215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09679524618354933,0.12895428473908202,0.12582754281297012,0.0,0.3120988935393449,0.0,0.07694161511412304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12251057524584988,0.0,0.0,0.08890101355571764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810789984748727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10493474433451024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11535024077765126,0.0,0.1953307038721541,0.08873816521185829,0.0,0.0,0.08158657327935845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10074843539218792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07385843697185959,0.0,0.0,0.20163933754045532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565174483693649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798746090117175,0.0,0.09246023165903368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111132711511396,0.0,0.08391574615257963,0.0,0.0,0.08188236702215655,0.0,0.0,0.0

Death of my family(they are alive but we are not that close anymore, how ever everytime I close my eyes I see their death) and that point I cry. I am crying myself to sleep. I am waiting for my impending loneliness and death afterwards. I need a companion. I need a mind alike friend. It has been too long and I am 23 now. I dont even care about the other problems in my life. This doom of mine paralyzes every cell in my brain and makes me think of loneliness. I dont enjoy doing any shit. How fucked up I have become...

lonely,mr-t-rexx,2018/04/18,"Losing friends due to psychosis Maintaining friendships has always been an issue. 
Dealing with bipolar 2 and unspecified psychosis has taken its toll on me.
I've recently had to cut out my ""best friend"" out of my life due to his narcissistic, manipulative and enabling nature. 
I'm slowly trying to rebuild the friendships that Iker. But it's pretty hard.

I'd love to hear from some people who either have a similar situation, or have over came this type of shit.
Music production is my life, and has changed/saved me as a person.

But it gets pretty fucking lonely when the only people I see are my psych and the convenience store clerk.
Open to chats and what not, I don't really know what I'm looking for with this.

lonely,VorpalPen,2018/04/18,"Missed connection Hey guys, here’s a cautionary tale about me being a bonehead.  
  
I haven’t had any romantic interactions for a couple years, mostly because I haven’t been trying.  I have a somewhat low opinion of my physical attractiveness and women don’t seem to like my personality so I just gave up on the online dating soul grinder long ago.  I’m lonely, but coping.  Anyway, yesterday I ran into a beautiful lady who I was acquainted with through an organization (I don’t want to give full details because of privacy).  She was super sweet and bubbly, made a very kind offer to help me out with something (I didn’t require help so I kindly thanked her and declined) and offered me her phone number “in case I had an emergency or something”.  I awkwardly demurred, because of course it never occurred to me that she might actually be interested in me- I assumed her intent was just to be kind.  It was literally hours later that I realized *an attractive woman had offered me her phone number and I didn’t take it*.  I mean, chances are that she’s not interested in me.  But still.  How f-ing thick is my skull?  Welp, here goes another two years of isolation before I get another lady’s phone number.  
  
Moral of the story:  Don’t be me.  No matter how strongly you feel destined to be alone, please be ready to carpe the diem if it ever presents itself.  The only thing about this situation more horrifying than my missed opportunity is the possibility that she was interested and now thinks that I wasn’t.  I’m a sorry SOB.

lonely,starryvirgo,2018/04/18,"Thoughts in the dark At 3am I took my dog out and as I walked along the sidewalk I looked up at the apt building/retirement home across the street. All of the apt units were dark except the top corner apt. That particular apt has a large balcony, impressively high ceilings and appears to be the most luxurious in the building. No matter the time, the lights are always on. As I walked alone in the dark, I stared up at the lights and wondered if they can’t sleep at night like me. I wondered if the person living there is as lonely as me as well. I started to imagine when I’m old and gray... missing the feeling of someone looking at you in wonder and wanting to know you. Missing that feeling of being truly alive, free and wild. The world is a different place when you are young and beautiful. I see people - mostly men - treating me differently as I get older. I become more and more invisible. It seems like no one gives a shit about old people and we will all inevitably become old unless we die a premature death. Anyway, somehow this all compounded my loneliness but made me realize I don’t need to live this life. I am getting older but I am still young. I spend so much time looking back on how I miss certain aspects of my life and that prevents me from moving forward. When I thought of looking back in the future, i.e., when I’m old, it brings a little more clarity. I just hope I am brave enough to make the changes in my life to be happier and less lonely.

They arent there when i need them. I cant rely on anyone. I feel so different from everyone. Ive never had a girlfriend. Never even kissed a girl. My left eye is bigger than the right which drops my self esteem by a ton. I dont think anyone im into is ever going to be attracted to me. I try to hide this all and be happy but people just arent into me. When will my life get better? How can i make it better when all i have is family? People need friends.

lonely,VisitingOtherWorlds,2018/04/18,"27 [M4F] UK - Seeking cuddle buddy / soulmate Talk to me if you *need* highly perceptive, intuitive people in your life. I've always been looking for that special connection which goes beyond all the normal rules and social norms..

I'm a compassionate INTJ, I love psychology and philosophy and talking openly about all of life - being emotionally supportive - also I like BDSM. To me a spiritual and emotional connection is really important, before I'd want to meet up.

[Mayyyybeee you could be cuddling me soon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efdcTEAhLkE&amp;list=PL63ZO-jXFTasqvj7WdEFQ6QtG6UBrl9CR)

I'm very attentive, caring, empathic, and supportive for the right person. I'd want to explore your mind.

I don't mind shy/quiet women but I would like a very strong connection, someone who reads interesting books or is strong-minded, passionate, intuitive.

I can travel so that's not an issue.


“Because he took his time getting to know me, and letting me get to know him. And he was willing to take more time if needed or requested.

“Because he engages my mind as much as he engages my body. And he engages my body a lot.

“Because he's understood that the quickest way to my heart is through my mind.

“Because he's smart in a way that completes my own intelligence. But he's humble about it. Which adds to his sexy as fuck quotient.

“Because he's not overly controlling (for me). He gives me space to roam, knowing that the act will only endear him to me.

“Because he tugs on the proverbial leash when it's needed. And he's never done so wrongly.

“Because he listens to me, and really hears what I say.

“Because I trust him implicitly. I feel safe with him.

lonely,Asianhippiefarmer,2018/04/19,"i crave human contact One thing i’ve noticed as i get older and more socialized: i crave human connection, whether that be a simple tap on the shoulder, hug from a friend or even exchanging words with my colleague. 

even though i don’t feel as lonely as i used to, 2 years ago, there will be days where i am holed up in my room. it’s worse during a weekend where i don’t have any friends to hang out or events to go to. 

i used to solve my loneliness issues through chronic masturbation, but after discovering noFap, i’ve been forcing myself to think positively and watch funny videos. 

this is just a shoutout to the r/lonely people. your life will be better or for worse depending on what you do everyday. make the best of it and learn to deal with loneliness more productively rather than destructively. 

pm if you want to talk or get a virtual hug :)",6.976303030303029,6.603644812121214,7.078787878787883,76.96484848484852,64.51515151515152,10.484848484848484,32.878787878787875,9.994966539143718,3.0052424242424243,674,24,131,13,9,217,111,165,0.099,0.7070000000000001,0.193,0.9528,0,4,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,3,0,2,8,8,1,0,8,0,12,5,1,4,0,24,21,14,0,3,9,0,1,0,2,2,2,0,1,2,6,6,0,0,3,2,1,2,2,2,0,1,1,2,15,6,25,15,3,18,0,1,1,2,11,8,0,6,8,88,21,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735569703112418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13314464164887824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054706487501746,0.17316129073561828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12626904284142187,0.2018519961448704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2586363105398926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09899784792011247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3025353902002009,0.0,0.20458550632688036,0.0,0.11127257716069204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20435500909658674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13829302306120994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13069205965297812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22290943103513897,0.0,0.0,0.1326730962314164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13573687563192602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19958433944457585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15736944573491884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13007488711011894,0.12545501204107412,0.1923637323151445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3382012427364642,0.0,0.0,0.11548264593316927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3990556547189055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12608302990000833
lonely,nuclear-cats,2018/04/19,"25/M/Toronto, Canada - looking for new friends hi! i want to make some new friends irl. i'm also interested in dating but i'm equally okay with either finding friends or someone to date.

i guess it'd make sense to have common interests but if we have none, that is totally fine! some of my interests include: extreme/alternative music (+ lots more styles), visual arts, film (many genres), nature/animals, spirituality, mental health, comics, old school gaming, etc.

i'm also Jewish, a metalhead, a musician, i deal with anxiety disorders and probably fit into the category of a nerd lol. i'm very into creative type things and i love cats!

send a message if you think we'd get along! again, looking for irl friends.",4.234592875318064,6.713920442748092,5.601851145038168,74.3438963104326,73.58015267175573,8.33613231552163,31.527353689567427,9.075114841892004,3.2222513994910944,562,27,93,13,12,188,96,131,0.033,0.667,0.3,0.9897,0,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,2,1,0,0,3,11,0,0,5,2,5,2,0,2,1,24,18,9,0,3,6,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,3,8,0,0,2,4,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,8,10,13,16,9,12,1,0,2,1,13,4,0,7,7,51,11,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26094771786178184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481204208181068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16820417686672948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18698813757256588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1819593693323276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491194162872857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5042082045614965,0.0,0.08524101160208042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17973206239927925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17342462606905626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2740158317381092,0.0,0.0,0.1387073392363086,0.14725247583536394,0.0,0.21781256303424806,0.16541212209047254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16442043444626342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31514948835742795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17120223675900156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17590715405247515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16512013325147706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13823949882834002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10839198885943904,0.1045422261716423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134618790274256,0.09623220861110288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,sharkb8master,2018/04/19,"My social skills are becoming worse. So, i have no friends. The only people i talk to in real life are my family. 

When i went to class earlier this week i came across someone that i used to know a long time ago, it must have been atleast 5 years since i last saw him. For some reason he didnt pretend to not recognize me and came to talk to me in the train. 

It was nice to catch up and talk to someone but i realized my social skills have worsened, i used to be able to have normal conversations but i couldnt find topics to talk about if my life depended on it. It was a 30 minute train ride too so there were some awkward silences as well. To make things worse he somehow knew i didnt go out much and that i didnt have any friends. He even said he was gonna contact me to do something but i highly doubt he meant it.",2.5323076923076933,3.548105758620689,3.667931034482759,92.60478779840851,74.74712643678161,6.963041556145005,23.72944297082229,7.321109707123232,0.6829076923076927,638,18,149,7,13,207,104,174,0.101,0.828,0.07200000000000001,-0.7143,0,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,2,9,6,0,2,4,0,19,2,0,5,1,29,32,11,0,4,5,0,0,0,2,2,2,1,0,0,9,6,0,0,6,1,0,6,6,2,1,0,15,2,20,4,22,13,3,20,0,0,1,0,17,7,0,6,7,94,29,1,0.13610510815583635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064896626784148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925561407889986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15031739872285285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31133596983149203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08989614029908334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12830778292489672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12439760310249985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2103089378757612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07735166950841009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438025194556162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07479980798636518,0.11094382885380527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1922701259934244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1204487377399366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085121656750623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10005291494899876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13335410814202847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103514067883579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09435814476393678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1549174102816034,0.0,0.13993871945795272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1294671256123551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11258755193788736,0.0,0.0,0.2774840352888822,0.2306428329253401,0.10478036175232132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43758452146318255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09042218609312473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0793639830939543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2351022275479924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10917530802904578,0.0,0.12237483779847655,0.12617079883918908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2774054659909795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08764722727110222

lonely,Vladelie,2018/04/19,"I hate where i am About 2 month ago, i agreed to go with my dad in a business trip , i didn't like where we were going to go but i agreed when he tells me that i was going to work there and get paid. Very bad decision

Prior to this a went through a hard time, losing my girlfriend (it was enterily my fault and i regret ,she was the only person to who i tell everything, i fully trust her) , lost my appart with her,lost my job, get myself hospitalized for 2 month. Fortunalty , i was somehow lucky to be able to pass all my college classes .

Psychiatrist weren't able to give me a diagnosis except that i have anxiety.

My dad  wanted to move me out of where i was caused i get a lot of problems, but cut me off from my friends,my mom and the psychatric help that i was receiving was the worst idea he ever had

There's absolutely no one here who could help me during tough time, I'm stuck with panic attack, intrusive thoughts, worries, high level of loneliness.

I even had been robbed by a member of my family (about 100$)

I don't have access to alcohol and benzo.

the only person that i know with who i can have at least some fun is the son of a friend of my dad, but he is always busy with work and his girlfriend. But he me that i can stay at his place by tomorrow. 

I really don't know how can i handle this situation, my dad told me that we're supposed to return home in about a week, but it's not sure. 

I don't even have access to book and movie don't work on my pc for a whatever reason that i don't know. 

Do you have any idea about what can i do on my computer, i love scary stuff, chess, a bit of science fiction.

lonely,meadowgrasssky,2018/04/19,"I can’t believe that this is my life. I’m 38 and I’ve never really felt like i belonged. I don’t really have any friends mostly by choice. i just dont really relate to most people in my age group because i never married or had kids. i live in a small town in the south, and even in these days and times that makes you a pariah. lol.
When I was younger, I tried to “fit in” and ended up trying to be something that I wasn’t, and got hurt a lot along the way. 
So I just kind of started keeping to myself. Luckily, I’m introverted and I like staying at home with my dog and doing things that I like to do. I thought I was content with that until I met someone that I really clicked with and it made me realize how lonely I was. I ended up spending time with him and really fell in love with him. He ended up living with me for awhile because he and his wife seperated( not at all becaue of me.) and it probably is sad to admit it, but it was the best times of my life. I had a fellow homebody that I could talk to for hours, we had a lot of the same interests and weird sense of humor. All things end eventually, though and his wife whom he has a small child with decided that she wanted him back so he went back. When he left, i genuinely wished him the best, but it was like someone stabbed me in the heart! i didnt think id ever stop crying. I really miss him still 3 months later but i realized that i completely missed out on having a life with someone that i never got tired of talking to, someone i connected with on many levels. i realized that ive never been in love really, and at 38 its not likely to happen. 
i just wish i could easily make friends that cared about me and that i had someone to come home to.

Had my menu down and made every indication I was ready, even tried to get their attention.

lonely,iAmTheTrembles,2018/04/19,Done My girlfriend of 2 months broke up with me suddenly. Been after this girl for 3 years. My best friend for that matter. and i finally got her to date me. She said she loved me every 20 minutes and we would make super sensual love and i could see sparkles in her eyes when she looked at me. Sunday she broke up with me because she said she was missing her ex and it wasnt fair to me. Wouldnt let me come over and say goodbye. Said it wasnt me. I have been in 3 prior relationships but i'd never felt love for someone even half as much as i love her. I've never felt more alone and every day feels like im walking in a circle with no purpose. My face stings. It hurts to live. Im either sobbing uncontrollably until i pass out from exaustion or it feels like im having a heart attack desperately trying to feel anything at all. I know my thoughts are a jumbled mess but so are my emotions. I have one friend that will die for me and im unexplainably fucking greatful but it's not enough to make me feel my life is worth anything. I hate feeling like this because im almost 20 and i've always been level headed and rational with my own emotions. Im drowning what should i do?,0.7853265306122452,3.08922819591837,2.5122959183673466,92.63538265306124,85.40816326530611,4.969387755102041,20.994897959183675,6.367922702773337,0.24428571428571424,928,30,198,9,28,305,138,245,0.151,0.679,0.17,0.5274,0,1,0,0,0,0,17.0,1,0,0,2,3,22,3,1,3,0,20,10,4,2,3,42,45,18,2,4,6,1,7,3,3,4,1,4,0,1,10,16,0,0,9,0,1,3,7,10,0,2,14,14,37,12,28,25,7,26,0,5,3,5,25,10,2,2,16,127,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08856419299470733,0.09160162377088997,0.0,0.0,0.07359274463416092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14556424969046394,0.0,0.0,0.10061816209376724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10782965153649612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09281683867800213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0761869350327792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07061557860359115,0.0,0.0,0.05703925816522752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179122222693052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09050922845290787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19897587160681415,0.0,0.09138660692224568,0.0,0.05841662752727955,0.0,0.14903627850879106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22360048346960454,0.18955388169308568,0.16984080024246348,0.09688641004002256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13666369711393928,0.08176533229854578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07073698808549883,0.0975101555152406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08732043783512411,0.0907693703357433,0.0,0.0,0.1048069240614139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946814548545778,0.0,0.5732101415776629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048606675522598376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09044029138069752,0.06247082631920022,0.1296282558201193,0.0,0.07809793930056758,0.0,0.07427093866044718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3192977436667218,0.0,0.11807451712536622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07059539828341731,0.0,0.06501673871813424,0.0,0.1364273966952408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05993214819112681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.094956081307903,0.0,0.0,0.2523923550698288,0.07033445907875757,0.0,0.0,0.07047865800610757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0749385703213197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07021489669721018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06004787562132605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06282829475884302,0.0,0.0,0.0569552309171499
lonely,shayne_42,2018/04/20,Does anyone ever feel like speaking about loneliness irl is taboo when you’re older? It’s like everyone’s set with their network of friends and when you’re someone with an unusual background and not very extroverted you’re kind of fucked. I find the more lonely and sad I get from no social support the more grouchy I get as a person which is not helping me to reach out or warm people up to me. :/,7.46386075949367,6.443795354430377,7.198575949367092,78.62925632911396,63.81012658227849,9.925316455696203,34.939873417721515,8.841846274778883,2.8107443037974686,319,12,62,4,4,101,59,79,0.248,0.606,0.147,-0.8893,0,2,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,1,0,4,9,1,0,4,0,2,1,0,0,1,13,7,7,0,0,3,0,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,2,6,0,1,2,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,6,6,11,7,2,7,0,2,0,1,6,2,1,1,6,37,8,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1830712913225969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22912127202108504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2368320329111449,0.0,0.2501811315868533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13238453586350613,0.18704493433766275,0.0,0.0,0.23929959905600034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2022822114590711,0.24204924332240466,0.2735812734165714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17549305946719487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726462225439577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2558249757969941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.181513675879052,0.2286119489436964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26689347999075785,0.22184003577101408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2971113039445403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21602969847984796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,formformer,2018/04/20,"Anyone want to talk? I’ve been gathering the courage to post something for a while, and this has been a treat of a day.. I just feel lonely. I feel lonely arriving in a school where everyone seems like a stranger. I have a hard time forming a genuine connection with individuals because I’m an introvert, and I don’t know how to reach out to people I am interested in being close to. But if someone sat down next to me and started talking, I would immediately feel at ease as if we knew each other for ages.. but normal people don’t usually do that. Because that’s weird.  I mean I can’t imagine what normal people even talk about.. we all watch the same shows, like the same movies, read the same books. The luck you need to find someone you have a good rapport with seems absurd

I would love to just.. talk. And there are so many people here who reach out, that I feel like I’m at a point where I want to as well.. I just want to hear about your day. Or your job. Or the new thing that you like. If you want to vent about your neighbor or tell me how excited you are about something, I would love to listen. Go ahead, narrate your day

I’m 24, F. If you’re in New Jersey, even better.

lonely,RawandTrue,2018/04/20,"Loneliness can warp your judgement about who truly cares for you There was a fool that I contemplated losing my virginity to a while back. Things turned sour between us when he began listening to outside parties about me. His mentor called me clingy and his best friend lied about sleeping with me. After awhile, I was getting treated like trash thinking that the dynamic would change. A close friend of mine that was familiar with him let me vent. I soon found out they were sleeping together. Instead of being honest with me, she rallied a group of my female friends against me. Ultimately, I got labeled as ugly, desperate, clingy, crazy, jealous and bitter. Safe to say that no one genuinely cared about my feelings,

Don’t make the mistake of wanting to be with someone so badly that you’re taken advantage of by individuals who don’t value you.",7.245686274509801,8.513349156862747,6.727326797385626,74.08197058823531,63.967320261437905,9.257254901960783,35.56143790849673,9.3871,3.4563626143790858,683,31,111,12,10,212,110,153,0.175,0.61,0.215,0.8181,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,1,3,1,3,10,18,2,0,6,0,11,3,2,1,0,16,24,6,0,3,0,0,1,1,3,1,0,2,0,0,8,8,0,1,3,0,0,0,3,6,0,1,8,5,23,12,24,12,1,8,0,1,0,1,19,2,0,0,7,84,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14137316284215942,0.15351126332513468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19294450211335845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18773653317768824,0.0,0.3749048954331273,0.0,0.19449423444368036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929626230969101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2015875413465448,0.42613780062198864,0.0,0.0960566603988389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14704565617132825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18800421604502932,0.0,0.08982227663022699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20568674076803192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12272465451049865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12458492077538925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1462088924989378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36797559880028097,0.0,0.15577976308689725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12214510677594714,0.11780687403835273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999814680961605,0.0,0.0,0.2211549533956789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10844245520147396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1306053322170445,0.0,0.0,0.0
lonely,eolmana,2018/04/20,"Drained after freshman year I've always heard that college is one of the best times of your life and it helps you branch out, break out of your shell. You meet new people and grow as a person and whatnot. But I'm almost done with my freshman year and while there's been good things that have happened to me in college, this year as a whole has been emotionally exhausting. If anything, I feel like I've become more socially awkward, more lonely, and in general, a lot unhappier. So much shit has happened in this year alone. The friends I met at the beginning of the year kicked me out of their group. A guy that I befriended and then dated broke up with me because I was too clingy and depressing, and it hurt a lot because he was one of my only friends and we used to be super close. Now we're not on talking terms and he likely hates me. It doesn't help that I see him in class three times a week. After he broke up with me I threw myself at other guys and slept around a lot in what I guess was an attempt to find that same friendship and affection I got from my ex. One hookup that I got emotionally attached to got tired of me and pushed me away after a few months. We're not on speaking terms anymore either. A close friend of mine stopped being my friend without telling me why and doesn't respond to my messages. 

I do have a few friends that I try to see a few times a week, but they're all pretty busy and can't hang out as often as I'd like. I've tried joining clubs to meet new people but I've found that for some reason, being around people in tnat sort of setting makes me feel more alone. There's something depressing about joining a club by yourself instead of with a friend or two. You see how close everyone in that club is and want in on that, but don't know where to start and with who. And why would they want to take you into their friend group? Who wants to take the time and effort in the middle of the year to accommodate a newcomer? Not all clubs are as welcoming as they say they are. They only want to meet new people at the beginning of the year.

On top of this, I'm also stressed out all the time because of academics and pretty sleep deprived. I know that to get over breakups and loneliness and stuff I need  to throw myself at new hobbies and focus on academics. I often don't have the energy or motivation to focus on academics. I have interests I want to pursue but I can't do that and manage my academics at the same time. I know I need to focus on myself and take care of myself but I can't. I'm the type of person who constantly needs to be surrounded by friends to feel less lonely but my friends aren't always available. I don't know how to be happy by myself.

Tldr, freshman year has been socially and emotionally exhausting and I've been more prone to loneliness than I normally am.",5.606844359828656,5.409190839441539,5.864889735046803,83.94075202284628,67.30715532286213,8.830271299381248,29.754561320006342,8.296473431620573,1.8877113438045368,2233,71,466,27,33,713,231,573,0.096,0.769,0.135,0.9788,0,6,1,0,0,0,41.0,1,6,6,6,16,33,2,2,29,0,37,7,3,7,3,101,80,49,0,11,15,1,3,3,9,1,4,3,0,4,25,44,0,1,11,4,0,5,13,14,0,5,16,9,58,19,92,58,23,82,0,8,3,0,52,40,1,12,38,321,83,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06265312040909067,0.1296037906454761,0.0,0.05003585164153354,0.10412368554129084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062050946870551016,0.0,0.0,0.051488384609684204,0.11139811504578133,0.0,0.0,0.0587849830375967,0.0,0.0,0.11442317565841965,0.06910177815011323,0.0,0.0,0.06566157690875746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063792557847772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06761411090515493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10777998041895312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06402910021133283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2111427680998094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05978669761553002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490924632614832,0.04469881025332348,0.0,0.0,0.05718629809343495,0.0,0.0,0.06860291796340875,0.4350610615403312,0.0,0.03268935743331594,0.0,0.0,0.052479326475271766,0.15012476991108678,0.0,0.06892604298766544,0.12390491967816508,0.11065789258589008,0.06660512510824311,0.0,0.06177324854284502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08387643315416803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06698066555934468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375436185314736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04419384483824233,0.0917031414807077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15958000869651467,0.0,0.0,0.041764830054641315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049941424851497065,0.0,0.04599490405515341,0.13918081812593947,0.0,0.24171543899394946,0.0,0.0,0.0613036552955975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12719371012227934,0.09517203218098744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1735079409711083,0.1092644627202733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12730892167196092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433063922575878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049756828178099115,0.0,0.0,0.14957651722491286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422546689952162,0.0,0.0,0.06261349200552807,0.12756101695242675,0.0,0.0481681387105905,0.0,0.0,0.04428616896979448,0.0,0.0,0.05230990537513575,0.07167178303886779,0.0,0.07162574094610548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14113073799765535,0.050290034255820334,0.054687457186655616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04156760226256775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21890449406908213,0.07191306348917535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08495954526086799,0.0,0.06112014335660412,0.0,0.0,0.05403892732528014,0.0,0.0,0.18452203961226746,0.0,0.1003770418992282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11291632843662995,0.06985527912031107,0.0,0.06031361415482962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04444672935549558,0.0,0.0,0.3223355010567768

lonely,lonelyguy1423,2018/04/20,"Why do I have no friends? For the past 4 or so years, I've had a very small amount of friends. It all started when I changed schools when going to 6th grade (born in '02). I'm a guy btw, if you couldn't tell.

Before, I used to have a lot of friends, about half the guys on my class in 1-5th grade, although I would be very awkward around them. Now, I basically have none, even when I did have friends in my current school, it was only one guy.

One of my friends from the previous school came to the school I'm still in right now. I'm now on 9th grade, going to high school next year, so I'll probably get friends from there. At least I hope. Anyway back to what I was saying. I was really good friends with this guy from the very first day in this new school, to about summer 2017. We would see almost everyday, almost always going to my house to play Xbox, sometimes going outside. He was a lot like me in a lot of ways back then.

Now I'm not the biggest people person, so I got kind of anxious seeing a friend everyday for multiple years in a row, so I told him a few times that I didn't want to hang out as much. I told him I'd like to hang out maybe 2-3 times a week, or whenever I ask him. He would always be the one to ask me to hang out, and I would always agree, even if I didn't necessarily want to. This might've lead to him thinking that I didn't want to be friends with thim, which was not the case.

After the summer in 2017, he started hanging out with a lot of the other guys on my class, and stopped asking me if I could hang out, pretty much completely. After then, I've seen him outside of school maybe 5 times. I actually haven't seen anyone on my free time aside from my family and relatives in the past 3-4 months.

Now to the question. Why do I have no friends? I honestly couldn't give you a clear answer, that's why I'm posting this. Here's a few things that could be the reason as to why:

- I don't have a lot to talk about aside from school or video games, since those are the only two things I do
- I might act weird in school because I'm very anxious a lot of the time, although I've been feeling a lot less anxiety lately
- I used to be a complete idiot, just like a lot of other people when they were 12
- I don't know how to start a conversation

Even though all of these would be the reason I'm lonely, I still don't get how no one else seems to want to be my friend. It could be because they think I'm an asshole, because I don't talk to anyone. Or they could think I don't want friends, or that I have friends outside of school. 

Basically I don't know why nobody seems interested in talking to me. It felt good writing this though.

lonely,emifyden,2018/04/20,Press f Girlfriend of almost 2 years and my first real love ended things with me yesterday out of nowhere. I thought we were doing okay. She fell for someone else and had been dropping hints for at least a month. I'm glad she's going to be happy now but my heart still hurts. Waking up a few minutes ago and knowing I'm single....and she's not mine anymore just wrecks me.

lonely,Aelwyd,2018/04/20,"Why does it feel so hard to have a good friend? I feel lonely in this age, the age of 2018. I have quit Facebook, but every time I reopen it, I can't help but feel fomo, even though I am doing really well for myself. Doesn't it always seem like you have to try really hard to get people to like you enough to just hold their short attention span? I feel exhausted. I'm not motivated. I'm trying to forget how lonely I am. I've started a diet over a month ago, I joined a gym, I'm saving money. I don't do drugs anymore. I'm boring but I'm healthy, but I feel just so empty. Anyone else feel that way?

I've definitely been worse, maybe haven't been better, but no matter what accomplishment I make in my career, it's always met with a hollow acceptance, as in, it's just never enough to make me feel good about being me. It makes me feel like maybe I am worth other people's time, maybe I am worth a friend sticking around, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure why this is so hard.

lonely,cryx0,2018/04/20,"I’m getting older. And I fucking hate it, every second I lose any scrap of hope or confidence I have left. I’m getting older and I really don’t like the direction my life is headed. I wish there was a way to change this but I’m hopeless. I have downright horrid communication skills, and struggle with the the most basic interactions.

I don’t want to live life more like this. I’m not even living it either, I feel as if I’m existing. Existing and not doing anything of importance. I’ve been hurt bad by past ‘friends’ and I feel hurt once again. I truly think there isn’t any way out. I don’t know how can get out of this. I’m getting older and I don’t wanna bring this issues along as I age.

I am lonely once again and this time there just isn’t any hope for me.

lonely,PepperOniiSan,2018/04/20,"I feel selfish... I honestly just need to vent. Before last year, I didn't know that loneliness could feel so crippling. I was dealing with a lot of stuff at the time with nobody to help me through it. I was ready to call it quits, if you know what I mean. Then one person randomly reached her hand out and helped pull me out of that dark place. Though we're only online friends, it really helped me out. For almost a year, we'd talk, watch movies and shows, and play games with each other constantly. I felt like I wasn't alone. But recently we've had a bit of a falling out. We still message each other from time to time, but we grown distant. And the darkness is creeping back. She goes out and does her own thing and hangs out with her irl friends. I don't want her to feel pressured or obligated to talk to me since she's been such a good friend, but at the same time, I feel so lost and alone. I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to be selfish, but I don't want to feel lonely.

lonely,LordMoy,2018/04/20,"I keep make posts looking for friends and delete them a day later   And I've ghosted more people than I would like to admit. I don't know why, one day I swallow my pride and say all the stuff I'm interested in in a friend and talk about my hobbies. I get some replies, we hit it off well but then next day I delete my post and just ignore the people who replied.

I don't know why I'm like this but I keep getting this itch whenever I remember how I only have school friends, no one to talk to after school.

Lastly I know I can help myself I just need some words of wisdom from you folks to get me motivated!
