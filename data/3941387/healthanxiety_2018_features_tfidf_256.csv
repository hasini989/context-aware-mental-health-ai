healthanxiety,Nomis176,2018/01/01,"Final doctor appointment tomorrow, tired of constantly seeking reassurance! Ive decided that Im having my final doctor appointment tomorrow, this is something that has been a huge battle for me, but over the last weeks I have decided that this is the only way I can and will make it out of this anxiety.


Here is the deal: I have been experiencing multiple symptoms as mentioned before in other posts, the symptoms have varied from Brain fog, dizzyness, blurred vision, sore throat, swollen tonsils, coating on my tongue (yellow and white) very reduced energy, fatigue and headaches. The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away, and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time, the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms, which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out!

Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 2-3 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it, as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times. Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off, so I guess i will be dropping it off completely, atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation.

Even though I feel somewhat weak and off, Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems, and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person. Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for  the truth, hopefully this will take my mind to other places.  Its wierd how something as minor as a sore throat lasting for a long time, can make you feel so sure its something serious!",9.13790909090909,7.282427881818188,8.61606060606061,72.47409090909092,61.09090909090909,11.345454545454546,39.57575757575758,9.888512548439397,3.837066666666667,1371,58,250,21,15,437,172,330,0.13,0.7490000000000001,0.121,-0.3075,0,0,3,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,0,2,12,16,1,3,16,0,31,21,4,5,2,53,53,28,0,4,2,0,4,0,0,5,17,1,0,2,26,22,0,0,12,1,0,4,2,8,0,0,8,8,33,8,39,39,4,49,0,1,2,0,9,19,0,7,23,172,59,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1328584597738892,0.19619971230020106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08158519150823812,0.06677145112798592,0.0,0.052934361899321936,0.0,0.07389095965786993,0.0,0.0,0.0767993016076186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09693758869154907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496028869076066,0.09104579460231624,0.09383876462681444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08952400542970239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35552091457599044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05735429649274724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0977145353000003,0.17562737142055707,0.0,0.0,0.2853734693067509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045368176508150636,0.0,0.09870169225139884,0.07283383747801861,0.0694506060926754,0.0,0.09565953967286604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18460501344329286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08624764731976059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28139303657458103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04772274260694034,0.14156570533399504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684704363869024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07382478141889147,0.0,0.08216623321500706,0.11592728218149485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08767951023584641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438772349856614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604261896910044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.082894697312276,0.0,0.15164352621105542,0.0907250389756262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316479363210545,0.0,0.0,0.08309023394289966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05562930450630788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260083117840468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09760719585777182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20055156699384666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19894047230474385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08184181310025508,0.36102301799342185,0.06528979393639613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057689916980343627,0.05564094184675674,0.08531583608367725,0.0,0.15190414411804673,0.0998050990838275,0.08231028478432148,0.0,0.0,0.05895587965150596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07499834153074522,0.0,0.14329743215593418,0.0,0.06892629976169845,0.06965452538398638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055919475996960656

healthanxiety,bulk_barn,2018/01/01,"Listening to your body? I'm curious how those of us with health anxiety can listen to our bodies. It seems the general advice when trying to figure out what's wrong is listen to your body, you know it best, you tell your doctor when something is off.  But it doesn't really work that way when I'm convinced every itch means I have lymphoma or a pimple is a tumour...so how can people with health anxiety know when something is wrong?!

healthanxiety,parthkhurana7,2018/01/01,"This is killing me So i had a bacterial stomach infection(pain in the right side), thought it was appendix. Doctor gave some antibiotics and the pain went away. But that infection gave me health anxiety for life.
I’ve been having excessive gas since a month which is mostly due to stress. I was convinced i had stomach cancer, but no black stools or blood and I’m 20 so doctor ruled that out.
Then i was convinced that my kidney failed, but no. I googled a lot that night and was sure of it, woke up breathless that night.. insomnia took over.
Then i was convinced that i have brain tumor(google is evil), but haven’t really had even a single symptom.

The only concern now is insomnia, has been a month now, I generally get 6-8 hours a day but wake up once or twice a night, I’m generally a deep sleeper.
Any solutions?

healthanxiety,chillimustache,2018/01/01,"Health anxiety following stomach flu, anyone else? I have moderate to severe health anxiety especially when I’m sick, then it’s pretty severe. 

About 6 days ago I came down with a stomach virus and was violently puking and had water like diarrhea (sorry if TMI). By day 3 I was no longer feeling the nausea or diarrhea, but have a general sense of being unwell/dehydrated/drained. 

I feel as though my anxiety is playing a big factor because I can’t stop thinking about it and feel like I’m drained and depleted, which isn’t normal cause my energy is usually very high. 

Is it normal for constant worrying to drain you and wear you out physically???

healthanxiety,Dustycrusties,2018/01/02,"The worst things about hypochondria Hypochondria is the worst thing to ever happen to me, everyday I’m crippled by it. I guess I just wanted to make a list of all the worst things I go through as a hypochondriac.

1. Seeing healthy people and wishing you were like them (even though you probably are healthy but your brain is telling you you’re not)
2. Changing daily routines based off the health issue you think you have at the time
3. Changing your entire diet to become healthier (for me it has been limiting carbs and sugars because I’m afraid of developing diabetes)
4. Checking your pulse all the time to make sure your heart is beating properly (unfortunately for me my heart is never beating normally, I have constant heart palpitations and my heart races a lot, not even sure if it’s due to anxiety. I’m scared it’s something serious)
5. Having very bad mental health days where you can’t leave your house (this happens to me a lot)
6. Not knowing if your symptoms are caused by anxiety or something serious (this drives me absolutely insane)
7. Not being able to lead a normal productive (for me I can’t hold a job, because I always fear something bad will happen to me at work and I’ll panic)
8. Being triggered by seeing things on shows or in movies. For instance, a man has a heart attack in the show your watching and then you freak out about having a heart attack
9. Obsessively looking up symptoms and not being able to stop once you start
10. Wasting a ton of money on doctors appointments only for them to say you’re okay
11. Being in tons of debt from going to the ER because you think you’re dying
12. Always looking for reassurance from others, obsessively asking others if they ever have the same symptoms as you so you don’t feel alone

These are the only ones I can think of right now, but feel free to list the things you deal with as a hypochondriac I’m curious about what others go through.",4.4947796673870135,6.325902694822894,5.0359804566381685,81.4973569482289,71.09809264305177,7.568880954618058,28.186507563656864,8.216663640201805,1.9999366531992864,1527,57,277,23,29,488,190,367,0.172,0.763,0.065,-0.9921,2,1,3,0,0,0,36.0,0,19,3,5,12,22,2,6,22,1,25,16,7,5,7,50,52,19,1,7,13,0,2,1,0,1,7,1,0,1,16,8,2,3,6,2,4,5,9,16,1,1,2,9,38,7,48,45,10,30,0,0,5,0,28,12,0,8,14,189,54,4,0.14947645586418087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07740626426743223,0.0,0.0,0.12437638558821736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434907960104697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06987015419734334,0.1700510476673138,0.0,0.0,0.12480659701085847,0.13667919015675192,0.0825425008666418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08343257978820848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07677674767864569,0.158126270433561,0.0,0.0,0.08076547315268791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04819997407686778,0.07705183125340946,0.0,0.0,0.07756648094906744,0.0,0.0,0.07649774321837469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09872778935226124,0.1352100120177518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08410128488780659,0.0755797873499013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12742637183083674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233258412951915,0.0,0.1982723044006782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15888648274942666,0.0,0.5313909597003872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08623788048706882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07800729235988436,0.07416615892484438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04107417549795934,0.0,0.0,0.0791369920318801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03651332299390663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12552257631851724,0.0,0.0,0.12707953744708075,0.0,0.0,0.0997766949930428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07531855513673423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057642728846830665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1464551898902728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0795937735557873,0.05064455748732628,0.1136835803517792,0.0,0.08768920722751426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05181407682760721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058045051436395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382603829126568,0.0,0.059434838624414815,0.07482600434930216,0.0,0.11911338254177185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17261141772472285,0.0,0.0,0.052900102405881666,0.0,0.0,0.06248450510754359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14087979067079806,0.23304490673344386,0.0,0.0,0.06532450543338966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24826378840271554,0.1436677159845211,0.07342992947656916,0.0,0.08716092347221985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06166686526440105,0.04408254323506187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08594527367788374,0.0,0.0,0.054410320062560434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Sharklovaaa,2018/01/02,"I might be losing my mind... I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for around 6 months now. In the last 6 months I’ve convinced myself I’ve had pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical cancer, arthritis, periodontitis, and most recently lymphoma.

I have a swollen lymph node on my neck that feels like two small lymph nodes stuck together, I’m worried they are matted, which typically points to cancer. I noticed the lump about two weeks ago, it’s maybe 1.5cm in size and moves when I press on it.

Every day I bounce back and forth between anxiety and calmness.

healthanxiety,Ajwwr82,2018/01/02,"I've been crying all day - sure my time is up About 3 years ago, a good friend of mine passed away from acute leukemia at the age of 19. I was devastated, and with a lifelong battle with health anxiety it always lingered in my mind anytime I would get ill. Would this be the time I faced the same fate?

Well now this time I'm more or less certain that the time has come. I came down with some infection from a coworker back on November 18th. At first is was merely a slight sore throat, some coughing, malaise. I began to feel better around the end of November. Then the first week of December the sore throat came back. And fever, severe congestion, cough, fatigue, achy muscles amongst other things. I began to feel better from that, but have not been the same since. As of right now, I have a terrible cough, irritated throat , congestion. I have been having night sweats where my neck and head get very damp, but I am not drenched and it only affects the head and neck. I am simply not myself. 

The positives that have kept me hopeful I do not have acute leukemia :
-I have been able to make it to the gym to lift about 3-4 times a week. I don't have much motivation to do so, but I make it and my strength is still there. 
-I have not lost any weight, gained a few pounds actually, currently at 6'0"" and 220 pounds
-when I do feel bad, I'm never running a fever, my temp is usually somewhere between 96.9 and 98.5
-I'm not bruising at all, even after bumping into things, and I don't have any petechia anywhere to suggest low platelets
- my infections haven't been severe, per se. I haven't had sore throats like that of strep and no mouth sores or bleeding gums , they've just been persistent 
- I've been going out on the weekends with friends for a few drinks, which ironically when I am not sober I do not experience night sweats at all
- the guy who originally got me sick is still sick himself, and my entire family is sick back and forth

But nonetheless, I can't help but think this is it for me. I just keep looking at pictures of my mom or baby sister or handmade birthday cards from my sister - just little sentimental things - and I start crying like a baby. I don't want to leave them, I don't want my family and friends to go through what my friend's loved ones went through three years ago when they lost her, I love life so much and I don't want it to end. It's all I can think about though.  I don't really know where to go from here. Nobody in my family thinks it's odd I've been sick for the better part of 6 weeks, and I put on a front to everyone that I'm fine to not alarm them, but on the inside I'm falling apart.",5.710125786163522,5.3782047924528325,5.7271698113207545,85.46786163522013,67.11320754716982,9.17987421383648,29.176100628930826,8.648137234880735,1.829828930817611,2060,61,448,28,30,648,252,530,0.14400000000000002,0.736,0.12,-0.8833,1,0,1,0,0,1,66.0,0,0,3,11,26,26,1,1,26,0,49,38,12,5,7,80,87,34,0,6,22,3,4,2,4,2,22,0,0,1,23,26,2,2,8,3,0,12,20,8,1,4,20,5,52,18,59,64,15,76,0,4,1,2,18,24,0,7,42,288,75,1,0.08188400060253671,0.0,0.07990697267898403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1451704518725329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06813404809183353,0.0,0.0,0.1113678566635024,0.0,0.06264103633457499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07289412095251863,0.0,0.0,0.07693271402255394,0.18889122619691007,0.06836972020612803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2172592329006491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18730696508527814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07053581601416731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1798914593708687,0.052808406294282115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08021514702587765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14504984014965458,0.0,0.0,0.05408361013157326,0.0,0.0,0.07824367163747885,0.0,0.08009826489710611,0.23157884483592475,0.0,0.12420903313072065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13930097816411327,0.0,0.0,0.2530535029738961,0.0,0.08556202135466873,0.0,0.13960969367986806,0.06868041474531295,0.06549011552766072,0.0,0.0,0.08107803438074702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16807321630589686,0.08703886357200315,0.0,0.0,0.05488511956322649,0.0,0.0,0.08132928860869601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278226207809826,0.0,0.0,0.04500130527953673,0.0,0.0,0.08670333352176078,0.0,0.0,0.057837091223163835,0.08000877314753431,0.08206928030255439,0.0,0.0,0.06876193749359844,0.0,0.17877211898344222,0.0,0.1478070150172379,0.0,0.10931641248375687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08267949810390332,0.09590155185238752,0.0,0.0,0.1203883242734568,0.0,0.0631539892531905,0.0,0.0,0.1536851751823114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05548671798287095,0.0622764722926128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08867239311494007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08231603711827376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05245698754565293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06992848910798825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1850112266534863,0.0,0.06773529146433273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057957917081113634,0.0,0.13078533731012287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07717470151054874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16320027457135408,0.15740388376522424,0.0804506148442131,0.0,0.2387360962251437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09018365817922584,0.0675628760833737,0.14489191529003093,0.0,0.1970472183497362,0.09971265305569106,0.07362355041482031,0.07590728891924896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11633608932258326,0.0,0.0,0.10546122343123612
healthanxiety,InkyH,2018/01/02,"Extreme tiredness all day every day Lately, I've been sleeping 12 hours a night and I wake up extremely tired, I can't move for hours because of the overwhelming tiredness. I keep falling back asleep after I hit snooze, and I have intense dreams right away, then my alarm goes off again and the same repeats until I drag myself out of bed because I'm too hungry. 

I am extremely tired all day as if I had multiple sleepless nights in a row, while I actually sleep 11 hours per night. I'm Feverish (but no fever most of the time), I feel like my forehead and eyes are hot and heavy, cold chills with sweating, extreme fatigue, muscular pain all over. I feel like I can't function properly, I'm sluggish and think slowly, my mind is clouded. My eyes keep going out of focus randomly. When someone talks to me, their voice echoes in my head, as if it was waking me up (while I'm already up and awake). I randomly start falling asleep/zone out even when standing up, and get a falling sensation when trying to resist. 

It's true I had insomnia for awhile, and whatnot, but I don't know why I keep being so tired now that I am sleeping. I do wake up multiple times per night, because my mouth is dry, or because I have to pee or other things, but it's not really new. I think my sleep is just not normal, or something is very wrong with me.

I'm tired of being tired. I've convinced myself I probably have leukemia, anemia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy or something else. :( I don't even have the energy to go to the doctor.

Am i dying?

Edit: I've been taking Nexium for 5 months, and the leaflet says it can mess with your white blood cells, causing intense fatigue, pain all over and a fever. It can also cause hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hallucinations, insomnia 
Etc. maybe that's the culprit? The side effect list also reads ""Sleep disorder"", what could it mean? I've tired stopping this drug but it's making me sick.",4.2928629500580735,5.839989520325204,4.931214672861014,83.1807012195122,71.1409214092141,7.656252419667053,28.35472319008905,8.192908349453996,1.924852806813784,1499,56,285,22,28,481,196,369,0.16699999999999998,0.789,0.043,-0.9923,0,0,3,0,0,0,60.0,0,1,1,1,13,12,0,2,12,0,27,36,19,4,5,56,48,33,1,4,13,0,3,2,0,0,17,2,1,0,13,17,0,4,7,2,0,6,7,8,0,0,5,9,38,4,34,39,7,52,0,3,3,0,5,16,0,9,31,171,51,3,0.0,0.0,0.07282542058186539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08235301444266557,0.11935875283148185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011474802962213,0.057383740662522414,0.0,0.18196828998336145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15332546384213055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05958377821675505,0.0,0.0,0.14438518703827408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774512924140533,0.0,0.08552928179569179,0.07638414179072968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865439051665421,0.0,0.06234148259145705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08322909879217025,0.09858117564384587,0.0,0.06287666787217079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07546754911406807,0.10662742953013177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03898965248014651,0.0,0.08482475991498213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07658907762152628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22047839499864236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989963579785732,0.0,0.0,0.0410131791236926,0.0,0.0841827766187589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07291819924296407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049814261814251325,0.0,0.07497309259726614,0.08129094147187242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07535223799684634,0.0,0.05956675053326992,0.07931694520916169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07207545288007937,0.0,0.2801304352953693,0.07311884978509905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15881728874526996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08046078614475534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07464743462790578,0.0,0.04780812052306148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06373125472294375,0.0,0.05934657611841763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4480868060213198,0.0,0.06323141780047868,0.11490338975139099,0.0,0.0,0.052821544177847166,0.0,0.0,0.062391713755965486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056110396582131225,0.059982548229924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04957902185616828,0.09563624343082593,0.0,0.0,0.0870314869042281,0.5146382017349872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05066699691711413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06157528813234855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0673394760673902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159317114411704,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Wackyal123,2018/01/02,"2018, already panicking... So, last year, I had multiple blood tests an X-ray and an ultrasound due to abdominal pain. I was also getting pains in my legs, and weird hot sensations too. 

Doc said bloods were fine, no lymphoma or leukaemia, or diabetes, and nothing else to worry about. 

Here I am 2 months later and I’m getting pain in my left arm too. In the muscles specifically. No idea of the cause. Worried as fuck. Also keep waking up itching (since I had oral thrush and took some meds, left me itching on and off) and had a rash this morning on my arms. 

Anyone have any ideas. All I can think is strain of some kind or low vitamin d but I’d expect that to show up in a blood test. Totally stressed about it all.

She is just now recovering from having a serious cold where she had 104 degree fever and intense symptoms. I would like to sleep in the same bed as her, but I know for a fact that I’m gonna get sick being so close to her for 5 days. The trip is still gonna happen and I’m leaving tomorrow. How should I go through with this without getting sick? Thanks guys!

healthanxiety,reincarnatedavocado,2018/01/02,"Convinced I have lymphoma So I just turned 20 and I have myself totally convinced I have lymphoma. About two months ago I noticed a lymph node on the left side of my neck that was enlarged. Well, it's still there. It doesn't hurt (which I've read is more worrisome than painful ones), it fluctuates in size throughout the day, its not rock hard but it's not really soft, and I can't really move it that much. I'm really worried that it's lymphoma, I don't have any swollen lymph nodes under my arms, groin or collarbone that I can tell. Nor do I have any other symptoms that are commonly associated with lymphoma, but I know that a lot of people don't show any symptoms so it's not really reassuring. I don't have health insurance so I can't go to the doctor as I please. However I am trying to get into this affordable doctor near me within the next couple of weeks to ease my mind. I've been having panic attacks over it, last night I had one and I was seriously about to go to the ER but my boyfriend talked me down. It's so exhausting.

healthanxiety,thornykins,2018/01/02,"Heart health anxiety Hi all, stumbled across this sub doing, what else, some late night symptom googling, and I couldn't be more glad to see it. I've had generalized anxiety for years, but recently it's started to manifest more as health anxiety, triggered when my cat died of sudden onset congestive heart failure a few months ago. 

I've had chest pain in the upper left side for almost a week now, and I can't seem to convince myself that I'm not dying. I've had two normal EKGs, normal bloodwork except for an elevated d dimer level, and a normal x-ray and CT. After all that, I'm still not able to stop my anxiety that the twinge in my arm is a heart attack, or the burning sensation in my back is an aortic dissection. Any suggestions for calming the anxiety beast?

I am a 25 year old female. I went to the doctor a couple days ago, they did the phalan test and they said it’s carpal tunnel. But I occasionally feel weird nerve pain in my thighs and feet. I have no other symptoms other that minor twitching (that could be from researching so much on google). My grandmother died of ALS so it worries me whenever I have nerve issues.

healthanxiety,TeezusRa,2018/01/02,"Finally getting better. My anxiety was to a point where every few days I was posting in the sub and r/Anxiety. I suspect my anxiety was worsened by being on antibiotics, at pretty heavy doses destroying my gut bacteria, and a hormone imbalance from going on and off of birth control after 5 years of being on it (been off it for 3 months now). Noticed it was WAY worse in the week leading up to my period, the week of, and a week after. This cycle, I actually only had anxiety *during*, and before it was because I was flying (huge fear of mine). Whatever imbalances I had, I think they've finally begun to balance out.

Now, my only health fear at this moment is a DVT from the flight from LAX to Hawaii, even though I know it's mostly from long haul flights, and I obsessively made sure to move in my seat as much as possible... not to mention I was rather active during my stay in Hawaii. My left leg has some weird muscle twitches every so often, but none of the other symptoms-
 in fact the twitches aren't even a symptom. But damn, I'm so much better than I was at my peak anxiety weeks. 

This year, going to go to therapy, and I've started exercising (though I'm afraid my heart will give out despite being only 21, pretty healthy with a perfect EKG and no health issues, and a former athlete, my heart races bc I'm simply just out of shape... baby steps). 

What helped me a lot was writing down my instances of anxiety, and working through them. It's called ABC therapy model used in CBT. http://images.slideplayer.com/20/6041594/slides/slide_10.jpg

When I wrote down my current fixation, such as a brain tumor, I wrote down why I felt that way (even symptoms!), reasons why it's probably not likely (had two physical brain checks, docs said I was fine just head and neck tension, and I didn't have any severe symptoms). Then I wrote how I felt after working through it.

Pinpointing my anxiety to particular times, such as my period, helped me realize that it's really likelu just a hormonal thing, and ya know, every time I was about to be or on my period I probably didn't have cancer or a tumor or some horrible disease or ailment because I knew it was most likely just anxiety. I encourage you all to journal your anxiety! It helps you see trends, it helps a ton to rationalize.

healthanxiety,Frozgaar,2018/01/02,"Soapy taste in mouth. Sodium Fluoride poisoning? I started noticing a soapy aftertaste when I was drinking coffee a little while ago. I first thought it was something in the coffee maker, but I then drank some water and it had the same soapy after taste. I had a friend taste the water and they said they didn't taste any soapiness. It became obvious it was just me. It's possible I got some shampoo in my mouth when I shower shortly before drinking the coffee, but I don't remember that happening. 

I decided to Google soapy taste in mouth, and it said it's a possible symptom of sodium fluoride poisoning. My hypochondriac side started getting worried. I drink a lot of unfiltered tap water but I don't know if that's enough to get sodium fluoride poisoning.

I just got over a cold, so I don't know if that has anything to do it. This seems like a silly thing to be worried about, but Google gets me paranoid as usual.

healthanxiety,duckydonut,2018/01/03,"Flat Stool and Dull Stomach Pain. Could it be IBS? Colon Cancer? Just flat out Anxiety? Lately I've noticed that my stool has been softer, floating, and generally flatter than before.  They are not absurdly flat, you'd only notice it if you examined them closely because they float around. I've really noticed this over the past couple of weeks. I haven't really had a solid and long stool in a while. In addition to this, I've been having some dull abdominal pain that kind of radiates on my sides and in the middle of my abdomen. Nothing that keeps me from walking around and exercising though. The pain radiates for a couple of minutes and subsides when I stop thinking about it.

I went to the doctor two weeks ago complaining about the abdominal pain (this was before I noticed anything about the poop). I had a blood test and a urine test taken and basically they came back all clear. 

For the record, I'm 19, male, and overweight. My college diet combined with inaccessibility to the gym has caused me to gain weight over the past two years.

My biggest questions for are these: When is the right time to contact my doctor again? Since the blood and urine tests came back completely normal, is it right to assume that my stool is just a byproduct of me being anxious and general change of diet? I'm on my school's winter break. Meaning this is a big diet change and physical activity change. I'm no longer eating food in bad dining halls, I'm making my own.

IBS? Colon Cancer?? Please help me out. From Googling, I'm convinced I want a colonoscopy.",4.298458904109591,6.494313407534246,4.765884931506848,81.69692328767125,72.45890410958904,7.274739726027397,26.74849315068493,8.109356740369918,1.8052590136986304,1233,44,222,19,25,391,158,292,0.15,0.797,0.054000000000000006,-0.9826,0,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,2,4,1,13,11,0,0,19,0,19,26,9,2,2,42,33,17,0,4,4,0,1,0,0,0,10,0,0,1,13,21,8,2,5,2,0,4,3,8,0,2,9,1,25,3,34,20,3,42,0,2,0,0,12,20,0,4,17,138,38,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08297676725679386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07160893454023673,0.10574902327506557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07703040848557656,0.16665976941303806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439556797848791,0.07815775576612895,0.057061827491134434,0.0,0.1593049596468549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2141224504984571,0.0,0.09615995367717976,0.2970707010867351,0.0,0.0981449334417532,0.0,0.0,0.0747374012073284,0.20714825500633371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19162102242405013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09578311031983032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11318969634455567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06274265503916678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08320201174520132,0.0,0.09747706228806834,0.0,0.0,0.10559253104117323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08283905935533327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06248325605528132,0.0,0.0,0.1019652309593947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09171477499005998,0.08981823508277392,0.42628778193529016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07119217830272559,0.3984168773063007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1787165367917088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275214066758194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10486102245341268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11993380720175975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15987936637209407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09473506414973837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07743250010466428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825946394384807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059979448342883414,0.09196819128806866,0.0,0.054582869273323176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1828804552773127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05521170723717478,0.0,0.15017143378425374,0.11398784667866654,0.0,0.08677442777786723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06027970071315954

healthanxiety,justsomerandomnick,2018/01/03,"Does anyone else worry about early-onset dementia? Firstly - I lurk here from time to time and I don't see this come up very often, so I'm sorry if this gives anyone yet more to worry about. Feel free to stop reading now!

I don't know how this has got into my head, but you know how these things can suddenly take hold, right? You read something by mistake, or someone tells you something you didn't want to hear about how this guy got diagnosed with Alzheimer's in his 30s or whatever, and suddenly it's occupying your every waking moment. These ideas have taken root in my mind and I can't make them go away.

I've been under a lot of stress at work for a long time. I'm responsible for the finances in a company which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy for several years, and in September I had my first ever panic attack over worries that we wouldn't be able to make payroll. I know intellectually that the symptoms I'm experiencing can rationally be explained by this, but still. I can't stop thinking about it. I've felt over the past few months that I can't think or write as fluently as I could. I make more mistakes. I feel scatterbrained and foggy, and I struggle to concentrate. I feel like it takes me longer to do things that should be much easier than I'm finding them.

It's led me to start compulsively and repeatedly testing myself on things I ""should"" know, which of course makes the anxiety and racing thoughts worse. Can't instantly recall all my PINs and passwords? Dementia. Can't find the right word while I'm talking? Dementia. Repeat myself while I'm typing a sentence? Dementia. Can't remember who starred in that film I saw last week? Dementia. Can't remember every detail of my journey to work? Dementia. It's taken me ages to write this. Dementia.

Flash forward a few years, and I see myself sat in a chair unable to recognise my family :-(. It's horrible.

I just wanted to get this out. I know there are a lot of people in this sub who will have fellow feeling.

healthanxiety,K_gg90,2018/01/03,"Eye stuff Hey,

So sometimes when I look at a wall especially the sides that meet I see them getting distorted or even rippled.


Then when I start staring at them it becomes more rippled and then everything starts blending together making it look all white.
(walla are white)

I just wanna know if anyone's had any similar experiences like this. Also just to be clear this only happens with the sides of the walls that meet its more noticeable in the dark but it also happens in the light as well.

I am getting major anxiety over this so please fast replies would be appreciated ",3.814290569243841,6.600232757009351,4.4148513169073915,80.73564995751912,76.57009345794394,7.255395072217502,28.418861512319456,8.296473431620573,2.358409345794392,463,20,80,9,11,147,77,107,0.035,0.8340000000000001,0.131,0.8942,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,2,0,10,2,0,0,6,0,6,1,1,1,2,13,17,13,0,3,5,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,10,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,8,7,2,10,13,4,16,0,0,7,0,5,9,0,2,8,58,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32076498595335806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13638319900970725,0.0,0.15342281301876626,0.0,0.0,0.14023161039425106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22149548943895805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13246363869648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18024447703529925,0.1961797223915564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20956176289438924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35469744389718305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11021891158738643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09798026789428856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33682871472755377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13387096138382834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283313914665684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15252990887611145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2201474238673721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1598151054778732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19835245490362666,0.0,0.2839054778020919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2295856774166043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18032160497376806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14246739137696512,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,ThatsHowYouGetAnts__,2018/01/03,"Pins and Needles Sensation All Over I’m a 18 year old soon to to be 19 yo black male. I probably font have the healthiest lifestyle but I’m no doctor. For the past few days I’ve had this pins and needles sensation all over kind of like a numbness like I can see myself doing thing but I don’t feel it the same way. I’ve smoked weed pretty frequently over the past few weeks but I’m by no means a heavy smoker. I was wondering if this could be a symptom of early onset diabetes (not sure if it’s that severe though) or perhaps carpal tunnel because as my thumb has been giving me problem for several years as in got jammed by a football nd perhaps hasn’t healed properly. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated

healthanxiety,Imsoscared105,2018/01/03,"Dr.’s office blew up my phone about results of blood test I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for a few months now after a lymes disease scare in November. I found myself fine tuned to any aches/pains in my body at this time out of paranoia of getting lymes disease. After my blood test came back negative, I still felt these aches and pains and now started to attribute them to severe diseases, like cancer, and driving myself crazy. These pains seem to be deep in my bone and very painful, but I simply don’t know if they’re psychosomatic or real. I find it hard to believe I could imagine these pains, but at the same time I didn’t feel these pains before my scare back in November. I finally went to get a physical for the first time in 4 years last week and also requested a blood test.

Fast forward to today, an unknown number called me 4 times and left a message the last time. It was the Dr.’s office notifying me my blood results came in. I feel very uneasy about this... why not call once and leave a message? The multiple calls are freaking me out and makes me feel the results are really bad. Also, does anyone know if my Lyme blood tests would’ve tested for cancer as well? I’m 22 years old if this helps btw.

healthanxiety,thedominantturtle,2018/01/03,"Wheezing and trouble getting air Damn, hypochondria is driving me crazy. Every little thing that I find wrong with me makes me immediately conclude that I have cancer. 

This time, I have realized that my breath is whistling when I exhale (wheezing). I also feel like I cannot get enough air, and must take deep breaths every 45 seconds or so. This has been going on for roughly three weeks and has not improved.

Are there minor conditions that could be causing this? I hate hate hate that I automatically assume that I am going to die whenever I discover something like this.

healthanxiety,salty_turnip,2018/01/03,"Non-stop Coughing It all started last Saturday, when I started coughing up a little mucus. I passed it off as my asthma, but the coughing since then has gotten worse, and today I am running a low-grade fever. I'm really concerned that this is walking pneumonia, and I just can't deal with that right now. I have to attend a funeral out of state this weekend, and the thought of being sick and having to stay in a hotel room is just dreadful. The coughing is so persistent now that my throat is raw from it, and I'm scared I'll start coughing up blood. Oddly enough, my anxiety is not as bad over this, but I'm still pretty stressed out nonetheless.",8.076666666666668,6.33169625,7.9409375,76.12697916666669,63.0625,10.720833333333333,36.95833333333333,9.2995712137729,3.273105208333334,512,20,98,7,6,165,84,128,0.182,0.759,0.059,-0.9487,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,1,7,4,0,3,7,0,11,10,2,0,1,15,19,12,1,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,9,8,0,0,1,2,0,4,2,4,0,0,2,0,8,0,15,16,2,28,0,0,0,0,1,10,0,0,12,68,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17190144451985054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1876222737133163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2316646734992973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321840259571984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18316747975854453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252170248167931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22860940456600906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14395406688507062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19189989492748666,0.0,0.0,0.22497248390927824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18588125498915245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4771496570263161,0.23950944210372516,0.17945255794895654,0.1878664301552695,0.257402913001162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17839350804651188,0.0,0.0,0.21299745424334507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.228997234915016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tocquebee,2018/01/03,"Fear of getting pneumonia Sorry if it sounds stupid and selfish, but...

My dad had to visit his mother in the hospital, we still don't know what she has but there are high chances that it might either be pneumonia or something worse. Anyway, of course I'm concerned about my grandmother and all the stress my father is going through, but I'm still recovering from a persistant cold, which increases the chances of getting pneumonia. 

What do I do?!

healthanxiety,youngestflexer,2018/01/04,"Could I have chronic appendicitis? Hello, I found this subreddit yesterday and it kinda makes me feel good that I know I'm not alone. About 3 days ago, I started to feel pain in my lower right abdomen. I only felt it when I was moving and coughing. Yesterday (2nd day of pain) it started to hurt more (about 6/10). Today it's better, but i still feel it. I didn't feel any pain when I touched it, but today I feel it a little, even when it's better when moving/coughing. I am scared of what it could be. Do you think it's normal to feel this kind of constant pain for 3 days straight? Btw I was on 4 sets of antibiotics last 2-3 months, I was even hospitalized because of 10kg weight loss, but it was probably due to mononucleosis I had. All tests in hospital went fine.

healthanxiety,Wooness,2018/01/04,"Afraid I Contacted E. Coli I made burger Tuesday night and most of the way through eating it I found out the middle was very rare. I freaked out a little bit but tried not to stress about it, today I started getting diarrhea so now I'm afraid I actually have contacted E. Coli. The diarrhea doesn't have blood or anything in it and it may just be a coincidence but I'm somewhat freaking out. Overall I feel fine no nausea, and only had some cramping earlier in the morning but nothing in awhile.

healthanxiety,getchwill,2018/01/04,"Dealing with Health Anxiety when you are looking forward to something that won't happen for several more months Does anyone's health anxiety increase when you start getting excited and start anticipating something that is a long time away, like several months or a year?  For example, my wife and I booked a cruise in April.  Everything is already paid for, all we have to do is show up.  Unfortunately, when I start getting excited for it, my health anxiety kicks in and I can't help but think that I might not make it because the symptoms that my anxiety produces, and that my mind thinks are real, will end me before I can experience it.  I feel like that heart attack that I've been worried about having for the past 10+ years will finally occur and prove every doctor I have seen wrong and that it will be the reason I won't be alive to experience this time that I am so looking forward too.  Anyways, just venting.

-Trouble speaking at times. My chest vibrates and I can't speak for a second.

-Right arm gets hot.

healthanxiety,vintorzaleris,2018/01/04,"Trying a new way of thinking. My day normally looks something like this...
Oh man I'm dizzy. I wonder what that means. Any my left arm is weak. Is that a heart attack? Maybe a symptom of a small heart attack? Where did I get that bruse on my knee? Is that a sign of a blood clot? Should I go to the doctor again? Last time he told me to stop worrying about stuff like this. Is that a lump I'm the back of my head? Maybe that's what's causing my head ache... But what is the lump is another sign of a problem? Should I start documenting this? The doctor thinks I'm crazy but if I have all the symptoms with the times I had them he could surly run more tests. A friend I knew died for a blood clot that the doctors missed maybe my doctor missed something... etc

Recently, I started asking my friends that don't have anxiety how they deal with strange feelings in their body. Every single one of them says that they almost immediately dismiss the thought. I can't even imagine what that feels like. I focus on a part of my body so much sometimes that I actually create pain that doesn't exist. So I dug a little bit deeper and asked what happens if they were walking around one day and all of a sudden they noticed that their left arm was weak and tingly. Most of my friends with without anxiety said the same thing. I guess my arm is weak today. And then that's it. If they have a headache or if they have a chest pain or if they have an upset stomach or if their leg hurts out of nowhere they just shrug it off and think oh I guess today I'm going to have a stomach ache or I guess I'm coming down with something or something to that nature. And then if it still hurts the next day they shrug it off again and only when it's continuing to do it for like a week do they actually think I'll maybe I should go to the doctor and have it looked at. But it's not in a panicky kind of way it's just kind of like almost annoyance.

So I'm going to try that method. ""Oh I guess I have a headache today"". And try to leave it at that. If it lasts a week, all the  talk to my doctor.

Has anyone had success doing something like this?

healthanxiety,xxThranduil,2018/01/04,"skipping beats and not feeling well overall Hi all, so recently i tried mountain climbing, During this mountains climbing i've had a few irregular beats that scared the hell out of me, it never happened to me before when i was exercising until this time. It feels like my heart skips a beat and then i feel i big thud in my chest. since then i've been too scared to excercice. i went to the emergency room because i couldn't wait till morning, i've had an ecg done and then they told me that everything looks just fine, and it is not necessary to do any further tests. but i feel like something is missing, since i feel constant dizziness and my body overall feels very weak. Is this normal?
I also got anxiety and health anxiety for some time now.

healthanxiety,GlitchYena,2018/01/04,"Heart feels like it's beating too hard Hello. I've been sick for the past week or so (I think it's the flu), and I'm on the tail end of it. Just earlier today I started having some discomfort in my chest and so I've been trying to avoid using those muscles too much. I just woke up ~10 minutes ago, and my heart was beating 80 times per minute, and way harder than normal. it's now 20 minutes since I woke up, and it's going back down closer to normal. This has happened to me only a few times in the past year, and I'm worried it might be something serious.",2.398338001867412,3.4550755378151266,3.9448179271708703,90.33041083099907,75.13445378151259,6.2972922502334265,23.3062558356676,6.42735559955562,0.4934866479925297,435,12,96,3,9,145,78,119,0.16,0.8190000000000001,0.021,-0.9287,0,1,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,2,8,4,0,2,5,0,7,5,3,1,0,17,17,9,0,2,3,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,8,6,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,5,2,7,1,12,10,3,21,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,3,13,57,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16519738637032585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14329976233003014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16506013570307146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422949538333966,0.13313601669321945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10591299726350477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16479802203970453,0.0,0.16694245103824246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44167630649732137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09104635302970876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976990970032194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369964497798826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36518754877522464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417355987034739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3558044710006364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15415937569396188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14346945887620507,0.0,0.0,0.1319069589956906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11941231780594636,0.0,0.0,0.2173366748945712,0.0,0.17664801419849185,0.0,0.0,0.12652658283290927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16095568292955262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14792433303879482,0.14948719496306948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18925818828727772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200100864158948
healthanxiety,TantricTaint,2018/01/04,"One hell of a year Hi, just discovered this subreddit and wanted to sort of share my experience with this. For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer. It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol' Dr Google. Fast forward countless doctors appointments, a spur of the moment ER visit, CT Scans, and an eventual biopsy and it turns out I don't have any life threatening conditions. 
I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious (of course they were fine). 
I mean, I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual, so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned. However, I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy, I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that I've had for the last 7 months. It's honestly making it hard to move on with my life and enjoy things. Anyone else have issues like this? How do you deal with it?",6.193251879699247,6.701290618421055,6.339498746867168,78.61815789473684,66.06140350877193,9.67218045112782,34.26817042606516,9.606745405546679,3.169374937343359,943,41,177,18,14,301,138,228,0.114,0.794,0.092,-0.8047,1,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,1,7,11,1,2,12,0,16,14,1,2,5,33,28,14,0,1,3,0,1,1,0,0,13,0,0,0,15,13,0,0,2,0,0,6,4,4,1,1,11,3,20,7,31,15,8,28,2,1,2,0,6,8,1,8,17,118,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11239980257591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557145922419565,0.1693545192930001,0.1360158768425929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10075650191963707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17040208479488542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16917670501099286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13807481976059685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16168092716932306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09393555422198148,0.0,0.13219390722808055,0.0,0.1820806041076352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14806333563045065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725151113360495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694594730048528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2334920624248303,0.08075014259541563,0.0,0.0,0.14627245936442104,0.13879818523167156,0.0,0.0,0.14051981480189726,0.0,0.0,0.11032934950527584,0.0,0.0,0.18004435610641256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26385860591428234,0.17567232055557333,0.0,0.0,0.12747836111074376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18817862837268104,0.0,0.0,0.1120017271357578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15624821511986148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10588611867917276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14115290723279986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339798441954953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10980833663450948,0.0,0.0,0.1312182182368474,0.096379299691573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17978315258790953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097489665698021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15322130719235166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593293162526601,0.0,0.1203298068611058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.212876875756012
healthanxiety,UndiplomaticTom,2018/01/04,"I can’t wait for this health anxiety phase to be over with. Als or carpal tunnel? Female age 26
Duration of complaint - 3 weeks. 
Area on body- hands, arms, sometimes feet and thighs. 

I went to the doctor a week ago who diagnosed me with carpal tunnel. And gave me a brace that helped a little. Hand pain coincided with symptoms of carpal tunnel but it still made me nervous because my grandmother died of als and nerve pain always puts me on edge. 

I don’t show any other signs of als besides very little muscle twitching. 

I am doing some weird things to test myself through out the day. For example. Testing my WPM ( words per minute) that I can type. Which is 75 words per minute . (I do this to see if I have any weakness in my hands)  I am standing on one foot to see if I can balance myself and shit like that. Also, tonight I just came home from dinner and I was holding a fork and I noticed it felt very odd in my hands. (It was a heavier than normal fork because it was at a steak house.) I also have health anxiety but I wish I knew I was okay. So I can stop worrying. 

I feel some pins and needles in my hands and light shooting pain in my arms and feet and thighs. Any help would be appreciated . Thank you.

healthanxiety,ikeeteri,2018/01/04,"I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old (male) and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

And for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town.

healthanxiety,jasmin3jad321,2018/01/04,"Hey guys. Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us, but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and it's so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me, that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I can't trust my mind/myself and that I've lost who I am completely and I'll never be the same. That's what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed! That being said, after WEEKS of constantly- and I mean CONSTANTLY- searching on google for self-help, I have FINALLY found a resource that is starting to help me. Most of the resources I've found only scratch the surface and are really tailored to mild anxiety- they don't really help. I am only on the second module, but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this. Give it a chance and open your mind to the possibility that you can be okay again. Much love 💕 [Helping Health Anxiety ](http://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/resources/infopax.cfm?Info_ID=53) ",4.486537084398979,6.963777227450982,4.2358738277919885,84.44056265984656,72.80392156862743,7.4151747655583975,27.55754475703325,8.321376580360154,1.9792097186700763,1103,42,201,19,23,335,139,255,0.175,0.643,0.182,-0.0931,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,3,7,1,3,8,15,2,3,12,1,24,7,2,2,2,40,42,20,0,2,4,0,5,2,0,1,4,1,1,1,22,18,0,1,7,0,1,2,5,7,0,1,5,8,23,8,25,33,11,24,0,1,1,1,21,12,0,4,12,144,45,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2852510362143557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056825819028856535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244518415084565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09773900471776424,0.20147459854968527,0.10455373764934216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19264158652565488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20979599262979906,0.1414039321543166,0.1331922394730522,0.0,0.10211754419750607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30663152641472496,0.0,0.0,0.0974068146065406,0.08942475992097748,0.05297886193837096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230208611892754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29726431119638835,0.0,0.11046570613592742,0.3124157530005163,0.0,0.0,0.09258812276945837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910848015216203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07828100822515224,0.0,0.10176023412570064,0.0,0.0841343523761004,0.0,0.062224824493796314,0.0,0.0,0.10154350143507697,0.0,0.0,0.1878869158709416,0.0,0.18825049750018072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370543028043695,0.0,0.07189672269837415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14179545305061672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3069814694233624,0.0,0.10509112227585762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09371147197993697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11943775941189153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08867321179963597,0.0,0.09332910833601014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09724840079518804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06598133137481378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09689088500190554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06193097761997879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2242634654930332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0747751613883534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Oogleythedoogley,2018/01/05,"Nervous about Hantavirus I cleaned out a large shed with two other guys. There was mouse poop in a ton of places and we had little to no ventilation in there because of the cold temperatures (trying to keep the heat inside.)

We were sweeping and moving things so the turds were definitely aerosoled. It's been 3 days and I'm nervous about hanta. I've already read about it before and had anxiety about it when cleaning mouse poop out of my truck. My only reassurance is that there has never been a case of hanta in my state. I live in the northeast....do you think I'll be okay?",2.7964521319388567,5.150626778761062,3.5579565567176203,87.85065969428803,77.6725663716814,5.879002413515687,23.54706355591312,6.980632752743323,0.8160513274336291,458,15,90,5,11,145,76,113,0.071,0.8640000000000001,0.065,0.0717,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,2,1,0,0,9,4,0,2,7,1,10,2,2,0,1,12,13,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,6,9,0,1,1,1,0,1,2,2,0,1,7,1,8,2,17,5,1,13,0,0,0,0,5,8,0,0,3,61,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2999920991673953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20796371853476747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16571660935379295,0.0,0.231323451479198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17532009662477493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691732210695117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2416318559017659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27246408597124233,0.2400476216697777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2889324337897488,0.0,0.0,0.20966668519417545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20675339223356168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28402431432207503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27192253693490354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1806043766819604,0.17418984367154916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18456760649915369,0.0,0.26555694321517176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,rattlesnake30,2018/01/05,"Slipped and fell two weeks ago and afraid of getting a scan I slipped and fell on my right side. I only had a small visible bruise on my upper thigh by my waist.

However, it seems it affected my whole leg. My upper thigh is tight and it feels like if you exercised and overstretched it. My knee is tight also, doesn't seem smooth when I move it, and has been popping/cracking alot more. 

I have full range of motion, but everything still feels sore. I really wanted to avoid going to the doctor but I might have no choice.  

A couple days ago I was in a dentist's office and I read an article about CT scans in Men's Health.  It was basically talking about how risky it is, especially for young people, because of how much radiation it gives off.  I'm not sure what the doctor would order for me, but I'm afraid of getting into a situation where I either have to refuse doctor's orders or get a scan and then have anxiety for the rest of my life about getting cancer from the radiation.",5.360391156462583,5.637140719387759,6.0718367346938775,80.62197278911567,67.8265306122449,9.186394557823132,28.068027210884352,9.075114841892004,2.0586884353741493,775,23,156,13,12,254,120,196,0.136,0.855,0.009000000000000001,-0.9732,1,1,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,0,0,9,5,0,3,12,0,15,14,5,3,1,32,28,18,0,3,7,0,5,1,0,2,9,1,0,1,9,9,1,4,4,2,0,5,3,3,0,1,4,9,18,2,22,22,7,28,0,0,3,0,5,13,0,6,9,105,27,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27333599952154924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12329474248276948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11794445809544475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939844499096126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1705931587936895,0.0,0.09943096774446804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4734179707030931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13856372954147886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15591235352403207,0.11014358941969207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3222030423739076,0.14789996894201132,0.08762195215499911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638822120121444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1088992900069195,0.07532275920025559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635567047130641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16386502207995826,0.11333733043313547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11725803413303368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1068864434146599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15421803614924298,0.0,0.0987692945618874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13166572962207754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28071265134169376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17330063650073033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12312540339756699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14530935120106409,0.0,0.0,0.1239210809769478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15060785593598616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909371844787596,0.0,0.12367093919787027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17213234845894926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10952242982386502,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Dubgyvubb,2018/01/05,"Head injury worries? I constantly worry about head injuries, because I constantly worry if a hit to my head was significant to cause a concussion. 


For example, I was laying in bed on my (not very heavy) laptop, and I accidentally pushed it into my chin. It wasn't a super hard hit, it didn't hurt, but I immediately started worrying that I could have a concussion. My head was against a pillow too, but the reading I did claimed that it's worse if your head doesn't move.


I mean, I don't notice myself feeling especially nauseaous or dizzy, but I can't stop worrying. It seems like most concussion stories involve something more significant than that. Are small hits like that something to worry about? Does anyone have any expertise as when to start worrying about a concussion?",7.067171717171718,7.9945911328671375,7.605268065268067,68.83644910644912,64.24475524475525,11.110800310800311,36.16860916860917,10.980518767755715,4.334069774669773,624,29,104,17,9,206,85,143,0.224,0.6729999999999999,0.103,-0.9527,0,0,2,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,1,6,4,0,0,7,0,13,5,5,1,0,16,21,9,0,3,7,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,9,2,0,1,3,1,0,2,6,1,0,0,6,2,16,3,14,11,2,12,0,1,0,0,2,4,0,5,8,71,25,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06776211887986464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0696742056444486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06074275847937344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10236301742190386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2153620148126268,0.0,0.07955854396037547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08720014213579905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05038358176894715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0892624819688983,0.0,0.5113233568934171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10667219383085476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09736317389741242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10854278016984886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10590702471518174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11344666355466013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996721152487018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907132020188006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534234091614147,0.0,0.0,0.14105869987769412,0.0,0.0,0.08330780709406771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221768431550515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7083614059861082,0.10154692062657453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,clairelessly,2018/01/05,"heart health anxiety hi, guys. this is my first time posting. I’ve been dealing with health anxiety for the past 6 years, and my new focus is my heart. I have a mitral valve prolapse, and I’m currently taking a beta blocker to help with palpitations. I’ve been to the ER and a cardiologist, all who have sent me home saying that I am fine. 

I just can’t stop worrying that I’m having heart failure or a heart attack. I’ve had 2 CT scans done on my chest. I also had 2 EKGs done that said I have an incomplete right bundle block which scared me senseless.

I did just work a long shift where I was on my feet the whole time. But because of this mornings pain couple with this pain, I’m nervous. It comes and goes and feels like an ache of some sort.

healthanxiety,arcanine_is_a_tiger,2018/01/05,"Distraction techniques? I suffer from extreme health anxiety, my main fears being that I will spontaneously drop dead from a heart attack or stroke. If I feel my heart acting up from palpitations, or if I feel like my face feels strange, it will send me off the deep end. It's so frustrating that I fixate on this every single day. 

I would love to hear how everyone distracts themselves when they are at the peak of their anxiety. Sometimes watching a light hearted show like Family Guy helps me. A lot of times if I'm talking to a friend on the phone, I won't even notice any of my symptoms (which I take as a sign it's all in my head!). I feel like my health anxiety is the worst at night when I'm laying in bed, and all I can do is hyper focus on my body sensations.

I also get flip flop feelings in my heart. Almost like a skipped beat and it makes me cough.,0.3940404040404033,2.8294852839506213,1.558361391694728,97.00535353535356,91.22222222222223,3.9331088664422,18.47474747474748,5.565023196281405,-0.38935555555555545,312,9,66,2,11,98,61,81,0.195,0.711,0.094,-0.7627,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,1,4,6,0,1,2,1,4,7,5,1,0,12,13,4,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,2,0,1,2,0,3,0,0,5,1,10,3,9,8,0,17,0,1,0,0,0,6,0,1,10,33,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13831120847647824,0.0,0.1562415379035276,0.0,0.0,0.12477715969676804,0.12982948538660574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11936254690811945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11997746294743328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17845678898729134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13146203093062422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889347202734882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1630385029543821,0.0,0.08867546252845952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13797684142380098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.165852627029548,0.0,0.7395853536099917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1628548148523415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15245678387048742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10415125751773126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17759633499492486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17626952324036213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12387041616655445,0.18196473207839609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20095644908496696
healthanxiety,thebosninski,2018/01/05,"Should a low blood pressure and pulse rate be concerning at an odd time? I was at this enormous concert recently (over 10,000 people in one room, 5 big screens, lord knows how many speakers, etc). It was the first concert I've ever been to because I don't really like loud noise, but there were a couple speakers there I wanted to see (it was more of a conference with several hours of music). Previously unbeknownst to me, the music was incredibly loud and there were continuous lights flashing all different colors and directions. I'm a pretty introverted, quiet guy so this wasn't my idea of a good time, but that's not confusing.

What confuses me is that my pulse dropped. It was a day long event, but I'm in good shape so I doubt that was an issue. I noticed because I started getting dizzy, got a headache, and was tired enough to sit and close my eyes amidst all the *hype*. To my chagrin and embarrassment several people asked me if I was okay (which I appreciated but felt deeply uncomfortable with). My resting heart rate is about 64, and I'd thought it'd be elevated with the very overwhelming (to me at least) stimulus for an extended period of time. Instead, I measured it, and it was right at 42. Wtf was going on? I didn't leave because I didn't want to ruin everyone's time, but seriously, is something wrong with me? No one else had this. It made me feel alienated and uncomfortable when I should have been having a great time. I've never had a panic attack or any prolonged health issues so idk what happened. Was this just an anxiety thing or is that an actual health issue. I'm not going to ask anyone because frankly it was embarrassing. To clarify I'm not ""asking [you] to diagnose"" anything, I just want to if anyone has felt something similar. Thanks in advance for any help.

healthanxiety,OldBren,2018/01/06,Advice Hey everybody you may have seen me post on here a lot recently and I do apologise for that I don't want to waste anyone's time. However since November when I'm stupidly ingested cannabis one night and ended up in hospital because my heart went to fast my anxiety has got so much worse. That night in hospital I was convinced I was gonna have a heart attack and die I was in so much pain and agony and in the ambulance the paramedics said my heart was going to fast but this was down to anxiety and nothing wrong with my heart. Same in the hospital they tried to treat my heart with medication but they couldn't slow it down they said this was because it was not an irregular heart it was normal just a bit fast once again due to anxiety so I was left over night and discharged the next day. December 4th I dislocated my knee for the 2nd time and while waiting to be seen in hospital my heart went to fast so they put me in a ward over night and did all the tests bloody tests for my heart and ecgs nothing once again and anxiety once again. Then after that is when my intrusive thoughts started and that went on for a few weeks I still get it on and off now however. But the last 2-3 days my heart has been going fast I'm losing my breath easily and I can feel my heart palpitating I've had countless doctors and tests look at me and nothing to do with my heart? I've even rang a hotline about this and they said anxiety does all this it seems to go in a cycle my thoughts then everything is okay for a while then my heart and thoughts again can anyone help?,2.8354884259259237,4.597439081250002,3.7084722222222233,89.58412037037041,75.375,7.8657407407407405,24.97685185185185,8.626192665926032,1.5513796296296296,1246,42,271,25,27,398,148,320,0.096,0.8390000000000001,0.065,-0.7142,2,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,5,1,16,8,2,0,16,1,26,18,14,0,2,40,51,32,1,3,5,0,1,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,13,21,1,1,5,0,0,7,3,5,0,1,24,8,33,3,38,23,8,62,0,1,3,0,11,19,0,3,35,176,46,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05541581039140008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21691283954487608,0.0,0.0,0.07930512081237122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06451517711518227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06913909896965173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06191202304664231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314579726906402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05885544752915248,0.0,0.0,0.05804451687119836,0.04962681485186394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05022773335731949,0.0,0.0,0.037456051601120685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05096678982313496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028673997802978187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02962834284878605,0.0,0.09668784827359443,0.0,0.0453557212730403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.80641154177533,0.03801114358846682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04622576413791157,0.0,0.0,0.06161497466193992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047621648641566684,0.06344335988385343,0.0,0.048212339639056113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05712879667851225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08337592988317544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06031113492095836,0.21287187885393766,0.055563212604803916,0.16324271718160907,0.0,0.0,0.1811811148001889,0.03842778555069044,0.0,0.060342844600314666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0543119694977796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05700865246238211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05599373249635211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16183099701894305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05162614613856897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04691063644111056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04013923492907402,0.0,0.04528823363529632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13506288732415675,0.0661354633502087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03850198861205655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03344869818222652,0.0,0.04548889371111168,0.0,0.0,0.15771066264310374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577917662205627,0.0,0.06200287242900024,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,KevCut,2018/01/06,"Signed up for Physical Exam due to health anxiety, symptoms getting more noticeable as the day approaches Due to me receiving medical insurance through the government , the health care I have access to is very saturated, so I’ve been waiting for a Physical exam for 2 months now. 

I’m getting down to single digits on days and I feel terrible at nights. I’ll experience acid reflux, or muscular/skeletal pains , etc. Right now I have a pain under my right rib cage and I feel like it’s my pancreas or something . I’m going absolutely mad just thinking that this dull pain could be cancer or something I need to go to the ER for before it bursts and I die . 

I just can’t wait for 5 more days until I can get checked out and be able to sleep at night knowing either nothing is wrong with me or taking steps to manage it. And now I’m in a worse mood because I won’t get the results then , I’ll still need to wait a week or two on top of that .

And now I'm having daily headaches on the same spot and I'm so scared I have a brain tumor. I just got blood work done (just normal stuff) so I'm hoping that if I had something it would show up in that..... 

Anyone else have any advice in dealing with thinking i have a brain tumor and how to talk myself out of it ",1.891282051282048,3.481098000000003,3.1935128205128223,93.00565384615388,77.54700854700855,5.705641025641025,19.392307692307693,6.2581,-0.10799076923076932,434,9,96,3,10,141,70,117,0.154,0.763,0.084,-0.7999,0,0,1,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,7,5,0,3,10,0,11,5,5,1,1,20,20,13,0,4,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,9,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,7,1,6,2,12,12,3,14,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,2,7,65,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1623350913929768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11297046287935818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615822221202465,0.17021434198979524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15607958299769406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.556350171155186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17952173649666608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713666010493272,0.17126722604236738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17000320055056975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387758336123776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3738728472776215,0.0,0.0,0.15950572178566133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13286506334654286,0.18315301994204666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16499926738348267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16276689148063106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1663197615458625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12789087646611685,0.0,0.0,0.11758388670368715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901729863835995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13352470597070856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10644597187914702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13325517872611867,0.0,0.0,0.15399922063751156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12094072825530347,0.0,0.0,0.11801018942168147,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,quietdusklight,2018/01/06,"Worried something is wrong with my heart I have been having occasional chest pains on and off for a week and a half now, and I've been struggling to sleep. Well, I was taking a bath after exercising and I didn't really do anything but turn to the side to reach for some bath gel and I felt something similar to a pop in my chest. It was right in the area that my heart would be. I thought it was odd, and when I stood (slowly) I felt a little light headed to get out of the bath.  I had two short, quick pains in that same spot and now I haven't had any pain since that. There is no heaviness in my chest. My stomach is fine.  But my heart has been feeling like it's been pounding not long after that. I've been feeling like I should  just give in and head to the ER.. It's taking everything I have to not ask to go because  I don't want to go and end up getting a big bill over nothing because I don't think my insurance will cover it.

healthanxiety,radshrew,2018/01/06,"fear of appendicitis Hello, I just found this subreddit, so I'm new here. I felt a weird pressure to the left of my right hip bone yesterday, and this is a symptom of appendicitis. I asked my mom about it, and she told me to lift up my legs; when I lifted up my leg I felt no pain, so she said I was fine. It doesn't hurt, but it's just a weird pressure feeling. Yesterday it was a constant pressure feeling, but today it's more random. I didn't feel anything until a couple minutes ago. I know appendicitis is very painful, so I don't know if I actually have it, or if my mind is playing tricks on me. I had an anxiety attack over this yesterday, and I'm really scared of having it. also sorry this is kind of a messy post. 
  
This is really annoying Lol. I want to calm myself down, but idk how. Any help is appreciated on how to calm down and focus on anything else.

healthanxiety,matheusfroes,2018/01/06,"Fear of brain aneurysm Hi, everything started in April/2016 when I read on the news that a boy of my age had an heart attack and died, that made me scared so I started thinking about my own health and got really nervous, one night before going to sleep I was feeling terrible, with a lot of headache and my heart was pumping really fast, but I managed to relax, the thing is after that day I started feeling a burning sensation in a specific spot on the right side of my head, from there on I started to panic a lot thinking I had an aneurysm and everything, with the upcoming months that burning sensation became a light headache, I went to the doctor and did a tomography and everything was fine, he gave me a medication to take and advised me to start exercising. I did it and after about two weeks now I feel less frequent headaches but when I feel it, it feels more intense, I don't know if it was because of the exercises but I'm scared thinking this supposed aneurysm is getting larger and it's going to rupture :( Thanks.

Everytime I go to the doctor my blood pressure is high because of tenseness, I always think that these high blood pressure moments created an aneurysm :(",6.992616758241758,7.2089504732142915,6.880892857142857,76.41987637362641,64.35714285714286,9.749450549450552,38.65934065934066,9.466822959209583,3.700314972527472,942,48,169,16,13,299,120,224,0.157,0.769,0.073,-0.9623,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,0,7,12,1,7,18,0,12,13,7,1,0,29,38,16,1,1,4,0,5,0,0,0,6,0,0,1,13,11,0,0,10,4,0,4,1,9,0,2,12,6,22,3,26,26,5,31,0,0,0,0,5,9,0,3,18,116,35,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09167380289143154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12533911603563738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1343224018882415,0.0,0.09375017307235528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12299090117557553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105327754939172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143434784967802,0.0,0.0,0.2255360292156609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2970525387631251,0.0,0.0,0.12397666288915375,0.27853705891689545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057561498988642275,0.0,0.18784369780716695,0.0,0.08811641331112176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307056702537616,0.11711007706806716,0.0,0.2611140363313299,0.0,0.2328102908030368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0605488871656792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1873324170398084,0.0,0.10424954040761307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1109889671864408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08794003620123157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339107136279947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07465692395963547,0.0,0.0,0.12926574543974498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102040659384403,0.0,0.14116089301069604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09408820856117166,0.0,0.0,0.2206072910522384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11025381774798533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38990951039123584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08283732556373187,0.0,0.0,0.10143364814716344,0.0,0.0,0.07319487697113683,0.28238084616548736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076242344984498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0883751387213981,0.0,0.0,0.10213263467080327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Obviously my body decided to give me a cold, But my brain is convinced it's the Aussie flu thing, I know logically it's just a cold but my brain is constantly trying to convince me otherwise.

healthanxiety,alphajasper,2018/01/07,"Need advice real bad ( family related ) I am 26 y old and i am living with my mom since i was 13 y old or so. My parents got divorced , my dad was alco , my mom developed bi polar disorder right after the divorce. Iv been living in almost almost movie like circumstances , my mom wasnt aggressive toward me for first 5 years but in last year of her hospitalization and stuff it was really a nightmare.

My mom is doing real good now for past 5-6 years , shes taking her meds regular she got back on her job so she is totally functional. But the thing is she is hypochondriac , and one of things she got used to is that i always confront her or even more i make appointments drive her to doctor and so on. She got used to that cause i was cooking , cleaning and doing regular home stuff in all those years before her recovery. 

But i cant handle it anymore , i am diagnosed with mild - severe anxiety with ocd and depression. I find it hard to find motivation for my own life , i do alot of things i try to keep myself in focus on goals i have , i am not happy how i am progressing but i am trying atleast. I just cant handle the doctors check ups anymore , according to her she had cancer atleast 2 times in past 6 months. 

I am very reasonable person i understand why is she scared she had uterus cancer 20 yrs ago and she had it removed it was one of reasons she got depression. I really understand that i would do anything to change it , but i cant . I was just having day full of work i had to study for my exam to finish this fucking law uni. She got into my room in 11 pm crying , she smokes quiet alot and she said her throat is hurting her as the day progress shes affraid that its cancer again. I know it sounds even funny when u read this but its so frustrating i deal one kind of disease per 15 days .

healthanxiety,IEatAllofTheCheese,2018/01/07,"Going to Battle HA? Hi All,

First time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years, with each year worse than the one before. 

For the last 6 months, my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks, but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise (I am thin and bruise like a peach), or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I don’t have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. 

A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a well-respected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. 

The problem? I’m scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. I’ve avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety. 

Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster? I just need to pick-up the phone and make the call. Would love to make progress on this in 2018.

healthanxiety,SwaggSama,2018/01/07,"Headache, facial tension and semi paralysis, anti social, loud music Not sure if the correct flair but I need help. Lately I've been feeling terrible. I get this weird headache and weird dizziness feeling like I'm surpresses, my face tenses and hurts and some facial expressions feel paralysed sometimes. Because of it I am acting very anti social and can't function in any way. I Don't know what to do but it's a living hell. I feel like I have sunk to a lower dimension of hell and can't get out. My brain is so tense and head and face, I can't look people in the eye, I can't laugh communicate. I feel so down and terrible it's awful. I have a theory it has something to do with ear damage as I produce music and been listening to extremely loud music for very long periods, for a long time now. When I started working, the loudest I can listen was half strong as what it is now, which I gradually increased over time. I fear I have really damaged something in the ear which is causing all this nausea, awful headache, tension and disability to live. Please help me I can't do nothing, even sleep feels terrible!!! I rarely feel normal.. Please help!

healthanxiety,ki-qqn,2018/01/08,Melanoma fear ruining my life Hi guys! So I’m a super moley person and it leads me to believe there is absolutely no way that I don’t have melanoma. I’m part Irish and used to lay in the sun when I was a teen a lot. I’ve been checked in the past year and a half and my dermatologist always acts like I’m crazy for coming in. She said it’s normal to keep getting new moles and even told me this really ugly one in my belly button is fine. I’m currently living in France and I have a doctors appointment on Wednesday but I keep convincing myself I have it and I’m going to die. I can’t sleep or focus on anything and I’m constantly taking pictures of the my body to exam the moles and always convince myself they’re all cancer. I try to get my family members to convince me I’m fine but I never feel better.

healthanxiety,Slice_Life,2018/01/08,"question regarding fingers slightly moving. Is it normal?

Not sure if I can classify it as 'tremors'

Basically, from what I've seen with different kinds of videos regarding tremors, it doesn't look like it.

Let's say I put my hands in the air facing my palm, or just in the bed resting, it doesn't shake or what.

But sometimes, if I look at them long enough, I notice it they slightly move.

Not sure if I'm doing it voluntarily, I'm being anxious, thus, making it move, or maybe because I'm not used to holding that kind of position, it kinda moves because of it?

If anything, I type a lot in a computer. Upon searching, I've seen that they might just been twitching due to fatigue, so maybe that's what it is?

As much as possible, I don't want to go to a doctor just because of this.

healthanxiety,Jillian0424,2018/01/08,"I finally saw the cardiologist today I had multiple ECGs, bloodwork done, I wore a two-week loop and I had an echocardiogram over a month ago, and today I did a stress test. I've been having HORRIBLE anxiety about my heart for over a month and a half. 

**My heart is completely healthy. No blockages and no damage to it whatsoever.** 

This is one of my happier days!!! 

They told me the chest pain -- which I can reproduce by touching it -- is likely caused by either anxiety or costochondritis and the heavy tightness is likely anemia (which I can deal with much better than heart disease). The left arm pain is probably from inflammation because I lay on it so awkwardly and for too long at night. 

I'm OK :') 

Anxiety is a bitch, guys. It can make you truly believe and FEEL the most frustrating and uncomfortable symptoms. I'm not saying to dismiss everything as anxiety -- it will always be better to see a doctor -- but what I am saying is none of you are alone. 

Thanks to everyone here who supported me through this. I can move on and focus on fixing my inflammation and anemia!! 💖",3.565195414278272,5.983532257425742,5.0879989577905125,77.52018499218346,75.43564356435644,8.807087024491924,27.46326211568525,9.414487439383343,2.8282930693069317,844,34,152,23,19,283,126,202,0.149,0.752,0.099,-0.6989,1,1,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,2,1,2,4,14,2,2,13,1,21,9,5,2,0,20,31,14,0,0,4,0,3,2,0,1,4,2,0,1,11,11,0,1,1,0,0,1,4,7,0,2,8,7,19,7,22,21,4,17,0,1,2,0,9,7,1,2,11,110,30,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10779967984819036,0.0,0.0,0.1259509950236727,0.0,0.0,0.10118902953488076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3721244137563337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07413215696943552,0.0,0.0,0.1370125110185039,0.0,0.2151078308168642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.124926682049885,0.0,0.0,0.12750547838288664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07842820929999281,0.12537428212830326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12447270213340478,0.0,0.12444896622117925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11620329955400567,0.10929497548284008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061489528725408436,0.0,0.0,0.13321750473915026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12041274289949075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4323243135052561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13212931731469835,0.0,0.0,0.11882473353356796,0.0,0.0,0.10762077594314816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08117543285081807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19413543760158825,0.12925188741663354,0.08939713727373365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141224847644139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824058939987641,0.0,0.2588026337951748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311158472481679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19341786184005413,0.0,0.0,0.0969072024968116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1393035241316267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13800126985660693,0.0,0.12639906328884318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11196189199601063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23054359145522904,0.11620329955400567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11879502649442787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975479825225465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Psy185,2018/01/08,"Drawing light pain in right testicle Hi,

I sometimes get a (light) drawing pain in the right testicle. It doesn't hurt a lot but it makes me really nervous sometimes.

The right one also sometimes slides into my groin during intercourse or ejaculation. It comes back out rather easily, but is really uncomfortable. Is this normal? Can it be related to the light pain?",4.945676691729325,7.6239154473684225,5.412706766917295,75.59394736842106,72.15789473684211,9.606015037593986,27.962406015037594,9.957137785484203,3.2954458646616533,338,13,56,10,7,108,52,76,0.181,0.723,0.096,-0.8177,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,1,5,0,7,3,0,1,0,14,12,4,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,7,4,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,5,0,1,0,3,4,0,7,9,1,12,0,1,0,0,2,8,0,3,1,39,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13069121906445647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12566403122948192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2815529921065113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853830170414758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095405887985066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17495025163982836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13893841576021898,0.0,0.0,0.1090877116065738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16012217601665482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1107412684295711,0.0,0.5216883868735399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2093889691076389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4186931502547693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4848956451790285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1701315863277956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11609270257880333,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,AWDjunkie,2018/01/08,"Health Anxiety after panic attack Almost a year ago, I had a panic attack that I thought was a heart attack. I've never had either, and at the time I didn't know that panic attack symptoms can mimic heart attacks. I had a friend take me to the ER, and I was freaking out in the ER while waiting to be seen. I remember thinking ""man, this is it, this is how I'm going to die and I'm away from family, wife and kids and everyone I love and I'm stuck in a place I hate"" and it scared me so badly. Anyway, since then I've almost had myself convinced that I was going to die and it was going to be from a heart attack. I've been prescribed Buspirone and it keeps me from having panic attacks, and I've come a long way from the panic attacks every day to almost having none. There's been a few times in the past few months where if I wasn't taking medication, I could've had a pretty bad attack. One of them was last week, where my mind just kind of ran away while I was driving home from work and for some reason my mind was looping ""you're gonna die, and probably run into oncoming traffic, look now you're barely breathing"" and I had to calm myself down. It sometimes takes me a really long to get calm, and sometimes I can calm myself almost immediately. The thing about this though that I really hate is that the anxiety is always there, always either in the back of my mind or I'm actively thinking about it. I've set an appointment with a psychologist for a few weeks from now, and I really want to get off the meds. They have some side effects that I really don't like, and they are considered mild. Are there any of you who suffer from the same kind of health anxiety that I do? I don't know anyone personally who does, at least not in the way it is with me.

healthanxiety,mirrorteru,2018/01/08,"Dog died on New Years, scared of rabies Okay so I posted this on the anxiety subreddit and that should of been enough but my anxiety still is being awful so uh-- posting this here too since health anxiety is a big one for be in general anyway...? Sorry ;;;

Basically, I had an old dog, like 14 years old. He started sleeping a lot more around Christmas, and all, and when I cold front blew in that week, he started having a harder time walking around (he'd been wobbly already), and then Thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. His front legs couldn't move, but back legs were fine, and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. 

During that Thursday I absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked, which is what started the paranoia.

My poor dog couldn't move, but his back legs still could--- and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.

We have him pain meds at a vets advice, which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again, still back legs working too, he just couldn't get up yet. But he was moving more, his head too. He even ate that day. Unfortunately, he started bloating, fell into a coma, and died that day, which was New Years.

I've brought my paranoia up with the vet, and he did say with everything I told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. Another commenter seemed to agree too.

And--- yeah, I know better--- he wasn't even paralyzed in that way, it was the pain in his bones--- the pain meds helped him, in those final moments. And he never had a hanging mouth, he could move it and eat fine, and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. But even still, I've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. Despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies, since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better--- but my mind keeps telling me what if it is, what if it is--- what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll die--

Ugh. I know I'm going to get a full doctor checkup tomorrow, and take steps to get help with my anxiety, but as it is right now it still feels so awful and constraining. I can't even focus on my usually drawing or other creative ideas because this anxiety has gotten in the way so much. I can't even properly grieve my dogs death because of this. I'm /scared/ despite being told that it shouldn't even be a consideration.

healthanxiety,christineyvette,2018/01/09,Night sweats Sometimes when I go to bed I wake up with cold sweat on me. Usually only in my cleavage and the back of my neck. I sleep with the room pretty cold and only in my underwear and bra. I always wake up freezing and is it possible to sweat cold cause I fold up in a ball to keep warm. I just don’t like wearing clothes to bed. Isn’t sweating during the night a sign of cancer also why would I be sweating if I’m cold? Sorry major anxiety disorder and agoraphobia sufferer here.

healthanxiety,mxmx9228,2018/01/09,"Toxic shock syndrome fear Okay this is kind of uh detailed, beware. Im afraid of getting TSS because i read this horrifying ass thing about people getting it even without leaving in tampons too long or anything. And all this stuff about how horrible tampons are for you. And people were commenting under it about how someone they know even got it from pads and every other period product and it basically just strikes randomly. And people having to get their legs amputated of they didnt die already. And like if you have any ""open wounds"" or anything you can get it from that too. And basically just making it seem like youre gonna get it just by existing and having periods. Like what if i have some kind of injury from shaving or something i dont even know about??

healthanxiety,redfoxharborseal,2018/01/09,"Uneven pupils on Friday I was looking in the mirror and noticed that my left pupil is much larger than my right. The vision in that eye is also blurry. 
I visited an optometrist today who dilated my eyes and confirmed that the left is more dilated than my right, but he didn't know why. He assumed that its something I've always had but only noticed now, but that's impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i haven't had a stroke (hello health anxiety). 
a few days before the uneven pupils, I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck, could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear, usually pulsatile (rushing noise). 
 I'm afraid its either a carotid dissection/stroke, or some sort of tumor. Maybe I had a seizure in my sleep that cause the pulled neck muscle and the eye issue? 
Anyway I just wanted to vent and see if anyone else has had weird eye issues or fears. Its tough to have all these thoughts in my head without anyone listening or taking them seriously.

healthanxiety,Keeks2634,2018/01/09,"Struggle Bus ... I'm riding it today, maybe even driving it. No need to get into details, I'm just anxious for my health and a family member's health (I hate that I project my HA to other people, as if I didn't do enough worrying as is).

I went to the gym despite getting shitty sleep last night and feeling AWFUL all day because I knew it was better than coming home from work and ruminating. And I'm about to listen to an anxiety podcast and a guided meditation for sleep. So there are a couple wins despite the day being a dud. 

But I just wanted to write it out that today sucked and my worrying sucks and I hate it. I know I'm not alone when I come here, and for that I am grateful. Hoping tomorrow is a better day for me and anyone else riding the bus.

healthanxiety,DixielandDisaster,2018/01/09,"I feel really silly posting this but... I think I’ll feel better if I get this off my chest. I definitely have some health anxiety, although it’s not as bad as it could be. I recognize that many of the symptoms I feel from time to time are a result of internalizing stress and are made worse by worrying about them, and I think I’ve gotten a better handle on it as the years have gone by.

But I don’t think anxiety can cause lumps or make them grow, and I’m trying to stay away from Google and redirect my focus but I’m still feeling that worry and wanting to check on the lump every five minutes. I think I’ve done a fairly good job keeping myself in check and only examining the lump once a day. But I’m going to write this out and see if it helps. Maybe someone else has had a similar story and everything turned out fine? I want to hear it if so.

Close to a year ago now, I noticed this lump under my arm. I thought it was an ingrown hair. Mentioned it at a checkup, the doctor felt it and thought it was a lymph node. She offered to do an ultrasound but I was getting ready to move out of state and didn’t have time. The lump grew and became really painful and red. For reasons, I didn’t see a doctor until about eight months later, when they diagnosed the lump as an abscess next to a (swollen) lymph node. Abscess was drained, tested positive for Staph, I got a gross course of antibiotics and that was that. The lymph node shrank a little after that and I could still feel a lump where the abscess was. Primary care doctor said it was a cyst that had formed form the abscess being left alone for so long, and sent me to a surgeon to have it removed. The surgeon was not very nice, told me he couldn’t feel anything and sent me home. Eventually the cyst shrank and I couldn’t feel it anymore. 

Fast forward to two months later and now...the original lymph node has shrunk but it’s still around. And now above it there’s a new...mass. It’s next to where the abscess was before but off to the outside top corner of my armpit (sorry for the bad explanation). It’s a hard lump and fixed in place, which freaks me out a bit because google says that’s a sign of cancer. Buuuuuut maybe it’s just my muscle I’m feeling. The other armpit has a bit of that “bump” thing going on at the top, but it’s way less pronounced and feels less like a defined lump, if that makes sense. And it feels like it’s growing. Thanks to the abscess I have a scar and it feels like the lump is noticeably getting closer to the scar. 

I feel like such a drama queen. I’m so embarrassed bringing stuff like this up at the doctor because I’m so used to being dismissed and them thinking I’m a huge baby. I just feel ashamed of being like this. Being stuck between worry or embarrassment isn’t much of a choice. But this nagging voice in my head keeps saying anxiety can’t cause a lump like it could cause a headache or nausea or heartburn or whatever. I just can’t cope with the humiliation if it turns out being nothing and they think I’m an idiot. I have an appointment with my doctor (for something unrelated and not to do with something being wrong with me) and I’m debating on if I should bring it up. My doctor now seems really good and non-judgy, these feelings are internalized. If someone else has had a mysterious bump that vanished one day and ended up being nothing please let me know. Thanks ",3.9401137454982,5.076411869117654,4.7457743097238865,85.75516806722689,71.48529411764707,7.4921968787515,26.377551020408163,7.817275551320576,1.3703853541416562,2661,85,548,33,49,860,286,680,0.114,0.769,0.118,-0.4561,1,1,2,0,0,0,67.0,0,0,5,5,21,29,2,4,55,0,51,39,6,10,0,116,116,61,0,15,27,0,17,7,0,1,33,5,1,0,46,40,0,2,27,1,2,13,11,12,0,4,27,25,44,17,72,74,8,78,0,0,3,0,18,35,0,14,35,350,90,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05258341300744393,0.0,0.0,0.0614374105688912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1361384266140104,0.0,0.05882929010159419,0.0,0.0,0.048815131240215234,0.05280718794243952,0.0,0.0,0.055732893616444505,0.0,0.0990590905636612,0.07232158448978787,0.0,0.0504767705719392,0.0,0.0,0.10492706402196632,0.12952368984926593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060480477433784284,0.1828132883269136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420860717298992,0.0,0.0,0.07651271185338324,0.0,0.0,0.060208336258929476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3642979003453827,0.0,0.060704738626063376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910814243226562,0.0,0.052539725218669814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04997947992333525,0.0,0.05331280059037314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41991414119378057,0.12713420543322304,0.05695629916967292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09297642285900083,0.0,0.06742560521482377,0.09950924771513066,0.04744345351655914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05313887855186878,0.0,0.060879216359142625,0.0630541608415447,0.06685771242975116,0.0,0.03976080356201103,0.0,0.05950258411323759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05886573650474468,0.10545230650185176,0.0,0.0,0.03260060419823862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06445112334781232,0.06065850238008374,0.0,0.20286456478284132,0.059454011552738224,0.0,0.052496145791616135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05612981780123116,0.07919283837695466,0.06014095453364724,0.11918940055390218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09469697784966603,0.06304754696481209,0.043606869682431715,0.0,0.0,0.057291421000692025,0.1261745352445416,0.0,0.0,0.1138378731082824,0.1350719438620648,0.0,0.06317363834766129,0.04019662363085765,0.04511537190893998,0.06312043690403593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06197655300062373,0.06511531394566414,0.0,0.0,0.05681195950448521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11400532569787955,0.06099062187283511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05642670258647455,0.0943469528525045,0.0,0.0,0.09454038192807096,0.054002507199024025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052292792957576,0.09133454197792468,0.0,0.06640364620546921,0.0,0.0632270013752663,0.14211857823108254,0.0,0.06795061685824408,0.0,0.06790696524987057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06165597298648062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922738205181948,0.0,0.0,0.039409431373122986,0.2280583499531976,0.0,0.09418657134786887,0.10376953645041438,0.0,0.0,0.05668259963184464,0.0,0.04027424227287011,0.12904579071331218,0.05794681348018501,0.0,0.0,0.05123325094506557,0.0,0.048945037660725006,0.06997669589883272,0.04708528669208322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18072637282725465,0.060451931914373175,0.0,0.06485687612087299,0.0,0.07639999733312472
healthanxiety,abingratta,2018/01/09,"Pain in the neck. Scary Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I've been having aching feelings in my neck in what seems to be my lymph nodes for a few weeks. The aching seems to pop up in different spots(left, right, under the jaw, mid neck, collarbone area) at random times. Today I was feeling around my neck and noticed my right lymph node was very swollen and the left side I couldn't even feel. 

I'm getting over a cold, and I know the obvious answer is that these aches and pains correlate with me getting over this sickness. Google is still managing to scare me to no end. I have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow, was just looking for some peace of mind to get me through the night.

healthanxiety,Lemongrabsdisciple,2018/01/10,"Im 19 y/o and my hair is thinning and more worrying symptoms I first noticed my hair thinning two months ago. I've always had thick hair that would grow pretty quickly. Now my hair's gotten thin and quite dry. The thinning is more extreme on the sides of my head with visible patches; at the top there arent any such patches (but still thinning and dryness).  I impulse-bought biotin tablets to help with the thinning, but im hesistant to take them at the moment since nothing's been diagosed yet.


But it's not just the hair. I have also been getting, although not frequent,  a tingling sensation in my right fingers,  and sometimes on a whole hand at times. 

More recently, say the last week or so, my vision's gotten blurry. I don't know if the  blurred vision is  permanent and i've just gotten use to it, or not, but ive definitely had these phases. 

Ive looked up my 'symptoms' and what's come up are thyroid conditions, B12 deficiencies and a whole load more. With B12 deficiency in particular, its symptoms seem to align with mine pretty closely. Other than my symptoms ive mentioned already, B12 deficiency symptoms include 'tiredness' and 'memory loss'- i feel like i have these, or atleast they're more pronounced recently (ive always been fairly forgetful).

Im genuinely worried if i have some serious conditon. Ive booked an appointment  with my doctor and hopefully i can get however many of these symptoms i actually have sorted. Sorry for this being so long winded. Stay healthy friends.

healthanxiety,tggibby55,2018/01/10,Heart fears So starting this week I’ve had these odd chest and back sensations not really that painful but weird. I went to my PCP and she listened to my heart and said it was normal and I had an EKG about 3 years ago that came back normal. However today when I yawn or take a deep breath I feel a sharp pain at the base of my neck. On top of that I haven’t been able to sleep out of fear I won’t wake up. Sorry for the rant I just need someone to talk to.,2.2926025459688835,2.757179108910893,3.3559547383309765,96.70089108910892,74.74257425742574,6.9595473833097605,20.369165487977373,6.868970318607317,-0.06353295615275822,354,6,91,3,7,114,74,101,0.185,0.775,0.039,-0.9312,1,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,0,1,6,5,0,2,5,0,6,10,7,0,0,14,14,8,0,3,4,0,2,0,0,1,3,2,0,0,6,6,0,0,1,0,0,2,3,5,0,0,7,4,11,0,14,6,0,16,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,1,8,54,17,0,0.17116844570051773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1517304994004743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2632359382921861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19577110208715776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3852241781472929,0.08654790918252114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4056708645980944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12691923361943372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3354174685686985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3642705889961801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965488933429887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16282038904085205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17129206150492707,0.0,0.1450304685794475,0.0,0.0,0.19160906119467616,0.12115390686598153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286973689908866,0.13757871290859036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16224767232306414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13730100241947227,0.0,0.0,0.15867486402765552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022686705319866
healthanxiety,julianolte,2018/01/10,"WARNING: graphic. Stomach Flu, Food Poisoning, or neither? Hello,

last night after going out with my boyfriend to get Mongolian Grill, I got back to his house and my head began hurting like a migraine. What was even worse is a few minutes later, my stomach started feeling weird. I brushed it off and was able to ignore it, however, normally if it is nothing or I am having motion sickness, it dies down after a while. It did not. I began feeling REALLY nauseous, and just plain weird. I was also having a lot of small burps and...gas down there. So then I thought, must be gas as this has happened before. 3 hours go by, and I literally cannot move or I feel like I am going to throw up. We go to his mom’s house, and I try to lay down and sleep. And then I got that feeling maybe 30 minutes later, went to the bathroom, and puked up all of my food. I have never puked so much in my life. It hurt really bad, and to make it worse every 30mins-1hr after that I threw up 8 more times, as you can imagine I got ZERO sleep. It has now been about 5 hours since I threw up, and I feel absolutely fine. My stomach does feel a little raw, as expected. But I am able to sip gatorade and suck on ice chips right now with zero desire to eat. 
This is where things get nastier: about 20 minutes ago I was laying here kind of sitting up, and I felt gas down there so I obviously decided to let it out. Worst mistake because, I SUDDENLY FELT IT WAS WET DOWN THERE. And boy, was it.
I ran full speed to the restroom, and it turns out to be what appeared as a mixture of super watery diarrhea, and vomit. Absolutely disgusting, I showered and here I am now.  hours ago before the last few times I puked I did have to poop, it was weird it came out of nowhere and I went and it was big and soft. And then this!
What makes my boyfriend’s mom suspect it is the stomach flu is because my boyfriend’s sister’s boyfriend threw up the other night too, however, she didn’t get sick, I was nowhere near him, and he had a concussion. I don’t have a fever either (atleast I don’t think I do)?
I feel like food poisoning is the culprit because I have had it before and this same thing happened, besides the bathroom situation from what I remember. Just constant throwing up over and over again. I did eat a lot of lettuce and spinach, so I hope it isn’t e-coli.

Any advice would be appreciated.

healthanxiety,LikeReich,2018/01/10,"Meningitis Hi Reddit,
For a week now I've had a stiff neck, this has been accompanied by cold hands and feet and random pains in my limbs, I also got off an antibiotic a week ago for a tooth infection. Headache has not been present, maybe just a mild one occasionally, have mostly just been a little drowsier than normal. Could this be meningitis? Getting pretty anxious.

healthanxiety,adventuringfroglet,2018/01/10,"the HA just won't quit... So, long time lurker and first time poster. Just have to say how helpful this subreddit is for calming me down during a heath anxiety meltdown!

Background: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago, went into remission, was re-diagnosed with stage four bc a year and a half ago, and passed away about six months ago (it had spread to her brain). I'm 23 female and she did not carry any of the BRCA genes.

Around 5 years ago, I felt a small bump in my armpit while doing a self-exam and went into a full blown panic. After about a month of constantly poking and prodding and googling symptoms, I forgot about it and the next time I checked it had disappeared. I noticed it again a year later and had a physical around that time and asked my doctor. She said that it was fine and nothing to worry about (can't remember if she said lymph node or cyst...I was just so excited I was not dying)

Fast forward to six months ago when my mother passed away and I became hyper-aware of anything breast-related. The small lump is currently present. It's come and gone a number of times since I first noticed it years ago, it's always in the exact same spot, lasts for various amounts of time, it's 'biggest' size has never changed, and when it's 'gone' I can kind of feel a little remnant. It's under the skin, not hard (but not exactly soft either), can move around but tends to move with the skin it's directly under. Sometimes when I get poking at it for days on end it hurts a little bit and the skin gets irritated. My aunt has suffered from cysts most of her life and has gotten a lot in her armpits and my step-mother, who is a nurse, has told me that I'm fine.

Basically, I know it's not cancer (most of the signs point to the fact it's not) but Google, of course, tells me that I'm dying of a million different cancers (mostly lymphoma or metastatic breast cancer). I have an annual exam in around a month and I'm going to ask about it for the peace of mind, but I just can't stop worrying about it. Any tips? It's just so frustrating to know I'm being completely ridiculous but it's like I have no control over it.",3.6269182027649762,4.832551124423965,4.4085915898617545,87.61145881336407,72.31797235023042,7.452649769585253,24.622407834101377,7.8658589789855275,1.1633642857142852,1684,48,351,22,32,541,216,434,0.09,0.8420000000000001,0.067,-0.9496,2,0,0,0,0,0,57.0,0,0,0,4,24,12,2,1,28,1,26,19,8,2,4,68,51,34,2,1,20,3,7,1,0,1,11,3,0,0,27,28,0,3,5,0,1,12,11,5,0,7,19,10,28,7,53,30,10,80,0,2,0,2,18,26,0,7,44,225,55,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.422135577347724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06604145990061869,0.0,0.0,0.10794743664940253,0.0,0.06071715397927279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531401707250667,0.2826213501589149,0.14839881267979302,0.0,0.1491397881223275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.086650514657837,0.0,0.0,0.08860217872435301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08396199727693082,0.06836946277694288,0.08321700461441761,0.08576981444415009,0.08901920879534553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05118651165418461,0.0,0.0,0.16111595738508572,0.16474521644935866,0.08292382992597698,0.0,0.08123765001453319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07029747585908322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0401314081604784,0.0,0.07620679493923271,0.0,0.0,0.1350226534484292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08293417110185641,0.0,0.04510729581422383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07109913530441045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053199443219489786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0849662767056022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08265071723789183,0.08723837732607115,0.06469642011187766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05606075152961327,0.038775739380689365,0.15909740389617075,0.0,0.07023916714679919,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06747678135853152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801401782449893,0.09295614554605744,0.2534066741540365,0.16871361212061944,0.0,0.0,0.06121435267147425,0.0,0.08440995178855991,0.0,0.0,0.07615680424071951,0.1807245217473816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0931225527328966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07502946587402808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08441882110280093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08990973261501123,0.0,0.1509964030596348,0.063117504068809,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827992943153741,0.0,0.0,0.06565495021034305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07849808193177336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06635613213800881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08249489799473189,0.0,0.0,0.0693721028425776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2776846073393281,0.0,0.0,0.07584058848167992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1471519252919926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16120637324801573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2555555318288421

healthanxiety,festeringswine,2018/01/10,"Convinced myself I have Celiac disease? I've been lactose intolerant since I was 20, and got diagosed with GERD as a child. However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested.

No one else in my family, even extended, has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. I've always been underweight (5'11, 130 lbs). Im also always tired, though I think my iron levels are fine and I cleared a thyroid test a few years ago. When I have more than 3 drinks in a night, I have severe vomiting the next day to the point I've gone to the ER because it had been every hour, for 8ish hours.

For someone this anxious about it, you'd think I'd track these things better. But now I'm locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chock-full of products with gluten for the next 5 months. Would I be justified in going to the doctor just to lay all this out there and see if its related, maybe to celiac? Or am I just being paranoid?",6.2625362318840585,6.2874461352657,6.642814009661838,78.16103260869569,65.90821256038647,9.0256038647343,30.77657004830918,8.59863814320734,2.295914975845411,838,28,158,11,12,272,140,207,0.123,0.821,0.056,-0.9271,1,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,2,10,6,1,0,12,0,19,9,0,1,2,26,29,14,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,1,9,11,3,0,2,1,0,3,1,3,1,1,9,3,13,3,24,16,4,26,0,0,2,0,2,9,1,3,14,100,22,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12409685457829732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11195371085356508,0.23297360995492655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581541628700691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08533946961592934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12381393542692185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1438131200122856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09028499990021867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2865810146629328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13714150926784455,0.0,0.14324952761333054,0.11694760795767427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09246517889825552,0.0,0.11795157250570712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13197454376481266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314145257878389,0.0,0.15912442815404854,0.0,0.11196655019146774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27573315904180784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15121829899806635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1238909039491417,0.11756028926819885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14064349251843114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174243375520952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29777190289092753,0.1313755422638314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09486403167764956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323402415994936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2679120420280867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13822787696878736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155765056790493,0.0,0.0,0.1581541628700691,0.0,0.11580506234214315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11861705484289572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14550809610824544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18601251590236265,0.17940590179075386,0.13754408176428484,0.0,0.0,0.1609033133709734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551028876829328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191780878522756,0.0,0.0,0.09944821809570996,0.0,0.0,0.09015199676644144
healthanxiety,JohnRE97,2018/01/10,"Afraid i've been exposed to hantavirus, really panicking So I'm on Vacation in a friends cabin a couple miles north of Lake Tahoe CA. It was freezing last night so I went to the closet to grab an old comforter to add to my bed. What I had forgotten is that there is a mouse problem in this house. 
I woke up this morning and found a couple mouse droppings in my bed. I googled if that could be dangerous, and panic ensued. 

I've googled the cases hantavirus reported in California, and many of them focus around the area I'm in. There was also a case near Reno (really close to here) just last fall. There's mouse droppings littered in the carpet of this house, one here one there, and now I've slept with a blanket that had them in it. We're only here for 2 nights total, so we didn't clean the place. I'm so scared for myself and my family. I hate being anxious like this because it feels like I KNOW i have it, like I'm already in the hospital dying.

healthanxiety,trhowaway5212,2018/01/11,"Do I have Anxiety or Schizophrenia? 18 - Male - 5'8 - Caucasian - no previous diagnosed medical conditions or medications - but I think I have Social Anxiety and mild GAD. No relatives that I know of with schizophrenia (however my dad is adopted so I can't know for sure)

I KNOW only a psychiatrist/gp can diagnose me properly. I am asking here to see if it's worth to do so.

For maybe half a year now I've had constant anxiety of having schizophrenia. It started with me being in school, walking through the corridor and hearing my name being called, even though I know I probably just misheard someone else talking. I went home and googled schiz symptoms, and since then have been constantly worrying about it..

Other symptoms -

Music playing in my head. Can be hard to make it stop. Sometimes when I’ve smoked weed it feels literally impossible to make it stop.

Constantly repeating conversations in my head, or preparing for future ones. Also, it feels like most of my thoughts are thought of as if im in a conversation, if you understand what I mean by that.

Auditory hallucinations (?) - Heard my name being called a couple of separate times when walking around town &amp; in school. However, one time at a night club it happened like 5-8 times in one night, (was quite drunk &amp; anxious the day/evening before). It's NOT in a distinct voice, its just someone else next to me who's talking about something completely different, and my brain just misfires and I hear my name instead.. Also, Idk if it counts as hypnagogic hallucinations but when I meditate I, a random word or sentance can pop up in my head, but it can be in a different voice than my own inner monologue - often someone i know. However it really doesn NOT feel like a voice talking to me, more like intrusive thoughts that are in the voice of someone else (but i’m the one thinking?, its not loud or anything)

Quite often, several times a day, when seeing some random person on the street I recognize someone I know for a split second - then I realize it wasn't them. Saw some interview with a dude with schiz who said this was one of his first symptoms but with cars

Poor control of my inner monologue. I tend to overanalyze every single thought that I have. Because of this I have somehow caught the habit of thinking- Would someone with schizophrenia do this, or does this mean I have schizophrenia?

Seeing things out of the corner of my eye.

Slight sensation that people in school might be talking shit about me (however like 2 seconds after that happens I realize how ridiculous it is)

I have smoked quite a lot of weed the last 2.5 years but lately have not been smoking much at all. It tends to make my anxiety worse and hyperactive - the last time I smoked when i was walking home i was paranoid about anyone looking at me through windows and when I walked past 2 guys I was convinced they were talking about me.

No delusions, paranoia (when sober), depersonalization, social life is good etc. I feel ''sane'' but can not stop having thoughts of schizophrenia.

What do you guys think? I posted a similar post in r/askdocs and r/schizophrenia and most of them said I'm fine, but I'm still extremely scared.",5.335718619643536,7.212501324232086,5.537472127417519,78.55566970041716,69.03412969283275,8.690117557830868,32.98809252938946,9.21078282632365,3.098322381494122,2520,117,444,51,45,797,273,586,0.107,0.841,0.052000000000000005,-0.982,6,0,4,0,0,0,86.0,0,2,3,5,30,13,2,1,23,0,44,15,6,5,3,95,90,45,0,5,26,1,5,5,0,2,8,10,3,4,33,18,1,4,24,3,2,7,10,3,0,9,21,21,57,10,64,61,11,70,0,0,6,0,34,24,1,21,42,303,90,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09286774939984456,0.0,0.12582495077441333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17767564385868204,0.06559595502453176,0.0,0.04059979929955198,0.0,0.04778184283932392,0.05168939816295292,0.05428213623069996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03539536303791667,0.0,0.049408309620973485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06481878728005554,0.11857996525678258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060879149901792926,0.18824013486624772,0.06512387439924644,0.0,0.06424687055246601,0.0,0.07489313825662708,0.0,0.0,0.1178677671308316,0.0,0.12132934358513775,0.0,0.0,0.05081232339658439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14551542417736724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06475686873436823,0.076701638531364,0.0,0.04892154531217483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11743590264956565,0.08296207165246168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049389330927687616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04870144886004778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149852620928332,0.10269186094207544,0.0,0.05201406775142617,0.0,0.1787716886761519,0.0,0.13088501973680236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11648614068623513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0627192390004462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914632090531739,0.094660053587605,0.06549888313471026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04101242182162361,0.14183603827413271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04875925683880387,0.0,0.0,0.049364058538882274,0.0,0.0,0.11627480028805955,0.0,0.05833323664904964,0.1264977490464543,0.0,0.11698703214184827,0.0,0.0615968806134613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04268382652967839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061751875496472014,0.1089785308875062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19672883224974255,0.04416039771731063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055428795209937314,0.04025436625029048,0.050699370597862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1112187984122842,0.0,0.06260296749879216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18527509208951928,0.0,0.0,0.037197377240374425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046459433492296,0.0,0.05813233716667832,0.1762920398153016,0.13880881470012096,0.0,0.0,0.06559595502453176,0.05960200905386232,0.04803125964663394,0.0,0.0,0.11837816452487405,0.2951853629427114,0.04470061454014427,0.05742692276741351,0.0,0.041098099730875234,0.0,0.04637010012441522,0.145632672098118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05472476823040648,0.18105263285158973,0.0,0.2333487961810967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03857523698935327,0.1488206348974836,0.057047726329611775,0.2304822211566176,0.16928834551264482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0604468212829791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05382604288448856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05896695637846839,0.059172322939213165,0.04124710170819399,0.0,0.0,0.0747828096073769

Maybe some you can look back and laugh at now, maybe some you still feel ashamed of and would like some kind words, or maybe some you think are crazy and would like some reassurance that you're okay :)

Mine is from today: I cut open an avocado, and where the stem was it was all brown, but everything else looked fine. Tried to convince myself it was fine, made the whole avocado toast and when it came time to eat it...I was too scared of being poisoned/getting sick or something (I mean, can that even happen??) that I scrapped off all the avocado and now I'm sitting here with my plate full of damn avocado that I know was most likely perfectly fine to eat lol

healthanxiety,carrmann79,2018/01/11,"Bruise anxiety I have a bruise appear on my outer thigh. About an inch wide. 

3 days ago when I noticed it, it was actual 2 bruises, a smaller and larger bruise.

The next day, the smaller bruise was nearly gone. The larger looked like it was fading. 

Last night, the large bruise was a red circle, which was not what it looked like the night before, which got my anxiety up.

Today it's spread a bit and now a dark red, turning purple ish and I noticed I have a lot of spider viens in that area. 

I'm so scared it's a blood clot or something worse. Should I wait and monitor it or go to doctor? I've been working with my therapist, that one symptom doesn't make it true, but I'm really freaking out. Is this normal for a Bruise? I've never paid a bruise attention before, so I don't know what's typical.

healthanxiety,tor70,2018/01/11,"HA for two weeks - just discovered what its like Hi all;

So the last two weeks have been a ride for me. I've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear (runs in the family). A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. So I started taking antibios ... didnt go away. So today I went to an ENT, who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time (1 week, 1 hour, 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal). I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. The ringing will go away, just in time.

The problem is... throughout the past several days, I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness. The first concern was cancer, then that turned into a meningiti, then that turned into inner ear concerns, then that turned into HIV concerns ...

I don't know how I arrived at any of these conclusions. I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses, yet I immediately assumed that I had them. No way do I have meningitis, I would know by now ... no way do I have cancer, it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms. No way do I have aids ... I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. 

My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. I literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps, rashes, bruises .... 

I write because I'm curious to know other people's stories. How do you cope with this? This constant anxiety-driven fear of having a major disease. I've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses, conditions, symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past. The slightest itch would terrify me. An ingrown hair on my belt-line convinced me I had an STD. 

In effect, I didn't actually live the past week. My worrying sapped away from my actual living. 

Sorry for the long drawn out rant.

healthanxiety,theflexorcist,2018/01/11,"Having a horrible HA week. This week my HA has just went flying back off the rails. It started with the usual heart palpitations, thinking im on the verge of cardiac arrest. Then i had a day of thinking i was gonna die of sepsis, for literally no reason at all. Like i didnt even have an injury. I keep washing my hands too much. Cleaning the absolute shit out of my house. And as of yesterday my head has settled back on the good ole fear of getting Rhabdomyolysis from powerlifting. Because i think i overdid training yesterday. I had a back injury that kept me from doing specifically squats for like almost a year. So i have been afraid to do them. Deadlift and bench are fine and i go heavy. But i have really only been doing squats on the high volume speed work day. I was doing pause squats with only 1 plate (per side) on the bar. Its way too light and i have been afraid to go heavier. So yesterday i decided to do box squats 10 sets of 2 with 30 sec rest. With 1 plate and one chain (per side). For resistance. It felt easy and i completed it and went on to do the rest of the exercises per usual. But then it sudden hit me that i did more weight with high volume than im used to on that particular exercise.  I do more than double that weight on deadlift, but still, thats not the same. And ill probably get rhabdo. Later on in the evening i felt nauseous and i think i have some pain in my quads. No other symptoms. But i read you could have it and have NO SYMPTOMS WTF. Idk if the nausea and migraine i got was from the major anxiety from the rest of the week leading up to this or from rhabdo. Im really trying to not do the whole panic and go to the ER thing that i always do when i get like this. Im ruining my sleep schedule that i worked really hard to fix (i have insomnia from ptsd), and i didnt want to sleep until i knew i didnt have it. Im still panicking over it today. And as soon as i get anxiety the nausea comes back and i think about the minor soreness in my quads and how its going to kill me or make me very sick for a long time and ruin everything. Its fucking awful.

healthanxiety,xereeto,2018/01/11,"Fucking amoeba again I'm in Egypt and, while taking a shower, I managed to inhale a small droplet of water up my nose. I didn't feel it, but I'm sure it went up there because I sniffed very hard and the ends of my hair, beaded with water droplets, were dangling right in front of my nostrils. I looked it up (why did I do that) and apparently the tap water here is full of that fucking amoeba that eats your brains. Now I've got the 15 day incubation period to endure, knowing that every twinge in my head could signal my doom. Fuck my life.

Worst of it is, one of the first symptoms of the amoeba is ""alterations to taste or smell""... I have a cold... which also causes that. And can cause headaches too. And sometimes even fever.

healthanxiety,Itsame_Daario,2018/01/11,"“Hollow” feeling in chest For the past couple of weeks, I’ve had this pain/discomfort in my chest. Sometimes it’s a dull pain in the center, sometimes sharp. I also get this weird weak feeling in my chest. It feels sort of hollow. I’ll get a flutter once in a while. Weird. 
I’ve had all the tests a few months ago. EKG, blood test, chest X-ray, echo. All normal.

healthanxiety,MeekosACheeseLover,2018/01/11,"Crippling fear Hey guys, I’m posting this because I want to see if I’m the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me, and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool I’ve been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain, ache, tingle, and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture, and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same, I’ve been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer, a brain tumor, or MS. Usually it’s cancer that takes over my thoughts.

My thing is, I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor, being diagnosed, because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes, but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and I’m convinced it’s changing, so every other week I ask my girlfriend if it’s changed and she says of course not. I can’t remember what it looked like as a kid, but I could’ve sworn it didn’t look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldn’t go away, got chest x-rays to rule out pneumonia, and before my doctor told me the results I told him, “look, if I have cancer I don’t want to know, just don’t tell me” and he looked at me like I was crazy because the X-ray came back perfectly fine, just a common flu.

I’ve avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go, but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much, but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me.",3.423156498673741,4.134052177718837,4.619376657824933,87.77001989389922,72.315649867374,7.391511936339523,25.90583554376657,7.468242284971852,1.1444663129973476,1409,43,306,15,26,465,187,377,0.168,0.745,0.086,-0.9796,0,2,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,1,20,20,1,6,23,0,25,23,5,2,2,52,57,25,0,9,13,0,1,5,1,2,18,1,0,2,20,17,0,2,9,2,0,9,7,11,0,1,13,8,51,9,40,40,3,41,0,1,6,0,17,14,0,6,20,203,71,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05655333378929853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911100930620759,0.0,0.069456089969455,0.17053403312051424,0.06172528160687463,0.13519415967236215,0.0,0.06290574364108907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16423066552410753,0.0,0.0825260780432488,0.0,0.08455186837068228,0.0,0.0,0.15640821568281665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059024048104609525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1500670555127077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5296661232456525,0.0646933079458522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048827551957548614,0.06687047213648907,0.1868580130472975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16637503521542876,0.03737930341578399,0.05281288563946414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03862338361958791,0.0,0.16805583195716065,0.0,0.05912552824882392,0.0,0.0,0.07319855177401925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07298680865065975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25036101402123023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125580250092553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05221625497821332,0.1805830138935341,0.07409346451434871,0.06527818106574504,0.0654223527356254,0.2483175266963429,0.0,0.0,0.06284940398390944,0.0,0.0,0.04934630655551788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05434425645998778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050094300263451484,0.05622419951631901,0.07866267943468949,0.08673645688025594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10250222536252752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0698841455753212,0.08334067276646002,0.14160171183074094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07394619650225928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08374396338173376,0.0,0.0,0.05878907428318029,0.0,0.0,0.11781920598153288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061152509148120274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05691199355801905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05558329542286612,0.05941907207160834,0.06461474938468162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04911327644199421,0.047368918200103985,0.0,0.05868913803823962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14127928712355114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24425776560155785,0.0,0.130810748484458,0.05867916945475023,0.059299131281212114,0.0,0.0,0.1370606394301166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08082668475802944,0.0,0.04760604325476756

healthanxiety,rnavstar,2018/01/11,"IBS/psoriasis My story and never would have thought what was causing it!! I want to share my story because I believe there’s a lot people out there in my situation. 

When I was younger in high school, I would get diarrhea going to class, mostly happened in the morning. This was around the year 1999. I had psoriasis on my head for most of my life. It would get bad from time to time, but never went away.  The doctor would prescribe an ointment that stunk like gasoline. I would put this on head and it felt like it was burning the skin off my skull. So I never really used it, just suffered as is. 

Now back to the diarrhea issue. I went to the doctors and they did everything you could imagine. Blood tests, stool tests, upper and lower GI’s, and the good old colonoscopy! In the end the doctor said that I was a healthy young man. So he diagnosed me with IBS.

Once I graduated from high school it seem to simmer down to where I never really had any more symptoms. So I figured that is was over. 

Years passed by and once in a blue moon the IBS would come back. But the psoriasis never went away. I moved forward in my career, and in my personal life. I thought that the nightmare I had when I was younger would never comeback. Boy I was wrong! One day at work after having something for lunch my captain and I had just taken off we were in the air for all of ten minutes. I looked at him and said we have to go back and land! He asked what was wrong, I replied that I’m going to crap my pants. So we turned the plane around and landed without incident. 

The next day my manager called and asked what had happened and I replied that I must have ate something I shouldn’t have. 

Months rolled by with no farther problems other then the psoriasis. 

I upgraded to captain and loved what I was doing. Then one day, it came back only this time it didn’t go away!! Much worse, I started taking Imodium gel caps one before the flight and as prescribed as many as I need during the flight.(this was a bad idea for me, but we will come back to this)
So off to the doctor I went and of course started to do familiar tests. Only this time after all the testing the doctor didn’t just say it was IBS but it also must be in my head. Now it’s time to send me to a shrink. 

There I am, off work by this point sitting on a couch playing head games at the same time trying not to mess myself. After the third session I said “it’s not in my head, no way!!!

My wife is going crazy by this point with me not working, so off I went with the same problems back to work. The first day I tried to do one flight. Had diarrhea threes times and kept taking Imodium trying to fight it. I didn’t even get the engine started. I went back off work. 

Then my wife said “your going to do whatever I tell you to do now”! I was game because I just wanted this to be over. She sent me to a natural-path doctor, I thought that this was going to be a joke, but played along as I’m willing to do whatever by this point. This ended up being a game changer for me. I told her what was happening, and she said “tell me what you eat I the run of a day”. I told her and she replied that it sounds like a FOOD INTOLERANCE, and that it’s a simple blood test. I said that I already been tested, she replied “that’s for allergies”. 

I agreed to the test. About three weeks later she calls me, say the results are in. I went to see her she said I had three different intolerances one was potatoes another was cane sugar with fruit, and the last most important....soy. 

That day I eliminated all three and within a week all my symptoms were gone including my psoriasis, even the little bumps on the back of my arms went away!!

I was so happy, the only problem now is that I have to prepare all my meals and read every label of anything I want to eat. So living on the road as an airline pilot makes it tough, but I’ve got it down now.

Soy is what was causing all my problems, and if I have it today it comes back at full fold. Now remember how I said I was taking Imodium GEL caps, well one of the ingredients is SOY.  Just like a car, jamming on the brakes while hitting the gas!!

So I had medical problems that regular doctors couldn’t find, went to a naturalpathic doctor and found out that I have a food intolerance to Soy.",2.531125786959408,4.212861848729794,3.684381347084692,89.7767200797241,76.00923787528869,6.592780537188776,23.75677813281027,7.357864514023983,0.8601587079629214,3315,103,711,40,73,1075,323,866,0.077,0.862,0.061,-0.9476,2,0,2,0,1,0,100.0,4,4,1,6,43,27,2,0,55,0,75,35,11,6,14,117,144,55,0,22,16,2,2,4,0,12,14,11,1,3,53,43,9,2,11,7,0,29,17,15,1,13,66,19,103,12,109,59,15,146,0,1,3,1,54,56,1,6,65,510,156,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044795446810312486,0.03246225229272142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027604670139310776,0.042565358688605406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03340462641305042,0.07227285230312762,0.07589805557673203,0.0,0.15255404976904885,0.2809219902901017,0.06778701253126122,0.04949030044788575,0.0,0.03454170091637045,0.04573447349050369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0829000976960094,0.046427642058312166,0.0,0.08340050096148419,0.0,0.10490197041116166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032410252204238744,0.0,0.0,0.1570749780063711,0.0,0.0,0.04120109745856721,0.0,0.04241110382693968,0.0,0.3323897039004124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.083073660904006,0.0,0.0,0.07190679808428392,0.0,0.0,0.053622661416072345,0.0,0.034201400523576814,0.0,0.03648242136216403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03897569969176772,0.0,0.037101317864946866,0.03452843277681472,0.09817056911763564,0.04450819078487439,0.0,0.0,0.06362458917795649,0.0,0.1614897847200336,0.03404752952737298,0.03246597520483474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10768891633061252,0.04321206303716258,0.0,0.0,0.20830093324844465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857775849540594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045824619326662416,0.0,0.04236860415534911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03308875859985582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0573441519973472,0.07932686709278981,0.0406849063849336,0.03584441223050463,0.0,0.03408794349676579,0.0,0.0,0.034510764669926364,0.03663681798380306,0.0,0.02709618015317241,0.04115498754750207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04089323340888183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032400990094101995,0.04314399447693696,0.029840566926186213,0.03009923674115593,0.18784720405458602,0.0,0.0431711756744382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04259558388391558,0.0864605598527313,0.16504143219616266,0.09261854505857052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028142113953344643,0.03544429083435359,0.0,0.0,0.11512067653304578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19421036235122227,0.0,0.040807233252068,0.0,0.0,0.040604041151749724,0.0,0.052009902357193945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045984019411446656,0.0,0.3089063364957045,0.06456245498426931,0.0,0.08216467985447397,0.03234741010644459,0.03695439369965955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04562829583233943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06250103555731408,0.0,0.0,0.08619592210451467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08438345617105557,0.09156277894418664,0.0,0.07096024047553139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09667905675145552,0.16569096214495527,0.0,0.03847747075590315,0.07757680935055625,0.0,0.08268006146947995,0.04415358844107328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035059367131969464,0.0,0.0,0.07182850864265664,0.032220878476398415,0.06512260212685263,0.0,0.0364980324588051,0.3386715271543409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03913025750829261,0.0,0.14776114148797062,0.0,0.04136779212186528,0.20185299664385373,0.08876426886876483,0.0,0.05228119445817609
healthanxiety,anxietythrowaway1233,2018/01/11,"HIV Anxiety About 3 weeks ago, I was the insertive partner in unprotected anal sex with another guy. He claimed to be HIV- and sent me test results from November proving so. However, I'm still nervous. About 3 days after the encounter, I developed something akin to strep throat; this went away after ~10 days, possibly thanks to amoxicillin. Today, I took an in-home HIV test that came back negative, but apparently these are not guaranteed to be accurate until 3 months after the event. I'm incredibly worried that I have HIV after one mistake.

healthanxiety,ais991,2018/01/12,"Bump on the (fore)head I have noticed that there is a “bump” - it’s bone though, not actual bump as when you bump your head against something - on one side of my forehead. I can definitely see it looking from the profile. I haven’t ever really spent ages investigating my forehead shape, but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t there always - however, I couldn’t tell how long it’s been present either. Years ago I had a pretty bad head injury in an accident, but I was overall ok and haven’t really had any problems since - so I’m guessing it’s probably not directly related, if there is anything... As of recent I have developed strange little symptoms, eg. I feel like I’m clumsier/less well co-ordinated than before and my muscles on one side feel a bit strange/achy sometimes, but these things aren’t very consistent and aren’t really getting worse, they’re probably in my head and they do get better with vitamin B.

I know I tend to be a bit hypochondriac and after that accident years ago I was, understandably, pretty paranoid about anything head-related - that’s why I’m hesitant to actually speak to a doctor in case they think I’m crazy and I waste their time on nonsense. If there’s anyone on here who knows a bit about the subject - any doctors or med students maybe - do you reckon it is worth checking out?

healthanxiety,prettylittlenutter,2018/01/12,"Paranoid about a healing bump on the forehead So almost two weeks ago (last Monday), I decided to go to Urgent Care because of chest pains. On my way to the car, I opened the door and it whacked me in the forehead.

I had a huge egg on my forehead above my right eye and it has almost gone down completely. The only bump is a small vertical line raised that isn't much longer than 3/4"". 

But because it is a line and it hurts to touch it (as well as after touching it), my brain is telling me I'm going to die of a blood clot or a stroke. 

Can someone please help convince me this isn't the case?

Hey everyone, would love some input- I've been getting odd chest sensations for a while now along with shoulder, back and neck pains. I spoke to my doctor and he believes it's posture related. But lately, this week, the chest discomfort has become more pronounced. I went to the gym two days ago and while I was on the elliptical, I started feeling this almost burning sensation in my chest. It subsided somewhat once I stopped. That same sensation has come and gone since and now I have a spot that's sore to the touch right over my sternum. I'm thinking it's reflux related, especially since I'm on meds for that and I've been burping a lot, but does anyone else have any insight?

healthanxiety,Funnycatchphrase,2018/01/12,"Second opinion for cancer? Hey there.

I'm a 24 y/o female and in early October 2017 I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck about the size of a pea. Assuming it was from a cold as I had been coughing quite a bit. I let it go until I noticed again in early November it had grown in size. I noticed another under my right jaw and my doctor ordered an ultrasound and the left one measured 1.88 cm x 0.92 cm x 0.98 cm and the right one measured 1.27cm x .76cm x 1.06cm. I had other swollen lymph nodes as well, but this was the one I could feel from the outside.

The ultrasound tech ordered another test through my GP (although my GP was hesitant to sign the form for my follow up) for early January, so I went on the 2nd. The left lymph node is now 1.74cm x 1.03cm X1.0cm and the right lymph node is now 1.79cm x 0.91cm x 1.22cm.

I've also found that my cough has gotten worse despite not having any other ""cold"" symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, etc) as well as I am finding myself very short of breath with a chronic pinching/squeezing sensation below where my bra band sits. My doctor ordered a pulmonary function test and we are waiting for results. I find myself waking up in the middle of night really hot and sweaty and I have been getting an itchy rash on my stomach that comes and goes. When I mentioned this to my doctor she didn't think anything of it (I thought I might be getting fevers at night from a bad flu or something).

I'm a little worried because the lymph nodes mentioned (as well as the other 8 or 9 notes in my ultrasound) have seem to have grown in some way or another and I'm hoping my doctor doesn't dismiss it like she did the last time. Would you reccomend a second opinion? Seeing if the lymph nodes grow more?

It's slowly going away!!!

I'm excited to have one of those random unexplainable things which normal people get and don't worry about!

HA sufferers - think about how many of your symptoms just magically went away. The human body is weird.

healthanxiety,Vivaldaim,2018/01/12,"Irrationally terrified of seizures I have spent today being irrationally terrified of having a seizure. I've never had a seizure before. I've seen my sister having a diabetic seizure, but that's as close as I've gotten to ""experiencing"" one.

My anxiety stems from the fact that people with retinal migraine are at a higher risk of experiencing seizures and strokes.

Then there is this: I was prescribed Wellbutrin last week to help with getting out of bed in the mornings (coupled with venlaflaxine). My psych informed me that drinking alcohol can result in a seizure while on Wellbutrin. In addition, so can combining Wellbutrin and aspirin/Advil. He said Tylenol is OK, and I checked online for any drug interactions, too, which confirmed that it should be OK. I have a cold today and an upset stomach, so I took some Tylenol Cold &amp; Flu pills to relieve it.

And then I spent the rest of my evening preoccupied by the idea of having a seizure because I took Tylenol. I even contemplated seriously telling my boss that I could have a seizure, along with wanting to tell my coworker that if I am on the ground shaking uncontrollably that it is a seizure and to call an ambulance.

Completely irrational, I know.

i only get them when im angry, never any other time.. hmmmm... i have never been on any medication for my mental health but i do have OCD. but it isn't anxiety that causes them, it's anger

healthanxiety,baudelaireorphan,2018/01/13,"Insomnia Last month, I suddenly developed the worst case of insomnia I've ever had. I'll literally lie in bed for hours and I can't fall asleep. I can't even fall asleep to nap after a night of little sleep. I'm wondering if anyone else here has ever experienced that. My psychiatrist isn't worried about it, but I'm not really sure I trust her since it just keeps going on. She prescribed me sleeping pills, but they don't always work.

healthanxiety,moonbento,2018/01/13,"Afraid to get worked up I posted here befpre about my healyh fears related to the head/brain mostly focusing on tumors,meningitis and the thing I hate to type out that involves bleeding in the head from a weakened or expanding blood vessel.

I got a CT scan last month due to head pains ,nausea and dizziness. It was without dye/contrast and the scan came back nornal accorsing to the doctor. I still fear what I fear since I noticed whenever i get slightly annoyed or mad I feel a pressure or slight ache or pain at the top of my head. It even happens when im not getting angry but someone is getting mad at me. Now I cant help but think the worst. Im scared to sneeze or strain during a BM too. I also notice a squeezing senation like muscles squeezing on the top or back of my head whenever i gwt anxious or come inside from cold weather.

Theres no history of what I fear in my family and I dont have high BP or smoke/drink. Im 80 lbs currently and I have been seeing therapist recently.

Edit: changed weight after checking it.

Update: tmi but had to go pass a bowel movement and qas a little difficult and i felt tension or pressure in my head qhile going but no headache afterwards",3.580611061552183,5.286743974576272,4.704210526315791,83.45898751115078,73.23728813559322,7.510793933987513,28.946476360392513,8.20500826718156,2.1086644067796607,942,39,178,15,19,309,148,236,0.249,0.716,0.035,-0.993,2,0,2,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,3,11,19,4,10,15,0,8,12,7,0,0,29,23,22,0,0,15,0,5,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,10,1,0,3,0,1,6,6,18,0,0,6,9,21,1,24,17,2,33,0,0,3,0,2,13,0,10,14,110,28,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07429838808959248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049594451252691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428808305259731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10371590662965643,0.0,0.10626184950532833,0.0,0.0,0.09828420469326574,0.08003190124425417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09509513925083854,0.0,0.0,0.10888732879253483,0.09101433977568137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06136477026243579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08758526891002745,0.41818872354181497,0.04697700938752173,0.0,0.08920612271908385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1941621045949263,0.0,0.1056033643492889,0.0,0.07430690895150077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0821581204155848,0.0,0.0,0.09172728440143893,0.5721016559798214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06227418518531023,0.09816226303147883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30106931997730885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07573231227723999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04539009111294105,0.09311809102827726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07415817346223995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21155244592296696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1977210430674108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08898005497813727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09173531068800976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09301698329672532,0.0,0.07403554159181676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07685434809651072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07872053465283857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419634301599276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078731950647624,0.06172385886392049,0.05953161005197834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11313675311493955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08955986886494265,0.0,0.06763803408241004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,TheHumanZoid,2018/01/13,"Very worried about my first blood test [22 year old male from London, England]

I have never had a blood test before and I have decided to bite the bullet and get one next week. I am going to be requesting a blood test on Monday due to some GI problems I have had since November (which started when I started taking a daily multivitamin), although have not been serious enough to warrant consulting a medical professional but not mild enough to be ignored completely. I am absolutely terrified they are going to turn around and say that I have a serious form of cancer or IBD (there has not been any bleeding, fatigue or fever though). I know it's an irrational fear because I frequently exercise, 75% of my diet is healthy and I don't smoke, drink or do drugs. However, I still feel as though they are going to call me up and ask me to be at the hospital immediately. Reassurance would be appreciated!

healthanxiety,Confusedsoul84,2018/01/13,"I’m a gay male hypochondriac so anxious about getting HIV. It’s affecting my life and relationships. Why do I feel like this? I have always had some form of hypochondria and more recently it has overrun my life and relationships. 
I am deeply anxious all the time.  I’m not intimate because of fear even though I’m in a monogamous relationship and I’m very conscious of my surroundings. For example , if I’m walking and someone coughs near me I have to look the other way or turn around directions. If someone sneezes same thing. I have to get as far away from them.  Also if I go out to eat , i have to see food being prepared like sushi or salads in front of me , if I notice something off like worker using no gloves or touched something differently I buy the salad and struggle to eat it after inspecting it for blood or bodily fluid many times. 

I feel like my body is contaminated or some disease is brewing inside me all the time even though my latest blood work last August was all negative.  I’m a habitual hand washer and sanitizer and I use alcohol to sanitize my razors toothbrushes before every use.  

I know HIV is very hard to get but over the past couple years i have been tested over 100 times including majority  over the counter HIV test for $40 each. This is crippling me and I want to resolve this fear.

healthanxiety,throwmefeat33,2018/01/13,"I fear I was bitten by a bat or something Hello,

I just need to get this off my chest. It am always worried about something with my health.About a week I was walking in my backyard. It was really cold in PA like below freezing. I had a coat and jeans on. When I was walking back I felt something near my knee. I didn't think anything of it. but I get random feelings all the time but nothing is ever there. But then a day later I found this and I am concerned. It doesn't itch or painful and its gone now. But for some reason I think it is a bite from something. My parents think I am crazy.
It has since healed.  https://imgur.com/a/EMPVa

healthanxiety,squi11ium,2018/01/13,"Blood(???) in Stool Alright so this is an issue I’ve had on and off for years and I don’t know what to do. So basically, sometimes I have red spots in my stool. I say spots because it doesn’t fill the whole bowl, the whole stool isn’t red, just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. I’m 21 now, and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test, found nothing but a hemroid, sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. It’s happened on and off since then and usually I either know it’s hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however, it’s gotten worse. About a month ago, as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. I’ve been fine this past month, but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days I’ve noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still don’t really think it’s blood, but if that’s the case wouldn’t it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a “spot” as I’ve described. 

Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasn’t blood, and I feel going again will just lead to the same result. I’m just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and I’m just overly vigilante, as health anxiety definitely has made me, or is there more to it.

healthanxiety,afrankblue92,2018/01/13,Scary throat problems I had 2 respiratory infections in about a span of a month and when it finally began to clear up I had an persistent globule feeling in the opening of my throat. After about a week later that two passed and I began to have pain in the right side of my chest usually after eating. Most recently I've been having this electric shock feeling in the opening of my throat when I yawn or sometimes just stretch my neck. I feel like it maybe happened occasionally over the last couple weeks but I feel like the frequency and intensity is increasing with time.

healthanxiety,Alwaysdying69,2018/01/13,"Constant lung issues Hey all, 

Been having lung issues for months. Constantly feeling sick the last 4 weeks. Moved out of a house filled with mold.

Been prescribed two diff antibiotics before tests showed nothing.

Started feeling slightly better but was around a ton of cigarette smoke.

It's like every other night I feel awful. Can't see the doctor again for a week. Just constantly losing my mind. Difficulty breathing doesn't help at all.

Just needed to complain. Thanks.

healthanxiety,ThrowAwayBcReasons08,2018/01/13,"Can’t tell if panic attack or allergic reaction. Please help. So I have what I think is the common cold and decided to take Mucinex DM. After I took it I noticed there weren’t any effects listed on the package at all so I looked it up online. Well it says the most severe side effect is chest tightness/difficulty breathing. I was kinda already having chest tightness before I looked that up. Reading that made it even worse. 

The reason I can’t tell if it’s panic or not is because I started getting bad anxiety after reading about the flu epidemic and how it caused death and stuff. This was all after taking it. This is also my first time ever taking Mucinex DM. Everything is just making my feelings worse and I don’t know what to do. My main anxiety/panic symptoms are chest tightness, short breaths, and nausea. 

It said on the website to go to the ER but I’m too scared to and can’t afford it at all. I’m also worried it’s just my anxiety and that I’ll end up going for no reason.

healthanxiety,kaywhite28,2018/01/13,"I feel like I’m going crazy. This all started after the death of a loved one. It was sudden, but not health related. Ever since then I analyze every single thing I do and how it could impact me. I’m always worried about my liver failing or something like that because I drink. I’m not an alcoholic by any means, at most I’ll have 4 drinks maybe twice a week. I’m 21 so that’s kind of the norm in college, but I still worry. A lot of my health anxiety is about other people as well. I constantly worry that my boyfriend is going to die for example. I know it’s so stupid and that I’m fine, but the worrying overtakes me. I know this started after the sudden death of a loved one. But at this point, I can’t control it and worrying is taking over my life.

healthanxiety,lemonpie2605,2018/01/13,"Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything, A &amp; E said I had no serious injuries, no bruise etc. 

My Health Anxiety's like, ""Well how do you know you're fine, you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.""

I go to the doctor, I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out, so I go to the A &amp; E again, a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. 

Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital (he's fine and well now) and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him, I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest, and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out; I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.

So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.

I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead, but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety; believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing, everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...

I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety; she tells me that all of my symptoms (headaches, ringing in ears, loss of sense of smell) are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.

Just today, I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me health-wise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes, ""Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke."" I can't pay attention to things.

It doesn't matter what the doctors say, after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.

I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?

How do you convince yourself that there's nothing seriously wrong with you?

healthanxiety,jstaffy,2018/01/14,"2+ years of relentless HIV anxiety - please read and KEEP CALM For the last couple of years, I have been utterly petrified of HIV. I'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. Statistically, the chances of me having it were  alwaysridiculously small, and none of the science would support the hypothesis that I had contracted HIV.

But some brains work in funny ways. And mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. And I'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of self-loathing and utter panic. The advent of Dr Google is good, but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health.

The solution the whole time was simple: test. Test and set yourself free. It's hugely important on so many levels to know your HIV status. For your own health, for your sexual partner's health. For the sake of the NHS. I am so glad I got tested. I can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. It feels strange not carrying around the fear I had been carrying before; it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space.

I had ALL the symptoms. Absolutely text book seroconversion illness. Fever, sore throat, swollen glands, night sweats, stomach discomfort, everything. Doctor's presumed it was glandular fever, but tests never confirmed the presence of the EBV (which it should for glandular fever). Classic ARS. Of course, after a couple of weeks I was back on my feet again, and the doctor was quite content.Then about a year after this, I came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. Seemed like some sort of bacterial infection (to me). And it always got worse in the sun. OBVIOUSLY my immune system was compromised.

From the moment of my ""glandular fever"" my brain had convinced myself I was carrying HIV. But I wasn't brave enough to test. I was being cowardly. However, over the last few months I've been having some stomach issues, which are pretty non-specific, and the internet didn't really help me link it to HIV. The doctor did suggest a CBC test for me though, I think just to get an idea if anything was going on, blood-wise (obviously lol). I was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of ""no news is good news"".

Of course, having had the blood test on Monday, first thing on Tuesday I got a call from the doctor. My white blood cell count was low, and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. AHHHHH! My brain went in to overdrive. I couldn't cope. This was it. My worst fears realised. Why me? Why me?!! That's exactly what HIV does - it attacks white blood cells. Nooooo!

I went in for the doctor's appointment, and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern.

She did then say, ""I would like to test you for HIV"". My world was crumbling inwards. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me, a very conservative, early twentys, heterosexual male. I looked at the statistics to such a deep level, that I knew that in my country of residence, there was only 32 males aged 15-24 who were HIV positive. That's essentially like 0% of the population. I was about to become a medical phenomenon.

The doctor eventually decided just to take the CBC again in 6 weeks time, and that we wouldn't test for HIV just yet (as I kind of freaked out when she suggested the HIV test). But the time was now - I needed to know. I would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being, every second of the day. I had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day, and I totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension I felt.

I did manage to summon the courage to order a HIV home test kit, which I had delivered to my family home, where I would have the test in the presence of my family so that I could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result (and in my head, it was very much of WHEN not IF). I spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low WBC, and they were all wonderfully supportive (did have to speak to my Mum about my sex-life though - not ideal).

So I went home yesterday, and I had the test. And, of course, it was a big fat NEGATIVE. Which it always has been. It was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work, but during those 15 minutes, on a deep level I felt a sense of peace. The band aid had been ripped off, and life was going to move on.

HIV is the worst for health anxiety, as almost everything can be linked back to it. The anxiety can make your brain question everything - I was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. But the chances are, going off the plethora of statistics out there, you don't have it, whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of HIV research ever (which has been me for the last two years). But still, if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what I was experiencing, you need to get tested. Now. Somehow. Make it happen.

I took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what I went through, can find solace in it. You will be alright regardless. You are a good person. But you need to put your mind to rest. You need to have the test. 

'Thinking Fast and Slow' by Daniel Kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. Our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinking/catastrophising. But numbers matter. Statistics speak volumes. You are not special. You are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. You aren't the 1 in 100,000 shot. You are the 99,999 out of 100,000 shot. Our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers, but we must try. 

Peace!

healthanxiety,donutsandprosecco,2018/01/14,"Convinced I'm dying. First post in here - very nervous so it'll be long winded.

On Monday, I had pain under my armpit and across my chest on the left side. I convinced myself I had everything from breast cancer to heart failure. Went to the doctor on Thursday and she diagnosed me with shingles. My rash is more like a cluster of spots, and it's not itchy or have any of the other symptoms.

Since then, I've convinced myself my organs are failing and that I have a blood clot.

The latest is breast cancer. Was in the shower and noticed a small, about an inch long, patch of skin that's red. No itch, no rash, spot or lumps. It's not hot to touch. It's just red skin. The thing that's throwing me is that it's on my right side, whereas the shingles is on the left.

I've alway suffered with anxiety, but never health anxiety. I've just bought a house and I'm moving in on Friday - I'm starting to think that because I'm not stressed about that, I'm stressing about every single twinge in my body. For example, I'm now extremely dizzy. It's a side effect of the anti vitals, but I'm here writing a will.

Somebody please tell me I'm not going crazy.

healthanxiety,rraannddoommnnaammee,2018/01/14,"I'm scared It started with me checking randomly my neck and noticing a lymph node which if I recall correctly I have had for at least a year and another behind my ear which was there for years (I went to two doctors and at different times and got told there was nothing to worry), but I keep checking my neck basically everyday and keep finding others which I don't know if they were there before or not and my anxiety is getting worse and worse.

My throat doesn't feel ok even though I got checked by three doctors. I feel like I have a bit of nausea and the other day I had a bit of fever which only lasted one night. Also my left ear from times to times feel obstructed which I've been told is due to my nasal septum deviation.

And I could list a lot of other stuff that's wrong with me but that would get too long.

**A little over a month ago I had blood tests which didn't show anything wrong beside some vitamin but everyday I find a new symptom and I'm getting really scared right now. I keep thinking what if I took the tests too early, what if...**


**I don't know what to do anymore, everyday something new pops up. I try to think about other stuff but eventually... I get back there.**

healthanxiety,SimonGhoul,2018/01/14,"I think School gave me social anxiety story is, since I was born until I was 12 I was bullied, no big deal because I am not traumatized and I am actually in good terms with my old classmates now, but, being bullied made me what people call ""a NEET"" I don't mind talking to people or going outside.... well, I guess I do set some limits to myself when it comes to socializing (to the point I am almost always quiet)

I blame the school system, at least on my country, because it's made in a way that even when I moved to the US, it just isn't easy to socialize with others because you have to be quiet or talk low, this also gave me troubles with talking low usually, it's hard for me not to, well, I scream a lot when I watch videos (I am kind of crazy xd) but in my comfort zone only and well, I spent most of my days on a pc watching videos and having fun

My parents also just don't know how to take care of a child, you see, I got depression and maybe something else thanks to my dad, he isn't abusive, he does things for a good purpose but the way he does it made me hard to tolerate him (the slightest thing, even just saying a bad joke, if it comes from him it would make me mad over the line, and I don't want to feel like that but I can't avoid it, I dunno why, it's just how he made me). I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me (I almost never go to my friends houses, I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey, after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective, I don't hate them for that, not even mad, I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like that)

I think I am forgetting something.... I don't know.... I am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me I have that, but I dunno my man, I am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that I just want to get to the point, I am a NEET and I am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messages
but today, I tried VRChat and I just.... couldn't talk, I wanted to, but I couldn't, most of the times I just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times, I just don't know, I can't, maybe I feel insecure? I just wonder if there's a way to fix this.... I don't think it's deep
I don't feel pretty good now, I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat, my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR, and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. I am frustrated because my voice... it isn't bad, but I can't think of a avatar who would fit it, my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice, and even though I know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words, my words are just what can't get out, by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to it
This is annoying, I don't really hate my life, I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends, just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game, and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to (ironically, people ruined that fun ""a little bit"" xd at the price of making it more fun) I am having fun now but now, well, I just handled depression I guess, but talking to people is still something hard to do for me, at least I got friends in my school, but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that, I also find it almost impossible to start conversations, or just impossible (but, without speaking.... meh, it feels like there's no risk, I dunno, when I type I don't think I could mess up, not because of my voice, but it's still pretty hard, but I think that's how it is usually, hard)

I wanna add that my family aren't something I can call friends or people to talk to, they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who I am now, I also almost never talk to them, specially when I just think there's nothing to talk about (with most people actually, but there's a fewer amount of topics with them)
And well, that's my thing, I just want to know if there's something I can do, sorry for wasting your time, this is a mess, I don't normally make such a mess when I type stuff but this is one of the things I found the hardest to talk about (not emotionally), I usually make a mess when I find things hard to explain or to type, but this one is just the worst xd oh well
at least I am not always like this, there are times where I just have energy",4.923684464893288,3.997336126024592,5.918731054747911,85.42749072069287,68.88729508196721,8.923414785029385,27.738864831425918,7.966352962830772,1.4293931178472006,3553,91,817,38,53,1185,295,976,0.127,0.71,0.163,0.9915,2,1,5,0,0,0,127.0,1,3,8,2,80,59,7,3,37,0,92,3,0,15,2,177,161,76,0,16,62,3,11,4,6,3,3,14,0,3,58,35,0,2,25,8,3,9,45,26,6,2,27,30,137,33,101,122,18,83,0,5,5,0,70,30,0,29,43,583,195,7,0.0,0.04813713756269264,0.1189402164008086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16273094468918586,0.0,0.0,0.16244963843758686,0.06761094101146899,0.0,0.0,0.027628204247093214,0.0,0.062160102490987384,0.0,0.0402917250456616,0.028407806841335387,0.0,0.03343310522024027,0.0,0.037981380883175805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10176720558853483,0.14859747884583874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04435488588502238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08297077341227432,0.0,0.08284522091577448,0.0,0.0,0.06999426908117766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03243788326683725,0.0,0.0,0.026201481805836976,0.041885336939663,0.06998509378957182,0.041236223075480985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07110708393209053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03393919948524845,0.045700652913511636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13417094230789467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03830014521912846,0.0,0.08217026921962005,0.05804882160307046,0.0,0.0,0.11139884475736103,0.0,0.0,0.0445461358338044,0.18833299145003066,0.0,0.08490510898215561,0.0,0.04617927467187621,0.10222966930710996,0.12997461509426078,0.0,0.08951190312496217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2547608438083256,0.08022281273670195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0937577374192112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04240472511936539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04230745940607497,0.11163950630795363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041544538364465394,0.028696520113509736,0.07939449648414945,0.040719591927892436,0.0358749710546664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10362055951535812,0.0,0.15377150951879345,0.10847712300996504,0.04119007385383502,0.08163189709040729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04102235831948819,0.0,0.0,0.04318077649284445,0.0,0.0,0.06266911715389761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03980648399479125,0.03898333870033845,0.0,0.04263189835741304,0.0,0.0550607122507015,0.030899168715933824,0.0,0.0,0.09022442433879416,0.0,0.0,0.28166106253910494,0.035474508538697026,0.0,0.0,0.07681254773841567,0.0,0.0,0.08266587903271379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02602712146068423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03469580249898604,0.0,0.06461749711180174,0.0,0.12335209289552718,0.032374987593590275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0336076229421819,0.0,0.0,0.16565914561511405,0.0,0.1563858006016571,0.0,0.0454793428633886,0.028756469215194508,0.0,0.1622265220855791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09301790886165864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03054694664990716,0.3265497683701056,0.03551036848813766,0.03740449389657078,0.0,0.0,0.16194728547799145,0.23429309570486825,0.03991647294490093,0.0,0.1184515860369174,0.04669552242839658,0.03851027436990742,0.0,0.0,0.055167033063921685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04887007663507796,0.03508925667314869,0.13423689397852506,0.0,0.11981624229574205,0.096745044270498,0.0,0.0,0.2191748911253062,0.037662250939079385,0.07332029385507287,0.04535933521168081,0.0,0.0783272352992843,0.04405896782250057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0577214527316257,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,RCRod97,2018/01/14,"Fear of medicaments Hey everyone,

I have a little urinary infection and the doctor prescribed me 2 different medicaments : urispas 200 mg 3x a day every 8 hours, and ciproxina 500 mg 2x a day every 12 hours.
But now I'm wondering if that's not a little too much for a urinary infection and I fear that it can have negative effects. It's maybe stupid but I'm now thinking that maybe I missed something and didn't understand that it wasn't to take at the same time the same week, but one one week and the other the other week. Which wouldn't make any sense imo but I'm still wondering nonetheless.

What do you guys think ? (and btw, english isn't my first language but I hope you understood everything)",4.015447909754478,5.815083802919707,4.598659588586597,84.27538818845392,72.28467153284672,8.485467816854678,29.242866622428664,9.095868883498916,2.5019255474452557,559,23,108,12,11,178,84,137,0.091,0.878,0.03,-0.6908,1,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,0,2,4,5,1,2,10,0,8,3,0,2,0,25,21,12,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,11,6,0,0,7,0,0,0,6,4,0,3,3,0,8,1,4,17,3,15,0,1,0,0,4,3,0,4,12,65,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09951641919042677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18875476838668204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15289446189614278,0.0,0.14978549345546155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465960211969359,0.13983442366499746,0.13152122155550391,0.0,0.0,0.3293470350150836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12447698062918268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448999001740599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453489331683374,0.2882314262002814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.293342842214264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.097683283624622,0.0,0.29403699268704564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075769553528335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19832794315036864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11265990904741767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11686754905449245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11002968997232587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875379048410208,0.0,0.0,0.085332203167428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1523454086258734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3521560739172658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3173996161102506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sometimes twice within the same month. I am scared this is due to some weakened immunity. Please advise! I eat healthy and exercise. I do travel a lot for work. Is this due to that?,0.7655072463768101,3.2628829420289875,1.7652173913043503,96.06202898550724,89.14492753623188,4.22608695652174,19.26086956521739,5.82211442006289,-0.2297999999999991,269,8,57,2,9,84,53,69,0.128,0.784,0.08900000000000001,-0.5707,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,6,0,9,4,0,0,0,7,9,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,1,1,4,0,9,5,5,13,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,2,9,38,7,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2531329133118178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15106702633395747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2396885438800068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1909388916123725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19914458666937948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5609103572478771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22476198474842296,0.0,0.0,0.24946060482513302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25712791007651603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345175943761712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1937678066321153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23167181015319105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.170531321046387,0.0,0.0,0.3327982853969826,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,mrjuicepump,2018/01/15,"Stain on neck I noticed something on my neck about a month ago. It looks like a pimple what seemed to be a yellow bruise down below it. I then forgot about it because I then started worrying if I had colon cancer because my stomach would make noises non stop. After my stomach issues cleared up by themselves I noticed my neck and the stain got darker and a bit bigger. For the past week or so I’ve been constantly looking up melanoma and now I feel like I have it. I’ve been obsessing, taking 50 pictures a day of my neck, crying, it able to eat properly, feeling like I’m going to faint, shaking, and not being able to be happy with my wife and daughter. I spoke to a virtual doctor and said I should get tested to see if it is melanoma and I’ve been crying and worrying all day. I feel like I’m going insane and the thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind at least once because the thought of leaving my wife and daughter behind and the fact that I’m only 26 scares me so much. I want to grow old with my wife and thinking that I might die so scares me so much. I’m going to an actual doctor tomorrow and I can’t handle it. I don’t know how I’m going to be like at work. I constantly keep googling and once I start I can’t stop. I feel like I have melanoma and it’s already to late because it might be advanced. I’m scared and all I want to do is cry and not move. I just want to be in bed and hold my wife and have her tell me that I’m going to be okay over and over again. I just needed to vent.

healthanxiety,GoldenTeachMe,2018/01/15,"sensations seemingly in heart Hi all! Do any of you ever have fleeting sensations coming from your heart? I can't find anything about it online so I figured I would ask folks here. The sensations I get aren't necessarily painful, but they give me anxiety as I feel like something is wrong with my heart. I have a history of stimulant use but I have long since said fuck off to those. This normally happens right when I wake up and get out of bed if at all. I'm 24 and am in pretty good shape.

healthanxiety,chapnerchap,2018/01/15,"Pupil size I’m a 30 year old female, and just noticed a difference in pupil size. It’s only in dim light and I’ve been to the optometrist 2 times everything looks fine and I have 20/20 vision she said it was so small she didn’t notice it until I mentioned it. But obviously still have been anxious and checking in the mirror nonstop. I got a horrible stiff neck back in June and have had a kink in my neck since- I’m also a long distance walker 10miles 4X a week and have been told this can be because of hip stuff. I have had blood work and everything is fine. But I’m convinced I have a spinal or brain tumor, it’s been hard for me to concentrate on information ( probably because I’m preoccupied with anxiety) and I’m dizzy but I can’t tell if I’m making that up too.  Feeling crummy and pretty shameful.

healthanxiety,ecn_ln,2018/01/15,"I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 5/6 years now, however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. 
Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest, or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.

About a year and a half ago I started saying  'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure, like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.

However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice (for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden) 
I still say it sometimes, but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. 

My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, shaking etc. I know/hope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.

To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. 

Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.

How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind.

healthanxiety,Tomogilvi3141,2018/01/16,"Where I'm now with depersonlization/derealization So its been 7 hard crushing months but im glad to say it's mainly over. However, it wasent easy. If u haven't read about my subreddit about how to deal with depersonlization I highly recommend u check it out. If u r still dealing with derealization plz message me YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Trust me I'm the most paranoid kid I've been through hell and back with this. 

So near about October/November I thought about DP (depersonlization) less and less, honeslty it's gotten so much better for me and i thank God for that. However I've not felt the same. Sometimes I feel like time is moving fast or that I'm in a simulation but that's just me being me;even my friend who has never taken weed or had DP is also thinking about these things. 

The good news is it does get better bad news is it takes time and motivation. I personally had to go to a psychiatrist about my problem however yall be fine without one. My thoughts took over me and i felt more depressed than depersonalised; Don't get me wrong some days I thought I was dead like literally. For a solid 5-6 months or so I woke up everyday and it was the first thought on my mind it was shit I couldn't talk to my bro without thinking he and myself weren't  real, i honeslty felt suicidal. 

Then some day I just woke up and i didn't think about it don't know why just didnt. I learned to control my thoughts but not to block them out. It's like me saying QUICK DONT THINK ABOUT A DOG ON ICE, boom bet u thought that, fuckin  magician I am. Anyway it's all about  acknowledging your thoughts don't block them out or try to get rid of them however don't let them take over you. Say to yourself 'I know you're there I'm just not in the mood to talk right now' it's like a fly in the room the more you try get rid of it the worse you will exhaust yourself however if u see it u wait don't put your full attention on it and let it see it'self out. 

Overall time is a healer and depersonlization taught me a lot about life and i hope whatever stage you are at now it gets better. Stay cool and collective, peace my dudes :) ",1.6560434600041989,3.870121750577365,3.1274002729372263,90.16841722653791,80.91685912240185,6.522968717195046,23.004881377283226,7.686295010490155,0.9272591224018476,1670,57,371,28,44,546,210,433,0.111,0.7040000000000001,0.185,0.9847,5,1,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,8,4,6,29,24,3,0,15,1,32,5,1,3,2,81,72,29,2,6,20,1,5,4,1,1,3,4,1,2,26,20,0,4,21,1,2,4,18,8,0,2,26,12,46,15,50,40,13,46,1,1,2,1,26,22,3,13,22,231,72,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08878228514768523,0.0,0.06855196481401626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591503475824367,0.07157440672920005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274428014978374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09614466970978472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11056737805660978,0.17675152568678415,0.07383235403154803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07501602285210324,0.0,0.10046571027997403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0566186653575591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04334368991582743,0.06123991432516581,0.2469200938165466,0.0,0.0,0.0729152089465477,0.0,0.0,0.06622871313315344,0.0,0.22393140188917493,0.0,0.048717867932644016,0.0718996644200187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07679020037359909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09057014794565588,0.0,0.08514142758410112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09259462176925892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09422129321903423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17531339309625893,0.060548082963626564,0.16751803148823305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07287789842875553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0865549253033873,0.0,0.1368451894736946,0.09110906922444932,0.0630156366079651,0.0,0.06611419938170576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05808754093187678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484926665668122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820245114625238,0.0,0.08617442785016947,0.0,0.0,0.0857453381620634,0.0975705628919335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07320623963771869,0.0,0.20450906036087785,0.0,0.0,0.13661889504436756,0.0,0.08942688788053049,0.0,0.08799254539729133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08478138889700604,0.0,0.0,0.09136839611489647,0.06845781216178894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09376610847714834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12890476285821975,0.1378004189275755,0.0,0.07892142987037032,0.0,0.0,0.05694998114794219,0.2197091453819367,0.0,0.476376630292619,0.14995580851268414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09524045225922348,0.11639941294620368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07735089860537568,0.0,0.0,0.1652661689449886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08735818465089966,0.0,0.09372370378622492,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,iownacello,2018/01/16,"Visual migraines? A few months ago, I (starving, dehydrated, anxious, overworked uni student) was sitting in my school before a class when suddenly this weird curvy shape appeared in my vision, specifically in my left eye. Kinda like if you stare at a light too long and you’re left with a retinal image for a bit, except this was kinda flashing and obscured my vision. This weird episode lasted for about 30 mins, and occurred again three weeks after that, and again a week after that. Thanks to the internet (and my mom, who says she has a history of these in her past), I self diagnosed myself with visual migraines (which can present themselves with no pain, as my episodes did). At the time I took this as a call from higher powers (aka my brain?) that I needed to get more sleep, drink more water, eat better, etc. and I hadn’t had an episode for two months.
Well I just had another one of these episodes, and although today happened to be a very bad eating day and I was super dehydrated, I’m starting to worry about these. What if I have a brain tumor? What if I’m going blind? What if I’m about to die? These are the questions pounding through my head right now. Any advice? Anyone have similar symptoms ever?",4.179370709382155,6.169193326086955,4.3684439359267735,85.30381006864991,72.26086956521739,6.407322654462242,26.887871853546912,7.0608816371341465,1.3354347826086963,955,34,175,9,19,297,144,230,0.119,0.804,0.077,-0.8699,1,0,1,0,0,0,39.0,0,1,0,3,11,9,0,0,14,0,13,15,5,0,1,24,24,16,1,5,6,1,0,1,0,0,6,1,0,1,16,11,4,0,1,1,0,3,2,4,1,3,8,5,20,5,29,15,5,36,0,0,3,0,9,10,0,9,23,121,36,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1297546120104618,0.11770466318517922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09029741169189727,0.1392351981719512,0.0,0.15000768984205198,0.0,0.09284539113271682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11086877233107054,0.0,0.0,0.11298907657448153,0.0,0.0,0.1174363171136011,0.1449653171623839,0.0,0.0,0.2964608575211128,0.13558691723497562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08563444690070071,0.0,0.0,0.13477257437234189,0.13780842876624996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300773916626071,0.0,0.2717415756662033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480888307307166,0.0,0.12011038196941802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0693739585093893,0.0,0.07546398852756285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11742011241196915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1362742972867912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10823636879508053,0.0,0.0,0.28853957290626064,0.0,0.0,0.06487136723566103,0.0,0.0,0.11750932101055347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15551456531433494,0.2119732296736122,0.0,0.0,0.09845736818849367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08997761413816421,0.0,0.14129112853209325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12675698550408054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14874803800122596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11339648187816333,0.0,0.10559486036480688,0.0,0.13438410757871888,0.0,0.0,0.13852226970199738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13287950995612036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398492628426916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1380130181489142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12224931285069182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07742719385071177,0.0,0.12586334124532572,0.0,0.14752748224915752,0.0,0.0,0.12971029785331786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095603887793664,0.0,0.0,0.21302201348611574,0.0,0.1193884167513997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13484820672315895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,rodensht,2018/01/16,"Chest Hey guys i hope everyone is well! This weekend i had slight chest pain and difficulty breathing aswell as a stuffy blocked nose. It was after hours so my local GP (doctors surgery) was closed, meaning the next best thing was the ER..i heard about this deadly flu going around and got my ass straight to the ER as soon as i started feeling this. They did heart monitoring and blood sample as well as a chest x ray and said everything was clear and that it must just be an infection. I was prescribed amoxicillin (500mg) 4 a day, spread out evenly. I feel better in the sense that my chest isnt as breathless and my nose isnt as stuffy and im generally perkier but the chest pain is still there and im worried about it. What if its fluid in my lung or pneumonia? Its just bizarre that my flu-like symptoms have essentially gone in the past 40 hours after 2 days on antibiotics yet i still feel this uncomfortable, worrying chest! Any advice?

healthanxiety,scotte16,2018/01/16,"Arm aches/ symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body. I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break, right after Christmas, and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school, I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester, and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that I’ve been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted (albeit less severe) I’m still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg, as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead, and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.

I just feel so stupid about this. It’s following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now I’m stressing again, but for some reason my mind doesn’t want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that it’s a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?",6.787297297297298,6.278202459459457,6.9331081081081125,78.30614864864866,64.94594594594594,9.967567567567567,33.364864864864856,9.354420925462401,2.8363081081081067,1192,44,231,19,16,384,152,296,0.145,0.813,0.042,-0.9742,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,0,1,19,15,1,5,15,0,15,19,9,4,1,44,36,27,1,2,3,0,7,1,0,1,10,0,3,1,16,20,0,3,8,1,0,11,2,12,2,2,10,7,28,3,45,25,5,70,0,0,0,0,2,35,0,3,23,162,44,3,0.08420970489438599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1145309740040142,0.0,0.12884038750421425,0.0951329971911252,0.0,0.05888138363531808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07911778976225008,0.1942561953267308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07165625652728831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870759968372102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631346867782188,0.0,0.0,0.08908270196986191,0.14507840865932786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05430829316180928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938541530261567,0.0,0.17031582805251075,0.0,0.1617090450875993,0.09224761557394316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04785831590489039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833808472763857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534076001461736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07484945491235126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06864214880851692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05947980494374412,0.041140608214903306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08502779645490299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05706267540072817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08064961957638392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0539468932680735,0.08658160173797379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.431487767194771,0.0,0.0,0.08430860510107542,0.1704494341893966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1902659943822504,0.0,0.0,0.09465523654961548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17881218764765658,0.0,0.06724997910676697,0.07040308395268674,0.3858477297665013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2625783801161916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08273560750270936,0.0,0.09820671224084908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0496690657449301,0.0,0.06754794581517991,0.0,0.15142927575809972,0.23418972029408244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08551904295659851,0.0,0.05982015826250538,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,504Cory,2018/01/16,"Horrid smelling dollar bill (smells like a dead animal[rabies anxiety]) A little background of myself. I have a severe phobia of rabies ever since I was bitten by a dog two years ago. Now every little thing triggers my fear. Anyways, today in the grocery store I received some money that smelled absolutely disgusting. The type of smell you smell from a rancid, dead animal. Now I've convinced myself that someone came into contact with a dead, rabid animal, didn't wash their hands, and smeared whatever gunk they picked up from the hypothetical animal onto the dollar bill that I touched. This is my most far-fetched scenario yet but I've persuaded myself that this is what happened. I'm sick of living this way. This shit is debilitating and ruins every waking moment of my life. How the fuck do I stop thinking like this?",5.2586886938564765,7.781119308724833,5.748456375838928,74.26328342798142,70.6778523489933,7.537635518843572,27.568921011874032,8.384062270229773,2.3204967475477543,663,24,102,11,13,213,102,149,0.251,0.7070000000000001,0.042,-0.9866,0,0,0,1,0,0,20.0,0,1,2,0,6,9,3,1,11,0,7,7,3,3,1,14,12,4,3,0,1,0,2,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,11,5,0,1,1,0,6,2,1,6,0,1,3,8,14,3,13,9,2,18,0,1,0,1,5,6,2,2,11,68,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821940564495302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15723343645743654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2350768722556703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18591784828679772,0.3463435964181795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2312836111935725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1900134620506876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18175360270509847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14517519408759946,0.20082768556922287,0.4119994088423725,0.1814908520317874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321956392496416,0.2109783535836747,0.17002037752853474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17414883285609928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17183616164954896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13654808148763953,0.13169829770995614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19482280547967945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20077747720150174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16314382979106531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13235756896271414

For about the past 6 months I’ve had my health anxiety under control, or at least I accepted the anxiety as it was. I just got back from a vacation and for some reason my lymph nodes under my jaw are swollen. I’m rather thin and they’re not terribly noticeable but if I feel around it’s maybe a little smaller than the size of my thumb. I’ve just been freaking out a bit even though I know that I got tons of mosquito bites (which can make lymph nodes noticeable) on my trip and I was on a plane with a bunch of sick people. I just wanted to post so that I didn’t keep this in my head. I guess I’ll just roll with it and if they don’t go down in a few weeks I’ll get them checked out.

healthanxiety,FellowLiverWorrier,2018/01/17,"My Health Anxiety Story and How I am Recovering Hello /r/HealthAnxiety!

Allow me to tell you my health anxiety story and how I am beginning to recover from this psychological illness!

The first precursor to my health anxiety was probably almost a year ago to the date when I felt a bump on my shoulder, which I thought was a tumor. Of course, it ended up being a deeply embedded pimple or cyst and resolved on its own after I went to the doctor who said the same thing. When I went into full-blown panic mode was back in April when I woke up with two puncture marks on my ankle after staying the night at a sister's house. Knowing that they once had an issue with a bat in the attic, I assumed that a magical bat had made its way all the way downstairs, embedded itself in the bowels of my sister's house, and bit me on the ankle. Of course, this magical bat must have had rabies too. Spoiler warning, but I did not die of rabies and am not writing this as a ghost.

My health anxiety probably climbed into a hysteria that consumed me last June. I was going to a university field station when I fell ill. Really ill. Not being able to keep down food or water for three days ill. Thus, I flew home as I had missed much of the class and assumed that I was going to die and wanted to so around family. Yet, again, I did not die, but the ordeal had traumatized me enough to sink into full-time paranoia that I would not escape until October.

Except for the occasional stomach ache things were fine for a month from a physical perspective, but from a mental perspective (if thinking I had terminal skin cancer from a 2mm mole was any indication) I was in rough shape. 

In mid-July, I developed the first sign of a rare birth defect that I did indeed end up having. Now, before you go into a google symptom, allow me to explain what happened: my belly button burst open. It was not painful as I didn't know this had occurred for an hour. It wasn't until I looked down and saw that my outie had turned into a popped inside outie. I walked to the hospital and was diagnosed with cellulitis and told to go to a follow-up with the university doctors. Ultrasound showed nothing. It was only after a CT scan two months later that they saw a 1""x2""x3"" sinus and cyst located behind and below my belly button. The operation was a success and it was removed two months ago. I even got an innie out of the ordeal. In between July and October I had been tested for just about anything and the only thing that came up were elevated liver enzymes and a weird-ass belly button.

In the meantime, I had begun CBT and doubled my dosage of Celexa (which is now down), which helped a lot. Besides teaching me mindful thinking, my therapist became a good outlet to just talk about life and my general grievances that I had been experiencing as a graduating senior from a top state university.

To err on the side of caution, my PCP sent me to a liver specialist to get my liver checked out. They tested me for any liver ailment you can think of, and the only weird thing was my beta globulins- ever so slightly out of range (think 0.1 out of range when usually 1 or 2 out of range indicates an actual problem). Wanting to be as thorough as possible, the pathologist recommended a Bence-Jones Test for leukemias myelomas, and pre-leukemia. The test came back negative. Specialist ruled that it was just an off result due to my immune system still recovering from surgery about two and a half weeks before and I had had no other symptoms consistently. This final test was taken after Christmas break and ordered before it so despite being told I did not have a deadly illness, I stewed over it.

And then, something happened. Something clicked in my head. I was sick of being prodded at and tested. I looked at my medical information logs for every time I visited the doctor and whenever I was with anyone but my PCP, my blood pressure jumped thirty points and pulse went up to 90bpm over 70. Living in America, I realized that doctors will NEVER stop running medical tests unless they are sure they have ruled out a condition. They don't want to get sued and if you have the insurance or money WILL run a test if you are insistent enough. This all hit me in about 24 hours. I decided that should that final test come back negative that I would only go to the doctor if anything were seriously and obviously wrong or for my psychiatric check-ups. I only google things five minutes a day and I do not talk to my doctors over the patient portal- only at appointments.

My status has improved tremendously these past two and a half weeks. I wanted to tell you guys that there is hope, and what you likely suffer from is a psychological issue. It really is. In seven months the only weird things they could find was:
-Elevated liver enzymes, likely prescription or slight fatty liver after a huge barrage of tests
-Maybe some gallbladder sludge/stone
-Weird-ass belly button thing where if you had it would be very obvious or already addressed in your childhood (having it through adulthood so unlikely that they like to write case studies on it)

And guess what? These were and are all very treatable. I came back here to post to tell you guys that it can get better. I felt a twinge in my upper right abdomen and got a little panicked tonight but this was the first time I felt even remotely worried about something in the last two weeks. I don't know if it'll take therapy, different meds, getting sick of tests, or all three, but you can get there.

healthanxiety,SatanOverFlowers,2018/01/17,"Possible Ear Infection? So my left ear is a bit red and itchy, it also feels like it’s burning and it’s tender to touch in certain places, especially just before the inside of the ear and behind the ear like the rounded bit on the outside.

I think it might be my earphones that have caused the problem so I’ve stopped using them for a couple days.

I’m not sure if this is something I should go to the doctor about or not. I know ear infections and stuff don’t really need treated but I wasn’t sure if I should just wait it out or go see a doctor about it.

healthanxiety,DopeLemonDrop,2018/01/17,"Random itchiness? Just looking for possibilities I guess, here's what happened:

I'm preparing to move by putting stuff into boxes, today I focused on decorations such as figurines around the house, military memorabilia, books, and small miscellaneous items. The only thing out of the ordinary was an old roommate's uniform that moved out like 6 months ago that was sitting under where I put my motorcycle helmet, I picked it up and unfurled it, saw it was his put it in my roommates pile of stuff. About 45 minutes later (give or take) my arms became itchy, incredibly itchy.

When I looked at it it looked like a rash all on one side of my forearm (basically exactly where the uniform touched) and then a couple of welt like spots a bit away. I washed my arms but a little bit after I was itchy on the middle of my back, shoulder, upper thighs, calves, ankles, chest, and stomach. I hopped immediately in the shower and changed clothes.

There is a chance it was old fuel on the uniform, I have a stuffed nose and can't smell a thing. My friend hasn't had a rash of any sort. Any thoughts?

FYI: I'm going to medical in the morning I just want thoughts now is all",4.998240950226244,6.427915619909504,5.494612556561087,80.27051611990952,69.27149321266968,8.058936651583709,30.554581447963802,8.472884824447931,2.271916063348417,916,37,173,14,16,294,139,221,0.052000000000000005,0.8590000000000001,0.08900000000000001,0.7789,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,0,12,4,0,0,17,0,11,12,10,1,3,24,25,11,0,1,4,0,1,3,1,0,2,0,1,0,14,10,0,0,2,1,0,6,2,0,0,1,9,7,18,4,28,16,5,40,0,0,4,0,3,22,0,4,14,111,32,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11444072348103698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1755869452041717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11492773951885472,0.0,0.0,0.12129514427400645,0.09927111339974017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28189088395964457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13657230845581975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14284839572861402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09974352764697407,0.0,0.0,0.12384595866021142,0.07337137892550709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14221989862748194,0.0,0.11416406327512812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14896584080764316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892174702026896,0.1293936567978594,0.0,0.0,0.3252383294212563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130056216892835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030476155574892,0.2744290062471349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2709406928472547,0.0,0.08748254300570188,0.09818753683113424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14554258570481185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3893481099106307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29558074640368764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09706828933944048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17153864994187473,0.0,0.0,0.2049844000373755,0.0,0.0,0.12237316213372748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07614743174184281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,NongranularNip,2018/01/18,"Struggling with hantavirus fear... I can't rationalize out of it Hi all.. Never posted here, but I've been struggling with health anxiety for about a year.

I'm just really scared  and anxious right now. I woke up yesterday with a cough which progressed to lung pain. I've never had lung pain, so I think that is where a lot of this fear is coming from. Last night I got a fever, and today I'm pretty sick. Fever, mild sore throat, productive cough, and pretty bad body aches.

See, I'm freaking out about hantavirus because two weeks ago, I dismantled a crappy structure in my sunroom where my dogs hang out. It was really, really dusty. So much dust. I didn't wear a mask or anything. I didn't see any mice or droppings or anything, but there was so much dust. To make matters worse, I live in New Mexico, where hantavirus is most common. I also live in a county where there was a case in 2016.

This just doesn't feel like my normal kind of sick. It started in my lungs, where usually when I get sick my first symptoms is a sore throat and stuffy nose. Now my nose is barely stuffy, but I have a really bad cough. It's been a long time since I've had a fever, and I can't recall getting muscle aches before this.

All the factors combined are freaking me out really bad. I live in the state it is most common, I cleaned out an enclosed space where there was lots of dust, and now two weeks later (within the incubation period) I came down with a sickness that I feel is unusual for me.

Someone please talk to me. I don't know what to do or how to get rid of this crazy fear I feel. I can't stop googling about hantavirus.

healthanxiety,antisocial199,2018/01/18,Hair fall So I've posted here before regarding my hair loss issue. I mentioned in my previous post that I have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result I have bald patches. Some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so I visited another dermatologist today. She was able to diagnose my problem. She said I have a very severe hair loss at a very early age (I'm only 17). The problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia. She said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald it's probably due to an harmonal imbalance. So I'm wondering is there anyone who suffered from a similar problem and how did they manage to recover their hair?,4.118047619047618,6.274519757142862,5.985714285714287,72.92761904761906,72.85714285714286,9.523809523809524,32.38095238095238,9.928628108626363,3.8463095238095244,586,29,97,17,12,202,93,140,0.13699999999999998,0.85,0.013,-0.9312,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,2,2,6,8,0,0,9,0,9,10,8,3,0,16,15,9,0,5,1,0,5,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,7,0,1,5,9,17,1,13,10,3,11,0,3,1,0,12,3,0,4,4,66,21,2,0.1483565432338826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15556477102602326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10373434449057498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09043677175972467,0.0,0.12624049131631082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15240303659184315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15057876850168914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1518492084048777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1398573455666793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15484568689617326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1261274277772558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14535791329254638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11283183633124147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10285174724751624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28416911776347176,0.0,0.15995344579754206,0.5678287035440698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2822420918439605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11822095717100115,0.0,0.0,0.1676006658431469,0.0,0.12272206563728405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14062465611043798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3672290559662017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16088634267071025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,apos10,2018/01/18,"Always think I have cancer So I remember it started in high school where I started having a bump grow on a specific spot on my head and I never had any real fear before this time. I remember sitting in my class googling bump in that location and it said swollen lymph node which could be a sign of cancer. At first I was like ok no it’s probably just a pimple but then two weeks after that I got another one on my head where another lymph node was supposed to be located. I was terrified and I thought this was it. I went to the doctors made them send me to specialists the whole 9 yards and they kept telling me that’s not a lymph node but I was convinced they had no idea what they were talking about because I read so many articles on google. Turns out they were just cysts. 

Since then that has sparked my fear of always thinking I had cancer. That was 3 years ago and since then I have been convinced I had bone cancer, brain cancer and now stomach cancer. 

I have been a heavy weed smoker for a while and I started to get a tightness and cramping pains in my stomach I associated with the weed. So I quit and 2 days after quitting I got really bad runs, I was nauseas, and I threw up a couple times. I lost 15 pounds during this period which was a feeder into yep it’s cancer. The strange thing is when I stared getting better my symptoms only appeared in the morning. 

After this period I thought maybe it was just a sickness and not the weed so I smoked all day everyday again for another week but then started waking up nauseas so I quit again and again a couple days after quitting I got the runs. It’s been brutal and I have since gotten a lot better. Although my stomach still hasn’t gone back to normal I’m now terrified every morning because that’s usually when I go the bathroom and I freak out I have stomach cancer. I wouldn’t leave my doctor alone at the time and made her run so many tests and everything always came back fine. 

I just want to know how some people got over this irrational fear. I’m only 19 and on the cancer statistics website shows less than 1% of people who get this cancer are under 20 and most of them have a family history of it so my chances are very unlikely which I can understand but a part of me is still terrified. Thanks in advance!

healthanxiety,mitzikitty,2018/01/18,"How do you know when it's real or just anxiety? I have a problem where I want to get checked by doctors a lot, even when they say I'm fine, I try to insist they run more tests. I've heard of people who will often have stories like ""My cancer wasn't discovered at first by the doctors, but I had a gut feeling and insisted more tests, and then my cancer was found!"" So, I'm not sure when to give up and accept it's my healthy anxiety or if I should trust my gut and ask for more tests and exams. My doctors said I am too young for breast cancer (22) but it's still possible, right? I don't know when to give up or if I should look into it more. What do you guys do? How can you tell if it's real or not?",0.4843594470046071,1.9735041870967758,2.5833410138248847,96.26072580645165,81.3225806451613,5.71889400921659,19.45852534562212,6.5431188927421005,-0.1177281105990784,539,13,133,5,14,182,86,155,0.149,0.7440000000000001,0.107,-0.8686,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,3,2,1,13,6,0,0,4,0,14,9,3,2,1,34,28,22,0,7,12,0,1,1,0,3,6,3,0,1,7,6,0,0,5,0,1,1,4,1,0,1,6,5,18,5,13,19,5,15,0,0,1,1,14,6,0,9,9,92,25,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2539955531573107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15519765026931032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5097571402890179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10964854092405148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394002803707012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14120866717134456,0.0,0.18202222902975976,0.0,0.0,0.08673376996495122,0.3185052950345117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16437675201805887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1824703436614127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08110447153405817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13940722704977782,0.0,0.0,0.14113641107326816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11509095789034222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871521876914093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15884987653940008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3779131772420195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417722814926906,0.15791424830694747,0.13201841908909878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13257640693204342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15646317611369676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14510072096924545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.112710408425968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09791744710700837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,NameLessTaken,2018/01/18,"Need Support ASAP for rabies fear!! So on January 4th (almost 2 weeks ago) I pet, and gently moved, a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. He let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back, but darted off a little peturbed once I moved him. He may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved- but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever, I feel I would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers.

I went about my night (my birthday night) without much else of a thought for the cat. The next morning I did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cut/scraped area on my elbow that I'm still not sure how it came to be. But again, I patched it up and went about my days. Its since healed fine. I wasn't intoxicated, but I had been out dancing late and thought maybe I bumped it at some point.

Fast forward to today, January 17th, and the talk of rabies comes up. Suddenly I remember the cat and mysterious scratch. Surely I would've known if the cat did It? He was friendly, docile, and clean. I figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. But now I'm freaked out! Should I talk to my Dr about getting a rabies shot now?! Its been 2 weeks on Saturday.

**I fully intend to call my Dr in the morning and have spoken to the nurse hotline. I just know they also kind of have to give me the ""just in case"" response and would like some more candid input**

healthanxiety,teddyinBK,2018/01/18,"I'd been told it was just anxiety for two years, and now I've been diagnosed with a tumor I developed Panic Disorder when I was in college, shortly after the Virginia Tech Massacre. I was a freshman at Virginia Tech when it happened, and my sophomore year, I started to have deep-seeded health anxiety (fear of death, mostly.) I'd suffered through many family deaths before, and psychologists had told me I had PTSD with fear of dying. I DO have health anxiety, and I border on hypochondria. 

HOWEVER!

When you already have a PD diagnosis, or a hypochondria diagnosis, I find that doctors don't take you seriously. I completely understand why they wouldn't: it's tiresome for them when you come in and tell them you're having a heart attack when you're really suffering from GERD. When I first saw a doctor and told her that it felt like I'd broken my rib three times in one year, she sent me to a psychiatrist. The next doctor told me I needed to up my Prozac. Finally, a CT scan showed I have a severe Fibrous Dysplasia tumor in my 10th rib which is growing into my liver, kidney, and diaphragm. I'm scheduled for surgery on March 5th. 

It's hard to know when it's your health anxiety and when it's your health, and GOOD LORD it's tiring for us anxious people to convince doctors that we're having a real problem. I honestly still don't know how to tell the difference, but I'm here to say, SOMETIMES, your gut is right.

Anyone else have trouble with doctors writing them off because of their Anxiety or Hypochondria?",7.248286082474227,7.021268955326465,7.520307130584192,73.53963595360827,63.91408934707904,10.43651202749141,36.05691580756014,9.978442167317967,3.5970152920962204,1210,52,215,23,16,395,159,291,0.14,0.8220000000000001,0.037000000000000005,-0.9639,2,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,1,6,5,1,13,13,1,3,13,0,20,18,6,1,0,30,37,21,3,3,4,0,2,1,0,1,12,1,0,0,12,14,0,0,5,1,0,3,3,9,0,4,14,5,35,4,30,22,1,36,1,2,2,0,23,12,0,3,22,140,47,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09722112016472713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3369833026550848,0.0995285165030839,0.0,0.061601935562888725,0.09026939916483516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1002270658632638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05370526235854711,0.0,0.07496705791784668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07589080138767085,0.09237172434532397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942017843688194,0.09143443573571232,0.09204629744932903,0.10097083439308546,0.4508731027014316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07359668387719935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08305333428291939,0.19827516819834376,0.0,0.0,0.08459032006720225,0.09650981888624703,0.08052228383147528,0.0749382616119281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07389454052126537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0779070033562539,0.0,0.07892076574926424,0.0,0.0,0.3745869535003181,0.0,0.10439954638646808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09683548909306773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04304146641609119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08932010448911147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06532542301609151,0.0,0.0,0.09369590788255877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059699195841811575,0.0,0.0,0.10336698384221478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061077811187669626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08430030424894275,0.1029847992250173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10027768518058927,0.0564394522978663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523736703022375,0.0,0.07006107362579565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995285165030839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08713367201133512,0.0,0.06235800509010125,0.0,0.07035719311894349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06624063060132114,0.0,0.15400748418478485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05137212464955742,0.10125859344847236,0.0,0.3367353086488364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606141147901884,0.09171575362188113,0.10597408411856092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07949702070876137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1702015489530848
healthanxiety,yogurtcrotch,2018/01/18,"Flu Fear! Oh boy. It's DEFINITELY that time of the year. The time of year to search all over the internet for articles on flu statistics and reading through the sad cases of people who were killed by it, and subsequently, sending yourself into a spiral of anxiety when you remember the fact that you did not get your flu shot this year.

I've never gotten the flu. I haven't gotten the shot in a few years too, I believe. My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago, but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy, do I regret it now.
I go back to college in about 2 weeks, and I am stressed. I suppose it's not too late to go get it, but that doesn't quell my anxiety over the fact it's only 10% effective anyway. Jeez.

TLDR; I'm afraid I'm going to be one of those rare cases of someone dying of the flu. I need to stop reading. 
I'm hoping for some solidarity here. Does anyone else have this fear, especially considering this season is supposedly very bad?

healthanxiety,GMLittleVietnam,2018/01/19,"Hip still swollen 4 months after fall, anxiety about it hangs over me. About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didn't think it would be a good idea to get up immediately, but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night, but that was about it. The swelling started that night, too. Maybe a week and a half later, I went to the doctor about it. He didn't do any x-rays, but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didn't have any pain, and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall, and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am, 17 weeks later, and my hip is still swollen. There was a moment where it hurt for a bit about 2 months ago, but that was only for a week or two. 

The anxiety about it hangs over me. It's always there as something that actually shouldn't be happening, something that to me is not easily explainable.",4.141923076923078,4.286358192307691,4.605769230769232,90.53923076923077,70.44230769230771,7.938461538461539,24.17307692307693,7.61054688173877,0.7589499999999996,776,17,181,8,13,246,103,208,0.068,0.851,0.081,0.3816,0,0,2,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,0,15,7,0,0,12,0,19,9,3,0,0,26,33,17,0,4,7,0,2,2,0,2,6,4,0,0,16,9,0,0,6,0,0,8,5,2,0,3,15,7,15,5,25,14,1,37,0,1,1,0,7,9,0,2,21,114,31,2,0.0,0.0,0.117676296013775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137876144505549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10033870816357557,0.0,0.0,0.16400767577321515,0.0,0.1844986710716872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734870646812199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07350920250824729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1316506436344676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12342672116832736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10837653744804007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315663938682096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06300214746539283,0.0,0.0,0.10114332385468923,0.09644507810062757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10663539167338497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290917319959058,0.13612894613537854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178262141206665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10126337964878916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1211466513622992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28875609007099595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2263269594799582,0.23630087798327598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1834249088033988,0.12831391932357347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2294132207729767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18566875683431175,0.0,0.0,0.08535266420589507,0.12853054813089626,0.1926031427744875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09066701688631776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15453558388942226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2355935134371417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38691303178874376,0.0,0.0,0.11178609701996604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566211198619103,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,sfynkter,2018/01/19,"Health anxiety due to unexplainable scars on face skin In late 2016 I went throught a very bad episode of depression and health anxiety which lasted a couple of months. Managed to tell myself that everything is alright and ignored all kind of twitches/pains that were temporary that use to bring anxious people like me a lot of bad thoughts.



Since around summer 2017 I started noticing small scars and little holes appearing on my face skin for no apparent reason. I have no acnee or other skin condition, I always had clear and clean skin. 



I went to a specialist and he couldnt put a diagnose, tested me for some anti-immune stuff which came out fine.



I'm trying to ignore it but every few days a new hole appears and its destroying my face a bit at a time. I think I will soon succumb to the thoughts and lose it again in front of health anxiety.



How do you people put up with apparently minor issues that bug you for long periods without knowing why it happens? Do you just go on about your life?",6.9795668729176565,7.122864691099478,6.873964778676823,76.7061970490243,64.39267015706807,10.086815801999046,33.59400285578296,9.800150414767053,3.1704513089005237,800,31,145,15,11,254,130,191,0.151,0.8059999999999999,0.043,-0.9552,2,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,4,0,1,6,11,1,0,9,1,8,13,7,3,2,31,23,10,0,1,4,0,4,1,0,1,6,0,1,0,12,11,0,2,5,0,0,10,4,7,0,0,7,4,16,4,26,14,5,34,0,2,0,0,6,11,0,5,14,90,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10478824431621757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2890204414744851,0.14227102427319546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210910212311273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21030140276223785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748871260198106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14403641475280188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139344995837447,0.0,0.08121783947515926,0.0,0.10846787512203147,0.127821661809989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10610590787172308,0.0,0.11318251243315824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07157192377845216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11136415526906887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4015899520029629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13144371693381246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13114221829541484,0.06921073830553738,0.10265406439030854,0.14206048511437272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0889518150670205,0.061525618268889776,0.12622023842776764,0.0,0.11144876292290268,0.0,0.14088936921030298,0.0,0.10706567452188556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005203417768652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12162908153234467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14337815492945205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13400402071481993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17461533766084708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25319948690165617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12948244590389654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10417496786963182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08913764182878131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14416576982600654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11007298857924996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806942446067519,0.0,0.1999570959425769,0.07343387653885451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08550179087024483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10876765050546024,0.0,0.10390979787651096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2334865389454339,0.11363700535567077,0.0,0.0,0.12139711925859695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,bbipain,2018/01/19,"Chest Pain Hello, I have been experiencing this random chest pain on the left and it has been very concerning for me. It started back in June 2017~ random pain that comes and goes and only last for like a few seconds or so. It happens sometimes near center of my chest to the left or upper left near shoulder. It also disappeared and stopped after a few months then came back again in October and disappeared again and came back again. I've been to the doctor and he said my heart beat was fine, blood pressure was fine, blood test turned out normal mostly just need a bit of exercise to lower fat. Doctor said it probably is muscle spasms but does it happen this often? It's getting really annoying and causes me to freak out sometimes.",5.419285714285714,6.86519092857143,5.462857142857144,80.83214285714288,68.28571428571428,8.171428571428573,26.142857142857146,8.548686976883017,1.8088,590,17,106,9,10,185,88,140,0.14800000000000002,0.821,0.031,-0.9359,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,0,1,10,9,1,1,6,0,8,14,8,1,0,25,19,14,0,2,4,0,0,1,0,0,7,2,0,0,10,13,1,1,0,1,0,5,0,6,0,1,9,3,5,3,16,10,4,30,0,0,0,0,4,12,0,6,14,71,15,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10276577114677438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2964383032116548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14029468135297662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2939520274579741,0.0,0.1320105074356766,0.0,0.11069607644503322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26306157020898346,0.11245599535586508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06713879977489466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2272739104459737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.152279590626391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047491025311904,0.0,0.0,0.4188646798178273,0.0,0.0,0.06278127743523869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10257183336862817,0.0,0.0,0.09528517142748456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12590806799296506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09773419416095548,0.4102166140858705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13855062220557265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232388921769111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2444762427130157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541903746313629,0.0,0.09095682707515908,0.0,0.0,0.10743631992122253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13977704085743853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060304639315334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,DrenalineDC,2018/01/19,"Just looking for some advice. First, a little backstory (sorry if a bit long). 

Up until last year I was an extremely sedentary 28yo weighing around 265 lbs. I started a new job that is fairly physical and since then I have dropped down to 230ish. Well last week I was laying down and felt something I never felt before in my chest. I went to the doctor and he said it was almost certainly my xiphoid process. I also mentioned I had a general cough (I us an e-cigarette), as well as a periodical tingle under my right shoulder-blade. Other than those three things I felt completely normal.

My doctor said everything felt normal, my blood pressure was normal, as was my pulse and he checked me out with a stethoscope. In the end he ordered an x-ray to be certain. From that appointment up until I got my results I started stressing out (tight chest, sweating, vomiting, trouble sleeping, just overall freaking out about what that x-ray might show). Low and behold I got my result and everything came back looking completely normal. Although that is great news I haven't been able to ditch the tight chest, trouble sleeping with bad thoughts, and general feeling of just being uncomfortable. I also wear a fitbit to work and constantly find myself checking my heart rate (between 59 when I sleep and 120ish when i'm up working).  

Sorry for the wall of text, I am just hoping someone here could give me some tips on managing this stress. I have a yearly physical next month that can't get here soon enough.

Thank you.",5.11935064935065,7.073842571428571,5.219350649350652,80.31110389610393,69.71428571428572,7.662337662337662,30.941558441558442,8.296473431620573,2.4652142857142865,1200,51,205,18,22,376,171,280,0.093,0.836,0.07,-0.7463,1,0,2,0,0,0,40.0,1,1,0,3,16,15,0,3,15,0,18,16,10,2,3,48,39,21,0,7,5,0,7,0,0,1,5,2,0,0,11,16,1,2,7,1,2,2,3,8,2,2,18,11,32,7,33,17,4,44,0,1,2,0,9,17,0,6,23,141,43,6,0.09215334027435612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005117757342057,0.0,0.0,0.09227825876234456,0.0,0.0,0.14738998584663554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0820360104868816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07086023038475794,0.07694418988149257,0.0,0.0,0.07841570515925153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10060758007372043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10539887134389624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19324204797398656,0.09958502276267238,0.0,0.07357694362352837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1886456972843569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08162050692255737,0.09521903464403073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16564296031381645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04659549774077792,0.0,0.3539266329477949,0.0,0.08422648351223835,0.07838558416081162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048146316804495784,0.08840188109451344,0.0,0.0,0.14740688917049438,0.1015993829823478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10920215192614606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152906003955424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09144797072862564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15023454373216685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09236185650605,0.0,0.08155280624630316,0.15477119283728002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09776013115948468,0.0,0.0,0.07355591701284138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07107433709280686,0.08900227028078321,0.09800612283862932,0.0,0.3611628298483864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07869844907700334,0.17531785900699215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07623019536128978,0.0,0.2766596769438049,0.0,0.07808122616556958,0.07094414354805935,0.0,0.2063162394641001,0.13045321711365726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21112267986127745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484241453289297,0.0,0.0,0.061222584488527576,0.0,0.0,0.07315945854984153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11084912180853378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07391985096429225,0.0,0.1657138401558012,0.08542706967913714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341774585214336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11868745954148613

healthanxiety,blindshrew,2018/01/19,"just wanted to vent been having a stuffy nose and slight cough these past couple of days, and just a couple hours ago I've been feeling weird with a headache and fatigue. I'm scared I'm going to get sick and throw up later, and I was searching my symptoms up and diabetes is a possible condition, which is something I've thought I had before.

Along with that, I got these horizontal bumps that keep growing with my nail. I buff them out but they come back. I didn’t think anything of it until recently when I noticed it wasn’t going away. 
I’m scared I have subungual melanoma. 
Btw, I’m a 20 year old female. Also, I don’t remember injuring my nail at all.. 
I don’t have health insurance and I’m a broke college student working a part time job so I don’t exactly have the funds to see a doctor. 
I just need some reassurance or would like to hear from others who have had similar issues.

healthanxiety,forma_cristata,2018/01/20,"I am avoidant I have been having muscle spasms and back pain for a little under a year. I have massive anxiety about doctors and phone calls and the health care in my region is not very good. I have been putting off going to the doc for a while and I have developed a rib hump on one side and rib torsion on the other. I have scoliosis; I know I do. But going to the doctor and having them tell me I need surgery, or won't get better scares me too much to handle. 

I don't really know why I am posting this. I guess it is nice to get off my chest. Some days it makes me very sad. The fact that I am a hypochondriac makes it scarier that something really is wrong with me. I'm always in pain by the end of the day. I wish I was healthy more than anything. I wish I could carry things and wear push up bras and sleep in car seats comfortably. But I can't.

healthanxiety,livstudent17,2018/01/20,"Health anxiety vent :( My massive fear is getting pregnant. Every twinge I have, no matter what, is pregnancy. This all started from an increase in anxiety levels after (ironically) staring the birth control pill.

It’s been going on for months. No amount of doctors visits, home tests, visits to a sexual health nurse, not even having penetrative sex, or even a blood test has managed to completely calm me down. If it does it only lasts for a few hours. All I think is of women I read about on the internet who have been 8 months pregnant without any tests and still getting periods, or if I’m ectopic (my Mum nearly died from one of those).

I’ve had nexplanon put in my arm, but the stories online of women getting pregnant somehow overrule the data that says it’s 99.9% effective/my nurse saying she wouldn’t even do a test on me if I came in with nexplanon claiming to be pregnant. 

I’ve just started CBT and I’m on anti-depressants (citalopram, which I don’t think is working after 5 weeks on 10mg). I’m just terrified that I’ll never get better, and I’ll have to leave my university and my boyfriend and friends in London and move home to my parents again (who I adore, but I never wanted to stay at home for uni. That would be a massive defeat for me).

Just needed to vent because I’m fkin terrified right now and all I can thing about is the pain I’m getting in my stomach, and if it’s a baby kicking me.

healthanxiety,Ellisrael,2018/01/21,"Stomach just WON'T stop acting up, on fire, etc. Would an MRI detect anything serious? I was sent to the hospital because my stomach was giving me immense trouble. They performed a colored MRI on me, but I'm still worried because I don't fully understand what it's supposed to detect. If they were looking for like some sort of bowel thing, would they have missed something like colon cancer or something serious? Does an MRI even detect stuff like that? They sent it to an outsourced radiology firm because they didn't have a radiologist on-site at night. 

The problem is my stomach still will NOT stop. It's acting up immensely. I've gotten over a lot of my health anxiety, to the point where I've been off meds but I had to take a pill today to relax. My family does think something's wrong as I'm always fatigued, pale, nauseous etc. I'm getting a full blood work panel done soon because my iron was extremely low some time ago so they wanna check again, also because diabetes runs in my family like crazy.

Couple with an MRI and a full blood work panel this Wednesday, what are the chances of them missing something?

healthanxiety,hellaquin,2018/01/21,"Paranoia and Anxiety about that Brain Eating Amoeba Hi everyone. I'm pretty new to this sub, but I really need to vent.

 I was diagnosed with Illness Anxiety Disorder two years ago and I generally have a pretty good hold of it. Yesterday, I was showering and a drop or two or water got into one nostril in my nose. I could feel it chilling in my nose hair and I immediately used my towel to wipe it out and then I blew my nose when I got out of the shower. However, I live in Florida, and I'm really paranoid that the brain eating amoeba is lurking in the water. This was water from the shower head in my dorm and it has been colder lately, but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I'm terrified; I'm even tearing up with fear writing this. My birthday is next week and I want to be okay for that and for everything. My mom said I'm worrying needlessly and she's probably right but I can't shake the anxiety.

Edit to add: It doesn't help that symptoms apparently don't develop for 1-9 days after infection, so I'm going to be sitting in my anxiety for days.",2.7093628950051003,4.331600802752298,5.209480122324159,79.28442405708462,75.37614678899081,9.064627930682976,27.24872579001019,9.586721724236666,2.6648401630988787,837,33,166,23,18,297,119,218,0.16,0.754,0.086,-0.9509,6,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,7,1,15,18,9,1,0,31,31,18,0,3,5,1,2,0,0,0,4,1,4,0,13,17,5,1,2,0,0,2,4,2,0,3,8,7,22,2,29,20,0,28,0,0,0,0,6,12,0,2,12,108,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11448434732677534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3951998808646549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28834989933953875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311636474870968,0.0,0.0,0.16658309869494733,0.0,0.0,0.13108529260469978,0.0,0.0,0.14801794854727224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26430691945272106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853028522970445,0.0,0.0,0.12340907621797015,0.11607236637316333,0.0,0.0,0.14533049974772708,0.06530249972423796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06747593635204653,0.0,0.07339934748091725,0.10832552154832943,0.20658730577273746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2650918588968475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08656702531538908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14568767136250665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404247836369595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15125979742882956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09576364463010507,0.0,0.12473459909799355,0.13735328776286987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875158906187263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2627854864785432,0.13924635228548565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16547455503316885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1102940347957997,0.12285193843351525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1342370801445558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1025312691873106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2523230327406185,0.0,0.0,0.11154478114694452,0.0,0.0,0.07617645850534653,0.0,0.10359694136257586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13115885570819774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316884859881532
healthanxiety,highaltitude808,2018/01/21,"Deep scratch from unvaccinated cat Hey, so last night I got a deep scratch from a cat on my thumb. It was bleeding quite a bit until I cleaned it up and bandaged it.

The cat was born to a stray mother at my friend's parents store and was adopted by my friend as a kitten. It hasn't been vaccinated and is about 6 months-1 year old. My friend and his family have been scratched quite a bit by the cat as well (but not as of late). It's a house cat and rarely ever leaves the house.

I keep looking up various diseases I could be exposed too (cat scratch disease, rabies, etc). The wound itself looks fine thankfully (been over 12hrs). Should I be worried about anything? Any symptoms I should look out for? I want to ease my mind and stop worrying but I can't seem to..

I read a lot that back pain is a symptom of cancer, However, I can't find a description of what that back pain feels like. I can't even find a description that says ""there is no commonality to back pain from cancer."" So it leaves me in the dark.

Is there anything that describes what the pain feels like? Does it not stop, even if you lie still? Does it stay in one location or does it move around? Can it be light pain, or is it always a severe pain?

healthanxiety,leew8,2018/01/21,"Help I was doing so well with my fears of colon cancer over the Christmas period. My symptoms were minimal, and I finally truly believed I didn’t have it. But now, im scared I won’t see another Christmas again. I’ve been having slight feelings of being sick, thin stools, stomach ache, and a sore anus on and off. I don’t think I’ve had blood but sometimes stools are darker than others. And I feel a pain slightly in my left side when I put pressure on it and I’m convinced I have a lump there when no one else can feel anything. I’m only 15 so I’m told chances aren’t very likely. But my grandma had it at around 60, so that’s what worries me. Around 2/3 weeks before I started worrying I had blood and urine tests due to another worry, and I was completely clear of anything. But maybe that was too early to detect anything. I’ve been in this state for like 6 months now. And it’s tearing my life apart, not knowing whether or not I’m gonna be here in a few months",2.2786022131624932,3.889605415841583,3.4728305183459547,91.32787711124055,76.52475247524751,6.139079790331974,24.75364006988935,6.794906146795322,0.7968284216656962,762,26,164,7,17,247,127,202,0.163,0.7440000000000001,0.093,-0.9252,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,0,14,8,0,3,5,0,21,13,6,0,1,25,34,19,0,0,8,0,4,2,0,2,7,0,0,0,9,11,0,0,5,0,0,1,7,4,1,1,11,5,17,4,18,19,1,29,0,0,1,0,2,14,0,1,15,101,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29527108671514124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3475861820331063,0.2506743076648859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11980593939287508,0.1586274391187127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14762058850780518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11761592482088425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15843320682475304,0.2135701273224042,0.0,0.0,0.1542337372366123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437173511275404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520824615150364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0773770977519023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1529738786796176,0.0,0.09944747676675636,0.13757037984544146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14144722351722872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22476200954211847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0954061482133311,0.10708073142092517,0.14981551221465553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415375845452689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14096007972717242,0.0,0.11219516560901288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13924958132288565,0.0,0.09965522972333092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14633962670610007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902155735629972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345353916103847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1161703918281698,0.0,0.0,0.11293703431695168,0.0,0.1265913648927008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4289516271406027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I started having flu symptoms on Thursday and they cleared up yesterday for the most part. All I have left is a cough and some dizziness. I'm so afraid something will happen to me where I'll die or something because of how deadly this flu is supposed to be. :( am I being silly and am I going to be ok since my fever is gone and I feel mostly better or is there still a chance something weird could happen??

healthanxiety,Diladjent,2018/01/21,"I definitely need this group! It's almost debilitating... I find bulging veins and I think they are blood clots, I feel a lump and automatically think it's cancer, I have chest pain and think it's a heart attack, I have diarrhea and think it's bowl cancer, headache and it's a tumor... The list goes on! And on top of that, it creates insane panic attacks that make it all so much worse. My legs shake, my stomach hurts, I always feel pain wherever I assume there's something wrong, my vision gets blurry, I hyperventilate and feel faint... I don't know what to do! 

Even when I hear of something like water intoxication, I immediately start getting nervous that I drank too much water. When I hear sitting can cause blood clots, I immediately get extremely worried that I have been sitting too much... Even hearing about broken bones or something like that, I get anxious about doing anything! 

I'm glad I came across this. I was about to post in the Health forum about what to do about some of my issues. Haha.

healthanxiety,veganburritokiller,2018/01/21,"Constantly “checking” for signs of brain problem Hey, guys. So this is a little difficult to explain, so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So, a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think “there is something wrong with my brain”. Well now, it’s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/don’t have a problem, I’ve begun subconsciously “checking” every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance, I’ll skim a headline really fast online, then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didn’t carefully read it). Because I’m now “checking” every single word I read and hear, I’m constantly misreading, mishearing and misunderstanding things, because I’m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. It’s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory, which of course, is fueling my health anxiety as it further “proves” I have something wrong with me. 

Of course, occupying my mind with this causes me to make many, many mistakes which- you guessed it- fuels it more. 

Has anyone else struggled with health anxiety pertaining to a brain problem? This really sucks.

healthanxiety,Krypt0night,2018/01/21,"Oral cancer fears It's been at least weeks since I've noticed it, but who knows how long it's actually been there. I'm not even sure how to describe the location. It's not on the hard palate but kind of in between that and the hard part of the gums on the inner side of teeth.

If you take your tongue and reach it as far back as you can even past the final molar on top, that's where it is. 

Anyways, I felt with my tongue recently that there was a small lump. If I look in my mouth, there is no sore or anything. But I can feel it with my tongue and finger. I just touched it with my hand again and I believe it is movable as well but I'm not 100 percent on that. It doesn't currently hurt to the touch but weeks ago, it was tender when I would use my finger. 

I can't get it looked at until February 5th, and my health anxiety was doing so well for about a year now, but now I'm freaking out and it's affecting my sleep amongst other things.",4.035377668308705,3.6813803497536974,4.783854679802957,90.89512520525456,70.6256157635468,8.145977011494253,25.78366174055829,7.492282038375204,0.9195750410509032,733,18,177,7,12,237,115,203,0.091,0.8140000000000001,0.095,-0.0877,1,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,3,0,1,19,8,0,1,9,0,14,11,6,4,1,32,25,23,0,3,13,0,9,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,20,10,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,3,2,0,6,11,17,5,24,18,3,30,0,1,2,0,4,15,0,3,15,123,37,0,0.0,0.0,0.1617301940402747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14691111778555754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267842670247875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363830357366397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12743741729131294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867228286084036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21892839805401385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864941947507511,0.08379890747243765,0.0,0.1591283847391331,0.18155093370771191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08658795254176961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29692603045073873,0.0,0.0,0.17616500566348378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17741917082645964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17258402143908574,0.09108178661909544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14666730469907194,0.2783457092812569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18868659449164024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17947123841254645,0.1582096233369706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1636400212045383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13709494258918756,0.0,0.1658513504068955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1562001291232001,0.0,0.12460958349981155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11010475134999527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1431389431314023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2658798833223792,0.0,0.2980253335928088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11773101688894655,0.0,0.0,0.10672575594735598
healthanxiety,tw4569,2018/01/21,"Kind of freaking out now ('heavy' arm, sweating. nausea) I'm 26 years old, male, overweight (5' 10"" 250lb), non-smoker, infrequent drinker, non drug user, sedentary lifestyler, and my doctor has been monitoring my triglycerides for several years (I'm a carb addict). 

For the last several days I've been feeling kind of off. I've had what I think feel like low blood sugar episodes; light-headedness, feeling faint, slight nausea/abdominal discomfort that got better after I had some candy. 

I've also had feelings of 'fuzziness' in my hands and feet that come and go throughout the last several days. Not pins and needles or even a 'static' feeling, just 'fuzzy'.

Today, my left arm feels 'heavy'. That's the best way I can describe it. I seem to have normal strength in it and it's not numb anywhere, just 'heavy'. It's worth noting that I sleep on my sides (I switch sides several times throughout the night) and due to the way I position my arms, it's not uncommon for me to wake up with an arm asleep. Is it possible for a slept-on arm to retain an odd feeling for several hours after waking up?

Today, I had my favorite meal, mom's spaghetti. Once I got myself a serving, though, I found that I was lacking appetite. I began to feel kind of nauseous and began sweating. Nausea and sweating combined with the heavy arm freaked me out badly for a while. I took some pepto-bismol and don't really feel nauseous anymore, I'm not sweating anymore, but my arm still feels weird. I was pretty close to deciding to go to the ER for a little bit there, but I don't know. I think I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for Monday. 

This sucks. I'm on Citalopram for anxiety that was discovered after I went to the ER with heart palptations, chest discomfort, and trouble breathing when I was 19. I'm kind of a hypochondriac. Why does it have to be my left arm that feels weird? I could probably ignore the right arm, but since all the heart attack literature focuses on the left arm, I'm freaking out.

healthanxiety,mcnicfer,2018/01/22,"Seeing floaters when I walk into a dark room. Am I going blind? This is a new onset for me. As for everyone, it takes a few minutes to get used to being in a dark room, but lately I see floaters while my eyes adjust. Is this normal? I'm nearing my 30's so I don't know if this is just a normal part of me getting older or if I'm going blind. 

My dad lost his eyesight due to diabetes (I am not diabetic), so it makes me worry a little. My husband assures me this is normal.

I feel it more when I walk. I'm freaking out that it's my appendix but I also worked yesterday so maybe it's just me being sore from that.

healthanxiety,svarela128,2018/01/22,"Nervous about pain in throat after eating garlic &amp; venting Hi everybody,

So I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for about 4 years now. It all started with a donkey biting my arm while on vacation. Since then, I’ve had the rabies shots twice. I go to my doctor many times a year. I’ve developed a chronic pain on my shoulder. And I pretty much freak out over every little symptom.

Last night my mom called me to tell me she was coming down with a cold. I remembered that yesterday I borrowed her scarf and used it all day. Wanting to prevent a cold, I crushed a raw garlic clove and ate it. I’ve done this before many times and normally it just gives me a little acid reflux. I’ve noticed that raw garlic keeps me pretty healthy overall. However, this time, I developed a burning sensation in my throat about fives minutes after I ate it. It has now been burning me for about 6 hours. I woke up in the middle of the night and have not been able to go back to sleep. I had some milk and a banana and took ibuprofen to see if it would help the pain/burning sensation. Even my chest started hurting, which never usually happens to me. 

I’m embarrassed to go to the hospital for just a stupid raw garlic but my mind is going there and I’m already catastrophizing everything (ie I’ve burned a hole through my throat, this will somehow lead to death, etc). I’m hoping the symptoms  go down within the next couple of hours, otherwise, the pain will get the better of me and I might actually go to the emergency room.

In times like these I hate myself and how miserable I make life for myself. Why can’t I just get over these dumb fears? If I wasn’t so afraid all the time, I wouldn’t have eaten the garlic. My anxiety and negative thinking is probably making my pain and symptoms worse (I’m an expert at that).

I’m just really tired of constantly being in pain for some reason or another. This sucks. :(",3.7150580875781927,5.449271734584453,4.697069705093835,83.53205674709564,72.94101876675603,7.868775692582662,26.64244861483468,8.548686976883017,1.9313868453976768,1499,53,287,27,30,488,196,373,0.204,0.747,0.049,-0.9962,2,0,0,0,0,0,44.0,0,0,0,2,17,20,4,5,24,0,20,26,7,6,4,49,53,21,1,7,9,1,0,1,0,5,14,0,1,0,17,16,5,2,3,0,1,9,6,17,0,2,13,4,36,3,45,34,7,55,0,3,1,0,8,19,2,8,28,185,53,2,0.08160922857259809,0.0,0.07963883481410575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09005781307188594,0.0,0.0,0.08842356506243447,0.0,0.0,0.08557439179809044,0.12486167296751212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06275245933527909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06944344271157815,0.0,0.0,0.07217673076884781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833321468313781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07029912424035344,0.0,0.08819058387737966,0.0,0.0,0.09029905918324443,0.0,0.05263120106629457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08353050352316052,0.0,0.08351457494873579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08350661459601612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09101586228376787,0.05390212579723553,0.0,0.06875929484958063,0.0,0.07334511244761545,0.0,0.0,0.09183307086026364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08527490726497748,0.0782870083603184,0.27828243169930783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07216677130813222,0.0,0.0,0.08057221760466353,0.0,0.08674679375309778,0.0,0.0,0.05470094566350443,0.0,0.0,0.08105637798439776,0.16073730243354428,0.0,0.08736436706917854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07253803207287664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665224135253086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057643011612443874,0.03987014683921047,0.1635877730867071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10894958755650924,0.16547789739538846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08657449491607479,0.08240205668236618,0.09557974217182913,0.0,0.0,0.05999217307904853,0.0,0.06294206812454349,0.0,0.08679234042347042,0.15316946530925213,0.07995971672126469,0.0,0.09291264763222792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5210278384780754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16605184901120754,0.08798855132723939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0522809615473343,0.08390787897045603,0.0,0.0,0.09244734720441887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06503198918991873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06750799720175167,0.0,0.08166816578147405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155268640481584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2544697083073785,0.0,0.0,0.07133006284480567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052291898433098366,0.0,0.0,0.23793498732356694,0.09379780304170098,0.0,0.0,0.090670855737098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07048417096852487,0.08988103560774842,0.0,0.04813523743432136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07363963528327007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08316677598692739,0.057972854494817885,0.0,0.0,0.1051073350741849
healthanxiety,RabidPinkBunny,2018/01/22,"I'm convinced I have HIV. I've had a bit of HIV-phobia for a while now, and I realize now it was (mostly) unfounded. But this summer it got worse. I have no job right now and I wasn't going to school, so I spent most of the summer inside, to an unhealthy extent. When I did go out for long enough, I developed a rash that I think is PMLE, which is a mild allergy to sunlight, not fun but harmless. Then I saw that it can be a symptom of HIV infection. Granted, I've never had this reaction before. The page said it can develop around my age, and near-nonexistent sun exposure mixed with periods of high exposure can probably cause reactions like that, especially since it was a pretty brutal summer, but I'm still terrified.

Around this time I also started to develop these purplish vein-like patterns on my legs, and that just made me panic even more because I couldn't just explain that away. I am overweight, and I think I gained some weight during the summer, so I thought of stretch marks, but aren't those usually white? They seem to be going away now but that's only a little comforting.

I've never done drugs or even had sex. But I remember finding an unexplained cut on my finger a few years ago that I'm afraid might have been from a needle in the trash where I worked at the time. I don't remember exactly when that happened. I haven't been getting sick often or having issues with infections, but would I really notice those things if my immune system wasn't working properly? Isn't the immune system where most of the symptoms come from?

I still haven't been going out as much as I probably should, and I realize that I probably have a severe vitamin D deficiency, so that might be causing some of this, but I don't know if it can explain everything. I keep checking my skin for any changes, fearing the worst. I'm really scared.",5.409675714628875,6.001172016574589,6.2598630795099695,78.21558371366805,67.78453038674033,9.831563776122989,30.656257506605808,9.867487886160001,2.9086820562094653,1458,54,276,32,23,482,191,362,0.14400000000000002,0.773,0.084,-0.9742,1,0,1,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,1,3,21,12,2,4,20,0,38,18,4,3,3,58,63,28,0,5,15,0,3,1,0,4,12,1,0,0,25,13,2,1,12,0,2,5,13,7,0,0,18,6,33,5,31,37,13,48,0,0,2,3,4,16,0,13,26,200,58,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09204110566326576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303468581120478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07060955263580257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848655949548937,0.0,0.0,0.19510780517592247,0.0,0.0,0.06329523150976371,0.0,0.08835367481936901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11335802434148474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2133288328668018,0.10984084940131598,0.08944236807232818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10625653495240912,0.0,0.0,0.12041255130278335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10728656468072782,0.0,0.1371605643038673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09331781319802313,0.0,0.0,0.11684025105366805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490087885208892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05424811279903237,0.0,0.2360412494757121,0.0,0.08304420858968742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09181859648584782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10970456935764182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083739878112994,0.10303757713125546,0.09229095574110044,0.0,0.0,0.0570635393193593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0507272371772082,0.10406728370134387,0.0,0.09188835462308877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09824867188388127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22029941122693386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07632871794603313,0.0,0.16016380531800126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11821380874793215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07896917441095799,0.0,0.12182488056904052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10563481948631187,0.3358464765672443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330353132111337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23524360353899004,0.08867225212624222,0.09876833392796604,0.0,0.10395428732365156,0.10508387272352318,0.0,0.09452506383492076,0.0,0.11730099094997623,0.0,0.08589118568391453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0734930655829266,0.0,0.16584128375017426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21584311857493016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06898159380847607,0.13306314345717574,0.0,0.08243128079440841,0.12109094640051365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11435665460161715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12643981908827945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15118236218390302,0.0,0.10581402641345658,0.07375951615272865,0.0,0.0,0.0668646235098498
healthanxiety,ratlizardmutantgirl,2018/01/22,"Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade, but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. 

Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again, like it was when I was a child. In late 2016, when I was 19, I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 2-3 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.

Now, like a year and a half later, it's not as bad as it was in that period, but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.

Now....this is because I'm like, terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer, of any type, kidney failure, some kind of disease... whatever, it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps, and always convince myself something is there when it isn't, in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them. 

I know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap, but it scares me so bad I'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. :( I'm not currently in therapy but I know i need to be.

It's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep, but it's seeping over into my daily life. If my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think I have it. It's gotten so bad that I actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. :(

I just need to know that I'm not alone.

I’m trying to not think of the worst thing as nothing else is wrong with me. I got these in the past it’s just been a while. I REALLY want to google but i shouldnt right?

I have been suffering from health anxiety and death centered panic disorder since I was 7 years old. I was so young that I had absolutely no idea what panic attacks were and concluded that there was something medically wrong with me causing my symptoms. This is where my health anxiety began. I wasn't able to fully be a child as i spent 8+ years fearing for my life in silence thinking i was dying of this ailment or that ailment, i was too afraid to tell my parents. Since then, I am a 23 year old, going to therapy and taking medications and working out my issues. It is so relieving to see that there are other people out there like me dealing with the same issues and who understand.

healthanxiety,helpmethrowawayc,2018/01/24,"paranoid about testicles and now I'm freaking out So I'm totally serious here and I know it sounds like I'm trying to be funny but I'm not! A week ago  I was lazy and didn't do laundry so I went commando for pretty much a week. Because of how ""loose"" it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often. Anyways, because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles. 

I should also note that I was a frequent fapper (like 3-4 times a day) and decided to stop that. So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day. Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it. I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little ""pinch"" on my left testicle. It didn't hurt or anything it was just... uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia!!

I haven't felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again.  I always constantly reach down there feeling them, and thinking omg one is bigger than the other! omg one feels softer than the other! I'm dying!

I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors! I can't sleep. I'm undereating. I sometimes cry at night. I was never like this and I hate it. 

Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now it's below the belt. I just want to live my life normally again.

healthanxiety,OriginalUsername1,2018/01/24,"Just venting a bit... Hello guys. 

For the past month or so I’ve been dealing with daily stress from thinking I have something. It started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which I attributed to colorectal cancer. After multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing, I made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. Ever since (this was early Jan) I’ve been over analyzing every “symptom” I have and haven’t had real peace of mind. It’s taken a huge toll on me mentally and I plan to get help. I’m the last 3 weeks I’ve gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. I am scared and I just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral won’t come for like another month.

Things I have going for me:

1: I am a 23 year old Hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease
2: my twitches are widespread, which is uncommon in als. Only recently have they been in my right hand more focused.
3: the “lack of strength” I originally felt isn’t there anymore, nor am I dropping things or have any strength loss that I can see
4: I have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. 
5: no family history of neuro diseases
6: this has been going on for a month without affecting my life (other than mentally)

Things I worry about:

1: My right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that I feel have gotten more pronounced. This has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. I’ve googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and I havent found any that look like mine. All I’ve found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and don’t look like mine. Mine look as though I’m missing muscle strips and crevices.

2: on the same right hand, the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. My index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. Also my right thumb/hand is less flexible than my left. 

Thanks for reading

I've been getting a few symptoms which line up with that of hypocalcemia, most prominently tingling numbness around my mouth, and it's understandable as I've avoided dairy for quite some time as it wreaks havoc on my skin.

It's come on more over the past few months since I've been exercising (running and lifting)a lot more and I'm not able to relax it feels horrible. I'm just wondering if it is hypocalcemia then a calcium supplement should help?

I'm not able to go to the doctors for blood work for just under a month because I'm at uni and I literally avoid dairy like it's the plague.

Literally seconds after she confirmed that nothing was wrong, my thoughts went to a small mole I have under my toe, that my doctor checked about 6 months ago. She wasn’t concerned at all. But somehow I’ve managed to convince myself that somethings wrong with it. The only thing that’s convincing me, is that it’s not perfectly round and that it’s dark brown - which doesn’t mean much really. It hasn’t even changed.

Any tips?,5.178011583011582,8.018643635135135,4.797722007722007,79.49418918918923,72.1081081081081,5.850193050193052,34.89575289575289,6.868970318607317,2.6665969111969114,335,18,49,3,7,102,48,74,0.194,0.73,0.077,-0.8240000000000001,0,0,0,0,1,0,4.0,0,3,0,0,3,3,1,1,3,0,6,5,1,1,1,17,17,6,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,3,5,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,6,2,4,12,1,10,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,4,8,31,9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08742828962059272,0.0,0.09835151417775452,0.5809653015338342,0.0,0.08989530922088185,0.13172955487448548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1567434893853775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16582697299629365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10739916845661654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13001217942514035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20150898313833265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4091599509347784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099863662967517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14727023567568512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4008833219928764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2471368804162699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2437282851153808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1415956672338805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I started getting pinched nerves in the upper back/neck/shoulder/clavicle areas. So I've been seeing chiropractors and getting massages. Turns out my spine is fucked up, and I'm constantly getting muscle spasms because.... My boobs are too big :( Way better than a faulty heart, but not exactly the cheapest problem to fix.

healthanxiety,8432154,2018/01/24,"Sore inside mouth that won't go away I have had a strong sore on the lower right part of my mouth/gums for 6 days now. I experience intense pain when I brush my teeth. I have been pretty good about health anxiety the past year, but now I'm starting to get nervous because the pain will not go away.

healthanxiety,coordinatedflight,2018/01/25,"Ex-Smoker, Fear, and Excessive Research Hi everyone.

As a health anxiety sufferer, I have an interesting story to share.

A few years ago, I picked up a habit of smoking hookah. I smoked cigars for a bit as well, throughout the same period.

I smoked hookah probably between 100 and 200 times in all.

Once I left my masters program, a few years later I felt a pain in my back. This was my first bout with health anxiety. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so Googling symptoms led me to lung cancer.

I thought, ""I smoked, so it could be true."" Then I saw this awful number online: Hookah = 100 Cigarettes, according to various news organizations, citing the WHO.

This terrified me. I smoked the equivalent of FIVE PACKS every time I smoked?!

Of course, eventually I found out that lung cancer was not the case. It was a messed up nerve. Physical therapy and some posture fixes, and that particular back pain is more under control. (I also have chronic back pain, I believe as a result of anxiety and a lack of movement.)

Fast forward a few years.

At the beginning of this year, I started having a high level of health anxiety after visiting the dermatologist and having some moles removed. (They were dysplastic nevuses - he removed them, but honestly probably didn't even need to.)

I started freaking out about melanoma, but when I realized I could relatively well see and manage that if it were to happen, as long as I stay vigilant about skin checks and doc checkups, melanoma is not a big threat.

But then the lung cancer scare came back.

I frantically tried to understand how much damage had I done. Pack years - how many do I have? 1? 5? 10?

I've read probably 100 different studies, done a thousand google searches, to understand the connection between hookah smoking and lung cancer.

Long story short, this led me down a path of compulsively studying. I also went back and reconstructed my year of smoking - down to the day-by-day level. I've requested transaction logs from my bank to see when I was in a particular place - when COULD I have smoked?

Some of this was actually helpful. I narrowed down my smoking to a possible 215 days, many of which I likely didn't smoke anyway. So I shrunk that fear a bit by looking at the reality.

Some of the other research I did was helpful, too - looking into the claim of 100-cigarette equivalence revealed that the number stated is referring to the volume of smoke, not necessarily the equivalence of hazard. I can't take a solid guess as to a better number, but the research I've read looks like much less than 100 for an average session.

Lastly, a lot of this research was NOT helpful, as my interpretation of the research caused me to catastrophize it.

My setup is a perfect example of what would drive a health anxiety sufferer insane: Reason to believe that something bad could happen (my short-lived smoking habit), ambiguity on the risk (very little research on hookah and its impact on your health), lots of scary media surrounding smoking, and finally my dodgy memory of how often and how much I smoked during that year.

This is a perfect recipe for fear for a health anxiety sufferer.

My wife and I had our first son last year. All of this fear has grown into a tragic story where my son loses his father at a young age because his father smoked hookah for a year. This all sounds silly from the outside, but completely plausible from the inside.

I want to encourage health anxiety sufferers who have analytical brains like me: focus on what is in front of you today. There is nothing you can do to change what happened yesterday. Be aware, but don't ruminate. Look for actions you can take today to be healthy, not reasons why you aren't healthy.

I'm learning that no matter what risk levels I have, there is nothing I can do to nail that down perfectly, and trying to nail it down keeps rumination and negative thoughts constantly in my head. The what-if questions stay present. The hyperfocusing on what my shortened life would look like - that pervades my mental state.

Now, today, is the day where I look at what I have and say ""thank you"" for it. Look at my past, and accept it. Look at my risk, and accept it. Look at the future with belief and hope for the best, rather than constantly fearing the worst.",5.7918291689299295,7.287926925221803,6.221424723881949,75.55262595057036,67.45373891001267,9.43799565453558,31.83326543545175,9.740319157613822,3.188662665218178,3380,140,587,75,56,1091,348,789,0.162,0.727,0.111,-0.9924,2,0,14,0,0,0,122.0,1,6,2,10,31,46,1,10,55,1,55,26,7,13,7,102,90,48,0,13,13,5,2,4,0,2,18,2,0,0,41,28,1,2,19,2,2,14,13,25,2,4,24,16,71,21,99,56,24,111,1,7,12,0,30,44,0,12,55,412,112,12,0.0,0.0,0.04831355009819872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043886657598069714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918450780658172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26511924078493804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19034646193386975,0.04133786816888574,0.030180169315025932,0.0,0.0,0.11155916541104224,0.05195654194689567,0.04378660368480538,0.10810180439311934,0.0,0.0,0.055268312202678485,0.0,0.05662499865777799,0.0,0.1017185677676808,0.052373857454437435,0.0,0.05190914555171345,0.10700307713679656,0.05552844743291053,0.1581153301094424,0.0,0.0,0.1277165933118051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172626889513518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101329599061408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03270016520436193,0.0,0.041713388250673306,0.047307880936885566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2785564153490685,0.0,0.0,0.047536313387622826,0.054234586084018516,0.0,0.08422449958525374,0.0,0.05428395954910275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05453964117703887,0.0,0.1313416850896645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05081042044217,0.36837956041695546,0.0,0.0,0.09955432741707332,0.052308876970217036,0.0,0.04917351424928311,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.044005790074127714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071273182261157,0.0,0.0,0.053791570771109416,0.0,0.034969604161707114,0.09675020189509607,0.04962092984487957,0.0,0.08762764696345818,0.3741751039378225,0.05538780145368345,0.0,0.08418140213362857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10038851905126857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04989333220330314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918422650155518,0.03671022616068772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501026032845086,0.0,0.0,0.0527253686442075,0.0,0.0,0.15804289851568784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04726185242320567,0.0,0.0,0.05172626889513518,0.0,0.0,0.055813852188929834,0.0,0.0,0.16013692161139806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05546130489217903,0.0,0.09904460678103952,0.0,0.0,0.10180680126060034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039371468857231966,0.049567051381535734,0.0,0.07890437561138583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03811437429987916,0.0,0.0,0.07008531637745517,0.1055398119523424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051458709516448764,0.07444907106998974,0.0,0.0,0.04558114852456553,0.0566177482718322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0786090816603122,0.05773808196468155,0.0,0.14078596068940116,0.0,0.0,0.06722659407448278,0.0,0.0,0.10308103346312213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040850032093519305,0.02920163524115077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08902890378949857,0.045895251478887684,0.04467408666608453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033941208479041,0.0,0.0,0.2869390078083999

healthanxiety,wazzer174,2018/01/25,"Possible rabies exposure? We have a problem with animals getting into our trash, one of the wonderful perks of living so close to the woods. To make a long story short I fear that I somehow brought some wild animal saliva back onto a trashcan in my house, a trash can that I touched with an open cut on one of my fingers. 

This seems like i'm over reacting but i'm just so worried about the possibility of somehow having exposed myself to rabies. Manly because of how scary the despise is. Because by the time you know for sure that you have it, your dead.

Do you think i'm overreacting?",4.948157894736845,6.158076052631582,5.907850877192985,78.0870394736842,69.17543859649122,8.50701754385965,31.793859649122812,8.841846274778883,2.7027754385964906,466,20,85,8,8,154,81,114,0.196,0.747,0.057,-0.9546,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,2,4,0,0,8,6,2,1,10,0,6,1,1,3,1,20,16,4,1,1,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,6,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,4,0,2,1,2,12,2,18,15,1,12,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,5,4,62,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17190353810695716,0.0,0.27255972258220496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515667109038894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11680066746285313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25795777054293245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12286251330042243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10921993144340422,0.0,0.19740722859333348,0.19784321699448226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14922777349802138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3029795506517117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5040597324046472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21391635130919884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20352026970575973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21070228367592667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14324796908677648,0.0,0.0,0.13035940453527484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24244085714436744,0.0,0.2270356325320842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,omarh14,2018/01/25,"scared I have P.O.T.S., are my heart rates abnormal? So at the moment I'm scared I have POTS, where your heart rate goes way high upon standing. I was laying on my bed, noted my heart rate is 66 - 72, then I tried standing up real fast. It went from that to 120!, then I waited a five minutes standing and it only went down to 108.


So I tried again, this time I sat down for 5 minutes, my heart rate was 78. Stood up and it went to 102, waited 10 minutes this time and it was about the same, maybe a little higher to 108.


And none of this is walking around or anything, didn't check that but no doubt it would be higher.


Is this a cause for concern? I'm seeing the doctor luckily tomorrow for a routine checkup",2.299703196347032,3.7966695410958953,3.379657534246576,92.50227168949776,76.1917808219178,5.688584474885845,22.44063926940639,5.985473137389443,0.224129680365297,547,15,119,3,12,176,87,146,0.075,0.893,0.032,-0.6312,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,0,6,3,0,3,7,0,12,6,4,1,0,14,22,10,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,11,5,0,2,0,0,1,4,3,3,0,1,9,1,12,0,18,11,2,27,0,0,1,0,1,11,0,2,8,76,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11907364418224142,0.12881137769312428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14864410476132006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1481039364229192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6858685376422645,0.0,0.15288076422913294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14502482400386166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14536800282284176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1100489050290408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16469733747300272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2897347117625355,0.0,0.1153051063527848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16874845355427262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19648009427693086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11485407354949527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4024078623161165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10278889261064984,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,sit_ur_ass_down,2018/01/25,"The worry of a pulomnary embolism is ruining my life!! Edit: Darn...I should have spellchecked my title. 

I'm a 21 year old college student with GAD. In october, I stood up after class and had a weird pain in my right calf. It went on everyday for over a month in total and I became convinced I had a blood clot. I went to the ER twice and got negative results on the blood clot tests. Still, I couldn't reconcicle this. I kept having random chest pains, shoulder pains, palpitations, etc. It might have just been anxiety idk. But the daily pain went away around late october. 

Just this past week, the exact pain started up again in the exact same spot. I am getting anxious and having the same chest symptoms. I really hope this is all just my anxiety but I don't know. It feels so real. My october doctors appts and ER visits cost SO much money. I want to go to the ER again but they thought I was crazy last time and I can't put my family in more debt. So I don't know what to do. But I truly feel like I am having a pulmonary embolism and dying. Anyone else have similar issues? I can't focus and I am terrified.

healthanxiety,HypochondriacTales,2018/01/26,"What symptom did you have that you thought was a sign of something terrible, but just ended up going away? I have more than I can count.

1) A headache (albeit mild) that lasted for a month.  A MONTH.  I mean, what else could that have been other than a brain tumor?  Well, that was ten years ago.  Headache went away and there's no brain tumor!

2) A persistent twitching in my eyelid and facial cheek that I thought was a sign of some terrible neurological disease.  It went away.  Occasionally it comes back and then goes away again.  

3) Tingling in my hands and thighs for several months that I thought for sure was a sign of MS.  It just kind of went away over time.  (About 8 years ago). 

4) Noticing countless little red ""dots"" all over my body after reading that they were a sign of a type of Leukemia.  Was convinced for 6 months that I had leukemia.  I even started ""cataloging"" all instances of my red dots in a spreadsheet so I could keep track of which ones were new.  

There's a ton more, but what were your symptoms of imminent death that just kind of fizzled out?",2.4747572590011657,4.917165502439026,2.607386759581882,93.75593495934959,79.34146341463416,5.465737514518003,23.908246225319395,6.655083550727371,0.6034831591173053,828,29,172,8,21,250,113,205,0.108,0.847,0.045,-0.9304,0,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,3,1,1,11,7,0,0,12,0,17,12,7,0,3,26,28,8,1,2,5,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,17,6,0,1,4,1,0,5,1,2,1,2,17,3,16,5,30,9,6,35,0,0,2,0,4,13,0,1,17,118,33,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19434930342529305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5149746104678758,0.08429373370175214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12176703733589242,0.0,0.2447522451232338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09443097084883972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17505094913506236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09157639901939607,0.0,0.09709391625985993,0.0,0.0,0.07240531265291975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06230158265247414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974384370520229,0.0,0.2283120900215459,0.0,0.08935781434382342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10987158373951733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11941216960904767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3500018471406109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587509565186884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12480712405533832,0.0,0.0,0.07428374610830159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10965320321394068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12384339430704527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08439355491039052,0.0,0.0,0.07759210409144257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10331888677869387,0.2278816591885137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2610865311873674,0.06392236630160854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856472549510993,0.30486635267854595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411879280381158

Anyway, I’ve been experiencing some mild night sweats the past couple days. I wake up an hour or two after going to sleep and my shirt is generally damp. It’s not enough sweating to change sheets or anything, but sometimes I have to remove my shirt. I’ve had on and off night sweats in the past that freaked me out, such as last winter when I almost convinced myself I had some type of cancer because, well, a quick search on google led me to Mayo Clinic and... I think you can get the rest (this might have been a good time to see a doctor about anxiety...). Also, I had some mild night sweats for a while last month, but after I returned home from college they miraculously stopped. Last night was particularly bad in that my shirt was definitely soaked when I woke up in the middle of the night, but I just took it off and after stressing over it for a couple minutes, got myself to go back to sleep, and woke up with no more sweat. I should emphasize that when I really wake up, like in the morning, I do not wake up sweating. Should I be concerned about this, given that I’ve had them occasionally before, probably when I was really stressed out with school, and that they’re pretty mild? I don’t want to ignore it if it could be a sign of something bad, but I want to stop freaking out about it, too. Again, these are not bed-drenching like google says is a problem. Oh and to make things even more annoying, I feel like I’m coming down with a cold or something... everyone in my school it seems is getting sick. So throw those symptoms together and you have an overly anxious kid. Thanks for any advice.",6.715657534246574,6.3229077095890425,6.754349315068492,79.14248287671234,65.05479452054793,9.6013698630137,30.578767123287676,8.982922981607832,2.272728767123287,1474,45,292,21,20,471,188,365,0.152,0.754,0.094,-0.9752,0,0,2,0,0,0,48.0,0,2,2,0,19,18,1,2,19,0,27,24,16,2,2,52,49,24,0,7,13,0,1,3,0,3,8,1,1,2,20,16,0,3,3,0,0,7,7,10,1,1,16,6,31,8,53,27,7,63,0,0,2,0,7,23,0,10,35,197,51,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08519491082573448,0.0,0.0,0.08730189030567914,0.0,0.0,0.06972078011180087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059287911371239475,0.0,0.2000858948894892,0.09849277464016187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174476348282663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703889023326119,0.14558950970224702,0.15943913829883874,0.0,0.07418691446797213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09222880334388148,0.07510104501663646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06960909695740351,0.19293423017602776,0.0,0.05622627939211952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1784724396823766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0900840764552656,0.0,0.057584017151480725,0.0,0.0,0.0833077695554408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04408270254622389,0.06228405870370358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09109977853209704,0.0,0.09909702127029753,0.0731255582059619,0.06972877599374055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0894756373226389,0.0926722051390881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745236805395107,0.0,0.08585839095691719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09099714053486543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078841611190082,0.0,0.2131990758106089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061580431574077325,0.12778066832044496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05819580235203396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09248813708908883,0.0,0.0,0.06958920426670563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13448290125207896,0.0,0.0,0.4908960261027477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1664534294270536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08869717455546873,0.18799756684258834,0.08342303452529537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16755634820948032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06933198422041655,0.0,0.17646913484110718,0.06947412788493859,0.07936877373960202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744933428704055,0.0,0.0,0.13423655627950362,0.08622691689287157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14577896810700405,0.19973728682678016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09061725507713901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08026704519745524,0.0,0.0,0.05792098189686092,0.05586380002121287,0.0,0.0,0.050837521482985086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968643079411214,0.0,0.0,0.08516581482207264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284642013694814,0.06920236966323272,0.0,0.0,0.07838862419735057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,pichulove,2018/01/26,"Appendix or IBS Lately my anxiety has been super high for multiple reasons. But I’ve also been experiencing some unpleasant physical symptoms that I’m not sure are related to anxiety or not. 

Every time after I eat, a little snack or big meal, I get horrible stomach pain (cramping) and I have to go to the bathroom. Then the rest of the day I have dull pain in my abdomen area. 

My previous doctor suggested I may have IBS but didn’t officially diagnose me. 

Could that explain all the pain/discomfort? 

I’m always worried it’s my appendix and that I’ll die, every little pain in that area worries me.

healthanxiety,lapointypartyhat,2018/01/26,"I feel like my psychologist might be ready to refer me elsewhere I have OCD with a health anxiety emphasis. My worries have run the gamut but I mostly focus on the idea of skin cancer. I have been seeing a psychologist for CBT and while in the sessions everything he says sounds logical and makes perfect sense. However, the second I encounter a mole I feel looks suspicious I don't apply what I've learned in therapy and I do everything wrong. I start by googling my symptoms and then when that doesn't work, I go to my doctor to seek reassurance. This assuages my fears temporarily but sometimes its not enough until the doctor will agree to a biopsy. Then inevitably the cycle continues.

My psychologist has been doing this therapy with me for months and I was doing so well until I tried testing myself and found a new mole. I was definitely not ready for it and this started a downward spiral where I feel like all the progress I made went by the wayside and I was back to how I was in the beginning.

Today I had a session after my most recent urgent care &amp; doctor visit. The tone was a lot different this time and I can tell he's frustrated with me because I am not using his advice. He kept saying, ""I am sorry that I haven't been able to get through to you to help you."" and has pointed out that I am not doing the work of not giving into my compulsions. He said that he didn't want to make me go through therapy if I wasn't motivated to do the work to get better. He's totally right. 


The positive that came out of this is that I am reflecting on my lack of motivation to do what I know I need to do to get better. I feel like I can prove myself to him from this point forward but I don't know that he's willing to continue treating me. Hopefully this next appointment isn't him telling me its the last one.

healthanxiety,katt_kem,2018/01/27,"My HIV hypochondria is acting up again 😐 Hey guys,
So I had been sleeping with this guy (Rob) on and off since 2016 and around August last year I started to get anxious about his status after stalking his exes facebook. I noticed she had cold sores on her lips and the last time I saw her in 2015 I saw her with cold sores. At first I thought it was normal because lots of people have and get cold sores but when I saw a recent picture of her on Facebook with the same if not worse cold sores. This concerned me because to my knowledge only people who are immuno compromised get recurring cold sores that often. 
I had spoken to Rob about his status earlier and he assured me he was healthy and I chose to believe him but after speaking to one of my girl friends she was surprised at how quick I was to believe him. She said verbatim ""guys can lie and I don't trust these uni boys"" - keep in mind I live in Kenya where HIV is prevalent. This comment really freaked me out and I was sure he lied to me. 
I started freaking out and going crazy because of the picture of his ex coupled with my friend's comments, I was sure I had contracted the virus. At this time I started sending him cryptic messages alluding to him infecting me but he didn't get which then forced me to plainly ask ""Are you HIV positive?"" He quickly replied ""No I'm not. I checked, you also checked"" and I went and got tested and my results returned negative (this wasn't a rapid test it was the one you wait two days for). 
I felt so bad about accusing him and we stopped speaking. 
Skip forward 3 months and we start fucking again. We met up and fucked 2 more times before I officially ended it for good. Now my mind is going back to thoughts that I'm HIV positive again. I keep thinking that maybe the first 6 times we met up and fucked the virus missed me and on the last 7th and 8th time the virus may have stuck. Is that possible? 

**TLDR** Had been hooking up with a guy since Dec 2016 and started getting anxious about his HIV status. Got tested in August 2017 and results came back negative. Started fucking him again in October 2017 and stopped in November. Is it possible that he is positive and the virus missed me the first 6 times we fucked and got me the last two times we did it?

healthanxiety,throwaway19827843284,2018/01/27,"Finger pain/throbbing My forefinger keeps throbbing for about 3-4 seconds then stopping for 3-4 seconds then throbbing again for 3-4 seconds, this happens like 6 times for about 5 minutes then stops and starts again after a random amount of time, I can't really liken any of my activities to triggering it. It is moderately painful, doesn't feel like external pain (like a scratch or impact of some sort) and feels more like a ""shooting"" pain in the sense that it feels as though it is rushing up the first segment of my forefinger as it pains me.

I am a little worried I have some sort of repetitive strain since I do spend a lot of time on the computer and playing on a Nintendo DS. Really my question is should I go to the doctor about this?",9.850643678160921,6.940356420689657,9.297068965517244,71.45066091954025,60.6551724137931,12.701149425287356,42.09770114942529,10.864195022040775,4.4109080459770125,591,26,113,11,6,190,85,145,0.14800000000000002,0.787,0.065,-0.8718,0,0,0,1,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,6,10,0,1,10,0,9,8,1,1,0,19,16,10,0,1,1,0,5,4,0,1,7,0,0,0,8,3,0,3,4,2,1,2,2,5,0,4,0,5,10,5,22,15,6,22,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,8,18,77,18,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09232080367014188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1389551316901406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2059315516211674,0.1939725729030686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11547657144022636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715499191483619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005127214387405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1206688739334064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.265300041104702,0.13606622487231565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11541748238685125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7222859599814341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1520811965185294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17394143672754772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11230128211433672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09609094839892704,0.0,0.0,0.22700127534550446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1333825690947121,0.0,0.2374865667228092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13786989665481833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,DistinctWhereas,2018/01/27,"Is it normal to get screened for psychosis even though I dont have any symptoms of it??? Ok, let me explain what is going on. Hope some of you can relate to this. My anxiety is through the roof.

Couple of years back I had stress-induced panic anxiety, with all the classic symptoms (rapid heartbeat, crazy tensions, panic attacks, fatique etc.). My doctor had a hard time telling me what was going on, and I kept coming to the worst conclusions -&gt; this gave me some crazy health anxiety and the fear of dying. I came over this in a year, and haven't had any of this for 2 years straight.

Now, 4 months ago I start to feel a little depressed, nothing major, I assumed it was due to the winter coming, messed up sleeping pattern and life just being a bit boring. This threw me right back into the health anxiety. Thoughts racing constantly about why I got depressed, what is happening to me, am I going crazy etc. I went to the doctor, saying that I felt off, a bit emotionally numb, and racing thoughts 24/7. I took a depression test there, but kinda showed nothing, so the doctor kept asking me questions about hallucinations and delusions, which I have had nothing of, never. I went back a couple of more times assuming something physical was wrong with me or atleast something crazy that messed with my cognitive abilities. Got the same questions again and again.

So I slowly started thinking about the questions, what if I am gonna hallucinate, see stuff that isnt there etc. Now I am stuck here with some 24/7 dp/dr, constant hyperawareness and crazy anxiety about hallucinating or going psychotic or something. It's like my brain is in super defence mode, recognizing everything that changes in my surroundings, telling me to reality check everything so I am sure that I am not going crazy. I feel so off.

I went to my doctor again and told her about the fear of going crazy or developing schizophrenia. And she sent me to a psyciatrist, with the reference of me being psychotic. When I read the reference I had a fullblown panic attack, I just froze. This made my anxiety 100x worse than before, thinking that I must be super crazy.

Recently I went to the psyciatrist who asked me the same questions about delusions and halluciations, and I described again the same things. That I've never had them, never had any delusions. But I am starting to think whenever I see something, delusional thoughts pop up in my head, because of my obsession about the fear: ""what if I thought someone were actually following me"" etc.. all kinds of intruisive thoughts that I know for a fact that is no were near real, but just scary that that they pop up in my head all the damn time. I used some metaphors there at the interview and I think she might have gotten the totally wrong idea of what I told her. Because now I am being sent off to an interview about schizophrenia and psychosis, because she thinks I am that apparently, even though I don't have any symptoms at all. She even gave me a temporary diagnosis as a schizophrenic wtf.

This is throwing me off, what the f is happening. Am I losing control, I can't believe this is happening. Is this normal to get screened for??? I feel so detatched right now, stuck in full blown overanalyzing mode of my surroundings, I can't relax. What if I am going schizophrenic or psycotic????

Sorry for my grammar my anxiety has never been worse.",6.408602251407127,7.508366192307693,6.362596935584744,76.5535412757974,65.76282051282051,9.421138211382114,33.96951219512195,9.562709236259073,3.240615900562851,2680,117,472,52,41,847,256,624,0.194,0.765,0.04,-0.9981,2,0,4,0,0,0,95.0,0,1,2,5,37,31,4,8,34,1,52,17,4,3,12,95,114,34,1,7,15,0,6,1,0,3,13,1,0,0,37,23,0,4,26,3,1,20,12,23,0,0,40,11,77,8,68,66,22,79,0,4,4,0,28,27,1,21,33,347,114,8,0.0,0.0,0.05160580864906033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046877251819614336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14384797991838416,0.0,0.2831854165409749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09887622202464348,0.1203232291228854,0.0,0.12199041144713348,0.0,0.09671026282493393,0.0,0.044999214577545986,0.0595806034906319,0.0,0.0,0.1154682489858566,0.0,0.0,0.05903449318236479,0.0,0.0604836291174458,0.0,0.0,0.05594279990837661,0.09110738905742073,0.0,0.11429465051437075,0.05931235496000167,0.0,0.11702722623398573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1366431691867162,0.0,0.054883810405859136,0.0,0.0,0.21651040933674587,0.0,0.0,0.06197803671718339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0594858296232872,0.0,0.0,0.23591240047693016,0.10478541516193893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09505497781705476,0.0,0.0,0.17852294901849686,0.08021712475555473,0.0,0.05077560824193893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0552579725350695,0.0,0.21038088113531409,0.0,0.08459012416607757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14029177848876545,0.0,0.04737244025858914,0.0,0.10854564938355414,0.11242350418087624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05252437384113814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059698041014464326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05506911086777583,0.029062904917489214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054076061792895085,0.03735255838650787,0.0258357768969995,0.05300227793980252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05916212485940878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05003881363282562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05610010278222539,0.0,0.0,0.04221040270424073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16314534642267214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10362747899018188,0.1522269002456387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18613908089791387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2369625483431153,0.0,0.05289693072517882,0.060191998967411973,0.0,0.0,0.05221520738116858,0.0,0.0,0.09032293696126603,0.0,0.042054381926996974,0.0,0.0,0.08428120270811094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05292081113286201,0.0,0.0448072722621921,0.16284649775480356,0.0,0.05919776345582008,0.11229177173068013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06057686246632772,0.0,0.060537947772111016,0.0,0.0,0.049841243450700616,0.1648958715248153,0.0,0.0,0.092443481441858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035132862872255366,0.16942523774573093,0.10391381117712244,0.2099144659207974,0.09250884286841736,0.0,0.0,0.10106321916974872,0.058754536554149285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045673604445366486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19609087396028754,0.04771833912795925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10778381520922137,0.0,0.11563768649712015,0.0,0.10216402024424746
healthanxiety,SnorlaxForQueen,2018/01/28,"Can 24/7 anxiety cause brain-Tumor like symptoms? 19Yo male here, I eat really healthy and exercise regularly everyday just to preface. 

I've always suffered from severe anxiety, particularly health anxiety, and depression(to less of an extent), I remember at 12 the fear of testicular cancer just plaguing my every thought for months because of a dull ache in my testes.

Anyway, just before i started university for the first time a friend died of brain cancer, and all of my close friends' moms died of breast cancer when I was young, so I have a warped perception of how common it is, I guess. Aside from this my life has been filled with death, my father is terminally Ill, my mum was suicidal and almost died of blood poisoning, my grandma had vascular dementia and we cared for her at home until her death, more beyond this, grandparents, friends' parents, uncles and aunts.

My anxiety since starting uni has worsened, I suffer an elevated heart rate and sweats 24/7, extreme worrying thoughts all the time, trembling hands, especially bad at night. 

I've not had any memory issues or coordination issues, it's literally just headaches, for the past few weeks I've been getting pain in very singular spots, never a full over generalised headache, it lasts for a few seconds to a minute and then disappears, and this happens a few times through the day. 
The kicker is if I CAN remove myself from my anxiety it doesn't really happen, I was shopping all of yesterday with my girlfriend and didnt have any issues at all until we got into a quiet taxi, at which point my thoughts went rampant.

I just feel like my anxiety is killing me, and it's really spearheaded into this fear of a tumor. I sleep awfully too because of my anxiety and grind my teeth severely, as well as holding my shoulders up and tight all the time. 

EVERY rational part of me says it's all a mental thing, but I cannot get that rational part of my brain to win over, I'm in constant states of terror and get these huge adrenaline rushes physically crashing over me daily.

Should I see a doctor? Should I be hugely worried from the point of view of a Tumour? I've finally after years managed to bring myself to see a therapist, I start next week, I've  just always felt myself as being a drama queen, but my life isn't even enjoyable anymore, I'm so sickly worried all the time. Thanks 

Edit; my mum also suffers from severe anxiety and depression, not sure if this has an impact, my dad is due for huge open heart surgery this year, could it be affecting my subconscious? Table death rate is quite high.",12.848321437361555,8.388464811715483,11.841572729510215,60.24496062023138,56.74058577405858,15.347477233571254,45.69086881614571,12.827911418992354,5.6879023873984735,2052,84,351,49,17,667,256,478,0.206,0.735,0.059,-0.9962,2,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,2,0,0,4,17,24,2,4,26,1,30,25,11,3,9,62,53,31,8,5,13,7,4,2,4,2,13,2,1,1,17,23,1,2,7,3,1,6,7,13,1,2,14,9,45,11,56,33,16,63,0,5,3,1,17,24,0,5,34,231,62,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012334787809661,0.0,0.0,0.056001702838203625,0.1165385119829093,0.0,0.0,0.09524345508428778,0.0,0.4285724020777041,0.0,0.06944937626662241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05847080630502718,0.08537735071689219,0.0,0.05958902829051106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2345246323109331,0.0,0.0,0.0713986421870834,0.07193847841003892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567584486633867,0.0,0.055911995769313036,0.0,0.0,0.04516253812946552,0.0,0.06031537624833187,0.0,0.2180353342832149,0.0,0.0,0.07167705607908115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07165655712482641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046253111505294486,0.0,0.11800392970275705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15760288499015854,0.035408473690911865,0.05002831783420707,0.06723826592090285,0.0767127120585001,0.0,0.05956613898505205,0.0,0.0,0.1623113526637165,0.0,0.1097608787035892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05600812535676405,0.0,0.07714420061962965,0.0,0.1238518025373804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0744369366670617,0.0,0.165968031717536,0.0,0.07398887143534816,0.07024421586220371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21927443217881795,0.0,0.0,0.07747607207607739,0.0,0.0,0.05708250954631575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892628923915617,0.06842469829199373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057217733757044,0.0,0.0,0.08201644011130341,0.055896017397422636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05401023526028842,0.0,0.0744760200091801,0.06571692909483097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745151771352617,0.0,0.0777582740282674,0.15166791108096925,0.06685005156444007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13239898574304218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07448384552277043,0.0,0.0,0.13458599869414908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07932854957705514,0.0,0.0,0.05568941098003586,0.0,0.0,0.11160716958464313,0.0,0.0,0.23733654822552294,0.0,0.05792823336536885,0.0,0.0700789945193057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486994300960534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07659972631679238,0.0,0.06600095788116342,0.07278634264714277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06447276128638314,0.0,0.08130839402518099,0.04652377112079897,0.0,0.0,0.1667842316685706,0.204170676701812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05778078115533102,0.0,0.0,0.11234515028325012,0.0,0.06296396040256892,0.06491704769532357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21335178184381606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0901920140867609

healthanxiety,Relaxable,2018/01/28,"Sharp headache everytime I move or cough Figured I could come here for enlightenment since I'm currently kind of on holiday. I'm 23, female, and about a month ago I contracted one of the worst flus I'd ever experienced in my life - in fact I'm pretty sure I've never gotten any kind of flu before this one, I'm almost never sick. 

I only fully recovered about a week or two ago, and I've noticed for the past few days a sharp pain on the top of my head everytime I cough or move/change elevation. I figured it may be because I've been sleeping a lot and not drinking enough water perhaps, but I don't know. I took a pain killer a few days ago for the same kind of headache but it didn't help. Naps make it go away but not fully, I can still feel some kind of pressure/light pain when coughing and moving. I'm also currently on my period, which started a few days ago. Not sure if there's any correlation. Is this normal after a flu and a somewhat consistent cough? I haven't really gotten out of the house much the last couple of days either. Maybe I should?

One notable thing in my medical history (that I still have I believe) is iron deficiency. Not sure if that could also be a testament to whatever this is.",2.4456651884700658,4.379429922764228,4.216437546193646,84.74886917960093,77.00813008130079,7.562158167036216,24.189948263119,8.438071523408619,1.5974861788617891,955,32,194,19,22,322,132,246,0.121,0.8170000000000001,0.062,-0.9582,2,0,1,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,1,10,11,0,0,16,0,15,16,2,1,7,43,29,16,0,6,13,0,3,0,0,2,12,0,0,0,10,7,2,0,5,3,0,5,9,4,0,4,5,4,17,7,23,18,11,37,1,0,0,0,1,9,0,10,23,123,27,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33650213903689163,0.0,0.0950313649379541,0.0,0.0,0.15178734103841945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12907420726405094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08916422900313722,0.0,0.0,0.0578518169691309,0.0,0.08075522440283317,0.1069228663236058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10039449360918416,0.08175028961238227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1515441984772264,0.10500805407926324,0.0,0.2448176119580901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929685352948665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09805987836854442,0.0,0.0,0.08584494309639301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0479856665010719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393540254184639,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739756967107263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0636112924362113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10950499645239303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39530631345826095,0.05215605273211051,0.07735838291264173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06703259740954504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0806828983894205,0.0,0.0,0.06334830221669809,0.0,0.09534253755845776,0.0,0.0,0.09560450565208263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07575044530256796,0.3025997154038591,0.06976441850001237,0.0,0.14638965573429044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09298451538227256,0.0,0.10804737519372644,0.0,0.0,0.1929256165617706,0.07217779468144285,0.3029495541513879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09059538425611448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09655018390361064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060797112252716064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850451029128419,0.0,0.09497125713715697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06717263334360266,0.0,0.15157886881195484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26833407008303384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06304914989735519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10544041331962158,0.0,0.0,0.09270616707446154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07612523716164185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Herman-Toothrot,2018/01/28,"Wheezing / constricted airways after exercising in the cold I've been doing the Couch-to-5K running program for about a month.  It's been in the 40s and 50s a lot lately when I go running.  I'm able to complete my runs fine, but I notice after getting home that the deepest parts of my lungs feel tight or constricted.  I can force a deep breath, but when I do I hear this wheezing like the airways are stretching back open.  Usually after about 30 - 60 min or so it's back to normal.

I tried wearing a neck gaiter after the first time and it got a lot better, but was still there.  I went to the doctor and described all this and he listened to my lungs.  He said my lungs sounded perfect.  And that it's normal to have that wheezing after exercising in the cold, since your airways constrict and forcing them open creates a spasm that makes that wheezing sound.  He also said as long as it's only that and not actual shortness of breath, then it's nothing to worry about and to continue running (preferably when it stops being cold).

Anyway - just wondering if anyone else can relate to this or can offer any other support.  It is an irrational thing at this point, since I've been to the doctor and described exactly what was going on to him.  Knowing the way my anxiety works, I suspect the reasons I haven't dropped it are that he didn't hear it actually doing it (and to me it sounds strange) and that I secretly worry it's a small start to a bigger lung issue (I've had a couple relatives pass away after getting pulmonary fibrosis - which definitely is in my head when anything lung-related is going on).  Any tips or other support would be fantastic!

PS - I refuse to google it (or anything else for that matter) but if anyone has support for pulmonary fibrosis worries that would help too.  I believe for my relatives that started with gradually dropping oxygen levels and some strange sounds the doctors could hear in their breathing.  So nothing like what I'm describing here .. if only health anxiety used the rational side of the brain!",6.740863933318317,7.128551002590675,6.851590448299168,75.8317402568146,64.88082901554404,9.200090110385224,35.17639107907186,8.964715089967882,3.1393423293534592,1621,71,281,24,23,520,195,386,0.052000000000000005,0.825,0.123,0.9853,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,1,2,4,18,8,0,0,24,0,26,21,11,3,3,56,51,34,0,9,14,0,2,2,0,2,10,10,1,0,35,15,0,6,7,2,0,9,3,0,0,1,11,15,24,8,41,35,5,56,0,0,0,0,18,19,0,12,27,197,59,5,0.09152193306334463,0.0,0.17862440894452156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07319005680479303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12447610580777445,0.0,0.1400280565738237,0.0,0.0,0.1279885271776546,0.0937750359850647,0.15062950547410012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08598786883081883,0.14074943442786253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10311387769781424,0.0,0.08094371234352718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10216874541923594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09595900553927264,0.0,0.0,0.07307281634360807,0.10126727815960278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28102972982008145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15290966247295731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046276239283226564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07784850950967978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09563286519422773,0.0,0.1560420710510216,0.0,0.07319845055845486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09392790740131962,0.09728353508780173,0.3094556105216346,0.0,0.06134522253280901,0.0,0.0918039611048325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955251199734246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050298060906287786,0.0,0.1032407269102608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942598708668995,0.0,0.0,0.0809940307337842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1556173492703149,0.0,0.0,0.06109160099923981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305193380098816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1793441249114998,0.1756355262689276,0.10419832739590587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13921310846185433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09910933476033308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08651780924793281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09409979014554504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17411663331005545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15141577758311794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12955939056607926,0.0,0.07308953396808754,0.07651643412183946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31157401516892386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06080310559381004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053367175169125584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06213738489254316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904556494696083,0.1007984791479639,0.0,0.0,0.07264585047035357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08484174886873133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09925163234291486,0.06662905729107682,0.2788348968185339,0.0,0.1300291107113164,0.0,0.0,0.0

Now just in the past few minutes i’ve started to feel a very strong burning sensation in my throat. Not sure if its related or not, but its really freaking me out. Could it be due to acid?

healthanxiety,NormaJeanCalia,2018/01/28,"Appreciate the trigger So we have this patch of yard that’s just covered in leafs and overgrowth. Me and the neighbor agree to clear the patch on his land and mine. He’s cutting and burning for 2 days before I get a chance to go help. I start clearing my land. Removing leafs, burning them, cutting down growth and burning mine. Day 2 a family friend comes to help and says oh my gosh have you been burning this poison ivy/sumacs?! I look confused because there’s nothing with leaf of 3 and so on. The friend goes on and on about how burning it can infect your lungs and it’s highly dangerous. Well me and the neighbor have been burning it for days now. 

So of course I’m googling symptoms of poisoning in the lungs from ivy/sumac. And I don’t know if I’m making up symptoms or my throat just hurts from the smoke in general. 

**Edit/Update**
Called dr on demand for video chat about what to watch for and so on. Breathing problems. Told me to take antihistamines and keep some handy. I did but anxiety is still peaking pretty hard ",2.359424799622822,4.817343693069309,2.8238048090523336,91.94988448844887,79.89108910891089,5.431777463460631,24.47053276756247,6.655083550727371,0.7872156529938708,814,30,163,8,21,251,122,202,0.1,0.7879999999999999,0.113,0.5633,0,0,1,0,0,0,24.0,1,2,1,0,13,11,5,1,9,0,9,10,4,3,2,32,21,21,0,2,5,0,1,0,4,0,6,1,3,0,7,16,0,1,1,3,0,4,1,8,1,0,4,4,18,3,29,17,1,24,0,1,2,0,16,14,0,4,6,100,25,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14099954433173673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11235597522352868,0.0,0.15683745934923107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882049864007009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15877000923075946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3566014386132927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17375463705258368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848007528187649,0.0,0.0962963476424138,0.0,0.10474977397678399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16510895230241882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2470832956106881,0.19473763793333668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19731172352287607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1638265646441835,0.0,0.0,0.1012940383817663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15477716240485187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12303088558324435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1768540518115921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18751338572977894,0.0,0.17636340424697214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14657372307168207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13045824873020198,0.0,0.1471932302293457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3831451991613792,0.13858103142565667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1761197242778886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16572023178429654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Crooklord,2018/01/29,"Hantavirus anxiety Hello folks. 

I am trying to ease some of my fear of hantavirus. I work in a place that does have a deer mice presence. Recently I went into a utility closet to grab a dolly. I noticed rodent droppings on the floor. I didn't mess with them at all but I did definitely breathe while I was in there. Does anyone have any understand of hantavirus on a deeper level? I know it is extremely rare and caused by kicking up dust that has been contaminated. But what are the odds that I get hantavirus assuming the mouse excrement in that closet was even infectious? 

I seem to be the only person at my work who has any real concern over it and it's driving me nuts.

healthanxiety,kman43759,2018/01/29,"Anybody else feel this way? It scares me how there is just a ridiculously large amount of small things that you could do without knowing that you shouldnt, and a large amount of things that could happen to you and its like fuck the human body is just so fragile and I worry that my immense future potential is going to be FUCKED by something stupid like this.  About every month something feels wrong with me and I freak out.  Sometimes it is just something normal that I wasnt previously aware of, but now that I am aware of it I feel like something wrong

My psychological speculation is that perhaps I was coddled to much when I was younger so now I just have a poor sense of safety.

healthanxiety,WesterosiAssassin,2018/01/29,"Scared about temporal arteritis Adding to all the cancers and heart conditions I've been worried about, I just read about temporal arteritis and I'm worried about it too. I'm a 23 year old white male. For the past couple days I've had tenderness near my right temple only. There's no constant pain, but it hurts when I put mild to moderate pressure on a certain part of the bone behind/under the temple. I can feel a slight bump there but there's an essentially symmetrical one on the other side (with no tenderness with the same amount of pressure). I do have many other symptoms of temporal arteritis, including frequent headaches (although generally mild), tiredness in limbs, and general tiredness, but I've had all that for a long time and often can be traced to specific causes like poor sleeping habits and dehydration. I don't have any of the jaw pain or tiredness (any more so than I would normally get after chewing for a long time anyway), although sometimes my mouth does feel slightly stiff if I haven't opened it for a while. I do have a bad habit of clenching/grinding my teeth that I've had for most of my life, and I've had TMJ-associated pain before. I don't *think* I've had any vision loss, but sometimes I do find it harder to focus or I feel like I'm not seeing quite as well when I' tired so I can't say for sure. I don't have any other tender points on my scalp, just the right temple.",5.8177557544757015,6.258359807971015,6.175822676896846,79.70182864450129,66.86231884057972,9.247740835464619,31.09036658141517,9.168548406835145,2.5391788576300085,1121,41,216,19,17,361,145,276,0.163,0.765,0.07200000000000001,-0.976,0,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,2,17,17,0,3,16,0,22,22,10,1,4,37,31,21,0,3,10,0,3,2,0,1,11,1,0,1,9,9,1,1,5,1,1,1,8,9,1,1,6,6,19,8,30,23,7,25,0,2,2,0,2,10,0,5,16,135,28,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33493499654418746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280979039651024,0.0,0.0,0.10477597104646792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12649012993248382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13306157791291107,0.0,0.0,0.13624283648784988,0.0,0.0794097323481846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1077533428252386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867771964405086,0.08796528037586865,0.0,0.0,0.11254010379555868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06433120871969561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459116064210508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13181498550628554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08697153078687532,0.12031181599661812,0.0,0.0,0.21793528346566812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1248361739375492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12064288055053735,0.0,0.0,0.1292059610652634,0.0,0.08343719746710229,0.09364717368645496,0.3930622934804522,0.0,0.0,0.1333395854571135,0.11754309926020425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163992155499179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12378132449403452,0.0,0.1309656738129108,0.1231649781921728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21030752462528104,0.0,0.09791923580281373,0.12327626916533625,0.0,0.0981199887332356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12322058122719197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2435607145164144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11605012953529098,0.12798093791017112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07889779397814425,0.0,0.0,0.1435981188104274,0.14152172634265153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110710147175886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2500923493074164,0.0,0.08746919632510394,0.0,0.0,0.0792927500890453

For a very, very long time, I've had the habit of pacing around, whether it be riding in circles on a bike or just walking up and down. However, I strain my jaw when doing this, like opening it as wide as possible. I'm not sure why but it helps me visualise things better, and I'm worried that there's something wrong with me for doing so 

It's very hard to explain but I just get the urge to stand up and pace like that, so I'm just confused

healthanxiety,throwaway459102,2018/01/29,"Is this health anxiety? Hi.

To start off for the past few months, i've been fucking worrying about my mouth. *All started with a load of canker sores in my mouth.*

I recently quit using chewing tobacco, and i have a feeling it stems from that.

I always worry about my mouth, for example..

I check my mouth to make sure everything is okay.

...

Everything going go-

OHGODWHATTHEFUCKISTHAT??

*Insert hours of worrying and pacing*

Another example, i was out in the garage and had an urge to check a mirror quick, noticed something on the roof of my mouth.

*insert the hugest adrenaline rush ever once i noticed it.*

I thought that was the end for me, i instantly messaged my mother at like 2 in the morning fucking shaking.

Why is this happening? Even the littlest thing in my mouth worries me to no end, and i'm sick of it. I have this feeling there is something wrong with my mouth, but whenever i post pictures of the ""problem"" on dentistry i realized how stupid it was.

healthanxiety,RossMorgone,2018/01/30,"Anxiety or genuine heart condition? For the past year or so I have had crippling health anxiety, with it all being related to my heart. The anxiety comes in waves and is usually when I am on my own and not keeping myself busy. The symptoms are so raw and debilitating that I sometimes genuinely think I have a undiagnosed heart condition. Common symptoms include the following:

- Floating/sinking chest feeling

- Sudden twinges and sharp pierces that go after 1/2 seconds 

- Increase in heart rate

- Cold shivers 

- Restlessness (have to get up and walk around)

- Panic attacks

- Strange tingling an aching that is always on the left side of chest and resonates to left arm  and shoulder blade

- Dizziness/lightheadednesss 


I have recently taken up running as a form of exercise three times a week to aid in the alleviation of these symptoms. More often than not, this gives miraculous results and I feel fantastic after every run. Occasionally however, the anxiety kicks in half way through the run and it is a real struggle to continue. Afterwards I have to sit down and try not to panic and think that my heart is going to give out on me. 

Is there anything I can do to combat this anxiety? I am planning to get a blood test and ECG done just to rule out any conditions. I am a 22 y/o male with no family history of heart conditions. I have lightly smoked on and off between the ages of 18-21 but quit around 4 months ago. Any help would be appreciated :)",6.406280922431865,7.750204724528308,6.8052515723270455,72.49420859538785,65.90566037735849,10.266247379454928,36.60901467505241,10.380263240014207,4.136593291404613,1152,58,195,29,18,374,163,265,0.08,0.847,0.07200000000000001,0.7587,1,0,1,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,0,2,8,5,1,4,16,0,22,17,11,1,1,37,36,20,0,1,7,0,3,0,0,1,6,0,0,1,9,20,0,1,4,1,0,9,4,5,0,3,3,5,16,0,41,30,5,46,0,0,0,0,4,19,0,3,16,137,25,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08115136575396018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07617488250092641,0.0,0.0,0.12451092564305047,0.0,0.3501680669326355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07533582061403048,0.16299342998326752,0.0,0.10414853683000264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07886009487861573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09368491251309304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07713274630684618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08630286809173758,0.0,0.09257836837106392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09565961667871087,0.17564147416544412,0.10405714724519108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0973107483159538,0.0,0.6509056156567747,0.061362382698044775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0813716551008113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989333283981204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07307236869718806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2148226136517696,0.0,0.0,0.08739248058785741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09737207184773856,0.0,0.104201136672065,0.0,0.0,0.09039214603308103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054285257623317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09570536025671736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2854588240991812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11731992727869416,0.0,0.0,0.05338210362657112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06215476665020984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10082667561520743,0.0,0.0,0.07266617177242557,0.07343391018782301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06503274194732042,0.0,0.0,0.05895361077365111

I feel like a lot of times im looking for a reason I feel tired, despite nothing being wrong with me. I have Essential Tremor (or BFS, but I was technically diagnosed with ET). I worried about Parkinsons for awhile but it's pretty clear I don't have that or MS (Just slightly twitches every now and agan). 

However my main problem is my legs will feel slightly sore or ill feel tired and just run down, and I keep looking for reasons that may be....but maybe it's the OCD/Anxiety itself making me tired?

Is that possible?

healthanxiety,happyflowercake1992,2018/01/30,"I lost my Dad two years ago and now my Health Anxiety is at its worst... I’ve always been a ""worrier"" my mum says, but in the 2 years since my Dad died suddenly from a heart attack i have had debilitating Health Anxiety. I’ve been on 2 different anti depressants/anti anxiety tablets and will feel perfect and then come off them after 6 months, feel really good for a while and stable for a few months and then in a matter of 5 mins of feeling something weird happening in my body I spiral into a deep anxious state and the panic attacks start again. This past week I’ve convinced myself I have a brain tumor, meningitis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, you name it. It is exhausting and I am just so over it. I miss my carefree, worry free life :( and my dad :( ",5.035600000000001,5.902910693333332,5.993333333333332,78.81000000000002,68.73333333333333,9.466666666666667,29.666666666666664,9.642632912329526,2.7052666666666663,604,22,115,13,10,200,99,150,0.28300000000000003,0.573,0.14400000000000002,-0.9746,1,1,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,2,4,12,2,1,9,0,9,8,4,0,1,18,17,13,1,0,2,4,3,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,5,10,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,8,0,1,4,4,16,5,14,12,2,28,0,2,0,0,8,10,0,0,16,72,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1368872488268652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12849284788226353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3544010099947646,0.17445477018227218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513583916560711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17152986344626367,0.0,0.17238786498659397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13302230134842158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1602673689256202,0.16133984743110488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23424371289604415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12952323150483722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13655632419361596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3282902387284685,0.0,0.18299276942825146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10907399123671534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1685716564144868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2465189691704551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18118288149175288,0.0,0.0,0.14741484785477238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09892774478892682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1228038850326149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12774083950885168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11888287065400292,0.0,0.0,0.1093018546768101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15084946795794935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12386933778399972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15682471304071394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19888753595797928
healthanxiety,anetanetanet,2018/01/30,"Should I be worried about my nose? Hey guys, so on Saturday evening my boyfriend accidentally head butted me right in the nose pretty hard. Leaving aside the dumbness of the situation, it hurt like a motherfucker and it even made a crickly noise when the impact ensued. My head hurt all night and the next day.

Fortunately there was no bleeding, but it's tuesday and my nose still feels pretty uncomfortable. I'm way too aware of it too, so I constantly notice the pressure my glasses put on my nose and every time i rub my nose a little harder, it hurts :( 

Should I go to a doctor? Could something be broken in there even tho there was no bleeding? I'd like to know I can stop worrying about it if it's no big deal ",4.578214285714285,5.815217535714287,5.210000000000001,82.64500000000002,70.07142857142857,7.885714285714287,28.285714285714285,8.238735603445708,1.8083714285714287,565,20,112,8,10,182,86,140,0.276,0.654,0.07,-0.9832,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,0,15,7,1,1,10,0,8,10,7,1,1,15,13,11,0,4,3,0,3,2,0,2,3,0,0,1,7,4,0,1,2,0,0,2,3,5,0,0,3,8,13,2,10,5,1,20,0,3,0,0,3,7,1,1,12,72,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566143616556994,0.0,0.1157122400387254,0.0,0.0,0.093465782805467,0.14941314518571333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14833869913196485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871683115974197,0.0,0.12210706174409612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327933390237533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0823652282069417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1435002963258448,0.0,0.0,0.12982592724650474,0.0,0.29747337276421754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4654413423212321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0796479674425455,0.0,0.0,0.15345653292953676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14160780713333174,0.14525470594612686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1371332222434704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1541312733672974,0.13600396425488587,0.0,0.0,0.16500009818389086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29488527222813016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1456914416964025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237666771926306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16290377151767815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11157171476948566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11573871272547047,0.12116527643303412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450797016391079,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150361311915988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29436035748344075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,idiotdidntdoit,2018/01/30,"I looked into my DLP projector for a second. Will I go blind? I got this new fancy DLP projector and was as stupid as I possibly could be. I tried to see what was blocking the light and leaving a shadow on my wall. Of course I looked directly into the lens for a second and it left a first white dot that then became green and black. 

I could see it for ten minutes or so. And it’s pretty much gone but it feels like I’ve lost some center focus. 

Can this repair itself or have I permanent vision damage now ?

I’ll go see a doctor tomorrow. Just wonder if anyone has tried something like that. A google search didn’t really yield any results which makes me think i might just be worrying too much. 

I’m writing this in the dark on my phone and there aren’t any noticeable visual artifacts but I have an issue with looking at faces on tv. It looks like there’s something blocking some of the information.

My mom is an anti vaccine person so i don't have vaccines and i'm only 16 so I don't have one. This time around I got a splinter from the wood handle of an incense stick.

healthanxiety,-shannon-m-,2018/01/30,"Does anyone ever read something about cancer and get scared? So I’ve had like a larger swollen node on my neck like right by my jaw on the side for like 3 years this April, showed my doc longggg time ago. It hurts when I think about it or feel it. I have another smaller one on my head and the same spot in my neck on the left. I get really obsessive when it even gets a little bigger, like it is now because I’ve been having some throat normal winter stuff going on. I told my therapist a long time ago and they never got bigger I never had symptoms but they showed up years ago when I had a bad cold. Also, I think they’d show up from physicals that I’ve had over the years? Since I had blood work done etc. I just read some post where a girl had lymphoma that they didn’t even catch from a biopsy and my heart literally dropped it scared me that much. But she also had more nodes showing up. This stuff scares me so much and I can’t talk to friends about it because they just don’t understand. It’s been 3 years I think I’m fine, I mean swollen nodes seem really common actually. I just need someone to tell me I’m okay and reassure me cause hypochondria is a bitch ",2.1878130511463816,3.9034348477366265,3.053721340388009,93.77888888888893,77.06584362139918,6.2746619635508525,20.624926513815407,7.07126945348624,0.2447222810111693,920,22,207,10,21,291,132,243,0.107,0.813,0.081,-0.8492,2,0,1,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,5,1,18,15,1,4,11,1,18,11,7,1,3,28,34,16,0,2,6,0,1,4,1,0,4,0,0,1,15,6,0,0,7,6,0,2,5,7,0,1,13,2,30,8,19,20,7,41,0,1,0,0,12,17,1,4,24,126,45,3,0.0,0.0,0.10533877480860653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2870602594362763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17264719771604697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11318977240241952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07547767252033039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012958843346243,0.13160457274199194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11088927725405544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944634202998841,0.11046524003391342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038723875732568,0.14259334417219474,0.0976424566257762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054580248888146166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08339805986451496,0.0,0.1691904635629958,0.0,0.06134764627163339,0.0,0.08633349882334188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11078273954221206,0.0,0.0,0.12791537638268596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555738366185404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11728258735990454,0.0,0.0,0.21094595014028406,0.10818927493631464,0.0,0.09552795180369016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11758377925272866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15870402988702495,0.08003986953668044,0.16650771839230627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10576320727346204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314634373582699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10338149682379913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2159484763282566,0.0,0.13830469639760773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09218446300606524,0.0,0.0,0.3242154086872344,0.0,0.0,0.0982690981822645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08929324156505378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09146147083388292,0.08310135527580698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24714245991600026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11219621416097904,0.0,0.08676212358204688,0.0943487112114538,0.0,0.0,0.1253324958688878,0.0,0.20750044345386467,0.0,0.0,0.12588722628737675,0.0,0.0,0.10314609890091174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11237457968768777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0785852650616678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780522323300302
healthanxiety,Miss_Cathy_Linton,2018/01/30,"DAE get anxiety from medication side effects like drowsiness? So latest health crisis was a fear that i had a kidney infection. my only symptom started last Wednesday with severe lower back pain and my whole back started to feel tense because well i don't know why. Its like i was being very careful not to strain the parts that hurt and as a result tensed up everything else. lower back was even spasming, and i thought for sure kidney. after that thought won, i started getting chills and teeth chattered (this happens when i am terrified during panic attacks too). so last thursday headed straight to my dr. they did not find an infection but saw a little bit of WBC in my urine so they loaded me with antibiotics, muscle relaxers, and a shot of toradol. and prednisone for inflammation. NO fever, nothing, just intense anxiety and lower back pain. I lift weights and mostly do glute work and increased weights last week plus i wear super high heels. anyway, the pain has lessened, but 1) i didn't take the prednisone but today i felt my back tight and painful again so I took HALF a muscle relaxer bc i don't like the out of control drowsiness that it causes. This is the first time ive ever taken one. but i looked up side effects. anyway i took the half at 2 and i feel so sleepy but like scared to sleep. my anxiety has been at a 7 every since i took it. I don't know why? maybe the lack of control, or the fear that ill have a bad reaction??",3.2649545078577304,5.572529745519713,3.8208064516129054,86.78197890818859,75.91756272401433,6.156106975461812,26.859801488833746,7.1686216300943375,1.4162813895781636,1145,45,213,13,26,360,162,279,0.227,0.664,0.109,-0.9879,3,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,2,8,19,23,1,5,17,0,18,22,8,6,2,43,40,25,0,1,9,0,6,4,0,0,12,0,0,0,10,15,2,3,10,2,0,4,7,12,1,4,16,8,27,11,22,23,6,37,0,1,2,0,2,11,0,2,26,140,37,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20492145335265166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158107657040248,0.0,0.3432952339128237,0.07455401575798856,0.054430789935722416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974823326068106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103783291350201,0.0917261586065496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20029425455693212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745909332560605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05897567387787581,0.08076856198340435,0.07523127685864939,0.0,0.08024873543055225,0.0,0.0,0.20095375305352187,0.09029613485222623,0.0,0.08573308722400534,0.0,0.08161009413034022,0.07595063494365205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09330142450677416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07895948270199638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09163803200588888,0.09491185259703486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09434054078423867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09558755512167864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09814368152525864,0.21835154593322206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744917286785667,0.0894927520322806,0.0,0.0,0.07498171055829582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08970452279056748,0.0,0.0,0.0899509995828446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567684739762978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06050569805437419,0.06790961090168744,0.3800464567819015,0.10476341305703316,0.0,0.09669314096443034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08939558069802743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10087309020530777,0.0,0.07386220057620158,0.0,0.08935519777922248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18960127891432765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08415544037899701,0.09280723970818372,0.06713550388040293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14177370465454026,0.05206613286205821,0.0,0.08463715552415642,0.0,0.2976158030368405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07367418958258944,0.0,0.0,0.07162362411129343,0.2174640669808833,0.08028307445513873,0.0,0.16114196057086075,0.09968989241435523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06500470257975875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,ManCityYank,2018/01/30,Health Anxiety and Xanax My health anxiety involves fear of having a heart attack or stroke. Ive been to the Emergency Rooms more times that I can count thinking im dying. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me Zoloft daily and Xanax (.5 mg) to take only in emergencies. Ive been taking the Zoloft for the past week and a half noticing no improvement but ive heard it takes a while for it to actually kick in. I still haven't taken any of the Xanax and it makes me anxious to think about the side effects and hearing stories of people getting addicted to it/dying from it. Anyone have any good experiences with it? I would hate for it to make my panic attacks worse. Ive been thinking about taking 1 pill just to know what its going to feel like when im actually having an emergency.,5.350000000000001,5.946413713375797,6.1661210191082825,78.81797133757964,67.9171974522293,9.082547770700637,29.712738853503183,9.120678840339163,2.4030336305732494,631,22,121,11,10,208,95,157,0.201,0.745,0.054000000000000006,-0.9704,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,5,7,3,2,10,0,13,11,1,3,0,19,31,10,1,1,3,0,2,1,0,1,10,2,1,0,9,7,0,0,6,0,0,2,2,5,0,1,6,4,12,2,21,24,1,12,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,1,7,76,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.256135431816058,0.1430669585056146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17849039389548374,0.0,0.2007908490716926,0.14825968510934645,0.0,0.09176348537654676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986005166441075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13620257918651332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.128374301887006,0.0,0.14767734431758714,0.0663570259051989,0.0937552522454551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06856555990043386,0.0,0.07458462421474721,0.11007479759474947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1295686946997657,0.0,0.2789961396154526,0.14791286905154274,0.15551566944471407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2835154887531229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0721240485881397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641154362759588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17520252349313115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941341857903953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09981113404665626,0.0,0.15397754345785727,0.0,0.0,0.12527991582320006,0.09098273913860087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10480549357599264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3946935161679863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2522728016470947,0.0,0.0,0.0765249527627138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526985874545763,0.0,0.0,0.12165738216254313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13374102050767306,0.09322651539478337,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Graham_Mumm,2018/01/31,"Anyone here tried sulforaphane or broccoli sprouts for anxiety and/or general health? There's been some interesting studies about sulforaphane (naturally occurring chemical in broccoli family of plants) for it's ability to help those with anxiety and depression. Apparently it works by activating the body's NRF2 system.

Anyone tried it? Did it help? What about as a general health food?

This study was especially interesting: “Sulforaphane alleviated depressive symptoms &amp; anxiety as well as prozac in animals” - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432815303399

Some other studies listed here about mood/depression. Tons of other apparent benefits too.

healthanxiety,cball_sohard,2018/01/31,"Skin on back and arms feels like it's burning? Hello all. I'm new to the subreddit but I wanted to see if anyone could help put my mind at ease. For the last couple of months my mom's health has not been the best.To make things worse, I've been smoking weed and it's pretty much been giving me panic attacks everyday. I stopped smoking weed a couple days ago to see if it would help. Anyways,  In the beginning of last week she was admitted to the hospital and, among other things, it really stressed me out. That Monday I woke up in the middle of the night sweating, hungry and cold. I was pacing back and forth and I started googling my symptoms (I know, bad idea) and I came across peripheral neuropathy. I googled the causes of that MS was one of the results and I started to freak out. I googled relentlessly for the next week because the burning on my back and arms has not stopped since and it's put all my senses on high alert. I also feel like cold electricity going up the back of my head I I'ven really anxious ever since and it's started to affect me. I went to the hospital and got a CT scan on my neck and they found nothing. I read online that one of the ways to diagnose MS was to do an MRI of the brain and spine to look for lesions so I'm not surprised that the CT scan came back clear. I haven't been back to the hospital but the symptoms just haven't stopped. Now I'm also getting twitches all over and my muscles feel weak but I think that's just the anxiety playing tricks on me. I went to the doctor this morning and explained to her all my symptoms. She did some basic strength tests and she told me that the burning skin can be a symptom of anxiety. I've also googled burning skin and anxiety can cause that but it still hasn't really made me feel better. I had some blood work done and she prescribed me muscle relaxers and an antidepressant and told me to come back in 3 weeks. Could all my symptoms really just be from anxiety? The burning also at times can feel like my skin is cold but when I touch it, it's not. I have noticed that my symptoms do go down a bit if I calm down a bit. Anyone else experience something similar?

Ive used some oxymethoziline and zicam but the top part of my nostril is still clogged. It feels like somethings stuck in there. Ive used my neti pot 3-4 times since then but nothing comes out. No mucus, no pressure just a nagging swelling.

Is this just a common cold coming on? Nasal Polyps? I really dont wanna go see an ENT because I just saw one 3-4 months ago for allergies and they said my sinuses were healthy.

If I lift up my nose and look inside it seems like the top of my nostril is more swollen on one side then the other.",3.2039907072792966,5.216083637583896,3.6893959731543617,89.02569953536396,75.04026845637584,6.4638100154878675,27.568921011874032,7.321109707123232,1.4498927207021173,598,24,118,7,13,187,98,149,0.07400000000000001,0.7929999999999999,0.133,0.7959,0,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,2,6,5,1,1,8,0,12,11,6,2,1,20,26,9,0,2,6,0,1,3,0,0,5,1,0,0,7,7,0,0,2,1,0,3,4,2,0,5,6,12,12,3,14,20,3,24,0,0,3,0,2,10,0,3,14,76,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14444167617709774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09933028582615723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723751174642214,0.28072686594794266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1909713381672665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14739386213305686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08239032443273897,0.11640855726132128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09260588917179746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2388213542060952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13683348616261198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13006183344902816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15635095045911476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5520816700390944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1764544909373508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1043872924629073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15499883017451074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12984675633531464,0.14833979408085568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.269581003826954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12544368634165448,0.0,0.0,0.2306678413670556,0.0,0.13012877687429406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09501504323487232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28146581666197834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,darkandtwisty_,2018/01/31,"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.

As a preface, I’m a 24 year old woman.

About a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.

I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.

I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didn’t think it was anything to worry about.

Again, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.

I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didn’t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didn’t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. 

That day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. 

When I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. It’s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.

Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.

I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. It’s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but it’s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.

I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, I’m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been – but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).

Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. I’m struggling to meet deadlines at work. I’m letting my house go to shit. 


 I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. I’m so depressed. I’m missing out on so much. 

Any words of advice would be so appreciated.

healthanxiety,KokoroCorrect,2018/01/31,"Fear of TIA To preface this I have a long history with hypochondria, I have for years and it was getting better but recently it's been worse. I haven't had the outbursts I used to have but I guess that's because I keep it to myself 

Basically after walking home today I sat down and watched my laptop on my bed as I usually do, and my mum called, but when speaking to her it felt like I couldn't get the right word out, constantly mixing up my words and such, and she was asking basic questions about the day 

Of course this lead to google and then the whole ""mini-stroke"" and it's just scary honestly. I didn't have any muscle weakness but I have a mild tension headache now (pretty sure it was brought on by the stress) 

I'm 16 if that helps.

healthanxiety,businessofmonkeys,2018/01/31,Parasites from Africa (Bilharzia) I've always had health anxiety and now I'm a little freaked out after it turns out I have tested positive for Bilharzia after swimming in Africa a few years ago.  It says it can potentially damage bladder and genitals...my doctors don't seem to know much about it and aren't too worried.  Are there tests that can see if there is any damage such as scarring to male genital tract?  I know there are tests for the bladder but not sure if it is worth getting all this checked out now that the parasite is gone,5.563186813186816,6.631740923076923,5.521593406593407,81.9376923076923,67.65384615384616,8.635164835164835,32.164835164835175,8.841846274778883,2.6094989010989003,432,18,81,7,7,135,71,104,0.092,0.848,0.059,-0.3297,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,8,4,0,0,4,0,11,4,2,0,2,15,19,7,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,8,6,0,0,3,1,2,2,3,3,0,0,2,2,2,1,13,17,3,13,0,2,1,0,2,5,0,3,6,55,10,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2426742089763315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277925846722452,0.0,0.0,0.1861680953155344,0.0,0.20942779671579725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2802078315251843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302976661457115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2909970602844299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.300905756529652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2743822509578817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20124716143130564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2177071707913632,0.0,0.0,0.21815351161655336,0.2492233761130454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2580182041246427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2977753191737955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2780194175224477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17629427093278666

healthanxiety,Hello_Destiny,2018/01/31,"Had a gas leak at work Hey all, first time asker here. But we had a gas leak at my work today and they did nothing no opening of doors, windows, nothing. We just stayed on the floor and worked. I know I tend to be anxiety focused with my health but my head has felt light and borderline headache after about 2 hours of breathing it in, and my chest/lungs have felt funny. Its been 7 hours since my shift ended but its not really gone away. Is this something to be concerned about?

I do not know what kind of gas it was, I'm currently at a factory to help a friend out.",1.6412587412587456,3.5800012222222213,2.5769852369852373,95.53139860139862,79.51282051282051,5.963947163947164,21.747474747474747,6.980632752743323,0.3765623931623941,441,13,100,5,11,139,81,117,0.04,0.833,0.127,0.9041,1,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,2,0,1,4,4,2,0,0,5,0,11,3,2,0,1,20,18,7,0,0,6,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,6,9,0,0,4,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,8,3,11,2,17,8,1,19,0,0,0,0,6,9,0,0,8,64,17,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14309794521126631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17574602752983232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16567680943028762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35920773792076016,0.0,0.0,0.1591104243130282,0.0,0.0,0.144519624925532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19197424967526855,0.1988326384664673,0.0,0.0,0.1253802346152655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36842654996344254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19479087921375865,0.20560305812732074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35897210216486297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11983338030460845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15473532358343609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14400546864967353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19937766735742626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10907432832084547,0.0,0.17730798087583108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4085387495765264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Snakethrowawayxx,2018/01/31,Pain in front of neck? Thyroid? Cancer? I’m legitimately freaking out. I have no health insurance and won’t for a couple months and I woke up this morning and noticed it hurt to bend my neck upwards. And I pressed where your thyroid is. Where I would have an Adam’s apple if I were a guy and it hurt so bad. It’s extremely tender and sore and every position I can feel it. Almost like it’s tight. I can’t tell if there’s a lump or anything but the pain scares me. It really is sore and like a 6 on pain scale. Everything I’ve read is saying get it checked it out and could be cancerous. I don’t know what to do or what to think. Haven’t had a health scare in over a year and now I can’t even function. ,-0.2579751461988309,1.855166111842106,1.9099122807017568,96.40994152046784,88.53947368421049,5.219883040935674,18.970760233918128,6.691623216298621,-0.0034178362573098475,547,16,130,7,18,183,92,152,0.249,0.722,0.029,-0.9854,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,1,0,0,6,12,0,2,8,0,17,15,2,0,0,24,23,16,0,4,5,0,3,2,0,2,13,1,0,1,11,12,0,1,3,1,1,1,6,9,0,0,3,4,12,3,12,16,0,14,0,2,0,0,4,10,0,5,5,82,23,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16173605994776993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13291482380241398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13486004476261193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12895827385859446,0.17871561605635108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1066805314001253,0.0,0.1360851358783954,0.0,0.1451611686141487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816679065792459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843860264096557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1599273379046547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433702815228173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3458148251679369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08876558257189314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15781820805390726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12892142052811134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18388830638117476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.515596795682875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16156082419896026,0.0,0.1034719999904936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12844489296747416,0.32341361875530794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1411730779916378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10349364575618313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11473712460903543,0.0,0.0,0.10401172675401377

The flu going around is quite severe, and for two days now i've been feeling a bit run down. My cough has not worsened in two days, and I have not run a fever. My glands in my neck are swollen, though. I am so worried that I have the flu. 
I never really worried about catching the flu, but since the strain this season seems to be killing many people, I am extremely worried. 
Do my symptoms sound like flu symptoms?

healthanxiety,kakaismeusenpai,2018/02/01,"Terrified of PCOS For the past 7 months, the fear of developing PCOS has taken over me, despite have no symptoms. I’ve always had normal periods. They always come every 28 days and last for 5. Not only that but I’ve always been skinny, I haven’t had a bad acne breakout since I was 14, I don’t get any facial hair aside from a little on my upper lip and I don’t think it’s possible for me to have diabetes. 

But I gained 3 pounds this month. And my period started yesterday and then completely stopped. So now I’m convinced I have it and I can’t think about anything else. 

The last time PCOS fears struck me I had two panic attacks in a row and was a state of high stress for a while. My period ended up coming a week and a half early which just made the anxiety worse. Eventually everything went back to normal but for some reason I’m convinced that won’t happen this time. 

I know PCOS is not a death sentence but I have never worried so much about an illness :/",2.188871968415114,4.14963188324873,3.8925465313028766,86.64821630005642,77.88324873096447,6.814326001128032,22.11195713479977,7.793537801064563,1.025774055273548,759,22,154,12,18,254,123,197,0.21,0.6990000000000001,0.091,-0.9757,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,1,1,7,8,1,4,13,0,17,7,4,2,1,26,30,15,1,2,7,0,1,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,7,9,1,1,4,0,0,3,9,6,0,2,9,1,17,2,17,20,2,33,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,1,22,97,24,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3376942802500687,0.0,0.0,0.09199582600338198,0.0,0.103489715110871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132486581778413,0.0,0.0,0.15390184633575588,0.0,0.10402285961368292,0.1129541157101956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.233065476932088,0.14183971967569592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872451549757947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11301004808763432,0.0,0.11981895185919562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11398020971669932,0.0,0.1215819812690399,0.0,0.0,0.3044578248942063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07067882120444333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11962868069360602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14293197021735882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0743469861852532,0.22054439799194409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13558725932472548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280063020695298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2159602583179958,0.0,0.09944721631990648,0.0,0.1043371683862171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26509362263575353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10288741618591674,0.0,0.15872329022559953,0.0,0.0,0.1291411720962208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525091785726228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13909156082618454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11190597133729822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09575269947814202,0.0,0.0,0.11310110505453065,0.1549641087054533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1406089207423918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17336540646403226,0.0,0.0,0.15776706153492942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13215003363414735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10851438441240124,0.0,0.0,0.12540698821031004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13738458201770365,0.13786305675747565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,RoutineGear,2018/02/01,"I need a little help. My first post and for some reason the first time opening up about my own internal struggle. Hey guys, I’ve been struggling with anxiety for the better part of 7 years. I’ve always been able to keep it under control but after having a near death experience in my teens, my anxious nature has been directed towards my health. For the past 9 months I’ve been experience various symptoms, consisting of brain fog, muscle twitches all over my body. sharp nerve pain that seems to come and go affecting everything from my legs, to my wrist and fingers. muscle buzzing (primarily in the feet, feels like a cell phone going off under my foot). This worry of ether a neurological disease or a serious infection such as Lyme seems to dominate most of my days. I constantly make the mistake of self diagnosing using discussion posts of users (on various sites) with similar issues and I realize it’s a recipe for unhappiness. This type of worry feels at times like an addiction that I simply cannot stop coming back to.

I live an incredibly charmed life with an amazing family and incredible fiancé. And I realize I’m not hard done by in the traditional sense. 

But this anxiety surrounding my health is something I’m desperate to manage but more importantly be done with. 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, and THANK YOU so much for taking the time out of your day to read this.

healthanxiety,nathan98900,2018/02/02,"Think Before You Post: why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety. Hey /r/healthanxiety, 

Just thought I'd make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive. 

So, you're experiencing your symptom that you're increasingly more worried about. Whether that be chest pains, heart palpitations, stomach problems, poop problems, any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about. 

You're worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified, or if it is actually a sign of the illness you're fearing.

Maybe you've already been to the doctor to get checked out, but doubt their opinion.

All of these have happened to me, and happen to many many other HA sufferers, which is completely okay. 

**However**, the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery.

Usually, what I would do, is post here, explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was. Then I'd get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit. Or I'd ask a close friend or family member and get the same results.

All of this felt like what I had to do, a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine. 

In the short term, yes, it made me feel better but this was only short lived.

This might also account for medical tests, I've spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT, colonoscopy or endoscopy, or whatever it might be, would make all their worries go away. Which, after the short term relief, the anxiety came back. This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety; I speak from experience.

One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance. Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety.

So, if you don't seek that reassurance, what's going to happen? For me, at first, it was unbareable anxiety, and just an extreme desire to check I was okay, whether that was through posting to the subreddit, the discord, asking family, checking my body for lumps, checking my lymph nodes etc. 

You'll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want, which is completely okay. Rather than seeking reassurance, do something mindful, something genuinely healthy for the mind. As, when in a very high anxiety situation, sometimes it's the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future. 

You can do many things, for me, it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else, not an easy task by any means, but something to try. After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry, which most times the anxiety had passed and I didn't need to seek further reassurance. 

You could possibly try meditation, though, if you don't regularly practice it, it'll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels. 

You could try relaxing music, your favourite food, anything else that enhances your mood, whatever works for you. 

During this time, you will experience anxiety, potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance, but I promise you, in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem.

When you seek reassurance, you're reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately, because usually it feels like the right thing, and the only thing to do in that situation. But trust me, try not seeking it.

It'll be very similar to [this graph](https://thegirlwiththecurlyhair.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/anxiety-repeated-exposure-graph.png), the more you do it the easier it'll be. And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this. 

Seriously, it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if you're currently having a lot of anxiety, I've been there hundreds of times, and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety.

healthanxiety,Sarah_135,2018/02/02,"180 on Health Concerns For a few months I had headaches several times a day and thought nothing of it. I mentioned it in passing to my husband who insisted I go to a doctor. Long story short, I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor. Very easy treatment and no major concerns with it. 

The twist is the medicine I take for it has a side effect of increasing anxiety. For me this has manifested into Health Anxieties and 99.9% of the time at night when I’m trying to sleep. I’ll feel a pain in my leg or think I have an elevated heart rate or, or, or, etc. 

I hate that I’ve gone 180 from being so passive to now fearful or obsessive. Has anyone else had a diagnosis trigger their anxiety?

healthanxiety,TyroneYuFresh,2018/02/02,"Loss of appetite for over a month I believe I got the flu right on Christmas Day, most likely caused by eating extremely spicy popcorn which I have been eating somewhat frequently prior. Went to the ER about 4 days after and got nothing but laughs from the doctor saying there's nothing wrong. Been eating nothing but rice porridge and shredded pork for over a week. I could hold food down but have completely lost the urge to eat since, would occasionally eat out to try and care for my hunger pangs that I think I was having. At first it was difficult to eat or even will myself to eat, got better, then got worse again. At this point, I could hardly eat and have to seriously think about whether or not I am hungry since it's seemingly impossible to tell when it was as easy as a stomach growl before then. 5-6 days ago, I think I got food poisoning, now I absolutely can't eat anything. Got the flu shot maybe 2 days prior and things only seemed to get worse then. Would often puke but wouldn't see food come back out, mostly what looked like saliva (had nothing but rice porridge after all). Went to the doctor's office and was prescribed Ranitidine, the medication may have cause this sense of looming nervousness but it's most likely just me since I've been fine with it every other time after about the second day of taking it or so. Decided that it was now necessary to force feed myself to jumpstart my appetite along with light walking (1-2 miles after each meal or so, I wasn't physically active at all prior, worse since I was bedridden during the flu). I fear that I'm overeating when I've been told to eat 5-6 small meals each day, I've also grown terribly impatient with my recovery seeing as how this has been going on for over a month. I would often feel incredibly miserable and every day I was plagued with anxiety until I decided to force feed myself, I don't care about getting fat anymore, I just want my appetite back, but now I'm starting to fear that I'm going about this the wrong way. The feelings of hopelessness and anxiety have hardly gotten better and while I don't suspect my loss of appetite is due to my anxiety, I can never be too sure. The whole reason why I even had anxiety in the first place was because of how sudden my loss of appetite was, and how I was unable to self diagnose myself since I felt no abdominal pain whatsoever, I'm at a loss as to what's going on with my body.

healthanxiety,The_Jedi_Hunter,2018/02/02,"Terrified of heart disease Ever since I learned that heart attacks are preceded by jaw and arm pain, I've been walking around in a state of constant paranoia. Because I have asthma, chest pain / tightness is something I like with daily, so throw these things together and you have a recipe for an anxious mess. 

Eating is a nightmare. Every time I eat something even mildly unhealthy (handful of salted peanuts, for example) I can *feel* the sodium and cholesterol in my chest, coursing through my veins around my heart. I know that I'm just being anxious, but damn if it doesn't wig me the hell out.

I got an EKG last summer and multiple CT scans (*including one in December), none of which have indicated heart problems. My blood pressure's a little high, but other than that, I'm technically fine. 

I know that everyone else on this sub deals with this, but damn does it suck.",6.111043771043768,7.379174481481483,5.741290684624019,80.13126262626265,66.53086419753086,8.360044893378229,33.86307519640853,8.575989854853784,2.801165432098766,694,31,122,10,11,214,112,162,0.223,0.754,0.023,-0.9851,0,0,2,0,0,0,26.0,0,1,0,0,6,12,5,1,8,0,10,16,11,0,1,21,17,9,0,2,5,0,3,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,12,9,2,1,4,0,0,2,2,10,0,1,2,5,14,2,18,14,1,18,1,0,1,0,2,9,4,1,7,76,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965859003262812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.233708720084184,0.0,0.1493337568494579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800183914545501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14185165801754965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532923896726815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11487155478268544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26863529449691537,0.1096557022834332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08669979921710863,0.1187373987708298,0.11059706773335376,0.12543006290585176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06637191444374348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498522293796927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6222022501003838,0.0,0.1386894868037334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14428046214932472,0.10699911758169517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641298218686112,0.13156278042116512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08894907896547442,0.0,0.27935205593746754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256036084526459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10858439655901624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2021095965988854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08720714096249009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07654212268094457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,frunchyspringss,2018/02/03,"Psychiatrist wants me to get a blood test She says it could show the levels of medication in my blood and if it's effective, etc. And if I have a thyroid disorder or diabetes or vitamin deficiency or some other physical reason for my depression and anxiety. Yeah, it makes perfect sense to get the blood test.

But I swear to God I just don't think I can do it. I am so sure something serious will be wrong with me and I just don't think I can handle it. Last time I had a blood test I fainted when I heard the results, which weren't actually bad in any way. Just thinking about it has had me depressed and anxious and crying for days now. I'm not afraid of needles, but I can't imagine going to the doctor for the blood test, let alone waiting for days for the results. I just don't think I can do it. I don't *want* to do it, even though I know it's objectively a good idea.

I'm seriously considering just... not seeing this psychiatrist anymore. I guess I could eventually find one who doesn't demand blood tests.

I don't know what I'm asking for here.

healthanxiety,JadeRQ,2018/02/03,"Woken by leg cramp - DVT? I'm a really anxious person and once something goes wrong I instantly think of all the worst things it could be and start to freak out.

Not too long ago, I was suddenly awoken by a severe cramp in my right calf. I've got it stuck in my head that it could be DVT. My legs arent swollen, red, or discolored. The pain was pretty intense but only lasted a few moments or so (less than a minute)

Does the pain usually last longer and not go away? It's still sore and hard to walk on, but not nearly as bad as when I woke.


Also I have severe panic attacks at doctors, lol. Which is a good combo with the worries of always dying.

healthanxiety,boredhuman-no22821,2018/02/03,I have very annoying intrusive/obsessive thoughts I didn’t know where to turn so here I am. For starters I’m not diagnosed with any anxiety disorder or other mental health illness. It’s not always as bad as it has been for the past few days but it’s already annoying me so much. It’s like I can’t relax my mind and the biggest issue for me is watching my current TV show. I know it sounds dumb but it’s what i love doing the most and what makes it easier to get through the day. It’s like these annoying thoughts keep getting in the way and I can’t enjoy watching my stuff. For instance I’m up next to solve an exercise in math class on tuesday in front of the class and it’s not for a grade or anything but my brain keeps telling me that I won’t be able to relax until i complete that and I wish my turn was on friday so i could enjoy the weekend. I don’t know how to clear my mind so i can get into what’s happening in my TV show and truly enjoy it like I normally do. I would appreciate any suggestions if you understand/can relate to what I’m going through atm.,1.0376019919555652,3.0889169471365685,3.1260907872055164,90.22884504884121,82.17180616740089,6.590997893123922,23.96648151695077,7.7425588080867325,1.2316230224095,845,32,184,15,23,286,122,227,0.078,0.684,0.238,0.9923,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,0,7,14,4,0,9,0,17,6,1,2,1,34,37,20,0,5,9,0,0,3,0,2,4,1,0,0,19,8,0,2,5,8,1,2,8,5,0,0,5,3,26,9,26,28,3,22,0,0,2,1,4,10,1,4,12,122,45,4,0.1400782428763485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15457982428021896,0.0,0.1165563195071956,0.0,0.0,0.1905160172870837,0.0,0.1071594723893954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11527245844742745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11695948172963723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15637364570634804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1468693725557536,0.0,0.0,0.1118410786664024,0.0,0.0,0.1806777565426909,0.0,0.0,0.1421764678956456,0.0,0.0,0.16054180214612468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.219555301159882,0.0,0.07960969353100272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12387072756005367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14889662182361316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14620529209286234,0.0,0.2490159569499602,0.0,0.0,0.2309500167669275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.205305461532099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1264260832156467,0.0,0.09350331484534484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14116592206501902,0.0,0.28287818697354605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10297362612331534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14897480045201414,0.0,0.13724693659175416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13372053300903766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1603560746674353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12243455847240828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22241295590451035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3047298075388748,0.0,0.14582639095884384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11557922055335275,0.0,0.1111875890897316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16108306623571436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0995075646982284,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,ali3n_sPac3_w33d,2018/02/03,"So my fears have been confirmed. Wednesday I went camping and ended up sleeping in 30 degree weather, was ill prepared to say the least. Ended up getting 2 hours of sleep while shivering the entire time. So Thursday night I suddenly came down with the chills and a brutal headache. Yesterday I went to urgent care and there they confirmed I have the flu type A virus and a 102 fever—as a hypochondriac this immediately kicked in my catastrophic thinking and always fearing the worst. They gave me Tamiflu which cost a pretty penny. Today I feel like dogshit—aches, pains, coughing but my fever has seemed to drop. But I’ve been sleeping like shit no more than 5 a night (don’t ya need to sleep to get rid of this?)

I’m an extremely healthy person so being out of commission like this is literal hell lol. 

Is anyone else dealing with the flu? Any tips? Also I’m going to be couch ridden while the misses is working, so casual convo is welcomed.

healthanxiety,Dryingpan101,2018/02/03,"What's causing my confusion/delerium 22/M

I've been feeling very confused/delirious since Sunday night. Let me give a little backstory about the events that lead up to this

I've been in terrible pain from a root canal for about a week before this happened, every day I took about 4000mg of extra strength Tylenol and 2000-2400 mg of Advil liquigels until Sunday night, I don't smoke weed often. Maybe once a week or so since last September but I did on Sunday night. Not anything more than I usually do or even a different strain but the night I smoked is the night I stopped taking my pain meds, but it's Friday night now and I feel confused and just overall ""off"" like I'm watching myself through a glass pane. Does anyone have any advice that could help me. This feeling is causing me to have daily panic attacks",4.568207547169814,6.151241245283022,4.420267295597487,86.97115566037735,70.50943396226415,6.809433962264151,28.34433962264151,7.1686216300943375,1.478135849056604,654,24,124,6,12,200,108,159,0.15,0.775,0.076,-0.9127,1,0,2,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,2,8,9,1,3,9,0,11,4,0,4,0,21,19,10,0,1,7,0,3,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,3,0,1,3,0,0,2,2,7,0,0,4,4,13,2,16,13,2,25,0,0,1,0,2,5,0,4,19,72,20,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11599108912504713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08071925124689566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08299695764846124,0.0,0.0976789948452913,0.0,0.0,0.1350370157150425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10100393233075043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24387271998733934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09477132954121653,0.0,0.0,0.07655090334540426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12401497747259067,0.0,0.0,0.10387411577703952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839943490589435,0.0,0.10000885458605352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18005303240604395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386670052699055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049649527891282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07956130051287745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09675536079187244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12137756041565373,0.0,0.05799023573889256,0.11896737631235756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11924889421096882,0.0,0.13184760299372789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6683446717995246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12641034322234665,0.0,0.0,0.2526077744477114,0.13926746135181295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19637774035685507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09923750795892176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08924672191529766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13187872921677846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1307299535256074,0.09793893737247417,0.0,0.0,0.19042602778445245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,TheGoldenWaffle77,2018/02/04,"Someone please help First of all I urge anyone who reads this to please give an opinion on what they think it may be, I'm worried sick. Thanks in advance.


Ok i've made posts about things I've felt before but somehow everything I had 2 weeks ago is now gone and has been replaced by new fears.

I'll get straight to it, here are symptoms with context:

- Odd feeling on left side of body, mainly legs, only when laying or sitting. Feels like weakness but I can still walk just fine and feel no difference in balance. Sort of like fatigue without any actual excercise to cause it, really odd and it scares me.

- Tinnitus, already diagnosed 2 years ago with bilateral tinnitus and it's got easier to deal with. But in times like these it makes me feel awful. I'm aware of the recent progresses in Tinnitus treatment so it doesn't worry me too much as it's benign and only sounds when i'm in silence.

- Constipation, probably caused by the stress or anxiety. Either way it might be causing me problems.

- Intermittent sharp stomach pains on the left side of my abdomen under ribs, I called the doctor about it and he said it was nothing lethal or worrying but to get it checked out anyway. That my current worst fear, that I had a digestive infection caused by the constipation. 

- A feeling that for some reason, I'm going to die tomorrow from some lethal random attack of sorts, like my intestines will rupture from a tiny stomach pain, or that I'll have a heart attack because I can sometimes hear pounding in my head. That's the worst of all of this, the never being able to relax, I feel on edge 24/7. Researching everything that I can in order to reassure myself, only to find an even worse disease that vaguely correlates to my symptoms.

I always feel the urge to check my speech to see if it's slurred, or check my heartrate to check for palpitations, or check my typing to check for stroke/ALS. I seriously can't keep living like this, why do I keep getting these physical symptoms?!

Many thanks, Max

healthanxiety,wafflemanfuzz,2018/02/04,"HIV worry Hi there,

About a month ago I had unprotected sex with my ex girlfriend (we have still maintained a close friendship). She told me she had been tested for STDs since the last time she had sex, I had had blood work and urine work done since the last time I had had sex also. About a week later she told me she had missed her period and we were worried about pregnancy. She was sick for a few days, nauseous and fatigued. After a while she got better but during that time I asked if she had blood work done, to which she replied no, just urine. She thought the same negative thoughts as me (she also has health anxiety). 

When she got better she assured me that she had just been stressed, not eating right and I had nothing to worry about. She even called me to reassure me.

Now I am studying abroad in the Middle East, and I started feeling sick last week. I had a stomach ache (normal for new bacteria in food) and then a sore throat and congestion. Instantly I thought this was the worst and that I had HIV. Again I told her I was freaking out but she reassured me that I was fine and so was she. I found out that my friend in the program has had the same symptoms  as me and we guessed it was allergies.

Now I’ve been taking antihistamines and feel better but the thought won’t leave my mind. I understand that it’s very hard to get anything through vaginal intercourse, plus I am circumcised (0.08% that she has it, 0.04% chance that I could get it from her if she was +). It’s hard to get tested in the country I’m in because that’s simply how it is. I’ve asked her to get tested but she said she’s been very busy and she told me I need to get help for my anxiety. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist because I have a history of panicking and anxiety. 

Should I be worried about this?

healthanxiety,gayluiigi,2018/02/04,"Superbowl parties and the flu I was going to go to a superbowl party today but then I remembered the flu season is at its peak. I'm also having surgery the day after on Monday, and while I know that symptoms don't usually appear until a couple days after being infected it would really suck if I got the flu while I was recovering from surgery. 

I don't care about football tbh but I love going to superbowl parties to stuff my face with food. I got the vaccince but apparently it's really ineffective this year, so I'm still worried about catching it even if I'm super careful. Is it reasonable for me to not go just because I'm paranoid about the flu?",4.018692307692309,5.578344253846153,6.0,75.20000000000002,71.84615384615384,8.892307692307693,29.92307692307693,9.3871,2.9403692307692304,523,22,93,12,10,182,80,130,0.214,0.65,0.136,-0.8914,1,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,2,8,6,1,0,8,0,9,9,1,1,0,15,25,13,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,8,3,1,0,3,0,0,6,3,2,0,0,4,0,10,4,16,19,0,22,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,3,14,67,18,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14631850454325782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153487881299594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3730937461461059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2024493127392797,0.0,0.23599693243517894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12084786288516955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22124421210714432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4159370544537877,0.0,0.2926705699699722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055378250166587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651347038484925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2344264675698972,0.1881203700750356,0.0,0.0,0.2072657464583754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14611754348677958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20945324119031494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19017258882417049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17343115717429805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20151210933612745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1858116930909376,0.0,0.12997438352256874,0.0,0.0,0.11782463705654178

I was making some Mac and cheese for dinner tonight (absolutely delicious, but a very once in a while kind of meal). It’s just pasta covered with what is essentially 100% butter, milk, and cheese. That’s it. I was pouring it into the baking dish and I felt discomfort in my chest. I notice this a lot when surrounded by unhealthy food. It’s not so much after I eat it, more before and during.

healthanxiety,bluerainyumbrella,2018/02/05,"Up and down So, my health anxiety focuses on getting pregnant: I’m terrified of it, don’t ever want to be (I’m 20) and no doctor will tie my tubes. I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken, i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them, I didn’t trust a blood test, I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.

Then, last week, after 3 CBT sessions, upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks, I had the first ‘good’ week since September. No tests, no doctor visits, plenty of exercise, could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. 

Then, on Saturday morning, my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then, I feel like I’ve spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. I’ve resisted doing a test so far, but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse, I’m symptom spotting, googling, crying etc. My techniques to cope aren’t working. I go from feeling scared and upset to angry with myself and the world.

I was just wondering, how do people cope with these type of set backs? How do you pull yourself up again? At the minute I just feel sad and depressed and angry.

healthanxiety,SleveMcDichael666,2018/02/05,"Fear it’s not bronchitis. 28 white male

6’1” 275lbs

Pack a day smoker for ~10 years

No chronic health conditions or regular meds

Current meds: 20mg prednisone 3x a day for 5 days, albuterol inhaler as needed (up until last night I’d been using it every 4 hours regardless)

On Wednesday (5 days ago) I went to urgent care because I’d been feeling some chest discomfort. My son has recently gotten over walking pneumonia so I wanted to get it checked out and start treatment early if that’s what I had. They did a chest x-ray, took blood, did a peak flow test where I scored a 300. Doc gave me a breathing treatment and bumped the peak flow score to 450. Doc said, “I’m gonna call it bronchitis” and prescribed me the meds listed above.

In the beginning, I didn’t feel sick; I wasn’t rundown or tired, no fever, no loss of appetite or anything. Ever since I went to the doctor I’ve felt weird. I wake up feeling shaky, I get dizzy throughout the day, for the first few days my lower legs were killing me, I get these random waves of feeling hot/flushed, and I wake up several times throughout the night either cold or burning up (still no fever, no chills). I feel like the prednisone should be giving me some improvement but the cough is becoming more frequent and more productive (white sputum). Last night it took me forever to fall asleep because the center of my chest hurt. 

I’ve slowed down on my smoking since going to the doctor but haven’t totally stopped. I’m just so afraid that this is something more serious. Would something like cancer have shown up on my chest X-ray or blood work? I’ve been up for the past 2 hours with my mind racing. Right now I’m sitting on the couch and every time I inhale I get a dull pain in my chest. I just want to be okay.",4.013572845492618,5.379608343839543,4.285114613180518,88.24839927264715,71.57879656160459,7.2030416574829195,27.176658584968038,7.61054688173877,1.4074186907648218,1388,48,281,16,26,433,198,349,0.145,0.7979999999999999,0.058,-0.9816,3,0,3,0,0,0,43.0,0,0,1,3,8,15,1,4,20,1,18,23,12,1,2,41,48,18,1,7,12,1,6,2,0,3,11,1,1,1,10,8,0,1,6,0,1,9,9,11,0,1,17,12,28,4,32,26,8,60,0,3,2,0,7,18,0,10,34,145,38,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08708791182992705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08084693636779268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11977799486989645,0.10850344409431636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10031872292837056,0.0,0.10016691928003348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38015784385160173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011150260166324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886786701351884,0.16555062868410064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105524907444636,0.2483771131622721,0.07018596321599856,0.09433022461941057,0.0,0.0,0.08356680817409666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20531499835155026,0.09424517427208028,0.055834671298312114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10442941767779734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19350228597510094,0.0,0.1051728782598129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869309583568587,0.0,0.0,0.16016492613530242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09599469990781848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32738281509846306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919904151483472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07284712744402001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2765877107883353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10453918316384238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09378558910652136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970046920431859,0.0,0.0,0.083900353209395,0.09345311417896653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098843591458153,0.0,0.16253789981999306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15126698865427876,0.0,0.0,0.06953803487555653,0.0,0.07845826597214214,0.0821368862769376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11457443484122724,0.11291771750067442,0.0,0.0,0.2183067351612539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08485179234053837,0.0,0.0,0.11589442324187768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1821474604336922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07152324025897998,0.0,0.0,0.06979014640293048,0.0,0.0,0.06326630253737929

It went away after a day, but now a week later it's happening again. Could it be breast cancer even though I'm 22? How do they even test for breast cancer? I don't know if I'd even qualify for getting a mammogram. I'm not sure if I still even have insurance. Also relevant, I've always had a lump in one of my breasts, ever since I was like 18. But it never worried me because I was so young and google said it was probably nothing. And it's been four years since I discovered it and it never killed me. What if though??? I'm definitely not pregnant so it isn't that.",1.3137104072398174,3.1457680439560463,3.756722689075634,87.19710084033615,80.09890109890111,7.359276018099548,21.694893341952167,8.313332769828598,1.223540012928248,672,20,145,14,17,234,99,182,0.14800000000000002,0.7759999999999999,0.076,-0.9049,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,1,0,15,7,1,1,6,0,15,10,5,2,5,28,27,19,1,5,11,0,0,1,0,0,5,1,0,0,14,4,0,1,2,0,0,1,8,5,0,3,10,1,18,2,10,15,2,24,0,2,0,5,2,4,0,6,20,100,32,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11356797783359585,0.11816643490174833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10863977922214213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13342616207256533,0.0,0.1185751664292572,0.0865699843245889,0.0,0.24168570243566376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1550417331010934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14588676964087796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11338605746519707,0.0,0.0,0.18317364898758465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3751937584715499,0.12845915249585654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07419608337993573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255818845888802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3040563312890185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15711666592694398,0.0,0.15609358198241116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938052081511395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3285882155342236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13626558322875393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1924637631862788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15311434747081418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09097735093620812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13508716084861513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2349497243605104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1005177385992895,0.0,0.11341199796707944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338458464968437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2790546755413989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391449626042666,0.0,0.0,0.1316477439085222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14422139091734507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09145190358019824
healthanxiety,BlueDocks,2018/02/06,"How do you stop fuzzing? My friend is as healthy as can be, but eversince I started really knowing him there's been something wrong. He'd go to the doctor, clear up whatever condition he thought he had and then he'll go home and start googling every single aspect of his bodily functions. (For example: ""Smelling burning wood"" - then he thinks obviously something is wrong with his nose now??) Until eventually he discovers some other condition he may have. Then he stresses it until a doctor clears it up again and then repeat. He would sit for hours up at night reading symptoms, and unfortunately  that is not exaggeration.

He's never fine, never normal, never healthy in his mind. And as much as it annoys me, its worrisome. Because there's no helping a person that always thinks that he knows better.

I'm looking for someone who can advise him on how you coped or even escaped this state of mind. But any advice would be appreciated.

healthanxiety,HypoTomasis,2018/02/06,"Heart anxiety pvc, vt and cpvt Hi there. I want to begin to tell you that I have suffer from health anxiety for few years. I was actually good for 3 years until 10 weeks ago. 

Last two years I've had skipped beats. Doctor told me it was probably pvc and did no test. I believed him and continued with my life. These skipped beats would happened when in rest so I wasn't worried. Last year I had a hernia surgery and I couldn't run for 4 month's. Then last summer I noticed when I started running that my heart would skip beats or flutter more frequently during excersice. Sometimes just 1-2 times but sometimes 10 times. 

I saw a cardiologist and he did ECG, echo, stress test. My heart is structurally normal and everything looks fine except 1 pvc during stress test. 

I didn't have any anxiety and continue working out. Than 10 weeks ago I was running. I'm not in good shape because I'm scared of exercising. Everything went fine until I had pvc. I continued running and got few in a row! my heart started pumping and I felt numbness and my heart was getting pvc A LOT. I thought I was going to faint but I didn't. My friend called the ambulance. I freaked out When they came my pvc had stop and I just had 150 bpm. ECG showed nothing. Had a blood test as we'll and 2 more ECG which showed nothing. Docs told me nothing to worry about. 

I was fine until week ago when I was watching tv and relaxing. I noticed chest tingling. I took my pulse and it was fast. I had a panic attack and skipped beats, few in a row. I called a ambulance and they did ECG 2x and there we're no sign of anything. My skipped beats were not happening when they came. 

I had a holter and I'm waiting for the results but it only captured skip bear  while at rest. I'm trying to get on with my life but I can't take this anymore. I'm so anxious. Deep down in my heart I worry so much that I have Venticular tachardia because of those skipped beats while excsersising or panic attacks. They came more than 3 in a row and that is suppose to be a bad sign. I want to believe my doctors but I can't get it out of my head that they have never capatured my heart fast and inregular at the same time. Only pvc or fast sinus rate. 

I'm can't sleep I can't enjoy anything and I'm have been a mess last week's because of this Venticular tachardia anxiety. 

summary. I've experience at least two times fast rate and skipped beats. It also happened one time when I had adrenaline rush because of a bad family fight. My heart started skipping beats alot and sometimes even during dramatic sport events my heart races with skipped beats. It happens if I have adrenaline, if I'm excsersising and panic attacks and stress.Also sometimes when drinking alcohol 

I'm 24 year old 90 kg 185 cm never smoked have panic attacks and health anxiety. 

Should I worry that they have never capture my heart going fast and skipping beats? Any advice? be honest.
I had few good weeks with my anxiety but then googled some shit and found CPVT and it's giving me one helluva anxiety.

Im just playing everything in my head. I get more skipped beats when my heart is racing curing excersice or panic.
I have had ECG when it happened but my pvc had stopped already and it only showed sinus tachardia.

I just want to stop think about this. Deep down I know I'm 99% all right but my brain keeps getting what if especially with cpvt fear.

2) However, my muscle twitching and numbness (ive always had this my entire life) and my short term memory loss problems got worse. Besides, i now have speech and focusing problems.

healthanxiety,inaverylonelyplace,2018/02/06,"Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. [Warning: this post got much, MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.]

So, I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline (for chronic depression/ptsd) and trazodone (for sleep) but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 1-1 1/2 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit, my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it.  I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.

I have had ekgs countless times, probably like over 10 times (ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years) and for the most part, were completely 100% normal (shocker).... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.

Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling / shaking in my chest with every beat, like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary, I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure (which wouldn't be that unrealistic, as purging (electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.), sleep deprivation (I had stayed up all night), physical activity while literally running on empty (we were inside playing basketball when it all started) and of course hypoglycemia (essentially not-eating will do that to ya) all lower the seizure threshold, and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures) because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion, almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.

......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 (for the record, throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it, it has always, always sat at a comfy 55-60 while not using HR-raising drugs such as dxm or speed) when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility, and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. 

Coming fairly close to death (which has actually happened to me a numerous times,  with my purging phase, over exercising phase (I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 3-5 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some, feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad, real bad) restriction phase (I have eaten less than 500 calories / day for months at a time, several times, in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on, as I am pushing myself to not eat, God I hate being eating disordered, but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months (can't rmmbr) cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions, or if it just was a crash diet-turned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also, this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 1/2 years ago , legit almost got tboned (we would have been hit on my/her side of the car, had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection, that person would have hit us. oddly enough, she was panicking, yet I f elt absolutely nothing, no adrenaline, no fear, nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly (lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool (not))

I wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging (I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't, I am a person who is very much into record keeping). I feel like I am not actually alive, that I died months / years ago, and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be / am not actually alive, because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean, I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father, isn't a piece of shit drug addict, doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise, doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. (how did my life end up like this.......) I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are, Holy fucking shit. 

(Oops, sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.)

Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually, every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could ""sense"" that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad, but that, coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias, it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out, if I mayhaps did permanent, structural, unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode, and am now much, much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. 

Now what's weird about this phobia, is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty not-good for you, yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???

It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 4-20 times a day (no fucking joke) and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is ""normal"" about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig, the highest it goes is like 130/85 (which, insanely and funnily enough, is still probably lower than like 70% of Americas blood pressure, lmao), which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally, with only the Cigs and no meth, like 90/60, sometimes even like 85/57, no lie. I attribute it to my whole food/plant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something, but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.

So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. (/end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues.

healthanxiety,viktoriahoedl,2018/02/06,"Swallowing air, mostly when laying on my back Since the start of this year I‘ve had really weird symptoms. It started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. I got very scared because i was high (on weed) at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia I was sent into a full-blown panic attack. While being in a panic attack I first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. After sobering up, I was back to normal. But stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so I had my next panic attack, shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. At this point i quit smoking. Yet after that incident i noticed, that whenever I laid down on my back and swallowed(mostly the normal spit-swallow reflex) i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously, I cannot control it. I’ve also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. Now I‘ve become extremely aware of how i breathe, how I swallow and  when I feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. I‘ve thought about hiatus hernia(the conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus), GERD(but I‘ve never noticed any acidic reflux), and so on... It‘s gotten so bad that some nights I can‘t even sleep because I‘m having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... I‘ve gone to three different doctors, the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infection(or something like that idk), the second one sent me to a therapist to whom I‘ll go to in march and the third one didn‘t find anything wtong with me, just like the first one. It‘s extremely hard for me to live with this condition, because wherever I searched, I‘ve found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. I‘m using simeticon to relieve the bloating, because I‘m not able to burp all of the air out. But I may add that I do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough I‘m not laying down. When I lay down on my back though, it happens almost constant. I was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this? :(",7.032919080217661,8.082768962085307,6.639678778304372,75.29746621028612,64.35545023696683,9.379813937159913,36.48271019835001,9.444778638647367,3.5926816570124624,1850,88,305,33,27,577,209,422,0.14,0.836,0.025,-0.9933,2,0,4,0,0,0,52.0,0,0,0,5,31,19,4,5,24,1,19,22,10,9,3,63,49,33,0,4,12,0,4,2,0,2,8,5,0,0,22,19,4,2,9,1,0,11,6,15,0,10,18,11,39,4,51,26,8,70,0,1,1,0,7,29,0,14,32,224,61,1,0.07239267010990089,0.0,0.07064480325905508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249080201553396,0.0,0.0,0.057892392132136414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049229498125167886,0.0,0.11076038897324514,0.0,0.0,0.050618638154261854,0.0,0.059572999245201576,0.0,0.0,0.2470713395855843,0.0,0.2783274739083352,0.1208897113958333,0.22064949887262247,0.07995201653315241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08041193673284021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06235987521459825,0.07590233728204486,0.07823075842158325,0.08119453520193706,0.0577996564375765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07563493227044071,0.0,0.07409696539756867,0.06335131345876928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04781467585605709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10981172749177387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06616558897665069,0.1847315046410071,0.0,0.07937482620660997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04114242271319403,0.0,0.057899031483158475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25606639639088336,0.0,0.06484961304894322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24477540165858885,0.0,0.0,0.0764868306045031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749785061346506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07073480384137354,0.0,0.06392405400224177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1230913186821126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07694195165150602,0.0,0.0,0.05583369005530504,0.0,0.0769904259388159,0.06793561688417755,0.1418588925769418,0.06946271941155965,0.329678138942036,0.0,0.0,0.19622058721398836,0.0,0.0,0.2548116015055197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06843447263271828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07699851565177902,0.0,0.0,0.04637659819266314,0.07443172185515898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06886200702916398,0.0,0.07247769178341998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11976792960024273,0.0,0.07244495123047981,0.0,0.0,0.16719424270939695,0.1431964036289472,0.0,0.15371971352044814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2257311087075294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0840534696621562,0.0,0.0,0.07112543082531546,0.11494338745508158,0.04221274810751485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06252402364464395,0.0,0.05973153441440749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06532312481465076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07850676266963047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046618506063854384
healthanxiety,SailorStarPlatinum,2018/02/06,"Left Ear Tingling / Side of face numb?? My left ear sometimes (mainly when I'm going to bed) gets this weird tingling sensation, followed by the sensation spreading to the whole left side of my face?? It's weird and doesn't hurt but definitely stands out. I don't have many other health issues aside from mental health such as anxiety / OCD / depression. Is this just another weird side effect that can happen that nobody told me about before??? 

It's kinda freaking me out lol ",4.4175,6.957880908045977,4.384583333333335,82.99687500000002,73.25287356321839,7.108620689655173,24.66810344827586,8.07648339933343,1.6236448275862068,377,12,65,6,8,116,64,87,0.21600000000000005,0.727,0.057,-0.9261,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,0,0,1,4,7,0,0,2,1,5,9,4,1,0,7,11,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,1,0,7,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,7,0,0,1,2,5,0,10,10,2,12,0,2,0,0,1,8,0,1,1,36,12,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20146862659997256,0.1469815282303936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16349137557981125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16548421939989785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10038177361897653,0.0,0.10919384125577328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16990293469930506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40845764795205175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20568278286724595,0.0,0.0,0.2005373560359804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6262605171291833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19479311520881887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19362528105562468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1900248494754116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18359170129639224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21451008417800466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Ballsonhard,2018/02/06,"Terrified of a brain CT scan I had Sorry guys, long post but I just need to get this off my chest and I feel like I'm going crazy...
Firstly, I'm a 23 y.o. male in relatively good health training and playing sports 4ish times a week.

So recently I was having a weird pain on the right side of my brain and ongoing pressure that didn't go away for about 4 days. Eventually I went to the doctor who said we should do a 'scan' for reassurance to check if it was serious.

I stupidly just went along with radiology and did a brain CT scan when I could have asked for an MRI. Now days later I'm absolutely terrified of the affects of that CT radiation on my brain/body and so much regret I didn't speak up and demand an MRI instead. I've been emailing the clinic and they said that on average a brain CT with the machine (Siemens 64 slice Perspective) they use gives 1 mSv for a brain CT (I'm worried that this is just for a brain scan and that the person doing it would have hit my head among other body parts so the dosage might have been higher). 

I've now been reading about ionizing radiation for the past few days non-stop with occasional glimpses of hope about how overall the radiation impacted me is nominal compared to the background we receive. But then there are so many questions that stress me out, is receiving a large dose in one go the same as a 2/3 a year of exposure to the body? How much radiation can our bodies deal with? Is there now mutated DNA in my body that could cause problems in the future? Am I more sensitive to radiation than a normal person?

I can't sleep properly and I spend my days distracted reading about the odds of contracting a fatal cancer because of a stupid CT scan I could have said no to. I just want some proof to say ""look, the radiation you received is minor and there is almost no risk with the CT"". I've read every resource there is (I think) and done every calculator I could and it still stresses me out. **This fear of cancer is partially because I lost my mother when I was quite young to lung cancer and I'm just terrified hereditary impact this has on me**

tl;dr: Had a brain CT worried about brain tumours/cancer and now worried the scan could have done more harm then good.",3.841892757102841,5.370829535147394,4.8540169401093785,83.36373049219691,72.24263038548753,8.181432573029213,26.80278778177938,8.757208317658263,1.9107798586101112,1759,61,354,33,34,575,215,441,0.222,0.7340000000000001,0.045,-0.9982,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,3,1,2,3,28,22,2,6,35,0,42,26,16,5,1,58,67,28,1,14,8,1,1,1,0,3,10,5,0,4,16,24,0,0,3,5,2,8,5,16,0,2,19,13,34,6,51,39,8,48,0,2,7,0,26,16,0,6,24,232,50,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06374341379732891,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059510817265995324,0.0,0.05980796286549825,0.0,0.0,0.07760958311812785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35354356793484504,0.0,0.6395616211472301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06539340085720095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2541251658972107,0.0,0.0,0.16421431339123946,0.06562769901409934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06515576314704664,0.0,0.13028667696651322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1072677438879566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163196151904264,0.032186954255739864,0.045476661651036816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05414671661475783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03325821960718029,0.0610657132313521,0.108533430561429,0.10678514977309866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06303056028973215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06533057365271823,0.06766454539538838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06322588686472555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03109965503049175,0.0,0.0,0.056334551004909014,0.053455951170151166,0.0,0.06948926987298039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06453833171121573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753014823815745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09359062031108936,0.04720095037844418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06237046521036635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04313571425122269,0.0,0.0677356674209488,0.0,0.0,0.06893446126258401,0.060767927205254015,0.0,0.11116588950469296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06096592772921964,0.0,0.0,0.06091126997772275,0.0,0.0,0.07131054678554083,0.06770718640855561,0.19102304965901012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06285372967005773,0.0,0.0,0.054362835536841514,0.1816575049632069,0.05062269950945605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370309577789228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712589379213314,0.0,0.0,0.0508366609483084,0.053220205510188585,0.1458380394785906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0407889142901154,0.0,0.0,0.03711898055098256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05497931600481492,0.0,0.0,0.037546620659695835,0.0,0.05106190462467331,0.0,0.0,0.11802158222501193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1939406963014635,0.0,0.04522019402618864,0.0,0.0,0.040993100366095714
healthanxiety,iamthegoldengod69,2018/02/06,"What is wrong with me? I’ve always been extremely articulate and smart. I operated on a higher consciousness than most people just in the sense that I was more aware of my surroundings and I thought deeply about things. I was also quick witted and being funny was probably my defining personality trait. Until about a week ago, I felt like my normal self (still a very anxious person regarding my health, particularly a brain tumor). Now I just feel like there’s been a substantial cognitive decline. I can’t think as deeply and I’m constantly second guessing myself on if I’m using words correctly. I feel Ike my vocabulary is getting worse and I google synonyms for words about 30 times a day. At the same time, I also feel more relaxed. It sounds weird but I’d rather feel smart and anxious than dumb and relaxed. I’m not even particularly happy. I feel like I have no emotions (something that has been persisting for a while) but now I feel like I have no intelligence (something new to me). I am slower to respond in arguments and don’t feel as witty as I was two weeks ago. Maybe I’m thinking too much about my speech but I just wish I could revert back to normal. Everything just feels so superficial to me. It’s weird. I know a symptom of brain tumors is a shift in consciousness. I’m messing up when I talk a lot more. I feel like I’m forgetting words and not winning in arguments (very rare for me). I’m only 15 (almost 16) and feel like I have Alzheimer’s or something. On a side site, the only other truly concerning symptom I have that could be indicative of something more serious is the smell of smoke occasionally. This isn’t a daily occurrence or even a weekly but maybe once or twice a month, I’ll get a whiff of the faint smell of smoke that is certainly not coming from real life. As of lately, I just feel so dumb. I just can’t stress the fact that I’ve never felt this way before. I hate this feeling. I haven’t really had emotions for a while (this is due to some trauma I’ve been through) but lack of intelligence is brand new. I may not be completely devoid of my intellect (as I’m able to express my thoughts coherently in this format) but I feel slower than usual. I use to partake in writing creative stories and stuff and I tried to do that yesterday and I struggled and was uncharacteristically out of ideas. Sorry if this sounds repetitive but this has been going on for about a week now and I’m not sure what’s up. My parents won’t let me get an CAT Scan (I got an MRI in March 2016 and everything was fine). Is there a possibly a tumor could’ve developed in this short of amount of time? Thoughts and opinions please. I just feel like a completely different person



Also sometimes when I’d feel really weird or things would get too heavy, I’d cry and the feelings would subside. Now I can’t even cry cause I feel like I don’t even have feelings in the first place. I use to be able to explain this perfectly all the time (or so it felt like) and I took great pride in my ability to articulate things. Now I feel like whenever I do so, there’s a little voice in my head questioning what I say and if it makes complete sense. I now I sound articulate in my post but I don’t feel like I sound like this in real life. Or it at least takes too long for me to express myself.

healthanxiety,Phobeso,2018/02/07,"Tested a VR headset (for phone, Bobo Z4) &amp; before I could adjust settings to get rid of incorrect settings (the screen was double), I felt my left eye sting and after that, weird sensations in my eye areas and in my head/brain... kinda electrical and spasm-like, worried Health anxiety sucks - it sucks more when its symptoms overlap with the symptoms of physical conditions.

But the symptoms described in the title above were a little... odd. Epilepsy-concerns emerge, perhaps mild, but still leaving me concerned. Could it just be something that had to do with my eyes needing to adjust, or the settings not being correct and thus messing me up for a bit, or should I be worried about epilepsy/photosensitivity? I figured I'd ask around to see if it is a sound concern... no access to a doctor right now unfortunately, gotta wait til tomorrow.

healthanxiety,blueoreosandmilk,2018/02/07,"Fear of exercise and moving/exerting myself Hi. I have had many issues with fatigue in the past, and they were really terrifying. I've come to develop some kind of PTSD with exercise and exertions.. A few weeks ago I just went to grab some groceries and the exertion from carrying the weight had me suffering in the evening with widespread body pains and an intense fatigue that signalled there was something wrong with my body. In any case, I came down with a cough after that so my doctor said I could be coming down with a cold or something, and if exertions make me tired I shouldn't exercise and I should rest. 

It's been 2 weeks, I still don't know when it's safe to start moving because I'm still coughing slightly and seem to be coming down with sore throat. I'm terrified of exercising because of my past. Yet, I'm so sedentary these days that I'm not comfortable with it either. It's mad unhealthy to not move much. I'm anguished.

healthanxiety,blahhhbleep,2018/02/07,"Spinning Downhill All Over Again, PLEASE HELP! I haven't been to this sub in over a year. I started stressing about the things I was reading, and freaking out more, even though I just wanted to support others like they were giving me. I decided to stop googling, stop this sub and try to re focus, to feel some relief from the anxiety.

 2018 has started out pretty rough, issues with relationship, stress and more stress have been a real struggle. Therapy hasn't been feeling the same neither does school which last year I was so happy to actually be doing. It's a sad time.

Between all this I've tried different things to help me, yoga, some gym, journaling, hobbies etc. I realize that my life will forever be good and bad days....TODAY IS A BAD DAY! I'm overwhelmed and I'm not even out of bed yet.

I feel asleep fine last night (thankfully) and sleep through most of the night (again, thankfully) however I woke up at 530 to my right thigh twitching so quickly and non stop. Maybe I needed a stretch? No...Still going. 

It doesn't hurt but I've regrettable done something bad. I've let myself have bad thoughts, then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.

1. I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted  wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! (Now Wednesday). Can't be that...right?

2. Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?

3. Google sucks, it's the worst type of fear enabler, yet so accessible. I'm finding so much, Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???

4. Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58-119+bpm depending on exercise, and relaxation etc. 
I didn't sleep with it last night, but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66  down to 61 bpm (granted back In bed in my safe zone) but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?!   

I'm terrified again, upset I'm stressing out about this and worried I might not get out of bed today.

Please help, I could use any words or advice.

healthanxiety,tveskagg,2018/02/07,Scared to death of some wierd symptoms. Greetings. I have extreme health anxeity. For some time i have had troubles with floaters that looked like spiderweb. Recently these past weeks i have also noticed stars in my eyes. They seem to appear randomly and they also move with my eyes similar to floaters. They appear for some seconds then they disapear. I wen't to the eye doctor and he told me that i had PVD or occular migraine. He also told me that my right pupil was smaller then the left one so he called some neurologist and he did some tests but there was nothing wrong with them. But right now im starting to belive that he was wrong and that i have some super rare eye disease or maybe a brain tumor. Should i go back to the doctor or should i take his word that it is nothing serious?,3.4591876750700266,5.741444764705888,3.634234360410833,88.47191176470591,75.20915032679737,6.7243697478991615,25.96125116713352,7.7094869923839395,1.4327800186741362,631,23,122,9,14,194,90,153,0.061,0.8320000000000001,0.106,0.8017,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,0,5,1,7,7,0,1,4,0,13,10,5,0,0,25,22,15,1,2,5,0,0,1,0,2,5,0,0,0,8,7,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,5,0,2,8,5,19,2,13,12,6,17,0,0,5,0,14,4,0,13,10,83,27,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3643966472315953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167932372335983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16955831574191774,0.15509561373621825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31092958005353416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08632199812745744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16145086534263892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16406614464387967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16502780304949244,0.0,0.0,0.07420527526181611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.127548474961349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15259287890180803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16143393043925586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2914831135138688,0.17292659143339467,0.0,0.0,0.10292389245117653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1449952020668628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499720272403505,0.0,0.0,0.25942468950662034,0.0,0.0,0.15206734950988765,0.0,0.0,0.1382740076402692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.107507789993855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15787079011685093,0.1142015975889166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0885676759604914,0.0,0.0,0.290272826988509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218361645603942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3321334748851683,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,grudgekyoko,2018/02/07,"Keflex side effects, worried about allergic reaction So yesterday I was prescribed Keflex (Cipro) for a UTI.  Felt ok the first couple doses but I noticed on the 3rd dose I felt kind of light headed and fuzzy. Took my 4th dose around 10 and about an hour ago got up from the couch and was really dizzy. It seems like it’s a bit better now, I’m not dizzy while sitting anymore. But I googled and started freaking out, some sites say dizziness is a common side effect and some say severe dizziness can be a sign of an allergic reaction. So I started freaking out even more and now I feel like my throat is closing up. I can drink water though, and breathe, so I’m hoping that part is just my anxiety making everything worse. I’m going to call the doctors office in the morning to see if I can have a different antibiotic, but of course it’s the middle of the night. Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated....",4.103970944309928,5.8434361242937936,5.074047619047622,81.2025,71.93785310734464,7.769007263922517,28.46206618240517,8.418075326091056,2.1269083131557704,722,28,134,12,14,236,112,177,0.15,0.7490000000000001,0.101,-0.8053,1,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,0,4,11,9,0,0,14,1,12,11,3,3,0,30,27,17,0,3,7,0,3,2,0,1,6,2,1,0,4,11,2,0,6,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,6,7,11,7,17,18,5,26,0,0,1,0,4,12,0,6,13,85,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15337985855301392,0.1391358989915312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067384351000163,0.0,0.12007425466754106,0.0,0.15566251213400992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13972800827032555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13881869344589254,0.1713600734258795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16027408864251402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1736736657601792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16399018102756724,0.0,0.16065559133037707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15376140874705133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036708451244781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14106586114613212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07936388002101201,0.11213252084531787,0.3014131428510049,0.0,0.0,0.13351041191413898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08920419634309892,0.0,0.1255355477849051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1610866243473037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15589706498741893,0.15457434878355947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634500733263191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15336581839486474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10477226687157777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14729667597533785,0.0,0.0,0.17870042341224174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16997278678460845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10055283325783904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2496423748756381,0.0,0.0,0.125077094450894,0.1428908273007911,0.0,0.17732054293363558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2221947178021598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15421276818232324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17438874818749125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1594008764147673,0.15995602817737306,0.1115001445836188,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,ririrodina,2018/02/07,"Headache after workout I had a great day and spent an hour of walking on the treadmill. Had a light meal afterwards and then I started to feel numbness on my right side (a reoccurring feeling from when i was in a minor accident) and now a headache. Out of impulse I googled my symptoms and of course they're were some horrible causes for something so small.

Abosolutly freaked out and also very regretful that I googled that.

healthanxiety,nac66,2018/02/07,"Back pain on and off? Hi, people! I'm worried about a pain in my middle back that comes and goes almost every week. It's a weird pain, specifically located in the left side of my back. It isn't an horrible pain, but it's really annoying sometimes. Sometimes when I lay down the pain gets better, but it's noticeable when i'm sitting or standing  
I don't know if it's something related to my posture, spine, nerves... But I'm really worried that could be something related to my stomach (like an ulcer) or my pancreas... I don't have any other symptoms, but my anxious mind thinks the worst. Like I said, the pain comes and goes and it usually starts at night (in the morning the pain doesn't exists at all). Anyone has something to say? I'm not asking for medical advice, just some kind words.",3.3194230769230764,5.139919275641033,4.596410256410259,83.48192307692308,74.19230769230771,7.620512820512822,27.384615384615394,8.384062270229773,1.9967846153846152,621,24,119,11,13,205,91,156,0.231,0.691,0.078,-0.9773,0,0,3,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,1,7,14,1,0,10,0,8,12,2,0,1,23,20,13,0,2,9,0,0,2,0,0,10,2,0,0,9,6,0,0,2,0,0,2,5,10,0,0,1,2,10,4,14,17,3,24,0,0,0,0,4,11,0,5,11,72,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09779516942457778,0.0,0.0,0.10021376947026332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06805654564554478,0.0,0.0,0.11305977657202801,0.0,0.06997694043725512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09355952195223233,0.0,0.0,0.23086166408957898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851095426031623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17241685800664694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07990422625555288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843201227954423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05228668115112812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421594963123623,0.05500031119606842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10873515777530876,0.0,0.0,0.09778621740403284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081816562344073,0.0,0.0,0.10105036058403516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09391652540679854,0.0,0.0,0.11393958990908565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7454311447758206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06938155946665267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822519798025278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09519719889706146,0.07958612876826536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2311350520310745,0.1979596167134004,0.0,0.07083580033814511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10401947401747973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06412601098849903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11022189765043952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027662206858477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20326835429986168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,SeasonalGent,2018/02/08,"Forgetfulness, should i be concerned? I’m a rather healthy 19yo minus needing some weight loss, and i woke up this morning not remembering how I fell asleep at all. I’ve been struggling with sleep issues this past week due to a different work schedule catching me off guard. Today I can recall certain things from the past three days, but nothing too specific. As in conversations mainly. it’s kind of concerning as I’ve never had memory issues really bad, nothing like forgetting a lot of the day before. 

I did find out how I fell asleep after finding my controller beside me where i was watching YouTube before I fell asleep.

healthanxiety,OtherwiseHurry,2018/02/08,"Blood Tests Hey y’all,
First time poster, so be kind :) 

I have had health anxiety for a long time. I’m currently a 24 year old female with lots of manageable chronic issues. This requires a lot of blood tests.

Every time I have to get one, I get really freaked out to the point of causing fights with loved ones and raising my blood pressure with constant anxiety attacks. I’m afraid I may pass or during blood tests, and passing out is one of my biggest fears. Hearing about how it’s really not harmful and I’ll be fine once I wake up is unhelpful. It’s a trigger for me.

And here’s the thing: I have never passed out, only gotten slightly woozy. Every time it’s better than I imagine it being. 

Can someone give me some advice on how to prevent the slow spiral?

healthanxiety,easyoceanbreeze,2018/02/08,Should I be worried about hickeys? Hi I’m already anxious about some things but now I’m really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 2-3 inches down my neck. I read an article about two people who died from a blood clot that came from a hickey and I’m worried that because this one is so long that will happen to me too. They seem so innocent like just bruises but I’m freaking out. Does anyone know anything or should I be worried ,2.3682398239824,4.267080851485154,3.624290429042905,89.06622662266226,77.11881188118812,6.073047304730473,26.073707370737075,6.937597516519254,1.13620704070407,390,15,79,4,9,127,68,101,0.184,0.743,0.073,-0.8738,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,2,0,9,2,0,0,4,0,7,2,2,0,0,14,16,8,1,2,4,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,2,0,8,1,11,9,2,10,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,3,6,52,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18591355401512832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3806518624263912,0.0,0.11779986442557686,0.0,0.13863848357838288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20539850142592544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19268761792138156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17484781987897235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1474313890840406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347428201901164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489796440535627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0925880606064911,0.13732754436622002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08230713632881499,0.0,0.0,0.2981856592967045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15809999538579533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283226042240801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11679759428943927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16851805563775454,0.0,0.2158555496086651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1533710043851228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11192561948404647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16457311790393994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5132758969364509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,necknack_,2018/02/08,"Aneurysm Fear? I was minding my own buisness last night and heading to bed when a sudden pain took over the left side of my forehead. Lasted all of about 10 seconds and was abrupt, but it did make me go ""Ow!"" internally. The throbbing continued for around 20 or so seconds afterward. The event, however, left me feeling mentally discombobulated. I felt so spacy and out of it when moments earlier I had clarity. Derealization galore, feeling like I wasn't myself or in my own body. I was also very sleepy, so I fell asleep moments later. Today, I have pain, but only behind my left eye. 

Sure enough, Doc Google says that this is an aneurysm and impending death is imminent. I can't tell if I have a dilated eye just by looking at it, but one pupil is larger than the other (although this isn't much of the case when I take a pic with flash on it). The pain behind my left eye is more of a nusance than anything extreme.

I'd think that one'd know when something this serious was about to erupt, no? That's the scary thing about things like this. Anyway, health anxiety in general has been ruining my life lately.",4.139072079536042,5.936877516431927,4.974404860535767,81.7148301574151,71.95774647887325,8.016459541563105,28.961336647334992,8.671277953709913,2.271560839547087,873,35,165,16,17,283,135,213,0.14300000000000002,0.785,0.073,-0.9506,1,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,0,14,9,0,1,12,0,17,13,7,1,2,24,27,19,1,1,7,0,3,2,0,0,6,1,1,0,14,7,0,0,5,0,0,3,4,6,0,3,10,8,19,3,24,17,6,33,0,1,4,0,2,13,0,3,19,117,33,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10202250526042976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09759531391342716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10498420267383182,0.11356971456868617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417082095969142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13182014242096374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14355850222467206,0.12901254820167612,0.0911403414670625,0.12249299558687365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.072504397954453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13092981267265172,0.13560735438039015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07011244979748549,0.20798298392079168,0.14391131888837258,0.0,0.5544469203867314,0.0,0.09011072300297528,0.12465440848480767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713173452526543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515799080381166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12856663224087805,0.0,0.12881542266568885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09378306128449523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197214621070931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17289763951670534,0.09702731976456264,0.4072496727409128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10145357974338323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0982142608502569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12023889866489625,0.0,0.09592129767889787,0.0,0.11150707353752358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16951169137195454,0.08174556885899094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12092715955763612,0.0,0.14174166368511798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526358575921817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,patagoniac,2018/02/08,"The news is giving me anxiety, can anyone relate? (popular journalist dies of a heart attack after some random stomach pain) TRIGGER WARNING. Stop reading if you get easily triggered.
So this poor journalist lady who's very popular in my country died of a heart attack few days ago and the news went crazy. Of course it triggered me anxiety, as always when I hear of someone else dying. She was 50 and from what I heard she was a healthy and active woman ( this makes me even more anxious knowing that no matter how healthy you try to be you still can get a heart attack) . Apparently, she was having a heavy stomach ache and went to doc. She stayed hospitalised and suffered a heart attack during endoscopy procedure. They say that maybe there was smth wrong with the anaesthesia,  Weird bc it's one of the best private clinics there. So is stomach ache a symptom of heart attack or she died because of anesthesia negligence?. It's worth mentioning that her father's a doctor and she knew a lot about medicine and she didn't seem concerned during her stay",4.396666666666668,6.947416794871799,4.610384615384613,81.30378205128206,73.35897435897436,7.205128205128206,28.782051282051288,8.167268648758528,2.2890512820512816,845,35,141,14,18,264,123,195,0.232,0.665,0.102,-0.981,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,3,1,1,9,12,5,0,13,0,11,12,8,5,0,25,22,14,4,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,1,10,8,0,1,3,1,2,2,2,9,0,1,9,3,19,3,15,12,5,11,0,1,0,0,21,1,0,6,6,92,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08173531737966867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07672302418728368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14107512705942266,0.10416686821779934,0.0,0.0644727855814265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5244898612204173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056208101790925176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676481824777584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05946543243617625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38278230812596,0.0,0.0,0.094377050361431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07702652807515441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06090138843163299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09634796724626077,0.08845268038661985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10392319615979917,0.5463245194707733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05067416849748376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839049494122656,0.0,0.0,0.06154841811067752,0.0,0.09263361700377394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06248137201733429,0.0,0.0981139992332634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922312476394741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0733261469173979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08394114822073682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07812609479242348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.196559284717428,0.07363606653946418,0.07708859160079451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09583764598332298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0626020219328993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607985025226227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17095231904885766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10081310913087672,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,EQAD18,2018/02/09,"Terrified about continuing to go to a chiropractor I've had neck pain and stiffness for months and after an MRI and EMG found nothing like herniated discs or tumors, I tried PT and only got worse with periodic lightheadness and nausea.

I'm so desperate for relief that I started going to a chiropractor, which I've always been skeptical of as a profession. The chiropractor said x-rays show my spine is very rigid and doesn't bend like it should when I look straight up, so he thinks my cervical joints are the problem.  

My neck feels worse two days later after he used a ""chiropractic activator"" on my cervical spine (no twisting or cracking, it's a kinetic energy thing that looks like a glue gun). I'm terrified of getting a dissection of the arteries in my neck and having a stroke. But the medical literature shows that cervical dissections are rare, and my family and friends who have had benefits from chiros are encouraging me to see through a few more sessions.",14.122041198501876,9.066609780898881,13.282247191011233,52.67501872659179,55.12359550561798,17.934082397003746,49.89138576779027,15.247664890283005,7.21858127340824,783,36,132,27,6,261,119,178,0.17600000000000002,0.738,0.086,-0.9446,0,0,0,1,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,0,4,11,1,1,14,0,11,11,5,1,0,21,26,16,0,2,3,0,2,3,1,1,6,1,0,0,8,10,0,2,3,2,0,2,2,4,0,1,6,6,10,7,19,19,2,16,0,0,3,0,6,5,0,2,12,81,18,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16221109019170796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12572435362619938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18377819381161065,0.0,0.09857079898651093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2137487557288569,0.15061516871454714,0.0,0.10185149093328676,0.0,0.2215851569797465,0.0,0.15591651067325965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857230125165165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32741189337515914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1963880716052089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15560442235164793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870564075959785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14826558448813532,0.2074368020197761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1865374555567496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1854387470551696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15534710666454005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379841236248944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12951378055077692,0.12491383432627827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323558649246244,0.0,0.1904343864704373,0.0,0.0,0.16837116874331304,0.0,0.16085126442509015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3973342406136928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,peanutbuttermm,2018/02/09,"People who had the flu this season and are better now Ok so I’m usually pretty level headed about the flu. I have had it in the past and I usually don’t freak out. And I didn’t this season either until my best friend brought up how surprised he was that I wasn’t freaking out about the flu which lead me to googling everything and seeing news articles I wish I could unsee. Anyways, I am pretty sure I have the flu because my symptoms started yesterday (typical sore throat etc) and 36 hours later my temperature started rising. 

DONT READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU ARE EASILY TRIGGERED
All I can think about is that I’m dying from the flu and that my immune system will attack my organs and that I will die within a couple days all of a sudden like all these people from the news articles.

SAFE TO READ AGAIN

So people of Reddit who had the flu this season and have recovered, can you just please tell me that you feel better and that you survived?

healthanxiety,dxzsaurus,2018/02/09,"I (28F) Health anxiety - Help. How did you get over it? Health anxiety SUCKS. Like, really sucks. I literally have no reason in my current life to be so down sometimes but I am and I hate it. I'm literally crying. My grandmother, two of her sons, and one of my female cousins have diabetes. My mom does not and neither does my 14 year old sister. I'm 28, eat relatively healthy but was pretty sedentary up until 3 weeks ago. 

I weigh 151.7 and I've started exercising 6 days per week (1 hour Zumba) super high intensity with plyometrics incorporated and have felt pretty great. I have remained at around the same weight despite all of this. I went out last Thursday (about a week ago) and got drunk which I never really do. I rarely drink but I felt so terrible and I'm not doing that again. I was super dehydrated and felt like crap all weekend but I still went to Zumba that Saturday. Out of nowhere, I start thinking about diabetes and now I'm freaked the heck out.

 I went through all of my medical records from the past couple of years to try to calm me down, fasting glucose at 96, at 78, at 87, most recent in December 2017 was 96. On 5/5/2016 my a1c with eAG estimation was 5.0 and my a1c today was 4.9. I did eat a small tub of mangoes from HEB and a green juice prior to my glucose test and that came back at 148. This was literally 10-15 mins after eating. I've had some random shooting pain all over my body for a while now, and for the past couple of days (Sunday) I have cold feet I cannot warm up at all. 

Granted, my whole legs hurt and they feel cold from my butt down. My muscles are pretty sore as I've been doing squats and jumping all over the place for an hour daily. I took a rest day today. I seem to find charts and charts about ""normal"" diabetic ranges but not normal non diabetic ranges for immediately post meal and that 148 is freaking me out despite of the a1c level.

Should I be worried? Also, I started new birth control (Vienva - generic for Aviane) and I think this may be causing the cold feet? and maybe the anxiety to go to extremes? I asked the Dr. on Nurx about the birth control and she said it's not a normal side effect of the medication although it is my experience that sometimes they aren't aware of all. 

My health anxiety started about two years ago with a diagnosis of H. Pylori (which has been resolved naturally) as the Flagyl and antibiotics caused the first ever anxiety bout I've ever had and continues today.  I also had my gallbladder removed and then went to a gastro who said I didn't even need it taken out despite pain attacks. 

I've had EKG's, Echo, CT of the pelvis and abdomen with contrast ad I was also getting palpitations. Determined those are PVC's but I did not want to take beta blockers if nothing is structurally wrong with my heart. 

I just want to be the old me. Three year ago me who gave no fucks about anything until that shit. 

TL;DR: Is it diabetes or just health anxiety? Help! I want to be the old me :(",2.956202415332108,4.98273494709898,4.269846416382253,84.5216454449987,75.80887372013652,7.1698083486479405,25.60370175899186,8.07648339933343,1.5725600945129958,2333,84,463,39,52,768,287,586,0.13699999999999998,0.768,0.095,-0.966,1,0,1,1,0,0,78.0,0,1,2,7,23,22,7,0,25,0,42,36,10,7,10,91,81,45,0,9,15,4,6,2,0,2,17,4,0,0,20,36,8,3,11,4,0,9,12,14,0,5,31,14,56,8,74,43,13,95,0,1,1,2,17,29,7,7,58,294,76,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2252078410520182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15237807761992206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2915314867220545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05226719648134814,0.056541559915773275,0.05937768221577126,0.07225715460946168,0.0,0.04883889328803937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07055052708294901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07264391044587377,0.0,0.13049421108609538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14247430139093453,0.0,0.14055564235014734,0.06976792912407312,0.1228852051246864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111643056369258,0.0,0.0,0.06222023782508505,0.0,0.19497422167838888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04195086850292848,0.11490538726027234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06212957622164347,0.0,0.0,0.03211494698095746,0.0,0.1829522529542593,0.0,0.05805129644576824,0.05402558190064775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058718328129311034,0.06636763148691924,0.0,0.036096874740487415,0.0,0.050798517666604766,0.07002519462133806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06270762897993036,0.0,0.2700526766959904,0.0,0.0752652399771552,0.08514514574611455,0.06710678082509272,0.0,0.0,0.1250983952519901,0.0,0.06799381324119598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05177296778229806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04486231970447504,0.06206016042988604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06380906553942355,0.0,0.0,0.12796878126465938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07438766349359552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047095354434917316,0.048986461742303165,0.06134290499811022,0.0,0.0,0.18669279803490915,0.06094407952618198,0.0,0.19994401894241007,0.0,0.04303921287975574,0.0,0.13516826417682032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12126395960508725,0.0,0.0,0.06635935601565343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060829537368221775,0.19385188931346106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08137830227064496,0.06530370268309099,0.0627131159994541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12083407238500572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05782140870147873,0.0,0.0,0.06519693952317622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125635349214006,0.0,0.17982416131307935,0.0,0.05072293134889246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04775515920338083,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08139532615791227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18061356225661213,0.0,0.07056718245925056,0.043122320488187996,0.0,0.12408928988566248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1123878689067224,0.0,0.1528430133592703,0.07734380871101333,0.0,0.23551509879746124,0.0,0.07091190812682807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06450227349548791,0.0,0.0,0.06944336727673169,0.0,0.16360556943438825
healthanxiety,kupukupuchowkit,2018/02/09,"Skin condition Hi guys

Lately i have been having a severe skin issue whereby the skin above my ankle sort of dried off and created this ulcer looking condition.

I have went to the doctor to get it tested and was advised that it might be due to my severe ezcema and also diabetic condition. However the weird thing is that the left leg now has the same thing too and its spreading towards my knee area.",7.8913636363636375,7.25066225974026,8.161655844155845,70.83391233766237,62.766233766233775,10.816883116883119,33.535714285714285,10.125756701596842,3.368535064935065,322,11,55,6,4,106,56,77,0.087,0.887,0.025,-0.5994,1,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,6,0,9,8,5,0,0,7,12,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,0,0,1,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,4,5,0,6,7,1,8,0,0,1,0,3,4,0,2,3,42,13,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1996548838919909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.255539985106062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13043826873599015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24720496944091105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26058261968466745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816299951668161,0.0,0.2712588639915998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20965348736721826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648522899815213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5640947635252618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3317291314579117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2314394913609455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,omentext,2018/02/09,"Frequent cold sores (ulcers) on lips and intense fear of Bell’s Palsy returning Hi all, frequently ill and frequently anxious person here. I’m going to be seeing my doctor (again) to ask about this issue but lately (past few months) after a really bad flu that resulted in a mouth full of ulcers and palsy afterward (which I luckily recovered from), I’ve been terrified of this happening again. I feel I have been getting more frequent tiny ulcers on my mouth almost every month or so. It scares me every time I feel a warm bump. I have no idea why they are so much more common now and it’s disheartening (and discouraging - they’re ugly!). And, it scares me that the palsy could return or flare up again as I’ve read that it’s very possible :( 

All of this stresses me out so much and I know that can’t be doing my body any favors.

healthanxiety,ThaRudistMonk,2018/02/10,"Another Small Tip If you start to panic. And you need to tell someone. Try, instead of telling them your symptoms, just standing next to them and don't say anything about your symptoms. Worse case scenario something happens you are right next to someone who will help you now you can relax.

healthanxiety,Holdingdownback,2018/02/10,"Does this sound like you? I have health anxiety.  It sucks, but I find a lot of comfort reading posts here from people who suffer the same thing.  I haven’t beaten it, but I’m so much better than I was 7 years ago.  Here’s some of the things that go through my head:

Is that gas pain or is this the heart attack?  I should check my pulse to make sure (20 times a day)


I used to never get headaches, must be cancer!


My mouth is sore... gotta be cancer.


I slept too much and am still tired.  Definitely on my death bed.


My eyes are red today.  Not dry eyes, definitely cancer.


Lemme check my strength to make sure I am not getting ALS


Feel kinda weak today.  Definitely cancer and not exhaustion from 9 hours of work.



That’s the second time I’ve had diarrhea this week- probably cancer and not my IBS.


Feeling a bit chilled; I’ll be dead by tomorrow.  Likely cancer.


Haven’t I already had a cold this year?  Two in one year must be cancer.


Shit lemme check my pulse again...


Sore shoulders?  Cancer from that sunburn I got 15 years ago probably.


Slight cough?  Definitely cancer from second hand smoke.


These may sound silly but are things that have gone through my head, obsessively, for years.  I get blood work done every year and it always comes back outstanding.  Sometimes it helps to see how silly it looks. 


EDIT: Forgot to add my personal favorite- “is that spot on my body sore? Lemme poke it and prod it 100 times over the course of the day.  Shit, it’s sore now.  Gotta be cancer”",1.4635679513184598,3.9861669551724175,2.303367139959434,93.7404056795132,84.6206896551724,5.204868154158215,17.83975659229209,6.661559191721324,-0.08012373225152157,1147,27,240,13,34,358,161,290,0.318,0.55,0.131,-0.9981,0,0,1,0,0,1,48.0,0,1,0,5,9,19,5,1,10,0,25,34,13,4,5,34,45,11,2,3,8,0,3,2,0,6,21,2,1,1,23,7,0,1,3,1,3,3,7,10,0,4,8,11,23,9,22,26,6,31,0,1,5,0,4,4,3,5,25,135,46,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19030652730164374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845588245170663,0.0,0.08931813544773662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08211724863869889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1221183783139098,0.0,0.08254028932105906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09493633083093553,0.1171909648343838,0.11923408834913013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09246665573398026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13845495807953148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09393675134417488,0.1098493549386444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09044126956161708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10855188710788727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09810973348304212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16824716334712594,0.0,0.06100561016184052,0.0,0.0858521572254655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2203301685364876,0.11410079429396253,0.0,0.12720220024016696,0.07194987939959288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10571142221427254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488492372222988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09014124683189284,0.0,0.0,0.09125934384291473,0.0,0.0,0.14330482938170144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15781919546728768,0.0,0.08278968774288156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07273852546768682,0.0,0.11422072533851207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07441825408095913,0.09372793548499046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10280510625061222,0.0,0.2314682344061757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10737224133745324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08553862684776324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2203724895792613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616516238315284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08572441238702512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2023393776153464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2139421425485383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18777803676212584,0.12337520923883767,0.2034975908243853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10485870173593492,0.0,0.0,0.09271005353293472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08610423437847946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15629424553925492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.414752980457836
healthanxiety,catch_99,2018/02/10,"Rabies Anxiety - Long Term Incubation I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety, but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years, as high as 25 years in one case (although the evidence for it is not definite). A few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 - 6 years, and around 15.  

My fear here is that despite not having rabies yet, I am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity, which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses. 

11 years and 8 months ago I handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. We kept them for probably 3 days, and I would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well, before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. After dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. My father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. I called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back, but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local, unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. Still, it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.

I don't recall the animals behaving strangely, but that doesn't say much. I also don't recall being scratched to show blood (maybe some white-marking from their little claws, but no deep contact) and if they did get saliva on me, I don't imagine it was on an open wound. My aunt, father, two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. We never heard anything back from the animal hospital. The only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003, before this happened in 2006. In that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild (not humans). For the length of time we had the animals, we would have seen some sort of odd behavior. 

And it's been almost 12 years. What are the chances I'm a case study for long term rabies incubation?

healthanxiety,Jsch2,2018/02/10,"I feel like im becoming stupid Hi, I've suffered from health anxiety for a few years now, but it's starting to drive me crazy. I started getting terrible headaches a few months ago, it eventually got so bad that I had to go to the hospital and get a CT scan. They said there was nothing wrong with me. I continued to get headaches and I constantly felt like I was going crazy. I went to a chiropractor and was told that all of my pain is coming from my neck and my back, and for some reason I still feel like there is something wrong with my brain. I just recently started having trouble reading, the best way to describe it is that it's like I'm stuttering when I'm reading, I'm constantly reading stuff and not being able to understand what I just read, and then reading it again and realizing that I missed a few words or completely replaced a word with another word. I'm trying to avoid reading because its causing be to become extremely paranoid. I feel like I'm becoming less intelligent or becoming brain dead or something. I'm slowly starting to go crazy and I don't know what to do. I'm probably going to get an MRI just to prove to myself that there is nothing going on with my brain. I really scared and I don't know what to do.",6.1137005163511215,5.818919558232932,6.842814113597246,77.6812951807229,66.26907630522088,10.487779690189328,35.05479059093517,10.125756701596842,3.396522432587493,986,43,196,21,14,327,123,249,0.2,0.6890000000000001,0.112,-0.9758,0,1,2,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,1,12,18,1,2,9,0,15,7,4,2,2,40,48,17,1,0,8,0,4,5,0,0,3,1,0,0,15,15,0,1,10,6,0,8,3,12,0,0,9,6,24,6,25,37,7,27,0,2,1,0,4,1,0,4,22,123,39,6,0.08351825276323238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07403389187159022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757617011285597,0.0638912347643623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06422038110084602,0.06973425249755055,0.0509119516960706,0.3689573939244827,0.0,0.0,0.0876472536082903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2797019736849378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579625174937824,0.0,0.07194357954403095,0.087567299020995,0.1805071216683737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12668801411941344,0.17899636938536753,0.08019062006371812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745393599201095,0.0,0.23732673862117584,0.0,0.0667971762723451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08877599719774631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09021404478842067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09179889505533756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2040139981510893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666347254500267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1602760320521094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08886930941472726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09004680228635907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5012451239312995,0.0,0.053503931327212775,0.08587067378595804,0.08246419888660396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0794449838652743,0.0,0.0836163408929911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12859286261958042,0.0,0.0,0.2364585966876149,0.0,0.06669778454164256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09560841784699388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798052696113613,0.0,0.056703411344139976,0.0,0.0,0.08694544655590516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629290158877735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07742225704508561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826281969632552,0.0,0.053783016526044274

Lately since I got a big job my anxiety has latched back to my health again because it constantly needs to focus on something with me. I'm a massive worrier in general, its terrible but Im trying my best all the time. a few months ago it hyper fixated on blood clots on my legs and DVT thus causing like intense leg pains and what not i think after months of just fixating on it (and also developing a real actual flu that was debilitating and not from my hell brain I just wore it out of my brain which is cool i guess. except not really because I've recently developed a lump in my neck (most likely frm flu). its painless goes from feeling tender to firm but it swims around a little on my neck and goes from unnoticeable to like really noticeable. what has me freaking out though is that its on top of an artery, we went to the er after i had one really bad freak out and managed to at least get a nurse to check it (we would have stuck around for the doctor but it was like 1am and we would have had to wait til like 5 am. also my mom kind of started giving me flack on all of this bc she's extremely impatient on my hypochondria and really horrible about it) who took my blood pressure and kinda felt it , she assumes its a lymph node and i know a nurse isnt a doctor but im trying my best to be rational in that ok maybe she is right because nurses do experience a lot of shit with patients and should be pretty well versed on things. but idk its been  like 2 weeks and its still there and my brain is just. in literal hell . im just freaking out that every day is my last and i just have  clot hanging out there even though its like painless and not red or like super hot to touch and in like like the next 20 minutes i mgonna just endure a stroke or something and my brain is fried enough as is so im not even processing thoughts properly or anything. also w hypochondria since im like still googling shit on what it may be!!! im starting to endure what im assuming is sensations im  making up like pains in my neck whatever. but im also like paranoid that im actually right on all of this because this is the most real physical thing ive experienced i guess with my hypochondria. also ive seen some stuff with swollen things in necks with cancer and at this point im just trying to not even look into that because i think i'll literally have another break down, im sorry i guess, i just needed to vent somewhere where others would get what im experiencing because at home its been very much condescending and dismissive and i feel extremely trapped and upset. I'd love to go back to the doctors again myself but I have really bad agoraphobia as well and due to how condescending my folks have been with me i feel extremely embarrassed/ashamed/upset on any of my emotions on all of this and how much im fixating. its just really scary and im just really sad at this point. anyway thank you for reading this if you do and being patient with me if you respond",2.6175709680773664,4.644423674846628,4.085167931787463,85.45673338879071,76.82208588957054,7.487823645627536,24.701154206093374,8.388109219054641,1.6190667255901008,2564,89,520,50,59,849,277,652,0.133,0.72,0.146,0.8854,1,1,2,0,0,0,38.0,3,3,0,4,40,42,4,2,20,2,40,31,14,5,5,119,73,53,0,8,30,1,7,13,0,5,16,0,1,0,48,48,0,1,11,2,1,5,7,17,3,2,17,13,53,25,89,47,17,76,3,2,3,1,15,46,4,17,37,349,101,6,0.0,0.0,0.08184381259570149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03717229817108856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04627563168797545,0.16767454482832442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028516816756937,0.04397185431995758,0.06415937266405608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03450842214188764,0.07466097856733601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06448990035758638,0.07002691229776213,0.1533768549302454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08801509045763482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1872505488502856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0430781601691469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04531616789983043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02704420630218424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12876484617709238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04717053389179664,0.0,0.04332942486212947,0.0,0.0830917885581148,0.0,0.035331524218162616,0.0,0.0,0.08203974148558567,0.0,0.0,0.06360984836131592,0.0,0.040263581505390035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045978883804432415,0.0,0.0,0.043817966106621566,0.04022727891408792,0.02383227483785354,0.0,0.033538754894705224,0.0,0.13858634365900574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08914857114344664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04206360279988723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.724741231307759,0.0,0.04161340210277592,0.0,0.0,0.04366820429386122,0.02304603886482253,0.034182117045582314,0.04730380777977393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029619493120868024,0.2663312618645642,0.04202926585600038,0.0,0.0,0.035214318208200215,0.0,0.0,0.03565111074566302,0.03784741566295896,0.0,0.02799152463483352,0.0,0.04212872161413099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0491130396653612,0.06694324493601117,0.0,0.06165318945400833,0.062187623640456935,0.0,0.0,0.04459768943720578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047742570181574406,0.0,0.0,0.05683164304552614,0.0,0.08924227497192122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07928308799585966,0.0,0.0,0.04266234068895447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041945728576798215,0.09546101131271052,0.1880496657462181,0.0,0.041405141779789406,0.0,0.0,0.07162346370756678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860900780177775,0.0693771058377249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06456626973305431,0.0,0.046942105793850636,0.059362740759561224,0.0,0.06697770093279047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04800483300322468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07721508707513636,0.0,0.0,0.11143735638060596,0.053739715625195465,0.08240063193196741,0.033291214031313,0.024452274518990638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04659063974354219,0.08541207522055598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034600255667354016,0.0,0.0,0.033637230624642765,0.0,0.075408088440391,0.03887359088119173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08936694233385532,0.0,0.0,0.027004366193720115
healthanxiety,love901,2018/02/11,"HELP! Testicles question... Recently, I noticed one of my testicles is hanging higher than my other. They used to hang at the same height. It doesn’t hurt, but I’m soooooo paranoid about what’s going on. I think I might have testicular torsion (I don’t know how, maybe my skinny jeans?), but I read online that it would hurt like a motherfucker if I did. I’m paranoid and I need help! Im going to try and schedule an appointment for next week with a urologist but I’m literally bedridden with anxiety right now. Trying to move as little as possible.

Any ideas?

healthanxiety,weezylane,2018/02/11,Return of anxiety after periods of well being/healthy lifestyle. I'm starting to see a pattern in which different HA develops for me and how it always seems to happen after a short period of little to no anxiety(typically after resolution of previous anxiety) OR after you start making healthy choices. When I start running or working out I feel at my best but that also comes with me being hyper-aware of my surroundings. I'm beginning to think that it is this self consciousness and overly attachment that I have developed and reinforced over the years which has led to this becoming a persistent problem. I have a consistent HA of rabies and hence I'm super aware of all the potential causes that could transmit the virus to me. As you all know by now that this attitude is more destructive than defensive. It has gone to the point that I've started reading scientific literature in hopes of finding the best treatment for my anxiety rather than the health issues. Has anybody noticed similar spikes in their anxiety? ,7.047969735182848,8.861935032786889,7.696721311475412,64.95348045397228,64.79234972677595,11.532408575031528,37.02774274905423,11.362043627235082,5.094563177805801,833,42,124,27,13,276,113,183,0.08199999999999999,0.762,0.157,0.9438,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,2,1,5,6,10,2,0,10,2,9,1,0,4,2,27,27,11,0,4,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,14,7,0,1,6,1,0,4,1,3,1,0,1,2,13,7,33,24,5,30,0,0,1,0,4,11,0,4,15,98,27,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122891587996674,0.12613757037683135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4638731060558932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16742262549124973,0.0,0.0,0.31817512933107583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15572783157861494,0.0,0.13058399883392027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12103472373656365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583824835027053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665000635632928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13855331114822314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13405324294124593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16113633472262287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15056611419521124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15822377026661433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0833115816646626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15193607175646645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1011895451627021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1725897043693001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14330444157750394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450540860085246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15163408394419564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080004256538328,0.13800462903233854,0.15814462353760944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42919339446028176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09713471224285146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363003671721464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11036155366083107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09762096092290397
healthanxiety,Hopefullhypochon,2018/02/11,"Aches and Pains after a flu Hey all. So I was suffering from a gastro flu for the last 5 weeks. Reduced appetite, nausea, chills, aches and pains, diarrhea etc. all the good stuff. Felt like it took forever to get over. I even had a bad relapse last weekend.... Anyway, i seem to be coming out the other end and am starting to feel better. However, I am still getting aches and pains in my muscles. Seems to be pretty inconsistent, sometimes it's my back muscles (around my shoulder blades), sometimes it's my shoulders, arms, and forearms. I've had it in my legs too but that seems to have died down.

Anyone else have aches and pains last for a long time after the flu? If so how long we talking? a couple of weeks after? or a month?

healthanxiety,DEADGL0RY,2018/02/12,"Has anyone here ever actually been diagnosed with what they were worried they might have had? I've been convinced I have MS for years. I go back and forth between being 100% convinced that I have it, and then not feeling anything for a while and my worries going away again until bang -- I get dizzy or my arm feels weird. Then it's back again for a couple months.

I suppose it doesn't help that MS effects a large portion of my family and I've had some very convincing symptoms.

healthanxiety,patrickstarrshouse,2018/02/12,"Obsesssion with Hepatitis C from manicures I'm a woman in her late 20s.  Now that I am talking with my husband about having a baby, I'm starting to worry that I could have hep c, and could pass it to my baby.  You might think ""Easy, just get tested"" but that would stress me out more than anything.  There are so many false positives, not to mention the fact that if the healthcare law changes, I could have a ""preexisting condition"" on my record.

My therapist doesn't think I should worry.  I am not a baby boomer, IV drug user, never had any blood transfusions, my only unprotected sex partner is my husband, etc...none of the major risk factors.  But I can't stop thinking about the few manicures I've gotten in my life.  I've only ever gotten about ten manicures at a salon, but I've read that this is a possible mode of transmission.  Of course the logic side of my brain tells me that most women get FAR more than 10 manis in their life, and most women do not have hep c...but I can't stop thinking about it, especially because I've bled on a few occasions during manis (I've had probably about 20 pedicures in my life, but they were at a high end salon that showed off how well they sterilized everything)

Also, I got a tooth pulled in 1997...I assume that's late enough in history for them to be sanitizing everything, but who knows?

About 4 years ago, I had a CMP blood test done and my liver enzymes showed up normal.  I assume that if I had had hep C for *that* long, something would have been amiss.  But I still can't stop worrying.

my therapist thinks I'm clinging to this because I'm secretly more worried about being a mother, or the changes a baby will bring, but I've hyperfocused on this to distract me from the ""real"" concerns....

Anyway, is he right?  am I unnecessarily obsessing over this?  How often do you hear about young women with no risk factors coming down with hep C?",5.13579268292683,5.842027731707318,6.107605013550137,78.65864329268294,68.4308943089431,9.293631436314364,28.925135501355015,9.408791572840183,2.4571363143631446,1479,50,284,29,24,491,191,369,0.087,0.8640000000000001,0.048,-0.9294,2,0,2,0,0,0,58.0,0,2,4,0,20,6,0,5,19,0,36,11,5,2,3,54,55,17,0,9,14,3,0,0,1,5,5,1,0,5,17,9,0,3,10,3,0,4,9,5,1,1,11,1,34,1,44,34,9,39,0,0,0,1,22,20,0,9,15,189,51,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08592803274402859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07751979020524695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06591989423864529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07977017762273178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11818273338892585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10821278266740993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20509115000245215,0.08350189490922044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2321868423099275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09919931913966176,0.0,0.0,0.11241513861199816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0858566413008036,0.10016093762071414,0.10810941174041938,0.0,0.08768428162041995,0.0,0.0,0.17423989097691073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10129025676746993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07752868051154409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10925406652552633,0.0,0.0,0.10241834623782947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053273563369209215,0.0,0.2186963595906514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20540657155798428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08578542693451087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.294834071137193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10283391798145924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07476312137168384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497682844244366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14744859387889575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10928092456673393,0.0,0.0,0.10451354615772317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09696236487800944,0.1103345409006287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08278292757658025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07462617073400069,0.0,0.0,0.06861189357038723,0.0,0.07741332069897194,0.24312884205837176,0.11104001236179864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07791359149545977,0.08472645251128251,0.0,0.0,0.2251006425632384,0.0,0.3105637982512552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871572247544033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3937733921230113,0.0,0.13772129470810812,0.0,0.0,0.06242369120805341
healthanxiety,NerdyB1714,2018/02/12,"Flu Shot Hello everyone,

I don't know why, but I never got a vaccine this flu season. I usually get one every year. Is it too late to get one?

Note: I'm OCD and I constantly wash my hands and cover my nose when people cough (germaphobic). Will these habits already decrease my chances of getting sick?

Thank you!",0.7216757741347912,3.25687260655738,2.3353005464480887,90.39162112932608,93.42622950819671,5.334061930783244,21.531876138433514,6.937597516519254,0.9211952641165756,243,9,47,4,9,79,51,61,0.16699999999999998,0.75,0.083,-0.7545,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,0,3,7,2,0,1,5,10,4,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,1,2,8,1,2,8,0,7,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,7,25,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2860652521058987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28013406887985737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21841131096608352,0.2477040760237401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4063087978650611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20732882565414726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14246528199464595,0.0,0.292421198900808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999331093210292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3513200728416063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17971650013775814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386629046953391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2855037251476016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2339135285850211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16693474602906105

healthanxiety,shorthandshorthand,2018/02/12,"Obsessive googling of symptoms hi,
I'm pretty new to posting but I've struggled with health anxiety for about 18 months now. Thought I got on top of it, but I think I was spending my time worrying about other stuff...anyway.
My first obsession was a brain tumour but now it's liver cancer, because on saturday I went out and got drunk and now I'm obsessed I've lost all alcohol tolerance which could be a symptom. As soon as I read that (on some shitty health forum) my left side started hurting and I'm convinced I'm yellow now.
How do I stop the constant cycle of needing reassurance/worrying about symptoms appearing before they have?
Desperately trying to rationalise (I drank about 8 measures of gin, usually that wouldn't affect me as much as it did and I'd eaten...so clearly I'm stressing tf out).",3.275569892473122,5.72780885806452,4.655483870967744,80.08989247311828,76.54838709677419,7.488172043010754,30.333333333333336,8.447377352677275,2.7067978494623657,643,31,112,13,15,213,104,155,0.259,0.659,0.08199999999999999,-0.9844,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,0,1,3,10,8,0,5,3,0,8,11,2,2,2,22,23,12,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,7,0,0,0,7,7,3,1,2,2,1,2,1,7,0,1,9,1,12,1,21,11,3,25,0,2,1,0,2,8,0,2,14,68,19,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584601639617878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11342945538481955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09038665436287203,0.0,0.12617053255198227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16552318776408134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16023187358515084,0.0,0.11838498603914566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12612206799495965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23717705108564024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31521735494776953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1587307352397048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611004916564054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16185894487739716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11835115431292755,0.0,0.10899869204025284,0.10994353573480252,0.0,0.14320427032896516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1420058198015415,0.15084829757073898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14831445354362652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10494933280854148,0.0,0.0,0.12396397783115608,0.16984774222078353,0.1550085218566749,0.16973863170097744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4623414013161602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09500820258668094,0.0,0.11771325435003308,0.0864599532832734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10066853600417176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1633032246983134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374517879279747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3011595558040578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,gunoier,2018/02/12,"My health anxiety caused me to get a CT scan and now my anxiety is in overdrive over radiation risks I am a hypochondriac but this time I have been having some severe abdominal pain for 2 weeks. It's constant, not one second of peace, sleeping is very difficult. I've visited doctors, blood tests are normal. I even managed to do an endoscopy, which has always been one of my worst nightmares. It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. I've been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isn't much wrong, just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad I've irradiated myself for nothing (although, I don't really regret it, never had such pain in my life). The risk is like a 0,2% increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless it's an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so that's why I didn't get an MRI.

How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer. One way of dealing with the risk is to think of it like a screening, at least I know there isn't anything sinister going around in my belly.",3.851560828877005,5.649767665441178,5.1965240641711254,79.82708556149733,72.71323529411767,7.886631016042781,27.804812834224602,8.575989854853784,2.153192647058823,1103,42,205,20,22,368,150,272,0.248,0.637,0.115,-0.9923,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,1,15,20,0,5,16,0,27,17,4,3,3,36,38,14,0,2,8,0,0,2,0,2,13,1,0,0,11,10,0,0,5,1,0,6,9,14,1,4,8,7,24,6,27,27,10,31,0,2,6,1,4,10,0,5,15,147,35,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09037982555335798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11389663868433204,0.1661866891798266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0893842970474203,0.09669406295475433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12237657482633857,0.0,0.09606480225056314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1242313593823102,0.0,0.11158177702194848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2347574047839469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11198156361137483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11348388261259368,0.0,0.3335288763025729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07174191738026638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17024705225802947,0.0,0.12346152047541495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11545706627319928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05969423855978739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1534418212820013,0.10613165021496887,0.1088649132814926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1152277423133815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07984756558006617,0.0,0.16754755343492175,0.0,0.0,0.10193170457443736,0.10642369490853512,0.2084459880909744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22080942049976304,0.0,0.4623136915666251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10368925938428217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06958420226317129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0927601518446604,0.1033216754161008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24541742137231184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10869758317385138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08674338529756874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12434292808953465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08166807525835255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06959875889045228,0.0,0.0,0.0633366938686397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08962216579393813,0.0,0.0862168173130073,0.08712772208602597,0.0,0.09766165125168702,0.0,0.0980118789800357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11875797797671335,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,marie-mariahh,2018/02/12,"Im scared of car rides Kinda sound weird but ive gotten into too many car crashes in the past 3 months (not because of me, i was the passenger). I cant just get into a car for a ride without worrying that someone is gonna hit me. When im on freeways i get too scared because cars arent braking at the right time i want them to, cars are too close, were going too fast.
I hate how scared i get, is there anything i can do about it? Is anyone else like this? How do they deal with it ?

healthanxiety,_Jerov_,2018/02/12,"I'm 16 and going through hell. My anxiety exists due to my high heart rate and I have some questions. I've been dealing with this crap for almost 3 years. It all started with a bad infection that almost costed me a finger. Since then I've thought I had cancer, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders, neurological disorders, diabetes, severe mental issues beyond anxiety, and a whole bunch of crap. Luckily, I saw how ridiculous this was before it got too severe (hehe it probably is but not as much as it could possibly get). 

Now my problem is my heart. I know it is supposed to speed up when having stress, anxiety or panic, I know why my fingers tingle, I know why I hyperventilate and how it makes things worse, I know why I get headaches, I know! My issue is that it speeds up in a way that I think is too fast. For example, during anxious moments my heart rate is around 100-120: normal and I understand. During panic attacks my heart rate is about 180-205: not normal. 
My question is if anyone relates to this? 

The funny (not really funny) thing about anxiety is that the symptoms cycle. Anxiety is a smart cookie who knows how to fool you pretty bad. I've been writing down EVERYTHING since this started and I've learned a lot about how it works. I've solved my past ""diseases"" by finding the flaw in my thinking process but this time I can't. I can count my heart rate when it is  that fast. I believe heart anxiety is one of the most difficult ones to beat because the heart does some weird things that we're not supposed to feel but anxiety allows you to. I get ectopic beats ( My heart stops for a few seconds and then beats strongly again) which I know are normal but I feel them and people are not supposed to feel them. It's all due to my anxiety. 

Anyway, I'll repeat my question again: Does anyone else gets heart rate of 180 to 205 BPM during panic attacks?

healthanxiety,Pop437,2018/02/12,"15 year old, Sophomore suffering from Health Anxiety ever since I was in elementary school. It's been inherently worse ever since I tried marijuana last summer. Haven't tried no other drugs since but still. It was a bad trip, i had wayy too much.

Current fears that have come and gone:

-Heart Attack
-Heart arrhythmia
-Cancer (Brain)
-ALS or some motor-neuron disease

My current goals are to gain more muscle and be overall more athletic. I want to get rid of my fat and gain muscle. And consequently after sitting in front of a screen for pretty much all of my life i have gained little to no muscle and am extremely weak. So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased (went from 70-80bpm to now about 40-50bpm while resting) 

Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible? No. That's why all of us worry about this! All the diseases we can get, and death... don't get me started on that. Doesn't help I'm an athiest and have severe DPDR.


God, The story of a boy who lived a sedentary lifestyle up until he was in Grade 9 and then overexercised and killed himself in the process. WTF. I don't want that to be my life story FFS. Just scared. The hospital nearest to me has a bad reputation and houses many drug addicts and is overall filled with sketchy patients so i wouldn't exactly feel safe there. But I'm hanging in there. It's late where i am, school tomorrow. Took 0.5mg Lorazepam about an hour ago. I hope i'll live to see tomorrow ;(",2.4827893302739104,4.9594733760218,3.2239903915101102,89.14994801376741,79.5449591280654,6.151986232611503,24.09931163057508,7.3759095455046575,1.091598365122616,1487,53,295,21,38,468,210,367,0.241,0.665,0.094,-0.997,4,0,2,0,0,0,54.0,2,0,0,5,22,14,3,3,14,0,29,19,7,1,6,48,54,30,3,6,7,0,5,0,0,4,10,0,0,1,14,22,4,3,1,1,0,12,10,10,0,0,11,7,27,4,35,37,11,57,0,1,2,0,7,12,1,5,32,177,41,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10169897747075714,0.0,0.0,0.08269523035615041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07136596824791966,0.0,0.09251780016545208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08304714969228733,0.0,0.10612991123926696,0.0,0.0,0.1557851391630489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08250669967602425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10414157876532296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09583368674464783,0.0,0.08036036918549043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09681944158758804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2163716655943992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16877081054129206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049762647474339,0.047169813023560096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14621924037010445,0.0,0.10603678301279867,0.0,0.14922376061393225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09916203718018728,0.0,0.33164438655317485,0.06252977168371861,0.0,0.0,0.1853144126630763,0.09187105177353563,0.10764318981981023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10321065701757227,0.0,0.0,0.07604313379106166,0.10523425974544504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13178581509214582,0.0,0.09350026747512387,0.16475211221239994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945805873858868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13715656429485965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09789130270384626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08905507931338294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09490863531137828,0.10058151570392712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1867974895518828,0.1888272636224176,0.07433939919793256,0.0,0.0,0.10539022100735614,0.09576000386486984,0.23150932405179614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13206112517149754,0.0,0.07450086058534729,0.07799393266740558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054397671749347815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10364771282904542,0.12667446069744184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11221539854822636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1650731282723241,0.0,0.07483095401433268,0.3408032712236844,0.0,0.08648000556476647,0.0841789757979878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09473969183822052,0.09506964552540012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12015034812931664
healthanxiety,ManningBro4,2018/02/12,"HELP: Do I have Toe Nail Fungus? https://www.dropbox.com/s/o2vmiq0r8copo39/Toenail%20fungus%3F.jpg?dl=0 in the picture in the link below, you'll see that I have a white streak on my toenail, and I've felt a tingling feeling in that toe. However, the feeling did go away.  I also sprayed a bunch of bleach when I was cleaning my bathtub last night. Any chance this feeling is just the symptom of bleach possibly getting into my toenails, or is this actually a symptom of toenail fungus?

healthanxiety,Wheretheusernamegoes,2018/02/12,"Do I have an aneurysm? Why do I keep thingking my jugular vein is hemorrhaging? I am a 21 year old male. While I often get random stinging senations all over my body, and have gotten panic attacks for several diffirent reasons, my first panic attack, and main source of worry it would seem is my neck. My first panic attack was in the gym a few years ago when I was pushing myself which raised my heart rate, I felt a throbbing in my right jugular and convinced myself that I had burst it, aninhad somebody call the ambulance while hoping the blood transfusions would arrive in time. I hyperventilated on purpose to make up for the ""blood loss"", which made the experience worse and left me scrutinizing my beating and and feeling a drowning sensation for half a year.

Sometime later I got some sort of cramp near my left jugular, which freaked my out so I went to the doctor, and they said my jugular was fine. Then less then a week ago I sneezed strongly which made my left jugular pulsate strongly, which freaked me out because... Well why only one side? 

Today I was at the supermarket, coughed strongly and felt pain in the left jugular when I did that. Within a few minutes I was about to pass out, my hands were cold, and my whole body was buzzing, which of course ""confirmed"" to me that I was in fact losing blood. I did mange to snap out of it but why won't this just go away?",6.816590909090909,6.794758083333337,6.426272727272727,80.33690909090909,64.75757575757575,8.706666666666669,34.266666666666666,8.021203637495839,2.4716593939393943,1090,44,207,11,15,339,148,264,0.109,0.8420000000000001,0.049,-0.9268,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,1,8,8,18,3,3,16,0,21,14,9,4,2,33,36,17,1,3,2,0,4,0,0,3,5,1,0,1,13,13,0,1,5,1,0,4,1,11,1,4,19,6,36,7,29,14,7,44,0,2,0,0,4,22,0,6,18,146,49,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17655876806309675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3398896097577134,0.0935668728475086,0.0,0.0,0.06070835426791561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22124121593245025,0.0,0.0,0.10169120927187973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10193326630054766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741686956132152,0.0,0.0,0.05035504491213368,0.0,0.19124156154350505,0.0,0.0,0.16942021449541042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052030991460414976,0.0,0.05659855984886687,0.0,0.07965019030199368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11801310279663353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09891406149791214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08851902273224124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43281370636635996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11141429452143874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1884664938198006,0.066476238340005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450160024372757,0.0,0.06748388838468414,0.07574170284290269,0.10596941071325433,0.35053768657553475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1023937820444016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08504821559872895,0.09473167035696553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0906618227883804,0.0,0.11250689735561256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09849578229062762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0580709786296112,0.0,0.09439845403413882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798840573806696,0.0,0.08954221188954936,0.09231973342867238,0.2695899666709237,0.11118724003028282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10113717082347766,0.10148940526478348,0.14148992682139605,0.0,0.0,0.1923955954596957
healthanxiety,Hank2011,2018/02/13,"I’m worried sick about melanoma Three years ago when I was twelve I had a blue speck on my heel. I remember thinking if I stepped on a marker or not. So one day (I don’t know how much later it was) I saw my foot and it was now bigger and now brown. I touched it and it peeled off. It left a little hole with normal skin underneath and healed up fine. This petrified me. It hasn’t happen again. I told some adults and they reassured me all was okay. Well I’m still horrified about it and I have been subtly for those three years. I really have never had anxiety this bad. I’m so so scared I don’t know what to do. I’m 16 now and practically hopeless to my situation, i can’t drive or pay for medical fees so i have to beg my parents to take me to the doctors. I feel hopeless and scared for my future.

healthanxiety,n8toxic21,2018/02/13,"Can't stop worrying of the flu/pneumonia? Every time I wake up in the middle of the night, it feels like I'm in a nightmare where a world exists that little kids and children are randomly dying of the flu. It breaks me heart and of course since i have this bad sore throat and coughs I'm convinced I have pneumonia now. Does anyone else have this problem of taking what other people have and making it yours? It'd just scare to think since everyone gets the flu so it'd not like it's rare or anything, that's the scariest part.

healthanxiety,sweetas314,2018/02/13,"Throat Issues/Fears This is my first time posting on this subreddit... I've had some nasty health anxiety that's been going on since I had brief exposure to asbestos tile about a month ago during some home renovation. Ever since then, I've been convinced that I've acquired cancer of the mouth/throat. I recently went to the dentist to check out some mouth sores and bumps, and they were found to be nothing. 

For the last week and a half, I've had some issues with what feels like swallowing on my right side of my throat. No real pain, but also no lumps or bumps in my throat or neck to speak of. Recently though, I chose to feel in the back of my throats and felt what feels like cartilage/bone on the right side of my throat. It is a hard ridge, and doesn't appear on my left side. I don't have any pain, and haven't had any other symptoms to speak of. I'm wondering If anyone would have any idea what this is, or maybe it's just normal and I'm overly paranoid due to my recent health anxiety. 

My fiancé is a PA student and hasn't been overly concerned at all, and at my physical a month ago a blood test showed normal white blood cell count. I still can't stop thinking it's cancer though, and really looking for advice/help on this. I've been through a lot of stress lately, and just looking for some support. Any thoughts, help or support would be much appreciated.

healthanxiety,j__raider,2018/02/14,"Random Small Scratch On My Hand ... Rabies? Hi,

I was out walking today, around 12:00 noon, and when I passed a tree I heard a flapping of wings, but I didn't see if it was a bird.

For some reason, I felt the need to check my hand, due to the slightest feeling I may or may not have made up in my head, and I regret ever deciding to so. I found a small scratch, with two little hole-like cuts about a centimeter apart with little scab linings connecting the holes. I'm deathly afraid that I got bitten by a bat and didn't really feel it. I'll include a picture of the cut as well. Does anyone have any information on bats and bat bites? I know that some are so tiny that they're hard to notice.

healthanxiety,darlingotter,2018/02/14,"Distrust of doctors and diagnoses - how to overcome? I've had quite severe health anxiety for a few years. It's hopped from one malady to another, and medical counsel/tests do not assuage it as I'm always convinced they've missed something.

Most recently it's cancer - at first lymphoma, now cancer in general. I've visited specialists, GPs, had chest xrays and bloodwork, and finally a full CT scan with contrast. Despite the all clear in each instance, I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety they've missed something. Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns.

I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD -- but compulsive google'ing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue, after numerous misdiagnoses etc. That GERD must be stomach cancer, the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma, the doctors are brushing me off, the medical system in Korea is inadequate, the medical system in Australia is inadequate (I've carried this pattern through the doctor's offices of three nations!)

I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases I'm operating on here, but I don't know how to change them. For those who have endured something similar - how do you learn to trust the doctors' ""all clear""? How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness, and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted?

I'm feeling exhausted and hopeless from the unending cycle of costly medical tests which produce little effect on my anxiety.

healthanxiety,curbnola,2018/02/14,"Absolutely terrified of having autism. Does anyone have fears of mental illness/ developmental delay? This would honestly be funny if it didn’t scare me so badly. I don’t really even know why it scares me this much, and I feel bad because autism isn’t strictly a negative. It’s just a different wiring of the brain that emphasizes different skills. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. 

Last night I had a nightmare that I was actually autistic and that no one had ever told me so that I could live a more normal life. The whole thing shattered my perspective of myself in a way that was profoundly uncomfortable and was kind of from a third person view although I felt everything very intensely. I looked quite different, but the thing that freaks me out is that what if I actually do look like that and just have a very limited outside perspective of myself. I also saw a bunch of ways that maybe certain interactions I thought were normal may only have felt alright because I’m actually autistic. 

This all would just be a weird one off dream if I hadn’t been terrified of being autistic for a long period last summer. I would spend every break possible at my summer internship taking diagnostic tests to prove to myself that I don’t have it. I was an anxious mess.

Since then, I’ve had a number of fears about having different mental illnesses (everything from schizophrenia to NPD to bipolar) and don’t know quite what to do about it. I think I have ocd, but I haven’t been able to go to therapy. 

Has anyone else had hypochondria about these specific themes? What strategies help you?

Edit: I also know that I don’t have any of the symptoms, but I can’t help be afraid any way.

healthanxiety,Kam1Collo,2018/02/14,"Did I tear my knee ligament again or am I making it up? Right ,so a year and a half ago,maybe two years ago,I tore my right knee ligament while playing an sport,and after half a year I recovered fully and eventually starting being active again. Then I tore it again last summer,and once again got out of rehab a few months after , however one evening when I was standing up I felt the same sudden pop and pain I felt last time....I tore it again. I'm now done with my third round of therapy,and I thought everything was fine ,but just now , I had to move quickly and then I felt a sudden pinching pain. It's not quite the pain I've felt before but I can't see it as a dumb coincidence. Of course this could also be the case that I just strained it and things will get better as the day progresses and I move more but idk :/

healthanxiety,iamcarltonwhitfield,2018/02/14,"Overcoming exhaustion? First time poster here. I think it’s appropriate because I think a big part of this may be health anxiety related.

I travel a lot for my job. It’s mid-feb and I’ve been in 5 cities in 2 countries already. I train and speak, so it’s energy intensive work. Not to mention flying all the time. I have two cross country trips - 5 flights - this week alone.

I keep getting super sick. Last year I was not well - bronchitis, pneumonia - from early October through thanksgiving, then caught the flu in early December. Yesterday I started coming down with aches and sore throat, had to take a day off work to rest and am fully exhausted still.

I don’t know if this is a real thing or if this is normal given the circumstances? I now have so much anxiety about staying healthy that I take all kinds of supplements and wear a mask in airports/planes. I was my hands every hour. I feel like such a freak but I’m so tired of being sick, I’ll do anything!

I want to get stronger, but the  exhaustion gets worse after I exercise. I’ll swim in a hotel pool or walk a few miles and just be crawling at the end of a really light workout.

Any advice from folks who have overcome or learned to manage exhaustion  gratefully received. 

I’m off to bed now but will check back in the morning.",2.580833333333331,4.946683162698413,3.699930158730158,86.48951428571432,78.48412698412699,7.524063492063492,25.95301587301587,8.488131031819089,1.9761299682539688,1015,40,199,22,25,328,164,252,0.159,0.773,0.068,-0.9614,1,1,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,0,4,12,9,0,0,15,0,17,14,3,0,2,32,34,18,0,4,11,0,2,1,0,2,11,1,1,0,10,8,0,1,5,6,1,8,3,5,1,2,6,4,17,4,27,23,7,40,0,0,0,0,4,12,0,7,20,123,27,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15227524328400247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16139285317474986,0.17196224697497833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596972331273093,0.0,0.23841900121879844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12823478782726286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11982362820521653,0.0,0.09499250341807053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13423372112195114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10049743922970387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13801910073260942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13129347070987374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07879231505474947,0.1113249617834762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13254889297049366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24424418321423064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16563997128989266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15346113100206826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1546372003761556,0.1385088373891344,0.0,0.16227293410855873,0.0856400762671241,0.12702222398937946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07613065212032452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13248106805576104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455295805762288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15268028487318314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16874867211029604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17736862150822985,0.09982866910742956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11029725489689893,0.16609401430087362,0.12444601542428613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2343294884885605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352650791118148,0.1996991054172094,0.0,0.0,0.18173141744609644,0.17910362712774655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15222323781802738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09191255378667447,0.0,0.12499740250400865,0.0,0.14010985755670455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22689214833333965,0.0,0.1588040524697277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.100349391665115
healthanxiety,sosilay,2018/02/15,"Ear infection or something more? Hi all, this is sort of a follow up post from this: https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/7xnd17/when_to_go_to_the_doctor_for_recurring_flu/

I woke up with ear pain this morning in addition to the other symptoms and I’ve had recurring ear infections for the past few years so I didn’t think it was related to everything else going on. The doctor said that it’s a middle ear infection and my lungs sounded clear, my throat looked fine, etc. so the fever and aches are all from the ear. While I was in the waiting room I went and replied to my post above. A few minutes after the receptionist called me up to the desk to get my doctors note for Work and when I got there I fainted—like full on blacked out, unconscious, woke up confused and surrounded by nurses, etc. I’ve fainted before but only when needles were involved. The doctor said I had low blood pressure and low blood sugar (probably true, I’ve had no appetite and have barely eaten) and the fainting was not because of the ear infection itself. I’m home now and my fever is still 100. I’m just worried because the ear pain didn’t even start until today but I’ve had the fever since yesterday. Do you guys think I need a second opinion or am I overanalyzing this?",5.443926950998187,7.703201400862071,5.142794918330309,79.93959165154267,69.47413793103448,7.470417422867515,27.72776769509982,8.20500826718156,1.8791,1023,36,181,15,19,314,135,232,0.105,0.865,0.03,-0.9424,0,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,0,1,0,1,9,8,0,2,17,0,16,28,11,0,4,30,34,20,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,15,10,2,1,9,13,2,1,2,0,0,3,4,6,0,1,17,13,16,2,24,17,8,33,0,2,2,0,7,15,0,5,13,117,25,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17705076813260806,0.0,0.12357238942790585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14828689503312306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4459195933017334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12131352534391925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3239196427792084,0.09591711211197504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13051528616825264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07587198760250577,0.0,0.08253245057688274,0.0,0.11614651348183035,0.0,0.0,0.1437916384390307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14566852064215244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12194907942655572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076795440116294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110447127332975,0.3090508018475014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13862989282058866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2781631829653303,0.0,0.15657281818480587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27627688487760466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12012832592935332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1117982337383309,0.0,0.0,0.10278818327625604,0.0,0.11597369176040075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15094024079023252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861035278431541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1376525438617265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346213376598033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10572262994501096,0.14747899195250513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09351757368555004
healthanxiety,221BBagelSt,2018/02/15,"Does anyone else have a rotating 'portfolio' of health worries? I've had a number of scares in the past year since I've identified my health anxiety. I wouldn't call any of them explicitly painful, but there's a distracting discomfort that's hard to shake and when a panic attack happens, the discomfort is magnified a hundredfold. 

My mind tends to focus on one of them at a time : my chest, my abdominal area, my tooth filling, and my testicle. Doctors have already told me that each of these areas are fine, and I'm mostly mentally stable with that, but when my anxiety flares up it tells me that the doctors didn't do enough tests, they just brushed it off as imagined anxiety pains or IBS because I'm young and the probability of something serious is low. It's like my anxiety constantly picks at my defenses to see if it can get a footing and crawl into my brain. 

I used to be a WebMD nut that would look up every odd symptom and have panic attacks. I still get freaked out by the odd thing; that I have a brain tumor every time I misspell a word or I flub some speech, for example. But I'm mostly sticking to the ones I know nowadays. 

Does anyone else have a 'portfolio' of half-resolved worries like this? Or does your anxiety mostly conjure up new symptoms?

healthanxiety,drphilwasright,2018/02/15,"Been sick since Sunday, worried I have pneumonia Well, here we go. On Sunday I started feeling something in my throat, and the next morning I woke up feeling like total shit. Muscle aches, sore throat, all the fun stuff. My entire family has it now. No fever though. Now, I feel almost fine, but my throat fucking HURTS. Whenever I breath in deep or swallow I can feel it all along my throat into my chest, like right under my sternum. I'm not wheezing or anything, and I occasionally have a cough that brings up phlegm, but there's no blood in it or anything, it's kind of a greenish brown color. The cough hurts my throat as well. 

I'm just worried I'm dying of pneumonia or something. I've heard people say you definitely know when you have it because you get ridiculously sick, but I'm still worried :/ I called my doctor and they only have an opening today at 3, which I can't find a ride to get to. The next opening was Tuesday. Could I go to urgent care?

If anyone has any advice, that be awesome. I just need some piece of mind.",2.5937151702786387,4.732339568627452,3.5787409700722432,88.52828173374614,77.33333333333333,5.667285861713108,23.97213622291021,6.5966054737557815,0.7521117647058824,808,27,159,7,19,259,123,204,0.175,0.69,0.135,-0.8746,0,0,2,0,0,0,31.0,1,3,1,0,11,13,3,0,8,0,12,19,9,0,3,33,32,14,1,3,11,0,4,2,0,0,8,2,0,0,9,8,1,0,6,0,0,4,4,5,2,0,4,8,24,8,17,26,5,28,0,2,2,1,8,13,2,7,13,100,33,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12968897795081133,0.0,0.0,0.1328963528123954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090251736354324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09279842694512108,0.0,0.21842865868931466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0809027154749111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13551833300759644,0.0,0.13531326483321587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10596328528297118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377387208268262,0.0,0.0,0.13584090921897918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251132566465221,0.0,0.2684216971703189,0.09481265767663316,0.0,0.0,0.12130043001588856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1226942185271159,0.1386777338559539,0.0,0.1508516328258496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28415140710189324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13820375866593182,0.07293748953005072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12967710641971322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13400578027334456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840756528224948,0.0,0.0,0.28229089827282994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10093683988931844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09200887517049744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333912228731395,0.0,0.10554144708525884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13623152770187022,0.10978441805867464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20434321274348613,0.0,0.0,0.0939373856831113,0.0,0.10598752760043766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1519285819616054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13039323729470156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12579967551569113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2386560524940133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4043399884780088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,E_ock,2018/02/15,"Cross post with AskDocs -- random swelling?? Hello,

I'm a 23-year-old female, non-smoker, otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. I've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors I've seen haven't been concerned because I weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ENT basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. It's only one one side. During my appointment with the ENT though, I insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. She agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. My cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. It's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. It feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face.

She referred me for an MRI with contrast, and suggested I cancel a sonogram I had scheduled because an MRI would be better, anyway (I did.) I haven't had that yet, but I'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else I should be concerned with or if I should take her advice to just chill. I've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before (12 at a time, two years ago, apparently caused by stress), I wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and I had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. They were more impacted on that side of my mouth. I'm not sure what to do, just wondering if I'm going crazy or if I'm right to be concerned. Also, I'm more short of breath lately (not like, short of breath in a way where I'm sweaty and my heart's beating fast. Short of breath like my throat feels tight.) But that could be caused by anxiety, too.

healthanxiety,Wtf42000000,2018/02/16,"Getting over being sick, weird things are happening So I'm getting over being sick. Went to the doctors yesterday and he said my temp was 99.1, and that I probably have a virus of some kind, and that he thinks I'm recovering and that I should be feeling better in a few days. Well, this morning I woke up DRENCHED in sweat. So much so that my hands were pruned. I thought that was strange, but I got up and took a shower and started relaxing in my room. Well, like 6 hours later, my hands are still slightly pruned. I've been drinking plenty of water but it's still happening, and it's freaking me the fuck out. Other than that, I feel almost totally fine. I've also been having loose stools. 

Another thing is that I have absolutely zero appetite. I started getting sick Monday and my appetite has been gone since. I just feel weird, like.....slow and foggy. I've been forcing myself to eat food as much as I can, but absolutely nothing sounds appealing.

I'm having a fucking meltdown right now. I'm freaking out about why my hands are pruned, why I woke up so sweaty, why I still don't have an appetite, and why I feel so weird. Has anyone had anything like this happen? I'm convinced I'm dying of something or have pneumonia, even though my doctor said my lungs sounded fine.",3.805240963855424,5.554636381526109,4.382769076305223,85.81511746987951,72.73493975903614,6.9077108433734935,27.711044176706828,7.554174236665415,1.5708167068273091,1005,38,194,12,20,319,133,249,0.12,0.768,0.111,-0.5116,1,0,2,0,0,0,38.0,0,0,0,1,16,17,2,0,7,0,26,16,5,0,1,27,56,23,1,1,5,0,7,2,0,1,5,4,2,0,14,12,4,0,6,2,0,3,1,7,2,1,17,11,23,10,19,35,5,26,0,0,0,2,4,12,2,3,13,124,37,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149652632771322,0.0,0.0,0.09181322206626734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12038791068368054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08027756488178424,0.0,0.0944785455810707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10153979052216887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07404271534986583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11915427299698267,0.0,0.0,0.2350250486438984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11246973190000974,0.0,0.11747891686103762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0758306798305858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23220480044356864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1388282640017291,0.0,0.0,0.2122793114640875,0.17994988401900042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09182375160542287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30457733801037284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1130643619095934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11955656543372152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16827056234121687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16879658090708308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1101629393393144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1237842026778683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09804679931099508,0.2184205043338628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949717148645863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08838606460898586,0.0,0.0,0.16252569838195158,0.0,0.2750613637654351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525488373671435,0.0735653770452438,0.11279988154607005,0.09114602427703276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12755772670690738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2064552963796327,0.10642968006092864,0.4143913453070643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,Kevovo,2018/02/18,"Is this “Anxiety”? I’ve never considered myself an anxious person.
Starting probably last week, I’ve had a strange urge/feeling to breath deep, as if to catch my breath. It’s like the feeling of turning the water on cold in the shower. Once I take that deep breath, it goes away for a bit, then usually comes back until I do it again. Yawning makes it go away as well. 

It’s weird, it feels like I am now consciously thinking about breathing (which I have never really done before). Sometimes feels like my throat is tight, and sometimes this whole thing even makes me lightheaded.

I’ve been the the doc, had an EKG, Chest X-ray, all checks out ok. Curious if I am experiencing anxiety? Is this a symptom? Any help would be appreciated!!

healthanxiety,HookerAllie,2018/02/18,"Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - I’ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens.  Most often I am preoccupied with my heart.  My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest, but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm.  I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years, always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently, this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test, numerous ekgs, etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia, but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy.  They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I don’t think is the whole story, I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it, but that’s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety, but promised I wouldn’t have a heart attack, with or without the pills.  

Anyways, to bring my story to today, I’ve been putting off doing laundry for far too long.  Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs, outside and into another building. After it’s clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this, and I panic. 

I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal, even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and I’m so afraid.

I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence -I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate , and am terrified of exercising.  I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago (at the urging of my therapist) because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing up/walking - I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack.  Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things I’ve done but now that it’s been a few months I feel SO much better.  I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks, but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I can’t ignore it.   I just feel so stuck and like I can’t keep up with basic chores.  I feel like a failure of an adult. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for, this is mostly a rant. I’ve been lurking this subreddit for months and it’s brought me a lot of comfort.  Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.

TLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I can’t keep up with life.

healthanxiety,Kahlosa,2018/02/18,"My silly panic attack last night I'm sharing this panic attack story because I feel it represents health anxiety and might help you all to cope with physical symptoms. This might be a little long.

I had had a stressful day at work and had also done an anxiety no-no and googled my irregular period symptoms I have been having recently.  Needless to say this all made me panicky by the evening. 

When I got home I vented to my husband, smoked some high cbd low thc cannabis and worked out for an hour hoping that would calm me. It worked for the most part until bedtime.

I was laying in bed surfing the interwebs before I fell asleep when it happened. A weird physical sensation. Felt like my throat went numb. Now I had experienced  this symptom before about a year ago and at that moment I had forgotten about that. A year ago I had a full neurological check up including an MRI. Of course all results were negative and I was fine. In the moment though I couldn't remember that. 

So I started to get nervous. Is it a stroke or seizure? Is my throat closing in anaphylactic shock? I had to check to be sure. So I shove my my finger into the back of my throat feeling around. I'm pushing in really far and playing with my uvula. I can feel everything. Good okay. Throat's not numb. But wait, why am I not gagging? Thats weird. My finger's digging in but I'm not gagging at all. I think you all can guess what I did next, right? Yup, I googled it. 

What came up was horrifying. The worst results I have ever seen from Googling symptoms. Then BAM! Heart starts racing, my face goes numb and I start to shake uncontrollably. I start calling my husband's name telling him I think he should call 911. Luckily I recognize the shaking and racing heart as a panic attack and not a part of the symptoms mentioned on Google. 

My husband was a champ! He got me started on deep breathing and began to comfort me. I started to calm the panic attack pretty quickly but what I saw on Google still screamed in my head. I wondered if I could wait to go to urgent care in the morning or if I really should go to the er now. 

I always worry about the boy who cried wolf kinda symptoms. Like I keep getting weird symptoms and it's always nothing but the one time I should have gone to the er I ignored it instead. I'm sure we've all been there. 

I explain to my husband what triggered the panic attack and he insists I'm fine. Its at this point I remember I've had the numb throat feeling before and had negative MRI results. But I had never stuck my finger down my throat. Maybe if they had known I couldn't gag they would have done another test or know other symptoms to diagnose me. 

As my panic attack subsided I got up to use the bathroom. Away from my husband I tried to make myself gag with my finger again. Nothing. Next, however, I jammed my toothbrush down my throat and GAG! Oh sweet relief! I can gag! Turns out, after testing it out, I can't gag myself with my own finger. Or at least it's really hard to. 
I had jumped to conclusions because, well, how often does a person try to gag themself with their finger? 

I think a lot of our symptoms are like this. We become so sensitized and aware of our bodies we notice things we never paid attention to before and then freak out fearing the worst, or Googling it. These are really just normal body sensations that most people are able to ignore or not even feel.

I should have kept the fact I had a rough day in the back of my mind and taken a minute or two after I had noticed the first symptom to see if it went away by distracting myself. And never ever ever Google a symptom! NEVER! I know we know this, and I know how hard it is not to, but don't, and don't body check your symptoms either. Distract or truly objectively analyze your symptoms. More often than not they will go away or not be nearly as strong as they first felt. 

This was my first panic attack in over a year and I'm not letting it get me down. It has reassured me that while uncomfortable, panic attacks aren't dangerous. It also allows me to recognize my symptoms of stress leading up to an attack so next time I can perform more stringent self-care before it snowballs into an attack. These moments are only making it easier for me to recover from anxiety, not making it worse. Stay strong everyone!

healthanxiety,chantpleure,2018/02/19,"Just have to get this out Female, 33 years old, BMI 23 

April 2017 I got a cough/cold.  I continued coughing on and off for months, mostly in the morning, no other symptoms (ie no weight loss, no fatigue).  In October, after several months personal upheaval I managed to go to the Doctor who sent me for a chest x-ray just to rule out an infection.  Chest x-ray comes back with what the radiologist says could be a chest infection so it's recommended that I take antibiotics.

I take a week of amoxicillin, on the 4th day I start getting a rash on my hands and feet which starts creeping up my limbs on the following days.  I call my Dr who recommends that we switch to a different antibiotic (sorry, don't remember which one it was).  I take that for a week.  After the course is over I'm still coughing, mostly in the morning.

I go back to my Dr who sends me for another chest x-ray which comes back with no indication of infection and then my Dr sends me on to a respiratory medicine specialist.

Respiratory medicine Dr orders blood tests, chest CT scan and a breathing test.  Blood tests have come back with borderline high levels of IgM and I am FREAKING out about what this means.  No results from anything else yet.  

Respiratory medicine Dr thinks I have reflux and has put me on 40mg of an acid reducer.   At no point did she say she thinks I have any signs of anything life threatening.  

I'm just so scared.  I've always been a hypochondriac, and I am finding it really hard waiting for the results from all these tests.

healthanxiety,sorryimshayy,2018/02/19,"this sounds stupid RAS?? (FIRST TIME EVER POSTING ON REDDIT.) 

I've been lurking on here knowing I shouldn't. I know reading your guys posts will not help my recovery. I also know posting won't either, but tonight I don't care. I really need someone to tell me they know what I'm talking about. Okay so at night I have this weird thing happen to me. I can only describe it as RLS - but it's NOT in my legs. It's in my arms and the back of my head?? It's like my arms are tickley. It feels like there's millions of bugs under my skin but they also feel light. Like feathers or jello. So hard to describe. I will wake up with it in the middle of the night/early morning and just lay there thinking im going to die until I have to go to work..nothing i do stops it and it's been months. I'll have it for a couple weeks then it will go away but a few weeks later its back. I've been thinking I have MS or a brain tumor forever now (and more symptoms keep popping up) but nobody listens...I've been to the doctor 27 times (for many of things) in the past 6 months and I keep getting the ""you're perfectly healthy"" although I've never got a CT scan or MRI. they've done neurological ""tests"" (eyes and strength/balance things) and then said theres no need to do scans and put radiation in my body for no reason. I've tried looking this up many of times with no answers. I'm scared of a wrong diagnosis. If they are right then HOW can anxiety cause this? How. it doesn't make sense. I'm  terrified and exhausted. Normally I'd be more frantic but I've been laying here for hours already and I'm just getting tired and pissed at this point. How come all my anxiety stems from being scared to die, but I don't want to exist anymore?..",1.4774712454814318,3.4140358631284933,2.9203812027604354,92.87893197502466,80.03351955307262,5.5525468287873805,22.26125534012488,6.522977012572876,0.3611880381202761,1341,42,295,12,34,437,190,358,0.206,0.738,0.056,-0.995,0,0,0,0,0,0,51.0,0,1,3,2,19,14,2,3,11,1,26,16,10,6,4,57,55,35,2,6,16,0,4,3,0,5,6,2,0,1,21,14,0,3,10,1,0,5,11,8,0,2,8,11,27,6,40,40,5,48,0,0,4,0,9,17,1,4,26,182,48,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10919560076260433,0.15826318939160133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15139547504921216,0.0,0.09813344266484464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929683276954422,0.1521754140526833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10991297045946853,0.0,0.1104627610094158,0.0,0.0,0.10088779678185962,0.10165059682243066,0.0,0.08523808032494565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10948811301848606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2053923699631109,0.0,0.0,0.10128120152033512,0.0,0.1012618880349831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08950742792270708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10006584967608234,0.07069107490546724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0841682186232262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10339630078893706,0.0,0.1687095004562716,0.0,0.07914066985083867,0.0,0.0,0.09797768563061267,0.08750261281382403,0.0,0.08864123776844021,0.0,0.1015529352426896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663252017816721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974474379595532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688475670587684,0.0,0.0,0.17590553712451928,0.0,0.0,0.2175249449654976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450283264082486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08309446012790167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06605099135915454,0.20064287375709014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15796451784979876,0.0,0.0,0.14674278179940972,0.07631760874111093,0.0,0.0,0.18571883118658564,0.09695160260239384,0.09494677204558656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07525718489690103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09446054169234852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09354128845173501,0.0,0.2843049692295945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0994737337767433,0.0,0.0,0.09897842264482347,0.0,0.06339095754025101,0.10173877135547643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450416410283809,0.09412567402179116,0.0,0.1981357176467084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838414076342221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827280059181593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10284864698460887,0.0,0.07953358396854378,0.08648809913422613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1972172280557756,0.1268084371505089,0.0,0.0,0.1730984997104069,0.11373035946559527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06718167154710677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0583642439251301,0.0,0.15874608177429006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07203797601336873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081880900353776,0.0,0.0

Gonorrhea

Chlymedia

Mouth cancer

Bacterial infection

Stomach cancer

Throat cancer

Herpes

Going blind

Going deaf

Intestinal parasites

IBS

Heart defect

Lung cancer

In no particular order all of these have been individual cases of my health anxiety since April last year where I have genuinely believed without a shadow of a doubt I have got and began to process the self diagnosis as the truth and you know what...
NOT A SINGLE FUCKING ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN CORRECT!!!!!!!

Now I look at this list everytime I begin to self diagnose again. Not googling symptoms has also had a massive improvement.
I've also noticed that it is when I have a lot of downtime that I get my health anxiety back and it is virtually non existent when I'm super busy as my brain has something to focus on.

Hope this helps someone! :)",5.813107526881717,7.855781316129036,6.652661290322584,70.3723252688172,68.09677419354838,9.553763440860212,32.916666666666664,9.928628108626363,3.7435698924731184,684,31,107,17,12,226,106,155,0.17800000000000002,0.7070000000000001,0.115,-0.8992,0,0,2,0,0,0,16.0,0,1,1,1,8,6,1,1,8,0,12,22,7,1,3,14,24,9,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,13,1,0,2,8,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,4,3,0,1,5,3,13,3,15,19,3,17,0,0,2,3,5,4,1,3,10,74,21,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24768411011720076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35540406133750885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11907832818310315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17447499123026003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17287576957651088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15718036240765373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14316623241455795,0.08090833013275968,0.0,0.17602182225471488,0.0,0.12385625780346105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4938290842199418,0.0,0.18351068878488708,0.10379987061292606,0.0,0.0,0.1538116287584834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510739709781732,0.12623214887843354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13004399501594235,0.0,0.0,0.13165703906890333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17630994648350626,0.0,0.0,0.10493762595748897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32310699197802023,0.0,0.0,0.12810238086166706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312129783349216,0.1192193415434074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609595743840912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13374993316931852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14928019969476156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09972522091559484

healthanxiety,IAMAWalrus_AMA,2018/02/20,"Advice? Life's become quite hard worrying about heart attacks I'm 19, 6'1 and about 75kg. I've drank loads of energy drinks in my life and I'm a bit lethargic, I don't do anything deliberately to exercise. But I'm not fat and I don't eat too badly and whatever. No family history of heart attacks at all that I know of, just a lot of cancer. But the past 5 months, literally every day I worry I'm having a heart attack. Whenever I get a bit of chest pain I sieze up and think ""Right, this is it"". And I was never a worrier before this, I'm a really confident person, don't mind getting up on a stage at all. Yet I spend a lot of my days worried shitless about heart attacks now. I went to hospital a few months ago and had a lot of tests done and they said they'd found nothing wrong with me. I had an ECG (I think it's called EKG in America?), blood test, chest x-ray, ultrasound in my belly, obviously the doc checked me out with a stethoscope, and they couldn't find anything wrong. Yet the worry didn't go away. Over Christmas it got really bad, I got scared just walking down the stairs thinking it'd kill me. I do get chest pain and I do think it's real and probably happens worse/more frequently to me than most people, but it's probably just indigestion or something, right? I do eat quite a lot of spicy food and I like fizzy drinks. I don't worry much about other things like cancer, I don't worry about them as much as I should. I just worry about heart attacks and suddenly dying. I always feel uncomfortable in my torso and I'm not sure if there's something wrong the doctors haven't found or if if's purely anxiety. I'm not prone to heart conditions or to anxiety, which came first? Which one is real? I feel a pain in my chest and I get a shooting pain down my left arm fairly often, isn't it natural for me to worry about that? I might have a heart condition that's only detectable when I move around and walk and get the heart going a bit more.

Dunno why I worry about silly shit I can't control. All I know is I have to walk 20 minutes to class this morning and I know the whole time I'm gunna be having mini panic attacks thinking any second I'm going to die. I'm not going to die, right?

Tl;dr I'm not at risk of heart attack but I worry about it a lot because I get a lot of chest pain. Doctors can't find anything wrong with me. I'm not usually an anxious person but I worry about this more than I probably should. How do I cope?

healthanxiety,omgcow,2018/02/20,"My vision is blurry and I think I have MS This is a lot so bear with me. And it's mostly a vent because I'm absolutely fucking terrified.

Last Saturday I woke up with weirdly blurred vision in my right eye. I have pretty bad eyesight to begin with, but this was different. I thought it was because I was hungover or something, but it didn't go away. I made the mistake of googling and holy shit I'm losing my mind. Everything I'm experiencing, the blurry vision, the color distortion, the eye pain, is consistent with optic neuritis- which is usually the first symptom of MS. I'm so fucking terrified and I can't shake the feeling that I just found my death sentence. 

I went to the eye doctor and he said he didn't see any damage in my eye, but he wants me to go back in tomorrow and see if anything has changed. Which it hasn't. I still can't see worth a damn out of that eye. He said I might have to get an MRI which I'm convinced is going to show that my brain is full of lesions and tumors and all sorts of awful things. 

Anyway there's not a lot of point to this but I'm a major hypochondriac and I'm not in any way ready to deal with the fact that there could actually be something wrong with me. I can't focus on anything and I've spent all day crying. I'm usually at least able to say ""well, I'm probably jumping to conclusions and it could be this instead"" but literally everything I read said that I have MS. And even on the MS sub there's tons of posts where people had the same symptom as me as their first sign of the disease. It's a lot to handle and I'm not doing well. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",2.8540791855203618,4.089842620588237,4.364117647058823,87.0654524886878,74.26470588235293,7.4660633484162915,26.312217194570128,8.012643519586192,1.4549321266968331,1281,45,276,19,26,428,162,340,0.165,0.767,0.068,-0.9893,1,0,2,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,1,4,14,16,4,1,18,1,27,14,7,2,3,56,61,25,1,6,12,0,1,0,0,1,5,4,0,0,21,20,0,0,5,3,2,6,9,12,2,2,16,15,27,4,37,40,11,34,0,2,9,2,11,15,4,10,11,180,48,3,0.10241027955817113,0.0,0.09993765998834676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13928500379536027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16854986831009053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09621782878515713,0.07874718357093405,0.08550830575083798,0.12485671176162433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1143237410998495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833649665406916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635325500538181,0.0,0.11249288327839296,0.06604615812397634,0.10558050140418923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10699694522138928,0.0,0.10482126062289443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06764102379382239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840795116278764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051781714429217286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17422026295172954,0.0,0.11228758559892416,0.0,0.18935330646853904,0.05350514424073203,0.0,0.17460636575618158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08347804635784263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11457090729059567,0.0,0.26119667236231064,0.0,0.19380616538981926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10864112284893793,0.10340518846471344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10897175791146888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07099839318889498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09681081611015444,0.0,0.09808073900076396,0.10418807147074842,0.1104156024624729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20487598646848496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08745781918241724,0.29224688273359833,0.08144076475229936,0.0,0.0,0.24482320111281186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10512268029120096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1576808730349095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178498154390651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2128869853132856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09428562616217677,0.0,0.0,0.06803683918648565,0.06562037199502725,0.0,0.08130232262995472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22558090903601855,0.0,0.0604042362422598,0.08128851310713481,0.0,0.0,0.1841582806058764,0.09493535515511103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11196956406184187,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,desert_bluejay,2018/02/20,"Weird body sensation I've been going through a bad batch of anxiety the past month or so.

At one point I was so anxious my fight or flight response kicked in for about a week and I've struggled to get rid of all of those symptoms. Which in turn has led me to believe I'm hypomanic which adds to the anxiety.

Anyways, every once in awhile I'll get this very weird bodily sensation that is very hard to describe. It almost feels like my whole body and head feels numb/tingly but also heavy. It always makes me think of clay stress balls - this association always pops into my head which makes me even more anxious that I'm 'losing my mind'. Or like silly putty when you 'snap' it vs stretch it. The longest it's lasted is a few minutes. But now it happens for maybe a minute at most because instantly I start fretting about what it is and seem to scare myself out of it. 

Could this be related to anxiety, or something deeper? Anyone experience anything similar? Or does it sound like dpdr or a hallucination or the beginnings of mania/psychosis?",4.695820895522386,6.241918781094526,5.310626865671644,80.85489552238808,70.14427860696517,8.146069651741294,28.822885572139306,8.648137234880735,2.1919476616915423,829,31,155,14,15,267,127,201,0.154,0.8059999999999999,0.04,-0.9616,0,0,1,0,1,0,17.0,0,1,0,1,9,12,1,3,9,0,8,5,4,3,1,28,23,16,0,1,10,0,3,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,19,6,0,0,4,1,0,2,0,8,0,1,2,4,11,4,24,19,5,19,0,1,0,0,2,9,0,10,11,96,30,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12927189980759834,0.0,0.0,0.10323874625809804,0.21483792917261624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2962763310909101,0.29168550762129625,0.0,0.0902675558545014,0.0,0.10623575095794316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10779052117524382,0.07869627350721299,0.0,0.0,0.14544800099999464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2867951116456161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10307337190600896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129735693138952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08526728653481397,0.0,0.10876970822868066,0.0,0.0,0.12628154236205208,0.0,0.0,0.13055054562622473,0.09222685291422576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1348956065173489,0.0,0.07336874470891039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11415996449881192,0.0,0.11564546739085713,0.0,0.2649813327682493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10523120584125056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18921067682075107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14442641214713606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1723463696956294,0.0,0.12969519032696405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13035107009738106,0.0,0.1030439158895379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13748398785580573,0.0874794021629089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12323760101976534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12203830063387698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12924852050201513,0.0,0.0,0.1175249714615897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09938510261989243,0.0,0.0,0.09137545202130072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14788006559826686,0.13496011239677533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341811119799941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08272008239372751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404203587708089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21303692930638965,0.0,0.0,0.10355374815056599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14413208128357494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Infinitechemistry88,2018/02/21,"Left thigh pain/tingle/numbness Since I was 19 (29 now) I have had tingling and numbness in my upper left thigh/leg. When I was 19 I went to the Dr, he picked up my leg patted it and said looks like a healthy 19 year old leg to me. I am starting to get concerned because the pain has been getting more severe and I am worried it is something major.

healthanxiety,elswordfish,2018/02/21,"Worried sick. So. I have had health anxiety very bad since I was a kid. Around 22 years of dealing with this since my dad died out of the blue from a heart attack when I was almost 8. 

It ranges from cancer to HIV to ALS and everything in between it seems like. 

So. On Friday last week. I noticed that I had a lymph node under my jaw on my right side that is swollen. So swollen to the point it's visible to me and other people. 

Last night I went to the ER because I was freaking out so bad. They told me I had strep throat and the flu and that's what was causing it. But, I really have symptoms of neither. Other than a few red streaks on my throat I can see with a flashlight. No sore throat, no fever, no cough. 

Should I just trust the doctor? I really just need some calming down here. I trusted him for like 30 mins and then went back to the whole ""well, what if they got it wrong or got my tests mixed up with someone else's thing that I do a lot. I am at my wits end right now.

healthanxiety,books694,2018/02/21,"Worried Hey so I’ve been a hypochondriac for quite some time now. A few days ago I slept with this guy and even though I used a condom and I’m on birth control I’m worried I may be pregnant. My period still hasn’t come yet but it can also be irregular sometimes due to my birth control, ( I’m on Nexplanon). I read online that taking high amounts of Vitamin C and taking Dong Qaui and Black Cohosh supplements can help with miscarriage. I started taking 2 capsules of 568 mg of Dong Qaui and 2 capsules of 540 mg of Black Cohosh every 2 hours and 5,000 mg of Vitamin C since Monday. I was also pressing down hard on my uterus a few days ago and now my uterus is tender to the touch, I’m experiencing nausea, lightheadedness and racing heart rate. The nausea, lightheadedness and racing heart rate could be due to my anxiety but I don’t know. 

I realize that what I did was stupid and I stopped taking the supplements but now I’m worried what if I injured myself my pressing down too hard on my stomach? I’m thinking of maybe going into urgent care tomorrow and I’m also scared to tell my doctor, I feel like at times she really judges me for having anxiety. I also feel so ashamed and stupid right now and I’m so scared I hurt myself",3.4324493927125523,5.132428307692312,4.800589068825912,82.64145040485832,73.61538461538461,7.531093117408908,25.71032388663968,8.238735603445708,1.6740495546558707,980,33,189,16,20,326,126,247,0.181,0.746,0.073,-0.9792,0,0,0,0,0,2,17.0,0,0,0,3,16,9,2,3,7,0,15,10,4,3,0,33,37,25,0,2,4,0,7,1,0,1,5,0,0,1,6,17,0,3,5,1,0,2,2,6,0,0,5,10,26,3,23,27,4,34,0,1,2,1,5,10,0,3,23,113,32,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20168078858976546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3638917806132098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1740504826303095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1159847724357904,0.0,0.0,0.09799321290293136,0.0,0.0,0.2551805418858625,0.09082721893705463,0.0,0.0,0.14673014912085802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11643704674965913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07513667554534154,0.0,0.09584677322882837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11503982814065465,0.08126937546153537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06465180012631934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126391886247965,0.0,0.0,0.2038112461357256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696096704463225,0.07625018764200356,0.1201925156184873,0.0,0.0,0.11202959403135504,0.0,0.12178124713288488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06251891221165894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055576848643630335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11428609765140894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12099658492754865,0.11378967717310212,0.0,0.0728768594351431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09714947254261667,0.0,0.0,0.2277849933857174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0941025313462495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1125104533921566,0.0,0.08051912955539171,0.0,0.0908479984199688,0.09510752783343282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34213011846751884,0.0,0.09943028608481816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728921048679526,0.11176753419875743,0.0,0.13266744996786525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09825115812809088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3465830316644604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,straycatwildwest,2018/02/21,"Health anxiety for other people After a lifetime of obsessing over my own symptoms (currently “have” colon cancer and/or ovarian cancer, btw), I’m now completely convinced my husband has head and neck cancer. He has been clearing his throat more than usual and is in a risk group for that particular cancer. He’s 37 and otherwise healthy so he’s not dashing off to the doctor, but I now have a strong anxiety response *every time he clears his throat* and I’m making myself and him a nervous wreck.

healthanxiety,wastelands33,2018/02/21,"Premature Heart Beats This is one of the hardest things for me to deal with. I have had premature atrial contractions, premature junctional contraction, and premature ventricular contractions for like 4 years now. At one point I was in bigeminy for 1.5 months. Scariest and most depressing time of my life. I could not leave the house and was in constant discomfort. I went to every doctor and they all claimed they were benign. Cut out this, add this, don't exercise too much, exercise more.

This is what gives me Health anxiety. There's nothing I can do about it. All my doctors including my Mayo cardiologist and electrophysiologist says an ablation would more than likely make things worse. So I live with these day in and day out. I've tried everything. The best thing I have is magnesium glycinate

What do you do when the something you can't fix.? But you still have to go on. I'm not even worried about them killing me but they caused me so much discomfort that it affects my quality of life. I don't see an answer to this.

Health anxiety to something that is actually physically happening to you but is considered benign truly sucks.

healthanxiety,ahull33,2018/02/22,"New to this Hey all,
I’m new to Reddit but some recent health concerns have made me feel like I should reach out to some objective people for my situation. I’m 24 years old and before a little over a week ago, I thought I was in great health. A little over a week ago I started noticing heart palpitations (didn’t know what it was called for a while) and chest pain. I thought this would just go away but it didn’t after a couple of days. Then I had my first and second ever anxiety attacks. These were scary but I felt like I was anxious about my palpitations because they lasted all day and night. My pulse was constantly 20 bpm faster than it used to be, and the chest ache and pain lasted almost 24 hours. I’ve seen doctors and nurses and I’ve had a chest X-ray, blood work, and CT done and they didn’t find anything abnormal. I’ve been tracking my blood pressure as well and it’s constantly in the 150/90 range and today (during a snow day) Ive been laying in bed and the pain and palpitations are feeling worse than ever and my BP was 160/110 and my pulse 105. I had a Holter monitor and I’m waiting to hear the results. I also started seeing a counselor. I don’t consciously feel anxious, and my symptoms last all day and all night. I’m waiting for my next doctors appointment but I’m just reaching out because I feel worse day after day and just wanted to see if anyone else has been through something similar to this.

I'm so tired of these articles on protecting yourself from the flu. What scared me is that sometimes you have to be aorund other people and you can't help it. I got the flu because I was on the subway and a lady coughed in my face, it was a crowded car. I couldn't get away. Washing my hands won't do shit.

healthanxiety,MobileChikane,2018/02/22,"Massive abdominal pains for the last 2 days... Hi guys,

I'm in a pretty bad state right now. For the last 2 days I've been having really big and sometimes debilitating pain in my abdomen area. It first started around the side of my abdomen kind of like a stitch, then throughout the day it slowly travelled to the middle just above my belly button. Last night the pain travelled down to my lower right which instantly got me worked up thinking of appendicitis.

Phoned 111 and they recommended I go to the local A&amp;E. The blood test was fine and the doctor said he doesn't think it's appendicitis. The problem is this pain has been so intense for the last 2 days and it doesn't seem to stop, just travel around my abdomen a bit, but is very intense in the lower right at the moment.

Any idea what this could be?",6.634929676511955,6.591462310126584,6.492109704641354,79.78573136427569,65.13924050632912,8.7943741209564,30.213783403656826,8.167268648758528,1.9723142053445848,647,20,125,7,9,204,99,158,0.106,0.8220000000000001,0.07200000000000001,-0.7521,2,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,1,2,6,9,0,0,16,0,11,9,4,0,0,16,19,7,0,2,3,0,0,1,0,0,5,1,0,1,8,6,0,1,4,3,0,4,2,6,0,1,5,1,8,3,18,12,1,36,0,0,0,0,6,16,0,1,16,72,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13375877073120634,0.0,0.0839507023120854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2197945738284656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10307616937493316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1347761797226397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856533046497,0.0,0.0,0.31846192818684793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263570119789631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10500709360845847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015987188842693,0.0,0.098734794001805,0.0,0.0,0.12223559170960993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13936080222088548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285548962362879,0.0,0.4025151554536645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06031177126052261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1158501095203278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5254409511186788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1255937327662612,0.0,0.11812563767934067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07908567296827755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3162786434856044,0.11742987584434897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11238487143469923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209588875606656,0.0,0.08737903357889915,0.0,0.0,0.10321030435937108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15820443450054586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10185974781864396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08987357240458782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,titchmalbot,2018/02/22,"I've had health anxiety since 2012, i've been learning to manage it pretty well over the last couple years. Today I had a bit of a relapse so I wrote something to get my confidence back. Over the last 5 years I have had:

-Schizophrenia
-Pancreatic cancer
-Multiple Hernias
-Testicular cancer
-Urinary tract infections
-Blood clots / DVT
-Pulmonary embolism
-Heart attacks
-Angina
-Stomach Ulcers
-Misaligned vertebrae and ribs
-Meningitis 
-Bradycardia and Tachycardia 
-Brain Tumors
-TMJ
-Aching shoulders, neck, back
-GERD and food intolerances

Somehow I have survived all of these... 

My symptoms were:

-Headaches
-Insomnia
-Shortness of breath
-Palpitations
-Racing thoughts
-Indigestion 
-Tight aching muscles
-Dizziness 

My treatment for these was:

-Constantly checking pulse and breathing
-Checking for symmetry 
-pushing and prodding where I felt it hurt until it did hurt 
-Twisting and turning until I felt that symptom again
-Avoiding anything that I believed would make my symptoms worse (flying, eating certain foods, exercising too much or too little)
-and most importantly googling for the exact scenario I believed to be true e.g. 'headache above left ear associated with brain cancer' or 'sore achilles hill sign of DVT'

I have (literally) spent $1000's on:

-GP's (who always tell me the same thing)
-Physios
-Chiros
-Missed work
-Miracle cures (e.g. magnesium, vitamin B, etc...)
-Dietitians
-Ambulances

All to conquer my 'Sicknesses' 

The reality is though...

I was sick in 2012, I was truly diagnosed with Graves disease,

and although very treatable (and it has been treated).

it scared me to my core.

I became overaware of every sensation in my body and thought in my mind.

I believed that I needed to be aware to ensure I would survive.

This habit manifested itself into my true and worst alement health anxiety.

Health anxiety has stole time and experiences from me for 5 years.

It made me doubt myself.

It made me loathe myself.

It crippled me. 

However, I have been getting my life back over the last 2 years.

But it has taken effort, commitment and the realisation that this is here with me still (at least for the time being) and without consistent maintenance i'll end up back where I was.

Some days it still wins, but with each month those days get less and less.

My health anxiety no longer and will never again define who I am.

healthanxiety,Rand0m_Name,2018/02/22,"Scared I have mouth cancer, at 19. Background, so I've been out at college since August, been to a couple of parties, and took up smoking, why, because it looks cool. There I admit it. I would say I've been smoking since around Octber or November. I smoke maybe half a pack every other weekend, if that. Maybe have one or two on the side, here and there, but I wouldn't consider myself a smoker. I've noticed a sore in my mouth, it's all white, doesn't look harmful. I think it's a canker sore, as I've been drinking coffee like hell these past couple of weeks, sometimes without regard for how hot it is. Is it possible to get mouth cancer after smoking maybe two or three packs of smokes in total in my life, or am I just freaking out over a little blister? Thanks for the help.

healthanxiety,AyoSquirrel,2018/02/23,"Fear of Brain Damage My health anxiety has completely debilitated me for the past four months due to worry that I damaged my brain from drinking for years.  I constantly test my memory and feel it is declining rapidly.  I have trouble picturing things from seconds ago in my mind, all my memories no matter how distant or recent feel insanely foggy, time is flying by as I feel I’m not forming new memories, and I often can’t remember if I did something today or the day before even if it was just a few hours ago.  Scarier symptoms involve me feeling confused and unfamiliar with my own family, house, dog, etc. and feeling like I have to remind myself where I am or where I’m going.  I have brief moments of confusion where I have to piece everything together and constant memories that have nothing to do with what I’m doing (which lead me to a fear of seizures that I ended up being tested for) that have happened for he past few years when I was super anxious.  

I have had an MRI, CT, PET, 3 day eeg, and neuropsych testing and everything came back good but I can’t believe my symptoms are just anxiety and derealization since it feels it’s progressively getting worse over the past few months (which I barely have any memories of).  I honestly feel I have severe short term memory loss and have posited thy maybe I was having seizures and brain damage from alcohol but the neurologist, psychiatrist, GP, neuropsych and therapists all don’t think so.

I have in the past believed I had HIV, liver failure, mouth cancer, throat cancer, and other ailments and of course they all ended up being false but this one feels so much more real.  Has anyone else ever had extreme memory issues just because of anxiety?",8.71014150943396,7.931020792452832,8.785149371069185,67.47696933962267,61.20125786163523,11.723584905660374,38.42845911949686,10.9516,4.355993081761007,1364,59,226,30,16,448,181,318,0.168,0.7909999999999999,0.042,-0.991,0,0,3,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,1,4,14,13,0,4,8,0,32,15,6,2,4,50,48,26,0,2,12,0,8,1,0,0,8,0,1,0,14,16,2,0,10,1,0,4,5,9,0,3,8,8,32,4,27,38,13,40,0,4,0,1,3,9,0,8,28,165,46,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16228116860249447,0.09782347492538436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06224719180449065,0.0,0.21007292698458926,0.10340891579049157,0.0,0.06400366036759593,0.09378880570781413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07038505088466172,0.0,0.05579911313728037,0.0,0.07788985962678653,0.20625803743162244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30655124296818154,0.0,0.10469208020415602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0959730959513712,0.1978344370725781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1180654847447352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08966981662639092,0.0,0.0,0.07646605769795556,0.0,0.16214634081155366,0.0,0.10208613600188986,0.0604582498792513,0.08279898442351359,0.0,0.0,0.16453218013925314,0.0,0.08629140223059431,0.20600548357347195,0.3702642750860988,0.0653928880073911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04782345385829295,0.0,0.05202166131001741,0.07677552712145397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094442711106599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09729781999094436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09014390296961544,0.10561952945064706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0955391466747084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04471955910226928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09195958430931388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0924246318634474,0.0,0.14612532117678295,0.0,0.06728903057471672,0.0,0.0,0.08840543261782596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783065810419784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062026736984215715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3495234798602568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10418729291703728,0.0,0.0,0.09038013688648168,0.0,0.10369173265974074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340891579049157,0.0,0.07571900557362847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0704684013371905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19028059943833373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062796219167292,0.06081203378986495,0.05865217030625595,0.0,0.0,0.05337501148929629,0.0,0.08676482965408057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929586134431946,0.09328236409791556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11789155685550295

healthanxiety,tweedleloop,2018/02/23,"Rabies anxiety So, I have pretty severe rabies anxiety, which usually only acts up in the summer. I'm lucky in that I don't really worry about cats or dogs, since I next to never interact with them, but I'm absolutely *terrified* of a rabid bat getting into my room and biting me without my knowing it. We've had bats in our house twice now, and maybe two or three years ago, finally did an exclusion in our attic and had a professional go around and seal everything up.

I haven't slept with my window open at night for several years now, but last night, I left it open by mistake until around 4 in the morning; which, naturally, set off my anxiety. I have a screen on my window, which sort of sets against a little interior strip of wood, but it isn't tightly sealed, and there's one side that's actually quite loose (big enough that a bat *probably* could get through).

I'm trying to be very logical about this, but I'm struggling. I was in my room basically all night until I went to bed (at around 4 AM), and never saw a bat, or heard anything against the screen, but just *knowing* that my window was open, and what if a bat got in while I wasn't looking or when I left the room or something? Reasonably, I know a sick bat wouldn't be able to get back out if one had gotten in, and I don't think there's any way I *wouldn't* notice a bat flying around -- healthy or otherwise! -- but it's very hard to convince myself of that.",5.226421568627451,5.155482638888891,6.258725490196081,80.36470588235295,68.09722222222221,9.693137254901963,29.44117647058824,9.478462496947786,2.3669397058823525,1112,36,231,21,17,372,156,288,0.097,0.858,0.045,-0.9195,0,0,1,0,0,0,46.0,2,0,1,1,14,4,0,1,14,0,19,2,1,1,3,51,38,27,0,6,16,0,2,0,0,2,1,1,7,0,14,19,0,1,6,0,0,3,10,2,0,5,13,7,25,2,41,20,2,58,0,0,4,0,5,32,0,10,20,153,39,1,0.11125209839205208,0.0,0.10856599972251413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09861827265704796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07565524190360631,0.0,0.2553226522786071,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09155099768353997,0.3961518175339623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08554599648128326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0888257479004164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11495315719946575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999862124580608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1218712358288849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743738889464612,0.0,0.06322713132181673,0.0,0.08897846615672629,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09966002802016848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12836998455177395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18342373134763626,0.09068530880929514,0.0,0.0,0.2417514608444224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1115038295637674,0.0,0.0,0.09342374309235883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11176768613318087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17160895350852914,0.0,0.1183178687674858,0.3132076737513345,0.0,0.0,0.1266612513932946,0.0,0.0,0.15077460219478256,0.08461223403870947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11318337991605475,0.1199485786209108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11833030093142133,0.0,0.0,0.07127094300273888,0.11438568615785147,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2513664090644132,0.0,0.09202888543736856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564730062796098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11630484865964648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0712858524867814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07553287202866901,0.0,0.10867713456688334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12252846880077335,0.18358926487147373,0.0,0.08830673734467911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103131809796511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10724305280954896,0.0,0.0,0.11298190622249653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14328540764231534

I can't feel anything obvious, but I am noticing an asymmetry in the shape of one of my rearmost teeth when feeling it with my tongue.",5.473571428571423,5.537463023809526,5.852476190476192,83.02585714285719,67.57142857142857,8.14857142857143,34.65714285714286,7.554174236665415,2.4107457142857136,330,15,65,3,5,106,56,84,0.076,0.9,0.025,-0.3919,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,10,0,5,5,4,2,1,14,11,4,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,1,0,3,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,4,3,10,0,11,6,0,10,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,47,14,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4759997696377292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22238902714788156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2309152090545648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2959398719530443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2924723037387091,0.0,0.2776924346548409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27366289574965763,0.19305373081396912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3292740003426224,0.0,0.0,0.19598004862824148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741426739754977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2937125902277791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,CapitalHitman38,2018/02/23,"Can't stop worrying For the past few weeks I've been having flashing in my vision. It's usually a very small white light that appears for a split second then goes away once I try to look at it. Well ever since that started happening I've like been sent over the edge and am almost constantly worrying that I have a myriad of neurological diseases, from a stroke to retinal detachment to a brain tumor. I've also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but I'm not sure if im making up phantom nausea because I'm worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence. I went in yesterday for a full eye exam and the optomologist said my eyes, retina and all are in perfect condition. Because of this I am now more than ever convinced I have a brain tumor and am about to die. Sorry for the rant I just needed somewhere to vent.

healthanxiety,katiebuggc,2018/02/23,"A whole slew of problems... Normal? I've been dealing with anxiety since September, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Since then I've had a few recurring symptoms that my first doctor had waved off to anxiety, but since then have gotten more common. I will be talking to a new doctor soon since I need to get back on meds after my last attempt ended, so I will be talking to them about this, but wanted others' opinions/experiences too, for comfort especially.

I had a huge fear of contracting rabies since I work with animals. I know this is not logical, since any animal that has ever scratched me (I've never been bit) has not had rabies, and since even though I exhibited some general symptoms that happened to line up with rabies, I've been this way since September. So, I'd be dead by now. 

Some of those symptoms are, like I said, pretty general and line up with anxiety-related symptoms. Minor muscle twitching, ""foggy"" thinking, being irritable, trouble swallowing/dry mouth (has never impaired eating/drinking), etc. I also have had a totally random symptom from those, which is sharp, short-lived pains in my chest, and now they're along my lower abdomen and uterus. 

My new doctor has seen me once for chest pains when they wouldn't stop one day. She said everything sounded fine as far as my heart and lungs, I wasn't experiencing limited breathing, and the pain wasn't long-lived and was sharp, not like a pressure or anything. She was hoping it was from acid reflux, which I was having issues with, but after a month of medicine for that, I'm still having that.

Has anyone else had sharp chest pains from anxiety? I've had stomach pains from stress/anxiety, but have any ladies also had pains in their uterine/ovarian area from it?

healthanxiety,Ashjaln,2018/02/24,"New Here Hey there! So, I've been lurking around for a few days and thought I should I produce myself. 
I'm a 33 year old stay at home mom to 2 boys. I was diagnosed with GAD at 16. I was on medicine for less than a year, but quit taking it due to not liking the way it made me feel (and not liking my dr, so I didn't want to go back). The anxiety seemed to calm down until my second son was born. I had my first panic attack 5 years ago, but thankfully don't have them often. The health anxiety started around that time too. In August 2016, I finally realized that things were getting bad and asked my gp for help for help and was put on medication and started seeing a counselor. Then my husband went through some job changes, in 2017, and of course lost insurance for 3 months each time. Then in October he accepted a job offer that moved us from Texas to the Midwest. My anxiety was behaving itself during the move and I thought that just maybe it would leave me alone. No such luck. By December, my anxiety was a houseguest of my brain that wouldn't leave. I made an appointment to talk to a dr next week, but now I've found out that she is a clinical social worker? I currently don't have insurance, but I feel that my current way of living is just not working and want to go back on the medicine. Every time I feel an ache, pain, tickle, or sniffle, I freak out. Worse, I'm doing the same thing to my kids and husband. I'm hoping to find a bit of community here and maybe one day, we will all be anxiety free!

healthanxiety,healthfreakguy,2018/02/24,"Its like I am at war with my heart Hey people. 27m here. I have had panic attacks 7 years ago. I had severe anxiety for a year, then I used antidepressants, got a girlfriend and stabilized my anxiety for many years. I still had episodes of severe anxiety/stress and depression but it never turned into full blown health anxiety that triggered panic attacks and major anxiety symptoms until recently.

I have been very stressed thees past months and I finally had multiple panic attacks within the span of a month. Ended up in the ER 2 times. So as a person experienced with it, I thought I can overcome it more easily and systematically this time. Took some anxiety episodes like a boss, started SSRI(which elevated anxiety so far) and tried to fix things again.

So my last barrier was to exercise as it had been a major weapon for me to overcome my health anxiety. Today I tried to go for a run but was breathless and my chest was hurting(due cold I guess? I don't know) pretty bad. I became anxious and dizzy. My dizziness went on for hours and I think I still have it.

I am 27 and I had ECGs done during 2 of my attacks where the doctor told me it is not a heart attack this past month.

But this dizziness thing and basically whenever I measure my blood pressure it turning out quiet high at around 15 - 9/10 whenever I go to a doctor to have it measured is freaking me out.

I feel like my body is getting severely damaged due to my constant high blood pressure and the dizziness obviously screws my functionality. I'll go to a cardiologist regardless. I went to one 6 months ago and he told me all was fine before I was having these attacks.

But is it possible to have dizziness and hbp that often with anxiety? I can often see my blood pumping in the body when this state becomes very strong. I want to get back to exercising/working out to have a normal life but I am scared that its going to be what kills me...",4.560911730545879,6.174615186991872,5.666716027874568,77.9075304878049,70.57181571815718,8.740263259775455,30.79374758033295,9.23628265651192,2.8187552458381724,1520,65,279,32,28,504,188,369,0.239,0.6920000000000001,0.069,-0.9962,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,1,0,1,13,26,10,7,16,0,32,16,8,3,3,46,55,27,2,3,6,0,1,3,1,0,7,1,0,1,22,22,0,1,4,1,0,8,3,21,1,1,21,5,43,5,40,33,6,57,0,2,1,1,7,18,1,4,33,192,65,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1194762049767601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4124317697178649,0.07613270797718044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05999232505090572,0.0,0.46000231118934004,0.0,0.051819560083364295,0.05626871446762114,0.0,0.07442812357594128,0.05734482265885023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1497125356844736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728257873624345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05804381534298642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13795519703810624,0.0,0.06896444506294659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05968847038095276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03407494135542465,0.0481441818473156,0.0,0.07382360469493739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07041808763240824,0.0,0.15319955416716646,0.0,0.05389878150689242,0.0,0.07423884279710387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14326707633594507,0.0,0.15971744495447798,0.0,0.14240469539135422,0.0,0.0,0.06636661247482166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07455821551321444,0.0,0.037036360391855816,0.05493270289451682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04760029384151649,0.0987715935703017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06832395046649835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2151635827565006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05197613472843317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06602892362749077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045665921719593966,0.0,0.0,0.23720664203100306,0.0,0.0,0.1286647714075329,0.04672047094052823,0.05884326823064541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597328675310734,0.0,0.06856092859098886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06654053488440888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06747020068366336,0.0,0.0537019442244096,0.0,0.0,0.2283981239315413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047699734290896516,0.0,0.10763716422222856,0.0,0.15439244742260405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07004510781309994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08954324246861363,0.04318146573745072,0.0,0.05350096856029101,0.07859253009143127,0.0,0.0638788385725567,0.12879007856091793,0.07487393970609085,0.09150820286990397,0.14660422803355452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05820423248935844,0.0,0.11120935324833688,0.03974898919941633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12494436289430975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0490614893285765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13019288620972747
healthanxiety,Ionlyused59,2018/02/24,"Diagnosed with 2 illness' My whole life I have had severe generalized anxiety and health phobias. I have always worried there is something wrong. This started in 6th grade. I am 33 now. Everything I have worried about has never happened but I was diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome in '16 (autoimmune disease that attacks moisture producing glands) and more recently Hypogammaglobulinanemia (an immune deficiency where my blood lacks the proteins needed to protect me against virus and infection). 

Has anyone else with health phobias actually been diagnosed with an illness? It's been an incredibly difficult time for me but I'm working with a psychiatrist and just started seeing a therapist who specializes in chronic illness and anxiety. I'm looking for some words of encouragement or experiences.

healthanxiety,TheSuperSir,2018/02/24,"Scared of brain amoeba Exactly one year ago I was in New Zealand where they have these geothermal pools which have a brain eating amoeba in them, which is why you shouldn't inhale that water. I didn't go into one of those but I did go into a normal hot tub and scraped my knee doing so. And I sat there for a minute before realising that it was actually bleeding so I went up and cleaned the wound and put a band aid on. Then I sat back in but didn't put my knee back in. Lately I have been freaking out over this because I have been thinking a lot about health related things. I have heard that if you do get infected you will notice the symptoms really quickly but since it's been a year I should be in the clear, right?",4.038120805369125,4.70686224161074,4.792812080536915,87.23901677852348,70.87919463087249,7.839194630872482,24.967114093959733,7.908726449838941,1.1316491275167782,570,15,123,7,10,184,93,149,0.07200000000000001,0.904,0.025,-0.7615,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,3,2,0,8,2,0,1,9,0,20,12,4,0,2,18,28,11,0,4,4,0,1,0,0,3,6,1,1,0,11,7,2,0,1,2,0,5,3,2,0,2,12,3,17,0,15,12,1,27,0,0,0,0,7,13,0,2,9,91,28,0,0.0,0.0,0.16967012464279935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412352538129806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26738757848258105,0.0,0.1059883423804154,0.0,0.14794889463163807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3881884647750291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17791040941365846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09083887388812716,0.0,0.19762642594548127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18481359430743924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1961307203935121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14781638860720875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16792283485822387,0.0,0.0,0.1703537618822236,0.0,0.19794991402687348,0.0,0.0,0.23563496502351214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3495708023896166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11138431749896034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14848235473392554,0.0,0.0,0.17407223789159645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14382543800826922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18071546470643204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551019892219995,0.11140761847737277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16117741344008213,0.156888861148301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2239306323923102
healthanxiety,ChronicallyDamned,2018/02/24,"Lump in breast...? Help? A few days ago I discovered that there's a firm, oval-shaped lump (?) on the side of my right breast. It's smooth and I kind of have to press firmly to feel it. There's no pain, only if I press it, it kind of feels like when you have a bruise and you press on the bruised area lightly. So, not quite pain, just kind of like a dull feeling.

There are no other symptoms.

Should I go to the doctor just to be safe?
And in the event that it is serious, how long can I afford to wait before seeing a doctor?

I'm only 19, and I know breast cancer in young people is pretty rare, but I can't stop worrying that I might be in that unlucky tiny minority.

I'm posting this because I know little on the subject. I know that breast lumps are treated like a big deal, yet logically I know it doesn't seem likely...

healthanxiety,Anxioustrisarahtops,2018/02/25,"Frustrating set back with HA Looking for some support right now! My health anxiety started in the midst of some real health concerns. I was eventually diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary and am currently taking medication to deal with that. Even so I developed severe HA, concentrated around having a heart condition. 

I ended up in the hospital once and in urgent care half a dozen times over the course of 6 months. I also went to see my GP several times during this period. Every time an EKG was done and it came out normal. At the urging of GP I went to see a psychiatrist and therapist. 

I’ve been on Zoloft for about 8 weeks now. The beginning was rough but lately I’ve felt great. One of my biggest triggers has been my blood pressure, and it’s been weeks since I checked it. I was checking my BP just about every 10 minutes before. I was also afraid to exert myself, but have been able to start exercising again, which feels great. 

Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms- pain in my upper left chest, arm pain/numbness, and crushing fear all returned. I checked my BP several times and was only able to fall asleep when I collapsed from exhaustion. I took a klonopin, which I have so I can deal with panic attacks like last night. 

Today I’ve been feeling anxious the entire day, I’ve resisted taking klonopin again because I don’t want to become dependent on it. I feel incredibly frustrated. I have come such a long way in the last few weeks and I’m afraid I’m falling back into my old ways. 

I’m going back to my psych on Friday but I’m scared of spending the week in a near constant panic. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you deal with it and do you have any advice that can help? Having HA is like living in your own personal hell and I really don’t feel like I can go back to what my life was like before.

healthanxiety,mindsaremadeofclouds,2018/02/25,"I’m trying to open up and am requesting some general advice. I’m nearly 16 years old, healthy and a girl. I’ve never suffered from anything like depression etc. 

But recently my thoughts have been turning to horrible things. I get anxious about everything and everyday I’m battling with my mind to stay happy for the universe. I suffer bad when I’m ill from health anxiety because of my major fear of death. It’s just getting worse, I sit at night thinking ‘I don’t want to die’ and get really scared and nervous. And then I stress over school and negative thoughts overtake me. 

I struggle major when I’m ill, I can’t help myself but google my symptoms - it’s awful.

My parents don’t seem to get it, I tried opening up about my health anxiety and they just told me to get over it. It’s not as simple as that. And I’m scared to open up about everything else. Any advice?

healthanxiety,Choooosie,2018/02/25,"All of my problems I have had a lot of traumatic events these past few years. Add to that I have always been a bit of a worrier.

On top of that, my doctor told me I could have fibromyalgia (too soon to tell). I also had a superficial blood clot in my leg recently and read online that these can be associated with deadly DVTs.

I am so worried about EVERYTHING. Ever single day I am stressed and nervous. I Google health and read about these things constantly.

I am not sure what I need. I guess I just want suggestions (if you have any) and support. I really lost it after the latest stressful event (death of a family member).

healthanxiety,SlightLeadership,2018/02/26,"The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi all,

I've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kid,but this past month I have  been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable, but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.
Instead, I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.


The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancy(which is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october, and the circumstances made 
 pregnancy very unlikely),after PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago, I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative, which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovaries,and because of this I worry that  she could have missed it if it  was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms, pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.

I know this probably sounds crazy, but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?",5.433058875608674,6.908642294820719,5.4092895086321375,81.11724546259408,68.28286852589642,9.243116423196103,29.88069942452413,9.586721724236666,2.7430848162903927,1060,40,196,23,18,331,151,251,0.277,0.655,0.068,-0.9965,0,0,1,0,0,1,24.0,0,0,0,0,10,13,2,4,12,0,20,8,2,3,2,41,35,15,1,5,6,0,2,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,17,15,0,3,5,1,1,3,4,12,0,0,12,3,25,1,20,21,3,25,0,1,0,1,4,6,1,4,16,121,42,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11579417130083088,0.2100813793142448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08058221434649404,0.0,0.09065009542297316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09111709448662272,0.1978805595624101,0.07223484248566885,0.0,0.0,0.13350585706103402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13552932112807428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12424214434830308,0.12805346354717315,0.0,0.1892208729150281,0.13111498728189605,0.0,0.0,0.12216549324236872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12128698799468553,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071875745245467,0.0,0.0,0.10649771517821932,0.0,0.0,0.2666847700697895,0.05991578558585828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095488266022036,0.0619099383905157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12595706824145025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21065165548156195,0.13109968430342725,0.0,0.13024601304358446,0.0965910994225542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11876540565174165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10074215058028052,0.0,0.11212499217833764,0.07909785503883847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11964847376743545,0.0,0.18916679790956173,0.12594385635326025,0.0,0.08786423219336663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09012252169294824,0.2521789227686765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2262381254217463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12776011059885045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15182478467363675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10787547393692727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09802217514328614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0990690326536606,0.13573823472444474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09407360463098273,0.0690967173280059,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11575462495235145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19554533329544704,0.06989276633773815,0.0,0.1901027419238892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2406794811679195,0.12075885257756555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I’m a 22 year old male that too has significant health anxiety. 

I get occasional sinus infections and every time I google them it says “chance of sinus infection turning into deadly meningitis”.

I know legally these websites have to inform the public but it terrifies me. So much so that I literally turn off my phone call out of work and curl up in bed in fear.

healthanxiety,deathlevel,2018/02/26,"Constant state of fear that I’m going to die. My anxiety is entirely out of control right now. I cried not too long ago knowing that my panic and my anxiety stem from irrationality; nonetheless I am consistently sure, 100% that I am going to die suddenly. I am very convinced that I am going to go into full cardiac arrest and I’m only 31 years old. I’ll feel a small pain somewhere or smell something—they’re all symptoms of sudden and acute heart failure. Because I think this way, it makes my panic attacks just that much worse.

I wish I could shut my mind down.

healthanxiety,kevinkemple,2018/02/26,"100% sure i have hiv To start it off im a 17 year old male who had unprotected sex with a women i met from the internet (yeah i know im a dumbass) in her 20's 48 days ago. She said she was clean and even sent me a test she took febuary 5th saying she was negative. But then she blocked me. Now she could of done that because i pissed her  off constantly asking if she had hiv or she did it because she found out she did and did not want to be sued. 
two weeks after the sex my anxiety kicked in and i thought i had every symptom but a week later i found out that i had a 0.04% chance of contracting it, so it went away. fast forward to today, i am having daily headaches sometimes accompianed my nausa(huge hiv sympom). i had a 98% fever for one day last week and also had a leg cramp one day and sometimes would get some aches in my arm (maybe hiv or anxiety). 

Im scared out of my mind right now. The only reason i had sex was because i was feeling kind of depressed and thought sex would help. Little did i know that i was going to contract hiv from it :(. I will be a medical phenomenom, i can already see the headlines ""17 year old depressed boy has sex to make himself feel better, ends up contracting HIV instead"". I can't go to the doctor or get a test because im not 18 either. So i have to wait 4 more months until i find out i have HIv",1.9420468462951632,3.272780672535209,3.4770606246172697,92.12660440906308,76.78169014084506,6.4884262094304965,24.319657072872015,7.079830092131019,0.762936803429271,1037,34,237,11,23,343,153,284,0.103,0.8420000000000001,0.055,-0.9003,0,0,0,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,0,1,7,7,1,1,15,1,31,20,3,2,1,40,54,17,0,5,9,0,2,0,0,3,12,2,1,3,9,11,0,2,10,0,0,6,4,4,0,3,26,5,39,3,28,22,3,43,0,2,1,12,23,14,1,5,25,151,48,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09013811645540447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11221254760574267,0.08131790818409787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1555783551041344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09506227508625596,0.0,0.09553693394691924,0.0,0.0,0.24794630215642435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993261729508485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10988596940300396,0.0,0.08118764801660644,0.0,0.0,0.19673632815682973,0.0,0.1751632532325511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10407948276117314,0.0,0.10405963566679056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09006322715539568,0.0,0.0,0.06716235549984978,0.0,0.08567447269108204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028305521657233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0929387626109739,0.0,0.0,0.22298594312239006,0.0,0.0,0.10625301975086246,0.0,0.11558049786668545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06815768959929723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4393514305127168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10588986631716746,0.11176745249766827,0.08288730583096839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10191564812126266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678759030632477,0.0,0.10215681574203436,0.0,0.0,0.10243750709928208,0.0,0.0,0.10267343157556297,0.0,0.0811644464403603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2134037865325152,0.0,0.13780953858736358,0.07733645297008827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10454969471614348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08683891540546942,0.0967262563997908,0.08086444124716388,0.10180498799198597,0.0,0.08103022862708162,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20113924427261407,0.0,0.07197356503315465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09583743995337264,0.10569023491190868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16145395764796805,0.0,0.0,0.09638602416956747,0.0,0.11297640225541696,0.0,0.0,0.09933201979409548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059976779780350924,0.0,0.24469807575466546,0.0,0.0,0.0942635358664454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14446901324703276,0.0,0.0,0.1309643376672963
healthanxiety,wendys420,2018/02/27,"Found a swollen lymph-node Now I’ve had health anxiety since I was 4. I’ve had every cancer known to man, and many other various diseases, but I’ve never actually had any concrete symptoms. Until 2 weeks ago.

I was at work and felt a lump in my neck (was extremely scared, had a panic attack) but I told myself it was just a lymph-node and to get over it. I’ve gotten pretty good at being able to brush my symptoms off, so for about two weeks I kinda forgot it was there. Until like 3 days ago when I felt my neck and it was still there! Now I don’t know what to do. I’ve started googling again and I’m convinced I have lymphoma. I’ve also now got this pain on that side of my neck (that I’m pretty sure is just in my head) but I don’t know! I’m going to the doctor on Friday.

healthanxiety,sbesthrowaway,2018/02/27,"Testicular Cancer I'm like 90% sure I have testicular cancer.. basically around 3 months ago, i got a sharp pain in my testicle, immediately I got worried as I never have pain there.. so I looked it up and saw testicular cancer, I was shaking, etc. The next day or so I was experiencing symptoms of testicular cancer.. like abdominal pain, chest pain, etc almost every day for like 1 and a half months, so fast forward January I went to the ER because the chest pains were pretty bad, same with abdominal pain, etc. They did an EKG, chest x-ray and a nurse did a physical exam on me.. so for the EKG my heart rate was kinda high, also my blood pressure was high (but it always has been so not really worried), then I had a Chest X-Ray after I did that and got the results back saying ""all clear"".. my chest pain stopped like 10 minutes later still had abdominal pain tho, they did a blood test which also came back good but TC can't be detected in a common blood test. 

After that I got a physical exam and testicular exam, the testicular exam the nurse only examined the sides and front.. by the way I have a lump on the top of my testicle, didn't really tell her about it though but she said everything seemed fine.

So still almost everyday I worry that I have TC.. i'm scared they could of missed something on the Chest X-Ray. I'm thinking about going back to the ER soon and getting a testicular ultrasound. Also right now i'm having headaches, fever and my necks been hurting when I move it for about a week.. 

Could all of this be Health Anxiety? As some of the symptoms still persist when i'm not anxious or not thinking about it. I've also felt tired and fatigued lately.

I'm 15 years old by the way.",4.512466778480196,5.420128023738876,5.916039220745713,78.74464585214812,69.94955489614243,8.9469229776803,27.70855373500193,9.20300075937882,2.199472558379564,1332,44,264,26,23,451,162,337,0.158,0.785,0.057,-0.9849,0,0,1,0,0,0,50.0,0,0,3,2,28,22,0,3,26,0,25,30,11,1,5,39,47,31,0,2,8,0,2,4,0,0,19,2,0,0,10,12,0,1,5,0,0,7,6,15,2,1,23,7,27,7,28,20,7,50,0,3,2,0,8,13,0,7,34,166,37,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06493204693311883,0.0,0.14669935985383034,0.0,0.0,0.23431322678348715,0.0609501885731799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056036344293909336,0.0827520855467628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06520837294070476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16897507456188826,0.061161012092550565,0.04465275502090023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08377892670952343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11696894451997933,0.0,0.0,0.09448087738885964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24508062757419305,0.0,0.0,0.06171660891649351,0.0,0.06583272313609731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07033185712571402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0382703030446724,0.0,0.0416298820474348,0.06143894788650859,0.23434009884222284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07786173427943917,0.0,0.08680205932084348,0.0,0.15478610768473114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841605251247515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262962523152399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14314575303901506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06151187510894966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11693551746609847,0.07785356720678542,0.0,0.0,0.05649521292118712,0.0,0.07790261582205807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07686395737861974,0.0,0.0,0.055710218843757785,0.623548596347159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07452197588489254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09385214507082007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06255542885144233,0.06967789063268726,0.058251646481641724,0.07333641436352517,0.0,0.0,0.06668439972614028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056391725328726425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17549355707402273,0.06124060208367065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06903762130509038,0.15227039489043898,0.0,0.0,0.06402406543307687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09387177841647733,0.0719681316890781,0.0,0.0,0.08419054238724863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11628549272436507,0.05875704072873805,0.0,0.0,0.06790384107915069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22316796592892102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04717084655404865

healthanxiety,nubb1ns,2018/02/27,"Sleeps aids for someone afraid of medication? Hey guys, I've been struggling to sleep and was hoping someone could recommend a good sleep aid. Things like Zzzquil make my entire body tingly (anxiety, surely), and sleeping pills are a big no because I feel hypersensitive to medications. When I say hypersensitive I mean I could poke a xanax with my finger and eat the tiny bit of powder that comes off and it's still sometimes a bit too strong. The placebo is just too powerful with hypochondria.

So, enough rambling. Any good teas or extra weak medications that could help?

healthanxiety,thebrokengirlx,2018/02/28,"Brain Tumor Worry Hey everyone! I'm so glad I just found this sub because I've been struggling with health anxiety for almost my entire life, although it has gotten worse over the past two years. Usually I worry about stomach viruses and things related to throwing up, as that is my worst fear, but I've also worried about appendicitis, a stroke, epilepsy, leg cancer, and right now, a brain tumor. My health anxiety has had a profound effect on my life, especially in my transition to college, and it often limits me from eating, going out with friends, and even leaving my room.

I get migraines often, but my most recent headache is a little different. Yesterday, I had this weird pressure feeling on the top of my head, and eventually got one of my normal migraines. It went away this afternoon when I took two Advil, but the pressure feeling is still there. I don't know how to describe it, it's not really a pain but it just feels weird and a brain tumor was my first thought. I haven't had any other typical brain tumor symptoms, but I have been getting nosebleeds recently, which I've heard can be related to seizures.

People have told me not to be ridiculous because brain tumors are so rare. I know brain tumors are uncommon, but I've known three people that have had brain cancer, one of whom passed away about a year and a half ago (I didn't know her very well but it was still incredibly sad.) I just really hope I don't have one. Do my symptoms sound like typical brain tumor symptoms?

One stone is small while one is 9 millimeters. They sent me home, believing I can pass this stone thats 9 millimeters. Well I woke up early this morning in severe pain in my lower back.

healthanxiety,pen15es,2018/02/28,"It looks like I've found a home. My anxiety is ruining my life Hello everyone! So I have been suffering from severe health anxiety for years now, it's about my heart. When I was 18 I fell down the stairs in my house and when I got up my heart was beating totally out of rhythm seeming at random, turned out I had A-Fib and I had to get shocked (twice) back into normal rhythm. I am 22 now and have never gone back into A-fib but from what doctors have told me it's only a matter of time and usually it gets more and more common until it's always there. This scares the shit out of me. On top of that for whatever reason I get SVT's when I have panic attacks so my heart just beats out of my chest and it feels awful like what I would imagine a heart attack would feel like. So now I'm scared of getting these SVT's and since I'm scared of getting them I'll panic and actually get them. Just a giant negative feedback loop. I'm on cipralex for anxiety and have been for two years but just learned from a pharmacists that it can cause even more heart rhythm issues which is the source of my current anxiety attack, since the cipralex doesn't help at all anyways. How do you guys deal with this stuff? Other than with copious amounts of Ativan like I am now. Which still isn't helping.

healthanxiety,Damianjmcgrath,2018/03/01,"Heart anxiety for no reason Hello all,

First post on here, there's some really good advice from people in here so hopefully someone will have been through something similar to me. 

I just wondered if anyone else has the same thing as me. I am anxious about having a heart issue, every day, and this doesn't seem to be based on anything at all. There's no family history, I'm relatively young (32), have had all the heart checks available with nothing being found, my cholesterol is fine, and I can do mild exercise with no pain (I'm pretty unfit and just started doing exercise so I'm at a mild level). I threw away my blood pressure monitor because I think it was feeding my anxiety but when I used to take it, it was always in the normal range. 

But every day, I'll feel my heart beating in my chest at random times. Sometimes when I'm lying on my side, and in certain positions on the sofa. Sometimes I'll feel a strange vibration feeling in my chest. Or I'll feel my heart beat normally, then seem to stop, then thump back into rhythm. My partner will put her ear to my chest and tells me it's beating normally but to me, it feels like it's thumping and missing beats.

When I get any of those sensations, I'll worry about what it means and I'll feel panicky, especially if I'm on my own, or in a situation that I can't escape from, such as a plane or recently, on the London Eye ferris wheel. Maybe it's the thought of help not being easily available to get to me. The current snow in England is making me a little panicky that help won't get to me.

Along with those weird heart sensations, I'll get chest discomfort, like a heavy indigestion feeling, sometimes odd feelings in my arm, sometimes light headed feelings. None of it is painful, it's just like weird sensations. 

I've attempted to put my chest sensations down to digestive issues such as acid reflux and I've tried eating better and exercising to improve my health but so far, it hasn't made much difference.

I don't know if there is something going on that no one can find or whether I'm literally doing it all to myself.

I'm not an anxious person normally. I can talk in public, I'm not socially anxious at all, it seems to be this one and only issue and I've no idea where it came from. 

Does anyone else get these feelings, and if so, how do you ignore them and how have you managed to reduce them?

healthanxiety,anonymousiss,2018/03/01,"The flu is going around really badly at my university and I'm terrified of catching it I'm really freaking myself out a lot. I have a good immune system, I normally only get one cold or so a year, haven't had the stomach bug in almost 7 years (knock on wood), and I don't think I've ever had the flu (but maybe a flu like illness or two).

Anyway, I'm always health anxious about things like this, but it got a lot worse last week upon receiving an email that the flu is widespread and that they've been getting a large amount of cases. People in my classes claim to have it, people in my clubs claim to have it, etc. Luckily none of my five roommates (we live and share a bathroom together) have gotten it so far, but I'm still so freaked out. I obviously go above and beyond with precautions- hand washing before any kind of eating or touching my face, probiotics, Vitamin C immune supplements 1x a day, lots of fruit, water, sleep, not a lot of junk food, exercise. I clean the doorknobs every day and sanitize my phone and laptop daily. I still can't help but worry.

I've been taking my temperature a lot and feeling feverish but it never comes back with a fever. I've also had some trouble sleeping and I've been nauseous, had a funky appetite, and some questionable poops. You can catch the flu through air droplets so that's the only way I think I could ever get it but I'm still really freaked out.

Any advice on how to try and relax a bit?",5.1444213763936935,5.509574539792387,6.146407151095732,79.59259034986546,68.30795847750865,8.913571703191083,29.204344482891198,8.841846274778883,2.2194888888888893,1138,38,221,18,18,379,165,289,0.14800000000000002,0.732,0.12,-0.7521,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,1,1,0,0,16,11,0,0,21,0,18,23,6,1,4,48,35,26,0,2,10,0,3,2,0,0,13,0,1,0,12,19,4,0,4,3,0,6,6,5,0,3,9,5,18,6,25,25,11,35,0,0,0,0,8,14,0,12,15,141,30,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10878434722508047,0.0,0.0,0.11147472374077706,0.0,0.0,0.08902561759821229,0.092630335127752,0.0,0.0,0.15140802835163036,0.0,0.0,0.12576422807147886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991018006676166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560114497492075,0.09295073861967344,0.0,0.0,0.09472837033128792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1215367774096168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09589561252980804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08888301073438203,0.0,0.0,0.14358930694999025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11391205855703725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1241554849785806,0.0,0.201397534855173,0.09379511861590524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05628866764374616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13461320346563085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744863016565897,0.0,0.1265357832569372,0.09337313740696214,0.08903582744277773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183320135469786,0.0,0.0,0.07461800907258545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11592662621050365,0.0,0.09074377043674227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1087743892719724,0.0,0.09830097146343356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.473217648427868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11183973882741703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08585979188103836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10907370604617166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07543590063759101,0.16933356113711712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15435583782814233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12470815460239795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21395066661517875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22280843087102986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667100362619909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08370165724599142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739585985267847,0.14266361593477697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0755815654133256,0.0,0.10874719489127868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08836366559080301,0.0892972524159333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305474168169685,0.11344848192031524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14337777870252547
healthanxiety,BrownGuyReddits,2018/03/01,"I feel like I am okay I feel like I am okay in the sense that I feel stable when I think about my mental health as well as my emotional health. Physical health I am satisfied with even though I have slightly more fat than what I desire on my body. Regardless of these things I seem to be feeling well yet throughout some of my days in the week I feel anxious about something and I always get the feeling that it's regarding one of the three things I mentioned earlier (mental, emotional, and physical). 

More often than ever I feel like the problem might be anxiety. I'm not sure how to deal with it or what preventative measures I can take. I'd much rather read or listen to people who have been going through the same scenario as me than to approach a health councilor. 

Any sort of feedback on the things that I can do or maybe even some controversial practices I can try would be of great help.. hopefully


Thanks guys and gals! 


P.S. I feel like my anxiety is not on the level where I would need to start taking medicines for it. I would say that it is on a small level.

healthanxiety,ThrowawayImagrenade,2018/03/01,"2 Swollen Lymph Nodes...still freaking out About 2 weeks ago, I noticed a pea-sized growth under my skin in the inguinal groin region, then another. Was mis-diagnosed at first as a hernia, went to doc and they said if i threw up, go right to er. 

Next morning, threw up 3 times (from anxiety probably), went to ER. They poked me, said ""these are swollen lymph nodes, better order some tests."" So, I got bloodwork, a CT Scan and an ultrasound. Lymphoma, or another cancer is my ultimate fear. 

Everything came back normal. Just two enflamed lymph nodes on the CT Scan. They diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection, maybe given to me by the cat I got a week before all of this started. Gave me antibiotics.

So I am about two weeks out from that, finished my antibiotics and the nodes are still the same size. Have been to GP twice since the ER, thinking I felt more nodes, he said all seems normal, and it could take a month for the nodes to go down, and they may never go down. He says he doesn't think I have lymphoma and is almost convinced fully of it. 

Made the mistake of reading that only a biopsy can detect cancer, so have now convinced myself I have cancer somehow, despite 3 ER docs and a nurse telling me it probably wasn't. The nodes are still about the same size, maybe bigger, but not by much. This is kilin me.

edit: the doc and er doc say they are too small and superficial to even biopsy right now, which makes me feel even dumber.

healthanxiety,ahartzer2015,2018/03/01,"Last Saturday, I jumped over a fence, when I landed on my feet, my knee popped out of place. I’m scared I hurt it pretty bad. But I can’t go to the dr. Every day now, it’s been getting better. Every day I can bend it a little more. My parents said that it’s happened to them and that it takes a while to get better but it will. I’m wearing a brace and taking pain medicine and using ice/heat. Elevating it when I can. Even while sleeping. 


When it popped out of place, it started swelling up, and the swelling went away about 48 hours later. Now it’s still a sharp pain and often feels if it’s going to buckle when I walk too fast or the wrong way. I can’t fully bend it because it feels tight and like the muscles or tendons are twisting up. And the pretty bad sharp pain when I apply full pressure is on the middle of my knee. 

I’m just scared and I can’t afford the dr. We don’t have insurance.. I can’t be hurt now.. I have so much going on I can’t.. :( ",0.25699491447064204,2.1335540291262163,2.155131761442444,97.08318770226538,83.95145631067963,4.506333795654185,18.061950993989832,5.288315135182226,-0.6288767452612105,734,17,173,3,21,243,106,206,0.203,0.7340000000000001,0.063,-0.9864,2,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,1,0,1,2,15,14,0,3,12,0,15,11,6,1,0,23,32,21,0,1,6,1,5,1,0,1,5,1,0,0,15,11,0,2,2,0,0,6,6,11,0,0,3,6,19,3,17,27,3,43,0,2,0,0,4,17,0,4,20,110,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12274137647285413,0.0,0.218159301248722,0.07963744795008439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310824260434847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16850507772279272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08628704753902726,0.0,0.22014109668899334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321118754271213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13650890142512018,0.0,0.22273861242171814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11552526982010568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12865491899662296,0.0,0.2797074580276334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10648972695179902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382451906710129,0.13093644957746955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09603605449466153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4170332171780511,0.0,0.14506120062564426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27298375988483803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2658174158746869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12426936223610495,0.0,0.2615885572564304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13073519455836793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09246826412428276,0.0,0.10432994941010988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1964513174323571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1128317468217914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1036966237564958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12110537428251708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14283525817967718,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,fastcar2212016,2018/03/01,"Scared of dying from the flu I just started working at Walgreens 3 days ago. I’ve successfully avoided the public since the flu epidemic for the last few months so jumping into a job where sick people come in all day nonstop has sent me to a whirlwind of anxiety. 

Last night my throat started itching and hurting but I just said it was from talking so much at my new job. 

24 hours later here I am with a cough, sore throat, and a fever of 100.2

I know it’s not strep because my tonsils are fine. I’m sure it’s the flu 

I’m delirious and having panic attacks because of feeling bad and being scared that I’m going to die.

healthanxiety,EM2128,2018/03/02,"Heart/Diabetes anxiety for 4 years Last night when I couldn't sleep I started reading this subreddit and immediately felt some what comforted that I recognised myself in some of your stories. I thought I would share mine and get some of your imput. I think it would really help.

When I was 23 and finishing up a very stressful period of writing my thesis I woke up one night completely convinced I was having a heart attack. I managed to calm myself down but every since then not a day has gone by where I don't think I could die at any second. For the most time I worry about my heart. I got pains at the top of my stomach, like someone pressing two fingers right under my ribcage, which the doctor said was acid reflux but in my mind it is always the worst. One time, years ago, I heard a commercial on the radio where a woman said ""I thought I was just gassy, turns out I was having a heart attack!"". I turned it off right away but I couldn't get it out of my head. Especially when I learned that heart attacks in women can present as stomach pains/acid reflux. Everything I feel is related to my heart. Checking my pulse constantly is the new normal. It's completely exhausting. My father has since died from a heart attack and my uncle has had many stents so that its in my family history also doesn't help.

My other main worry is about diabetes. Because my dad was very overweight, I grew up with the family doctor telling me that if you are too heavy you Will get diabetes. Now, even more so after his death, I am completely terrified. I monitor how often I pee every day and if its more than usual I freak out. I get tested every couple of years but months after the last test my mind will go to 'but what if you do have it now. It will all be your fault. You did this. You're sick and it's your fault.'

I have a lot to live for. I'm getting married later this year and I refuse to let  few chemicals in my brain screw up my life but that voice in the back (or more often than not, front) of my head is very hard to get rid of.

healthanxiety,dogerwaul,2018/03/02,"Recent doctor's visit has me in a spiral I don't know where else to turn. I feel like my entire world is caving in. A few days ago, I went for a routine eye examination and at the end of it my doctor told me that I had an inflamed optic nerve and one pupil smaller than the other. She suspects that I might have idiopathic intracranial hypertension. She's seen this a few times. Sets me up with a specialist. Specialist calls and sets appointment some time in April. Today, I get a call saying that appointment was a mistake and they need to see me next week. They used the word ""serious."" My mind is racing now. I'm trying to calm myself down and think clearly, but I can't. They're not going to diagnosis me with IIH (which is a benign disease), it'll be terminal brain cancer or MS. I just know it. Basically, IIH makes your brain swell due to excessive spinal fluid. It gives you nasty headaches. Weight loss and meds are the treatment. I'm going to die of brain cancer at 28. This is how my life ends. This is the most convinced I've ever been in my entire life and all the history of health anxiety that I've had. This will be the end. I can't fucking believe this is happening to me. I had my appendix and gallbladder removed, and had to fight the fears of intestinal cancer. Now my brain is telling me: ""See? It took three/fours to metastasize to your brain, and now you're gonna die."" I can't stop panicking.

healthanxiety,fencer164,2018/03/02,"Issue with Anxiety and Throat Hey guys, 

First time posting but been dealing with anxiety for a while... A lot of my anxiety goes to my health... 3 years ago I began to have these extremely painful sores in the back of my throat. Went to a bunch of doctors and they couldn't tell me what was happening (they said it was stress). I also got oral thrush in my throat and mouth along with headaches, stomach aches, flu and cold symptoms. I began to get extremely anxious with everything that I spiraled out of control. I landed myself in a psychiatric hospital by the end. I almost lost my job, my wife, and my life because of it. Turned out I wasn't crazy but was having an adverse reaction pyhsical and mental to mold in our apartment we had recently moved  into before my symptoms popped up. Every thing gradually got better, my anxiety went way down... my health returned....But the one side effect was my throat became extremely sensitive. It easly scratches and a white scab will form while it heals. But my anxiety self that pops up during this time will freak out and go into PTSD mode remembering all the bad memories. I impulsively have to check my throat  and look at any injuries a lot during the day and even sometimes take a Q-tip and touch the area and see if the scab come off just to make sure it isn't one of those sores like before. 

Anyway I just wanted to know if anyone has gone through something similar and of anyone has some coping techniques that might help (yes I see a therapist and whatnot as well). Getting sick or feeling like I'm getting sick extremely stresses me out as well because of these issues. 

Thanks everyone!",5.7329523809523835,6.890270587096777,5.773594470046085,79.96134408602153,67.3225806451613,9.001536098310293,31.21351766513057,9.23628265651192,2.7250614439324123,1302,51,237,24,21,410,182,310,0.15,0.768,0.08199999999999999,-0.972,1,0,1,0,0,0,38.0,2,0,2,5,8,14,0,2,16,1,17,22,7,3,2,50,43,25,0,4,8,1,3,2,0,3,15,1,0,2,14,27,0,1,4,0,1,6,3,7,2,3,16,9,30,7,41,23,6,40,0,1,4,0,12,19,0,8,15,157,44,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726249236989501,0.0,0.09857499012081798,0.0,0.0,0.07872367009090309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06694362810748533,0.0,0.3765375725349248,0.11121092857360874,0.0,0.13766523799574956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07569547370985663,0.082194580382758,0.12001810749381035,0.0,0.16753301297758033,0.0,0.0,0.0870635491301804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08479867669138501,0.0,0.0,0.11041056634578607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06348665436913205,0.1014889130747802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10075909534678257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0871899922198188,0.0,0.0,0.06501971379942698,0.0,0.08294124964547195,0.0940651174007941,0.08847291548147672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04977500433012157,0.0703266613117383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08373433014342489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542949368684975,0.0,0.055946600116667855,0.0,0.15746539692675066,0.0,0.0,0.09747260913299764,0.08705153547996257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2092775236383574,0.0,0.0,0.06598329433199224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20549479966216785,0.09768804626406334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054100900120348634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953217636864269,0.09618713541570734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08266610688989154,0.0,0.10746057801377017,0.16738296702038952,0.0,0.0,0.06571049746847972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09920592633353956,0.10443092546939632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10462778605068238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13341308075178376,0.0,0.10474874734629973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0942797908929402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11507290124660867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719915222899676,0.0,0.11151508345624192,0.0,0.09364045470410064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568903364161123,0.0,0.10269600350424453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07578511280095332,0.09736120777112747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22552892047090106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09277999365361736,0.2046369212104801,0.07401579263211533,0.0,0.08604225163420673,0.09063175103840436,0.0,0.11429822420494146,0.06540019005636269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480411616301812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1070761356427486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058063375337370327,0.07813831844883433,0.0,0.0,0.17702154738648726,0.18251260183309112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06339312915460629
healthanxiety,smiley-j,2018/03/02,"Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. 

I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now, and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control, I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.

It all started just over a year ago, when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why, as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.

Since then, I've been fine. I have ibs, which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things, asthma, skin problems, but nothing unmanageable.

I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind, then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food, had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.

Ibs is more under control now, but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general, have quite a foggy head alot of the time, don't really feel like myself, don't want to do much, getting tired out easy, feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.

The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.

Any time I find the tiniest little lump (found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach) I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't, any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.

It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding, being hyper aware of every tiny sensation, looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.

It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day, I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.

Anyone got any advice, or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about, but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something.

healthanxiety,endothermicsomething,2018/03/03,"Different size pupils after an eye exam So I had this monday an eye exam and the doctor put 3 drops of atropine in my eyes. I have noticed in the first day that the pupils were coming back at normal at different sizes. Now it's saturday and my right pupil it's still a little bit bigger than the other one.

healthanxiety,throwaway72918111,2018/03/04,"Convinced I'm dying from visiting auto body shop Hi everyone,

So basically I’m freaking out because I’m thinking about how I used to visit my estranged dad’s body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. I can’t imagine that I would have gone more than 10-15 times or so in a given summer, and some years I probably only went a couple of times, others none at all.

I would go to work with him to wash/vacuum cars, answer the phone, and sometimes wetsand cars. However, there would be times where I would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. Or, I would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. I’m currently freaking out bc I can’t imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me, even though I wasn’t doing any sanding or painting myself. His back shop is rather large, and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation https://imgur.com/FviJwNq see building on the left). I think I remember a couple of times in the winter I was there and he had the doors shut though. I probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him.

My biggest fear is that I’ll wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. I probably first went to his shop when I was 5, and stopping visiting after I was 18 or 19. I have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. Does this limited secondhand exposure to dust/paint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? Or does that typically require years of direct exposure?

Was my dad 100% in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? Part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their family-owned businesses, but still.

It’s gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind, and its very difficult to care about anything, since I feel like I’m dead anyway.

I think its entirely possible that I’m overreacting, and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that I just graduated college and started my first job.

Can someone please let me know what they think?

healthanxiety,helpmesavetheplanet,2018/03/04,"legit anxiety and health anxiety so im roughly 50 lbs over weight

id really like to get in shape, here is where the problem comes in

i have legit anxiety as well as health anxiety.

so excersizing is really hard for me. because every time i excersize my body temp goes up and my heart rate goes up (which its suposed to)
but my paranoia kicks in and i start thinking about heart attacks and i start to freak out and panic.

its making losing weight really hard,

but i know if i dont lose the weight thats also a problem.. so its a really conflicting position to be in.

my diet is a lot better than its ever been, im making much better choices but its not perfect by any means. and im always improving on it.

so what should i do? any tricks to staying calm during excersize?

how can i get over the feeling of dread when my body temp and heart rare go up?",1.76971602434077,3.881705816091959,3.931649763353618,85.10479716024344,79.91954022988506,7.312508451656524,22.878972278566604,8.313332769828598,1.514846923597025,668,22,134,14,17,229,101,174,0.218,0.669,0.113,-0.9579,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,0,0,0,5,12,15,2,2,6,0,10,11,5,3,2,28,22,20,0,4,5,0,7,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,9,9,4,1,4,0,0,2,2,9,1,0,1,7,14,6,23,19,2,21,0,2,0,0,0,13,0,2,6,87,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08082848244346069,0.08410129150011908,0.0,0.0,0.1374669616632292,0.0,0.3092839603214524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1149857560350607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061613498730808125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17878268490806426,0.0,0.2245398601467392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08706591476570838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845744934613978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09142681370471337,0.08515882622172619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051105824448666265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10561351777586364,0.0,0.05744242843454465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18108409816018053,0.0,0.0,0.21487291720115806,0.0,0.35931793475854146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32753033907958146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05554738048294231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04937943173417722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22615090054314005,0.0,0.08592911887567914,0.0,0.0,0.1349347606596361,0.0,0.0,0.1100987280731468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430068986423839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1185880349163992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19342747659149456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2590012203501441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14308075964042716,0.10773095740284436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476385049046994,0.0,0.0,0.05893680056458533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3692410682651944,0.09087726104817576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,RainbowStuffAndJunk,2018/03/04,"A happy story! So I’m almost 19 and suffer moderate HA, usually a few times a year. So far I haven’t seeked professional help for it so I’ve been trudging along on my own. 

Well, for the past week or two I’ve had this random pain in my back, primarily my left rib. Naturally the worries happened: cancer of any sort, kidney problems, etc. Well today I went to the ER (my family doctor lives six hours away) and while they didn’t look inside me, he poked and prodded and said that he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong since I didn’t have any other symptoms. Also, bercitis (not spelled right) runs in my family, which is inflammation, in my family’s case, the RIBS. So I’m feeling pretty good. I hope this lifts your spirits, and helps with your doctor-fears, of which I also suffer.~",4.333906158357774,5.467119458064516,5.435777126099712,81.18821114369503,70.54838709677419,8.217008797653959,25.703812316715545,8.575989854853784,1.7039677419354835,616,18,120,10,11,204,108,155,0.117,0.718,0.165,0.7295,0,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,2,1,0,10,11,0,0,7,1,8,7,3,0,0,16,17,13,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,7,7,0,0,2,0,0,2,5,5,3,2,6,3,15,6,12,11,3,19,1,2,1,0,8,8,0,5,9,72,22,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14141390686074845,0.0,0.0,0.2258711207848281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1920722483159191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11621406209398966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13268316185706205,0.10859136435992647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2890943698250293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15750038753035858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3993959363376743,0.15891454396706767,0.0714063254554324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845070984225226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12488256621035933,0.15033394820569784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18931689321182305,0.0,0.0,0.14026578031581954,0.13907568850436888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15343862979517056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12470203070587295,0.0,0.11859130927570813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15027066787279714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13481282984383602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14367402512683802,0.0,0.13513083385817246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12060322005557905,0.13433491115437854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682068876658327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14678422224978568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09048965818983384,0.0,0.0,0.08234795950985825,0.0,0.13386239140513906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1379538353957597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15553660191356586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132801491881904,0.0,0.2539519261810356,0.13091464703625091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14341827612435945,0.0,0.0,0.1544046044174908,0.0,0.09094264225533663
healthanxiety,morgank25,2018/03/04,"Worried about ovarian cancer Hello,

I’m new to this subreddit but deff not new to health anxiety.  I’m 26, and 5 years ago my gyno basically diagnosed me with PCOS. My periods have been irregular for the better part of 5-6 years but lately have been regular...maybe a few days off. 

Well last month, my anxiety started to get really bad. I was having panic attacks daily and didn’t sleep well. A few days ago I started worrying that I have ovarian cancer bc I was bloated. It ended up subsiding but now my period is “due” (meaning this date range is when I usually get it) and I have lower back cramping, pelvic cramps, bloating but no bleeding. So basically I’m worried that it’s OC. I’m also thinking it could possibly be because of stress but I’m not sure

Any insight would be much appreciated.

healthanxiety,pageantrella,2018/03/04,"I’m experiencing calf pain after a loonnnggg bus ride. DVT? Hi everyone, 

First of all, I’m a 27yo female who is pretty active and in general good health. I am taking oral contraceptives so I am at a higher risk of clots. I’ve been taking the same birth control pill for 10 years without any trouble. 

I recently went on a trip and was on a bus for 15 hours straight. I did walk around or stand up every few hours or so. I also had the seat next to me for myself so i was able to extend/raise my legs and stretch out. I was very hydrated during that trip. 

Once I got to my destination, everything was okay. I had to get back on the bus to go home, which was only going to be 5 hours (the first one took so long due to weather/traffic). I walked around about half way through my return trip, but i did notice my lower legs started to hurt towards the end of my trip. Also, i admit, i definitely wasn’t drinking as much water as i probably should’ve. 

It’s been 24 hours now and I’m experiencing mild pain in my lower left leg. My calf just seems crampy.  It hurts a little when i flex my toes up to the sky (that also hurts on the other leg as well). I do feel slight muscle spasms in my other leg but no pain. I have no noticeable swelling or warmth on my legs. The crampy feeling sort of extends to my thigh as well, but i do have sciatica so I’m not sure if that’s what I’m feeling. I can walk totally fine and have no pain when doing so. I mostly feel this pain when i am sitting or laying down. 

I’d love some advice on whether or not i should go to the ER to be safe or if it’s just likely my muscles are dehydrated and sore from being stuck in a relatively small area for a while.

healthanxiety,margueritebourgeoys,2018/03/04,"Itchy vagina - anxious nighttime scratching NOT STI related. Advice wanted. I scratch my vagina - a lot. I do it most before bed and often wake up in the middle of the night scratching. I scratch when I'm watching Netflix and anytime I'm 'idle.' I get the urge to scratch sometimes at work, but very rarely when I'm busy or out having fun.

I've been tested for STIs and yeast and bacterial infections many times, it's none of these things.

The scratching problem also affects my anus but to a lesser extent.

When I get the urge to scratch, it's like a twitch that I can't ignore. Once I start scratching I find it very hard to stop. I feel relief when I scratch until I scratch so much that I tear the skin and it begins to hurt and bleed. When I'm scratching I notice that I'm usually holding my breath and my body is tense.

My suspicion is that it's an anxious behaviour and now that I've suffered for over 4 years, it's become an unconscious 'tick' that I can't kick.

I tried acupuncture and only experienced a mild improvement from 1 of my total 5 sessions. The improvement didn't last.

Has anyone else suffered from this condition? Any and all advice/personal stories would be so very appreciated.

healthanxiety,yournumberonefran,2018/03/05,"Need some support this week! Hi friends! Long time reader, first time poster. I've suffered from health anxiety for a few years now, and I'm currently going through one of my worst bouts yet.

I'm getting a colonoscopy later this week because of some gastrointestinal issues (I'm in my 20s), and my doctor has assured me multiple times he is not expecting colorectal cancer based on my symptoms. However, it's all I can think about. I can't stop Googling my symptoms, finding people younger than me who were diagnosed with cancer, finding people with less symptoms than me finding out they had cancer, etc.

Just looking for any advice to get through the next few days. Sending so much love to everyone who has to live like this.

healthanxiety,Red-handed-anxiety,2018/03/05,"Chewed tobacco over the weekend. Anxiety going crazy Kinda like the title says, but I chewed tobacco this weekend. I was with a friend on vacation and while drunk, I packed a few dips. I don't normally chew, and the total times I have done it in my life are in the single digits.

But I got a small canker sore from it, and it is driving my anxiety crazy thinking I have cancer. Lesson learned: Not worth doing it cause it will drive my anxiety crazy.

healthanxiety,Ieatpancake,2018/03/05,"Colon cancer anxiety Hey all. I've been losing my sleep worrying about this. Last week i've had bouts of diarrhea, they ocurred around the same time for 3 days or so. After that, i've had constipation, and i'm still suffering from it. I can pass stools with a lot of straining, but they're really small, rabbit like (no blood).
Also, last friday night i woke up very suddenly and threw up. That was the only time this happened though, and i had eaten out all day (a thing i don't usually do) but it still makes me worry.

I should also add i've started taking Paxil again last tuesday after tapering off of it in January due to my anxiety. I've read that it might cause some of the stuff i'm feeling, but i never had those the first time i took it, so i can't help but think i have cancer or something.",4.002960088691797,4.658504817073172,5.190399113082041,84.40471175166299,70.95121951219512,8.646563192904656,25.274944567627486,8.841846274778883,1.6281658536585355,626,17,132,11,11,208,105,164,0.163,0.804,0.033,-0.9593,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,2,10,4,0,1,6,0,13,6,3,2,3,25,25,14,0,1,6,0,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,13,7,1,0,2,1,0,3,4,3,0,1,10,1,13,1,17,13,5,32,0,2,0,0,3,7,0,5,23,87,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434930954679787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23292689223116386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13552618258664642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1563927693584988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19636485412069166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697729200936898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949555845158842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13462563301978234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10204349319283126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3722885977236129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437694190172996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17031800286068344,0.0,0.12942929591997918,0.0,0.0,0.10162161148524623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16150294616451988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1174171382652125,0.0,0.0,0.1428672493779419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11578564148237044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15228154194903967,0.0,0.09752906241490188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15235028970537476,0.0,0.0,0.11720205425500364,0.0,0.0,0.10775649874141632,0.0,0.2431586700317487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17427877018163854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11446579180505168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114171952749207,0.09754946495117396,0.14957536457140128,0.0,0.26631770582519737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1691446233327146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16767123006656096,0.12561422732731228,0.0,0.0,0.12211802059982375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3092149175942573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,PleaseUpvoteToMyXbox,2018/03/06,"Tiny grain like feeling under foreskin 18 white male

No meds

Probably anxiety issues


So I've noticed that when I'm erect I can feel this tiny little bump thing on the tip of my penis head. I'm not circumcised and I feel like it's under the skin, like on my head. 

It doesn't really feel like a bump though, it almost like a grain, or like a gash or cut kinda feeling. It feels like it's almost inside the tip, I don't know.


I've felt it for about 2 weeks


I've looks up penile cancer and it's apparently super rare, so I don't know...

healthanxiety,QazWsx543,2018/03/06,"Inhalated AC/refrigerant chemicals Today, I was in sitting in a lounge area of a building at my university for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden, someone (who happens to be the professor of a class I'm in) walks by and asks ""Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?"". I took a whiff, and lo and behold, there was a *very* strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks, but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there. 

Since then (this was about an hour ago), I've kinda been feeling a weird sensation in my lungs or possibly my esophagus (not sure).

healthanxiety,yupsss,2018/03/06,"I don't wanna jump to conclusions, but I'm a little worried about diabetes Just recently I have started to have trouble sleeping. My schedule, and everything has been a little messed up. I sleep for like 3 hours wake up, and can't go back to bed for a couple of hours while I feel decently thirsty, and hungry. Eventually I fall back asleep for another couple or hours, and wake up, not able to sleep until the next time. So after I have finnaly accumulated a normal amount of sleep I will eventually get up, but I don't really feel that great, but I don't necessarily feel that bad. 

For the past two-three days it seems to have been weird. The first day it was the same cycle except I woke feeling pretty aweful. Headache, not well rested, and tired. The second day I didn't really get a full 7-8 of rest, so for most of the day I felt like I was on the verge of falling asleep if I had any downtime of not doing really anything. That night I decided I would get a full night's rest in one full go as usual. I fell asleep pretty easy, but I woke up like 4 hours later having to pee pretty bad, and feeling thirsty. I was able to immediately go back to bed though. I awoke 3 more hours later, feeling as if I have to pee again, not as bad this time, BUT my thirst was pretty intense. I chugged some water, went to the bathroom, and gone back to bed. 

So I'm kind of afraid that this could be diabetes or something. I'm not overweight, but I'm definitely not active. My eating habits aren't too great either. I eat good foods, but most definitely eat a lot of bad foods.

TL;DR: I'm not sleep well. Waking up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty, and having to pee. Thirst exclusive to night.

healthanxiety,screamer201,2018/03/06,"HEALTH ANXIETY SYMPTOMS Hi guys, they said I have health anxiety, but I can't believe them because the symptoms are very real. Sometimes, I don't know if this is really anxiety. I went to hospital a lot of times and they said they don't find anything aside from my tubercolosis. But my doctor said that my TB is just mild and I don't have cough so it's not a reason yet to give me shortness of breath. I also had three ECG's and it all came up normal.

It is really possible that you wIll just experience anxiety symptoms without any reason? Like I'm just playing computer and suddenly I can't breath. I worry most when I can't breath. YES! I can't breath. It's just suddenly. I;m not anxious about anything then suddenly I can't just  breath.

healthanxiety,tleisher,2018/03/06,"I could use some reassurance. Swollen lymph node, getting a biopsy Friday I have been having reoccurring sinus infections due to a tooth that needed a root canal. During that time, I went to an ENT who told me that my nose was a bit crooked and that was another reason. 

While I was there I thought I'd ask him about a lymph node in the back of my neck. When I first discovered it I thought it was a knot in a muscle so I tried to massage it out but it never went away. Eventually, I asked my GP about it and he said not to worry unless it grows. I don't think it has.

I told him that it had been there for at least 2 years but more likely 3-4 years. He asked if it was stable and I said yes but he wanted to get an ultra sound. 

The ultra sound tech said she thought it was just a lymph node. I asked if she thought there was cancer in it, and she didn't think so but would let my ENT make that call. 

I went to the follow up and he mentioned the ultra sound doctor thinking it was a lymph node but wanted to get a needle point biopsy on it. He said that 9/10 times it was nothing but he would be a bad doctor if he didn't check. 

This triggered my health anxiety. What if I'm that 1/10? My brother had lymphoma when he was 27, and I'm 31. So I'm terrified. 

I poked it, and it got harder, and my neck got sore, and now I can't stop checking it even though I know I need to. I'm trying not to push on it and just brush my hand across it, but it's still there and it's still freaking me out. 

A few weeks ago I had a routine physical and my blood work was normal. My white blood cells were high but they were at 8 and the range was 1-10 was normal. My GP didn't think anything was wrong aside from minor cholesterol stuff that he put me on vitamins for.

So I'm getting the biopsy on Friday, and following up on Wednesday to get the results. But in the meantime I'm spiraling here and looking for reassurance or help. 

I don't feel sluggish (aside from being tired, I have a very active 11 month old baby.) My color is good, no fever, no night sweats. I have chest pain but that's just anxiety that comes and goes with my panic attacks. My appetite is fine. My blood work came back fine. 

I'm over reacting, right?

healthanxiety,boyfella,2018/03/07,"I can't trust myself I have self DX-ed hypochondria, I've known I've had it for 4 years now.. The thing I struggle with the most is never being able to trust how I'm feeling. Every single symptom I feel, I panic.. ""is this a real symptom?"" ""is this just my anxiety?"" ""do I have anxiety because of my symptom or do I have the symptom because of my anxiety"" 

I feel like I'm going crazy, my family isnt supportive at all, a lot of the time I just need reassurence that I'll be okay, and yet all I get is sarcasm and jokes at my expense. 

I want to get better. I want to take medication but I cant force myself to take these pills. I'm too scared of the side effects. Scared I'll choke when taking the pill.

healthanxiety,UtCanisACorio,2018/03/08,"Just when I think I've made it, I get pulled back in. I've had so many tests, painful and otherwise, over the past several weeks.  After finally getting a nearly clean bill of health, I brought up with my doctor the one thing I didn't think about until recently. I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery.  what started to scare me, is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 *months*.  My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.'s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away: I not only have the one, but *multiple* enlarged lymph nodes in that area.  My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged (at least one is on the order of 2cm), but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean; apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.

I've been freaking out all day and I've been trying to avoid the internet, but the soonest I can get in to see an ENT is next Tuesday, so I get to spend the next 4+ days agonizing about this. I'm 38 years old, and I've been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months (mostly heart related) that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...",6.743333333333332,6.133567142857146,6.735000000000002,80.02333333333334,65.07142857142857,10.323809523809524,32.95238095238096,9.725611199111238,2.8183523809523816,1120,40,228,20,15,357,154,280,0.125,0.8370000000000001,0.038,-0.9728,1,1,1,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,0,3,14,9,0,4,20,0,20,15,2,2,1,37,38,16,0,3,10,0,2,1,0,0,13,1,3,0,12,10,0,1,6,0,2,2,5,7,0,4,8,5,23,2,35,28,5,41,0,1,2,0,2,17,0,1,21,145,35,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08560077614736429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10513076438071216,0.08604176280184014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142591842197743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17868104285197828,0.12381172489133148,0.0,0.1443284093114797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3435934709327397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07390680734250239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11315680862104745,0.0,0.0,0.12257751849147362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23384592162803636,0.0,0.0,0.09385376028775368,0.08949412473327893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2378822162824159,0.0,0.13259829388730074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054667143782925434,0.0,0.0,0.09902518200643888,0.0,0.12518394159721594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10587949534083407,0.07469200943830857,0.22689166524246035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1129839099622661,0.0,0.17862997988931406,0.0,0.0,0.08297008884822786,0.0,0.0,0.23800711707037325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11741691026198732,0.0,0.3032967781589557,0.08510258890824035,0.11906612682690185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21363638989968814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07168398083768672,0.0,0.11048462993551864,0.0,0.0,0.09555928976788562,0.0,0.0889848581937632,0.22405651433849144,0.0,0.17833458792475013,0.0,0.0,0.12641157876863698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08614365403834233,0.0,0.0,0.0792011591176299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1163036610536348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433928825908237,0.1433979534538845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07597060910096952,0.0,0.0,0.11648855645244233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08975689534852385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07205789612856077

healthanxiety,pixihawk,2018/03/08,"(vent) I probably got cavities from grinding my teeth for years and i'm fed up with being so anxious all the time This is my first post here, i just recently found this subreddit and it already helped me a lot just reading everyones posts. I always felt like i was completely alone in this, as my close family and friends are usually brushing me off. Also i apologize in advance, i'm not a native speaker so my english might be a bit off at times.

Anyway, the main point of this is to just... put my feelings out there. I'd guess a few of you can relate. I hope this won't be too much, since i do tend to overshare when i'm depressed and i am depressed at the moment.

I've been anxious and obsessive ever since i can remember. Couple of years ago i was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and major depression, as well as BPD. Two years ago i was also diagnosed with AvPD and OCPD. I went through DBT two times, a third time is already scheduled. I was in therapy for over 5 years, but i have to quit. I've also been on Pregabalin for two years.

Health Anxiety started last year for me, after I had finally cut ties with an emotionally abusive friend who basically made the past four years a living hell. I don't know if that was the cause but it happened around the same time. 

I've always grinded my teeth at night and i was wearing a mouth guard ever since that was discovered. However recently i lost mine, as i lost my bag during traveling (which has caused a lot of stress for me over the past week, as losing things is something i've always been anxious about), so the grinding has been worse. 

Thanks to my medication i have a very dry mouth and to top that off i also currently have a very bad cold, that's already got me on edge wether i'm developing pneumonia. 

Yesterday night was a very bad time for me. While brushing teeth my gums were bleeding a lot - i have very good oral hygiene, my doctor has never had any complaints and my gums never bleed - so brushed my teeth, used mouth wash and then went to sleep, trying to not go into the anxiety cycle again. After that however instead of falling asleep I spend hours googling things and being caught up in memories of said former abusive friend. I don't know where that came from, but it just overwhelmed me. 

Today i found a tiny black spot on my teeth, that won't go away. It looks like a tiny hole. And instead of listening to what i learned in therapy - i should've known better - i googled again. Turns out you can get cavities from grinding your teeth and wearing them down. I am fairly certain this is what's going on and i've scheduled an appointment for Monday. And now i'm trying to find ways to get through the weekend without too much stress, because i'm worried that might make my cold even worse and... you all probably can guess how the cycle spirals downwards from here.

The thing i wanted to say about all this is the following: This sucks. Majorly. I am so tired of this anxiety, this obsessive overthinking of everything my body does; i'm tired of all these bad things that happened in the past still haunting me to this day. I'm tired of all the diagnosis i got - it feels like there's no chance of recovery because of all the things i have to work through. And i'm also tired of being aware that stress will wear my body down but that thought alone is causing me so much stress that it's a long spiral i can't seem to escape from. This right now feels like another punishment for not getting this right. I'm trying not to be too negative, but the thoughts keep forming in my head. Sometimes i just wish i could start anew because after i learned in therapy just exactly how all my problems started and how they escalated, i just wish i could redo my life and stop the anxiety before it even got this bad. 

I will continue to work through this. As we all do. I know that me wishing for a new start will never come to be and maybe that wouldn't even be for the best. I know i'm not and neither is anyone else here responsible for this condition. Right now it just felt like the thoughts were overwhelming me and i needed to tell someone. I know this can be beat, i just feel at a low point right now.

If you read this, thank you for listening to me.",4.229123127727327,5.5333918069544366,4.782179109171678,85.12829048236823,70.97841726618705,8.29858867004757,28.89994889334434,8.747414212480816,2.1240139010103394,3333,127,671,59,61,1063,334,834,0.18,0.737,0.083,-0.9982,3,2,1,0,0,0,83.0,1,6,2,12,52,40,4,8,40,0,65,31,17,9,15,124,139,53,0,12,22,0,6,5,3,8,13,5,0,0,50,35,1,3,22,4,1,13,18,24,1,6,36,18,86,16,100,84,23,121,1,9,2,0,20,41,2,11,69,458,136,7,0.0,0.1086563593841892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08129164519215203,0.0,0.0,0.09497953624242407,0.15179942123463194,0.18334270783049325,0.11445983927603202,0.0,0.0,0.031181539262718282,0.04808075577365239,0.17538668628827372,0.15540215105432545,0.0,0.032061408568890684,0.046981707010446766,0.0,0.04081879570278538,0.0,0.0,0.04308030188872095,0.0,0.1531409998437802,0.08385449303061318,0.0,0.03901743429243415,0.0,0.04811978178014606,0.04055315722051176,0.0500594828150196,0.10186445354576623,0.05775011294721995,0.0,0.0,0.05244349367011986,0.0,0.1413106540743013,0.0,0.0394982067962241,0.048075885398518786,0.0,0.0,0.07321960715494387,0.05073535341535481,0.0,0.02957132234738209,0.0,0.11847908736418243,0.09307944138349862,0.0,0.0,0.052551387313368135,0.046932378427221394,0.04012617522398621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03830420796913881,0.05157833243195496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908562091420696,0.08295313278787082,0.0,0.04381440376633995,0.041209623167471496,0.0,0.04322602624612183,0.0,0.09273840069317152,0.06551463112775807,0.0880519349876293,0.05022960246212933,0.04190871304986064,0.03900244693658414,0.0,0.10055065983163153,0.10627749300756976,0.0,0.07186873146879431,0.0,0.07817776646430744,0.03845923075329484,0.14669098749495413,0.0,0.10102426117923674,0.0,0.0810951228125879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047058296264860966,0.048739480549637504,0.0,0.0,0.030734227305293862,0.0,0.0,0.045542268333733565,0.04515586275072656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04075615766719562,0.0,0.0,0.12599775280647094,0.037376227291581465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03238725400391999,0.11200703578231648,0.0,0.04048894414148017,0.04057836695616752,0.038504881353973085,0.05129765799189315,0.10010769739431276,0.11694746846577685,0.0,0.04338711556010905,0.030607161797330886,0.0,0.04606539356394322,0.0,0.0,0.046191965224851916,0.0,0.09728534574007897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10112145566690836,0.03399933878889812,0.10609373231159666,0.04428500930400955,0.0,0.08605966690235256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13131532276270008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08669160875437007,0.0,0.08782879220973598,0.0,0.09887434683086764,0.043875025554154866,0.0,0.0460948216164423,0.0,0.048770195317907016,0.09173060188792563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09054839921926794,0.0,0.05194238871536914,0.1566324786363886,0.043616600974278885,0.0364640605163873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041742751217843516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11378995952028235,0.0,0.045886006910642534,0.0,0.03885100701703465,0.035299796816184656,0.0453496831379778,0.0,0.12981965326032024,0.0,0.03661817918113824,0.03833507128665842,0.2100973337522335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04007744909309316,0.08443036576731103,0.15731033607905007,0.0,0.15231312162805294,0.0,0.0,0.1092062244817444,0.16042314213584793,0.21080461878334072,0.043463180652056316,0.0,0.0,0.09339331243386917,0.04987478005051813,0.13437483986005702,0.0,0.0,0.03960217699521678,0.05050048304095034,0.15133375366368546,0.0270452240040112,0.03639589179007579,0.036780424559703435,0.0,0.04122725706856109,0.08501218145604296,0.0,0.0,0.15818569039743954,0.04420055210576652,0.0,0.06676290369070519,0.04656583808617232,0.09345602955950527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2066943159673074

healthanxiety,CarrotVision,2018/03/08,"Difference between real symptoms and psychosomatic made symptoms? I ask this because I have been going through something extremely odd in the last year. All my medical tests suggest I am perfectly healthy but the symptoms I have been facing with are unlike anything I have experienced before. I am not just talking about your typical anxiety attack and heart palpitations but a constant state of bizarre sensations. My symptoms are:

* severe insomnia
* Constant irritability
* Confusion and brain fog (what I perceive as working memory issues)
* muscle spasms/jerks
* vision, hearing, and skin hypersensitivity

I am not looking for a diagnosis just understanding the line between a medical condition and something that is just anxiety.

healthanxiety,KevinTheKoop,2018/03/08,"Was doing so well until right now I started a new medication a month or so ago, and it seems to have quashed the intensity of my health anxiety. I was overjoyed about this! Finally, I had hope of living a life that wasn’t steered by hypochondria! But I’m currently having a setback.
Long story short, I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. My girlfriend who I was really in love with broke up with me last week. That seems to be the major issue right now. But I’m getting some troubling symptoms.
All day, I’ve had this weird pain in my chest. I attributed this to emotional pain and didn’t think too much of it. Now, I’m also feeling it in my back and the pain is more to the left side of my chest. I am having some left arm pain as well, and it almost feels like some weakness too, but I can’t tell if this is my mind playing tricks on me. My heart is pounding, and I’m feeling a little lightheaded. I just feel off.
So, the 2 things I’m worried about are a heart attack, or something called Broken Heart Syndrome, which is a very real condition and has been proven to exist.
I’m not asking for a diagnosis of course, but has anyone else experienced something like this?",4.259794303797467,5.026480556962028,5.173372890295358,84.35474287974688,70.43459915611814,7.9503164556962025,27.47072784810127,8.07648339933343,1.61544746835443,920,30,189,12,16,301,135,237,0.138,0.7709999999999999,0.091,-0.9011,1,0,2,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,0,15,18,2,1,14,0,23,16,6,1,1,34,41,19,0,2,9,0,4,2,1,0,9,0,0,0,14,8,0,0,7,1,0,0,4,11,2,0,9,5,17,7,26,31,8,30,0,1,0,1,6,14,0,11,18,128,31,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474469494647404,0.0,0.107027167282362,0.0,0.0,0.08547372307695693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176465392367112,0.0,0.0,0.07473457739066829,0.10951352966833863,0.0,0.0,0.09992050653089833,0.12159402690765783,0.0,0.08218587815563487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10913876106973226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06893023036608559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08928643258785257,0.12022818238116245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21617157489504632,0.07635672431106677,0.0,0.11708431663077085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05584158144916259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11361086875803116,0.0,0.3799680598187499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10615822352348242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11155733453354667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08712332601020688,0.1205678706566256,0.0,0.2322558263641655,0.0,0.07549411734753786,0.10443456925464097,0.10712412652086507,0.09437901403820297,0.09458745704064883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09086749483592367,0.09646543334488808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1076726555075118,0.0,0.0,0.10792063708749856,0.0,0.08531241855154494,0.0,0.07857077601729205,0.0,0.0,0.1032275749197216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.454921139372558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12165543753142405,0.06847152734893748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18255377132590528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946032323992356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16456640645500475,0.0,0.0,0.07565183000745505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12243329402653427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11109161650281604,0.0,0.0,0.0934198263445782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07100783954308869,0.06848585121082798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0881890770698471,0.0,0.0,0.08573452035996743,0.0,0.19220001687542573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10854414654723273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,booxbunn,2018/03/09,"Stress and Increased Health Concerns? Hey all.

I have recently been experiencing a lot of stress with my job. I mean, a lot. I am trying my hardest to cool down, but I can definitely tell that my body is reacting to the stress. Stress hives, hyperventilating, and all the while an increased worry that these are symptoms of something like lyphoma.

Just looking for some support. Does anybody else find that their worry about having cancer or some other disease increase with stress about other things? Is this just what happens wit health anxiety?",5.134736842105267,8.317739578947371,4.510789473684214,79.64302631578948,74.26315789473685,6.326315789473685,29.5,7.554174236665415,2.1200315789473683,440,19,70,6,10,132,68,95,0.253,0.591,0.155,-0.9342,1,0,1,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,0,4,8,0,5,5,1,8,5,1,1,2,17,12,5,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,9,4,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,5,0,0,1,3,8,3,10,11,9,6,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,5,3,53,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10048619472839107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459057630246331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11494962196376834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10973022474970544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005606552776643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11615676872237785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27924838749855313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303495421909889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06417340475931119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110305094634416,0.0,0.0,0.22334660130984216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.143084073509764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1296971889493387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10112347555599296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7523333882311567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14906006661155513,0.0,0.1365281117561478,0.0,0.0,0.11481003601283613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08726640729416045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08918140422713397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2667947021889022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,truecrimelullabies,2018/03/09,"Cat scratched behind my ear Hi all, life long health anxiety sufferer, history of as many as 45 ER visits in one year. Had it somewhat under control but the last 6 months I went thru a very hard time w my mental illness (CPTSD) and is flatingup again. 

Saturday my indoor cat scratched me pretty badly behind my ear (my fault, he hates being picked up). I made her mistake of reading online and found articles of people whose hearts have stopped and died from infected cat scratched. It’s now Friday and I spent the week completely distracted from my life . Today I was supposed to work a double shift but I was so distracted and anxious at work I just left and am now at emergency.

healthanxiety,zarxt0h,2018/03/09,"Scared of Klinefelters I seem to have alot of the symptoms for it, low confidence, Insecure and anxious and emotional, I didn't fit in and I admittedly have some feminine behaviors and I can't grow that much hair. (im 17 though, I have hair on my lower feet and the hair on my arms are coming in I guess), I got wide hips but I got big shoulders and I'm tall. I can only grow facial hair on mustache and chin though (it takes a month or two to become somewhat fullish looking) but my dad didn't grow facial hair until he was 22. 

As a kid I was described as somewhat masculine, never picked up girl toys and etc but I guess that doesn't really matter. 

The doctors diagnosed me as autistic when I was 7 and people sometimes confuse Klinefelter behavior for autism but I have a high verbal IQ and I can type fast. My IQ is 100 but Idk. 

I'm going to get my testosterone tested soon this Monday (i'm hoping, i'm going to ask the doctor about it.) But I'm really terrified and anxious, because this would mean everything I thought in my life up until now would be a lie and I also wont be able to have any kids which is the number one thing I want in life is to have kids. 

The symptoms of Klinefelters seems to vary so I'm just worried on having it, the only thing I really care is about the most is if I'm able to have kids with my girlfriend. 

I'm just making this post here to vent, sorry if its a bit of a nuisance, I'll delete it soon. 


EDIT: Yeah I also have a history of hypochondria, I'm just really worried.

healthanxiety,ythattho,2018/03/09,"Really worried about my kidneys. Any advice? I'm a 20 year old male, 5'7"", 130lbs. I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ug/L and B12 high at 658 pmol/L and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmol/L. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umol/L and magnesium at 0.99 mmol/L. My urine came back negative for protein, blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ug/L.  I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test I've done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which I'm seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what I've read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast? Thanks 

Also my grandma had polycystic kidney disease but from my understanding it was not the heredarity type.",2.526889952153109,4.550581880382778,3.8311004784689016,87.18770334928232,77.08612440191388,6.696650717703347,24.397129186602868,7.669130373188453,1.2312334928229665,819,28,165,12,19,268,133,209,0.057,0.918,0.026,-0.7233,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,0,0,2,8,2,0,0,14,0,16,11,9,3,1,32,27,16,0,3,9,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,0,2,9,10,1,0,5,2,0,1,4,1,0,0,13,4,14,1,20,9,1,25,0,0,2,0,2,14,0,3,10,96,23,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13708628575870144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33656104665487313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09539958996963044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1078716131561117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11937342803392847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16045031486582856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871234694925302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12821926484853938,0.0,0.0,0.307633681528434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11219988164592333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12566909536287865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.44466097902483703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11780527773336333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374509257739863,0.0,0.0,0.2944140405616166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1492746633126094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12249270849088607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14032440371278568,0.0,0.08987108583795418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11179012990051043,0.12771150637671908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12915690606745922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378307152328961,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14604313172536484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11252932038861592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20426039855224146,0.14246768969883666,0.0,0.09965546211038764,0.0,0.0,0.18067973604690368
healthanxiety,sinsaysgo,2018/03/10,"This morning I found what may be a bald spot, which naturally confirmed all of my fears that I have lupus and I’m dying. Just an average Saturday! I am so happy I found this sub, if for anything else to know that I’m not the only one out here. 

I always do this...I work to ignore little things day after day that *could* be symptoms of something bigger, until suddenly I find that one thing that affirms that I’ve been negligent and now I’ll pay the price. 

I’ve been in the obsession spiral since 11am today. I recently gave myself an undercut and I checked the back of my head in the mirror before leaving the house to get lunch and noticed a huge spot of hair missing at my neckline. 

By the time I got to the restaurant I was on a website confirming that I do in fact have lupus and sobbing while playing the conversation in my head of having to tell my mother.

For a moment I break through the cloud and say look at yourself! You noticed what MIGHT be a bald spot and now you definitely have lupus?? Get out of the spiral. You’re fine. 

Then I fall right back in. How dare I enjoy this hot dog right now like nothing is wrong!? I have lupus for god’s sake. 

It’s so bewildering how it takes this hold. 

So now I’ll work to distract myself until I can see a doctor, or the 800th time I check my hairline I can somehow convince myself that the spot has always been there and my hairline is just uneven. 

Thanks for existing and listening &lt;3

healthanxiety,headachewtfomgbbq,2018/03/10,"I feel like an idiot for posting here but here goes: Brain tumor/cancer worries I feel like a dummy, but I've definitely suffered from health anxiety in the past(pregnancy scares with my ex, lymphoma scares, diabetes scares, etc) so I'm hoping this is just another case of me being a hypochondriac.

For the past 2 weeks or so I've had this strange feeling in my head. I can't really call it a headache, its more of a ""pressure"" that can be felt throughout my head and sometimes more on the top. I wouldn't say its painful, just a really annoying feeling. I also feel somewhat of a ""pressure"" type feeling in my ears from time to time, with associated tinnitus. I've had minor hearing loss/tinnitus before this headache started, but obviously Dr. Google has indicated to me that this could be a tumor. I saw my doctor about it last week and he said that its more likely a tension headache, but that if the symptoms continued and I was still worried he'd order a head CT for me ( have a physical exam scheduled in a few days). I have no other symptoms or problems, and I'm a pretty damn healthy/active 23 year old.

I guess i dont know what I'm asking for here, maybe just words of support from other people who have experienced something similar? The anxiety over this is killing me, and there is no real reason for me to be so stressed. Am I being stupid or are my concerns legitimate? Unfortunately I'm having trouble trusting my PCP...the lymphoma scare I mentioned earlier was the result of me feeling a lump in my neck which he diagnosed as a cyst (turns out it was actually an enlarged lymph node after an ultrasound was done)",7.232847209171204,6.881827255591055,7.7260514940800595,72.46399173087768,63.98402555910543,10.55959406126668,37.58109377936478,10.056822442137396,3.8010189438075535,1293,60,233,25,17,428,176,313,0.224,0.6709999999999999,0.105,-0.9926,0,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,1,13,23,5,8,23,0,28,17,6,2,1,39,50,18,1,5,11,1,8,3,0,1,11,4,0,0,20,8,0,0,10,0,0,0,5,17,0,0,10,14,27,6,29,32,6,25,0,1,1,0,11,9,1,7,17,159,47,3,0.0,0.0,0.09723755709140264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07968476838223669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10448476333753492,0.1524538132940643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09315310171269392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08478917027167017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11123495690609124,0.10174702334582696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07955712428135196,0.0,0.0,0.06426173148337486,0.0,0.0,0.10113592484203617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10198921322952724,0.0,0.1019697647322128,0.11678128957698068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11112869902854937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3526787789089911,0.14237048936491184,0.09567326304005376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10976840786731287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30678853956343066,0.105916244628041,0.11230532181335526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09896835131098836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11024062743920904,0.0,0.05476139121032495,0.08122264719372042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14604215475665108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010515989469002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10455895682435404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10602757291397986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19024174642129005,0.06908016769562181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09543080615721668,0.10137313150079123,0.0,0.09534524962617764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11341597175313214,0.12766819090507128,0.1024499817313134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09478366462955118,0.07924040860164835,0.3990415921635422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07671033570198697,0.09854984252764933,0.0,0.07052809138088878,0.0,0.07957532538806923,0.0,0.11414114567110545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11307411742589465,0.0,0.20713523201194625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11620570274752227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10838337514123764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15985580483244316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20238536161754225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641670644658339
healthanxiety,pocketcampfriend,2018/03/10,"Do any of you ever feel like you break through the anxiety for a minute And then it comes right back? Sometimes I’ll just be talking with my bf and realize how illogical I sound, which is incredibly liberating to be wrong about my health concerns (since we all assume the worst). I will just cry a lot because it’s like the person I was before my health anxiety was able to break through for a second and hold a mirror to my thoughts. I try so hard to hold onto that feeling. But anxiety is too powerful sometimes and I can’t help googling, asking my bf to look at something on my body, or simply thinking about death. 

I’m so much better than last year and the year before but my anxiety is still there. I just want to be normal. I want to be like my bf or anyone else without health anxiety",4.311423670668955,5.264899113207548,5.186895368782164,83.6202401372213,70.44654088050314,8.297541452258432,28.919954259576894,8.575989854853784,2.02305786163522,625,23,127,10,11,204,96,159,0.102,0.7929999999999999,0.105,0.1546,1,0,1,0,0,0,12.0,1,2,0,2,13,6,0,0,8,0,12,4,1,1,2,31,22,13,1,3,8,0,3,3,3,1,3,1,0,1,4,8,0,2,6,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,3,5,18,4,20,14,4,14,0,0,1,0,10,4,0,4,10,88,22,0,0.12784633247495875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693989012051638,0.0,0.4890104720627164,0.0,0.0,0.08939312824178207,0.13099367580118804,0.0,0.0,0.11951906287779095,0.0,0.0,0.09830593819009817,0.0,0.07793393764997833,0.0,0.2175756252177383,0.0,0.0,0.11306969175209222,0.0,0.14200845448710736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110128295139263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14043319302245433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067992058997547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11564432706426606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1292858941036428,0.09133344546501562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11452520231870432,0.0,0.0,0.4076840191705593,0.0,0.0,0.08569270177293631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421182438978352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18737778083872111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1073587203573512,0.0,0.0,0.10869038004209633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09398176455664464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526226147887826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11163048625420977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10918006939312193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1057558073508324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09842235274590827,0.25288658367998185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10209824626034214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10275803931036888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08191876764130325,0.0,0.10149570741120216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679926769682939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15081415855597552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232393022988468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397798949078669,0.0,0.16465769301442792
healthanxiety,DSthwaway,2018/03/10,"So tired of always fearing the worst I’ve been experiencing some digestion issues this week, and I know deep down that it’s probably because I’ve been home from college and eating much more/much greasier food than usual, but I can’t escape the thoughts that it’s something much worse. Even though I’ve looked up symptoms and have nothing in common with any of them, except for the ones I know I’m probably just imagining, it still makes me so scared. Nothing to do but wait it out and see what happens when I’m back in school I guess, hopefully it just all goes away. 

I hate feeling this way, and I know my family/SO hate it too, is there anything that you all do to help with these feelings?

healthanxiety,tw1706,2018/03/12,Anyone else have health anxiety only about their genitals? I recently realised that about 95% of my health anxiety is about my genitals.

healthanxiety,EduHomework,2018/03/12,"Can't gain weight? Okay so I'm gonna preface this by saying that I used to weigh almost 200 pounds. In the past year I've lost 50ish pounds, and I'm at a healthy weight for my height. I did restrictive diets to lose weight, but at this point I'm working out so if I gain weight I don't really care because I know I won't gain weight in my stomach. 

There's just one problem. In September, I had my gallbladder removed. I'm not supposed to be eating oily food, but I'm a teen so of course I'm going to. The first month after my surgery, I ate like a pig and I didn't exercise. I lost 10 pounds. I have bulimia, but I'm in recovery and I don't purge often at all (like only 1-2 times a month when I relapse). At this point, I literally can't stop eating. I'll be full as hell but I still can't stop. I've recorded it, and I've been eating about 3500-4000 calories a day for the past few weeks (according to my Fitbit, I only burn about 2200). I haven't gained a pound. All I've done is lost (1-2 pounds a week). I should also mention that I have super low blood pressure (the doctors don't know why; I eat salty stuff all the time).

healthanxiety,paranoid23,2018/03/13,"Healthy Anxiety worst nightmare! -&gt; HPV Hi All,

A year ago I found out that I had a wart in my throat ""possibly linked to HPV"". It was removed and biopsy confirmed as benign. HPV, specifically HPV-16 found to be a major risk factor for oral/throat cancers possibly contracted by kissing, oral sex, towels and other methods.

It triggered major health anxiety within me and my life practically ended. I quit my job, I stopped any type of intimate relationships and basically waiting for life to have a miserable cancer ending.

I did about 10 times oral sex in my life in total (about 5 different women) and now I'm certain I contracted HPV in my throat according to the statistics that everyone got that virus.

I don't even know if I should vaccinate (I'm 36) because the manufacturer itself says it could increase the risk of cancer if you already got infected with HPV-16/HPV-18.

Yes I know in 90% the immune system clears it, in the rest of the cases, you are as good as dead.

There is no cure, there is no test and I'm positive I'm headed for cancer. 

I tried doctors, GPs, ENTs, CBT therapists, alternative therapists, nothing works for me.

My life is practically over.

I considered to start taking AHCC pills which women (and some preliminary trial) claim can help clear HPV faster just in case I did contract it (I can never know).

healthanxiety,Thugnificent646,2018/03/13,"Does weed trigger intense panic attacks for anyone else? There was a time where I'd smoke weed and it would make me socially inept but also incredibly relaxed and I could just sit and play a game for hours. I haven't smoked since 2015 (though I've gotten a slight second hand high from sitting in a car with my friends)

I recently figured I might as well try some as I've had trouble falling asleep and I don't want to use heavier drugs to get to bed. Well I smoked a small amount but immediately it made my heart beat so hard it almost felt painful. I had a minor panic attack but after a few minutes I went to bed.

This morning a friend used a knife of mine to cut dabs and some dab residue was left on the knife, I figured I might as well gum it and see if it does anything and then go to bed. I awoke an hour after passing out to find my heart rate was incredibly high and it was also beating weakly. I felt tired, dizzy and panicked out of my mind. I sent an embarrassing string of texts to my two closest friends and heavily debated going to the ER. I had drank a fair bit the night before and I take 5-HTP for anxiety and I was worried I'd given myself serotonin syndrome or that my heart was somehow damaged.

After a while I went to bed and woke up 6 hours later, I've phoned in to work and am spending the night recouping but I still feel off. Over the past 3 weeks I've been feeling like I'm going to die somehow. Whether it's by alcohol, serotonin syndrome, a really bad anxiety attack or something else.

It's all coming back to me as my 1 year anniversary of getting HA rolls around (I started having panic attacks at this point last year). This was my worst episode yet and I felt absolutely insane. I can't stand not knowing whether I'm okay or not. For the whole day I once again have been 
 super conscious of my heart.

Hopefully I can fight this off once again, I guess it's going to be an ongoing battle.",4.072531022070663,4.953665452685424,4.936038647342997,85.46673107890501,70.94373401534527,7.531723027375202,28.80373212086767,7.662118739084242,1.6358944965425777,1516,56,312,17,27,493,216,391,0.223,0.659,0.119,-0.9933,0,0,6,0,1,0,29.0,0,0,0,4,18,30,7,4,21,2,24,12,6,5,1,62,56,35,1,5,13,0,7,1,3,3,5,0,4,0,14,20,2,0,10,3,1,11,5,17,4,2,23,8,37,13,44,28,8,57,0,1,1,0,8,18,0,13,26,194,51,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260607581850751,0.07740092762815573,0.0,0.0,0.12362740455485903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11826268454234287,0.0,0.0,0.054047264473281134,0.07919903889262216,0.06360814441233438,0.06880996017654394,0.0,0.35174211242519365,0.0,0.05943596722875289,0.06453905559447687,0.0,0.0,0.06577332950736982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08438737497404494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06658378793149003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06171468518031365,0.0,0.0,0.0498496214319291,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08022119897723444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352847614272513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08963899271708417,0.0,0.12914202781198875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07816651065599739,0.055220384154723835,0.22264927353869604,0.0,0.0706472796749939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17915643848882054,0.0,0.08076809494519233,0.0,0.17571673063782786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08515042235963985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06924216682331026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36638523402756695,0.0,0.16333525014270173,0.0,0.07677251659288528,0.22836340936459465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04247994191732452,0.06300667786011331,0.0,0.0,0.08398249184809008,0.0,0.0,0.03776299392952452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07313948494718801,0.051595779545442616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16399799775766888,0.07804707564348039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1450743989478707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16463575161957947,0.0,0.0,0.08224855211807587,0.2720711287304677,0.0,0.0,0.07378792028116943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730698449491698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04951789220901665,0.0,0.07632062187349717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06159502303584784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0639401730524098,0.0,0.0,0.0787936895787568,0.0,0.059506351702483265,0.0,0.0,0.05471061196916828,0.0,0.0617288042875732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05811708428108744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0759430737523354,0.0,0.045072005970566834,0.08884055233483643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05247901118986665,0.0,0.07550710581815823,0.0,0.0,0.13351810973489164,0.0,0.0,0.045591271242594066,0.0,0.062002308143963014,0.0,0.208495562024794,0.1433086086886261,0.0,0.08629838974231367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05627251692673508,0.07849799116141645,0.0,0.054908966380129064,0.0,0.0,0.09955237116035524
healthanxiety,captaincupkirk,2018/03/13,"Swollen lymph nodes (for years) driving me up the wall. Ugh Hello! I just found this sub and it's so nice to know it isn't just me. 

This month has been full of health issues and to try to make it a long story short, an eating disorder gave me a ton of symptoms that I didn't even consider were from not eating such as really bad nerve pain, dizziness, lethargy, LOTS of weight loss, etc. I was POSITIVE the nerve pain, positioned right over my left chest, was a heart attack and went to the ER at 4am. They did an EKG, a blood test, urine test, a full physical and xray. Everything was a-okay aside from malnutrition and general ED signs.

I started eating regularly and every symptom went away completely. I feel healthier than I have in a long time (go figure. eating helps) and I felt reassured and content for about 3 weeks. This all started on the 23rd of last month.But now, I have a swollen rock hard lymph node under my chin I've never had before that is sore and a few big but squishy ones on the sides of my neck along with the muscles on the sides of my jaw being sore (I grind my teeth, possible cause?) 

Something else that is important to note is I had shingles at around age 15 with very swollen and painful lymph nodes and a lot of them never went down. I'm 22 now and can't remember a time when they weren't swollen and occasionally painful, but for some reason NOW I'm convinced I have lymph node cancer and can't stop freaking out about it because a new one popped up. I also have yet to gain any weight back but maybe it just hasn't been long enough yet. Panic attacks are becoming a regular occurrence. Has anyone experienced lymph nodes swollen for 7 years? I would have way more symptoms than just pain and swelling if it was cancer, right? I just need some reassurance or tips, I think.

healthanxiety,anxious_idiot,2018/03/14,"Rabies Anxiety I’ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently I’ve been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbor’s cat that had jumped over the fence. I didn’t want them to get in a fight so I shoo’d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1/2 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that I’m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesn’t help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesn’t help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that I’ve been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive. 
I’m not sure exactly what to do about this or what this post is supposed to do. I’m on lexapro for general anxiety and OCD tendencies. I guess I just want to be told I’m a healthy idiot.

healthanxiety,queenlamprey,2018/03/14,"Didn't realize I wasn't alone 
it's honestly so refreshing that I am 1. Not crazy and 2. not alone. 

I feel alone. People always judge when I try to tell them how terrified of diseases (especially STD's) and almost make fun of me. My boyfriend is really supportive but it's rough because he has no idea how to tell it and tbh neither do I. I really wanna go on medication because it's to the point where it takes a daily toll on my life. I don't know anyone who has health anxiety like I do and it's just really scary.

healthanxiety,warholglasses,2018/03/15,"Flomax Capsule I have an issue swallowing pills but I spent half an hour today trying to get a flomax pill to go down by chasing it with water. Eventually the pill cracked open from sitting in water for too long and I went ahead and swallowed about less than 1/3 of the little beads inside the capsule. 
I hear it’s dangerous to consume a pill that is crushed or broken down because it gives you large dosage at once. The good part is that I didn’t swallow even half of what was inside the flomax pill. However, I’m second guessing myself and wondering if I should get checked at the ER or just wait it out.
Any ideas? Is pill crushing as serious as it’s made out to be?

healthanxiety,waterripples,2018/03/15,"Weird muscle sensation anxiety Hello. I'm 17 years old, not active at all, and last week I went to the doctor for a tingling feeling in my arms and leg. My doctor said that the tingling is likely due to a lack of exercise, since once I come home from school, I either sit at my desk or lay down using my phone for hours. 

Of course, I'm going to take my doctor's advice and exercise/improve my diet, but that'll take time to see results. Could this really be it? I've never heard of your muscles falling asleep/tingling from a lack of exercise before.

healthanxiety,TheColorOfSnails,2018/03/15,"Do you think my doctor would object to me asking for an EKG for the sole purpose of soothing my anxiety? I've been having chest pain these past few days after a really bad heart palpitation that freaked me out. I recently saw my doctor three times in a row and worry about looking like I'm crazy for going in for something that is almost definitely anxiety. 

I just feel that an EKG would be quick and simple,  and I don't want to beat around the bush - I'd rather just tell her it's because I'm anxious. 

I guess the reason WHY I'm anxious is reason enough for a test?",5.127266009852222,5.2235235000000015,6.029753694581281,81.34775862068967,68.3103448275862,8.697536945812809,27.778325123152708,8.418075326091056,1.7848807881773403,450,13,91,6,7,149,79,116,0.197,0.743,0.06,-0.9241,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.0,0,1,0,1,6,4,0,0,8,0,9,5,2,2,0,17,20,3,0,4,3,0,1,1,0,2,3,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,3,0,1,2,3,11,1,14,15,2,11,0,0,2,0,4,4,0,2,7,57,16,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1693210040945188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25870951559937977,0.3820511890346206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15052754412413605,0.15807799949343151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14118458307202045,0.1030767867461554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10905021700948568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.346145227605142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1747170218757649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549789050605558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09609876192549717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1862736720969467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20037458726911345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0826097082515633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14199451814325076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17992558819007015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16141724827996887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10832453158384232,0.34770904806098873,0.16695774488415588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13017512230177544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1477936789382479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10834719247209523,0.0,0.0,0.09859878352044972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09973471974169833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15257904143256806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17172092234743147,0.0,0.2402359146376333,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tphillips1990,2018/03/15,"I'm convinced I may have blood clots in my leg. At the start of the week, the box spring of my bed caved in while I was sleeping. I didn't notice this as I'm a deep sleeper. When I woke up, I realized this and noticed my lower back was in great pain and my right leg felt like it was on the verge of cramping. It wasn't impossible to walk, just difficult, and I assumed it was mostly because of my back. 

A day later, my leg is in great pain and I'm only able to be comfortable in very specific situations. This time, I can only walk a little due to the pain increasing. I still figured it was just some sort of leg cramp waiting to happen, but I kept noticing a pulsating sensation in my thigh and shin. I replaced my box spring and was able to rest, somewhat, even though the pain is very noticeable. 

The morning of the third day, I was woken up by the pain in my leg. I can walk but at this point, it's unbearable. It's as if I'm experiencing a perpetual leg cramp. I look into my symptoms a bit and can no longer shake the fear that I may have developed blood clots after my box spring caved in so I arrange for someone to take me to the hospital (I couldn't drive). This was sheer agony as it has become impossible for me to sit upright. Despite the fact that they recognized I was in great pain, the doctor didn't perform an ultrasound. She told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot and that I just had a muscle spasm. I was prescribed baclofen, meloxicam, and lisinopril *(slightly unrelated, it seems I had high blood pressure on three consecutive visits and apparently this was a cause for concern)*. 

I went home, took the pills, and tried to sleep, thinking all I could do was rest. I wake up a few hours later to find the pain is even worse and my right foot is tingly. I had to get a second opinion. I arrange for a second trip to a different hospital and again, they recognized how much pain I was in and rushed me through. The only problem was...this doctor seemed almost apathetic. I explained the situation and he wanted to know exactly why I thought I have blood clots, and I told him about the numerous articles I read. This prompted a quiet dismissive response (very frustrating because I'm not the type to frantically rush to the hospital out of paranoia alone), and just like the other doctor, he told me I had no symptoms of a blood clot. 

Well...it's the fourth day, I've done nothing but try to rest and now I'm forced to take pain pills, yet I can still feel the pain regardless. What am I supposed to do if I have blood clots? Am I supposed to wait until my leg is the size of a log before it becomes an issue? I mean, shouldn't they have at least checked to be safe?",4.590087140216528,5.11973602033272,5.488193292843942,83.24581515711648,69.57301293900184,8.696720359123317,29.874887773963557,8.759644201051973,2.1480664483760226,2101,78,438,34,35,690,237,541,0.165,0.792,0.043,-0.9966,3,1,0,0,0,0,67.0,0,0,3,1,18,25,1,4,42,0,48,40,19,2,3,66,80,32,0,8,10,0,2,2,0,3,21,1,2,0,21,20,0,4,13,1,1,12,9,17,0,4,32,5,61,8,62,41,12,64,0,0,1,0,12,27,0,13,26,293,82,5,0.12455166873203155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06236025239192846,0.06449898299422822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09577254513924316,0.0,0.07592554121225317,0.13755753258689607,0.05299214821354447,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06798908182799954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06397443656198537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04972218631050103,0.0,0.0,0.1204882836445376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06506499217680584,0.0,0.19122586597999872,0.0,0.0637298002643049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08226520252274258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0700776273743216,0.031488533034914154,0.0,0.059794567146341376,0.0,0.056918984388672635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03253655311596843,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20597798172462287,0.0,0.0,0.05507031466076637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06579783818826272,0.06246773953027965,0.0,0.06132915233898351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06499979130840021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034225169913792916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084965399467328,0.062416746483459726,0.0,0.0,0.05229601629777973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06783664041102834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04577990380836211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059755342662733024,0.28360580074863984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14209073487578391,0.6626587853823254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058870792804448985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059589562953135326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06229268709123183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10636644455839896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11338716138011218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14000129416515456,0.12464161845762392,0.0,0.05276611236560413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04407915609622636,0.0,0.09946712353934982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19418531069217454,0.09364735424006046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039903840073763366,0.061185691072929024,0.049440056208414636,0.03631353982781752,0.0,0.0,0.17852168552693815,0.06919074340575722,0.08456240728278983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15415225621485384,0.03673190062030758,0.0,0.049953917907996304,0.0,0.055993454122090384,0.057730322372182764,0.05619425412893276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06346439559234449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,feraferoxdei,2018/03/15,"Retinal detachment flashes How exactly do they look like? 

A month ago I discovered I have floaters and I am only 20 years old. Read around for a while and discovered that the appearance of floaters is a usual sign of retinal detachment. However, it will also be accompanied with partial vision loss and light flashes.

What do those flashes look like?
Are they like shooting stars?
Like a camera flash?
Or like half or all vision suddenly gets brighter like its 12pm in the middle of a desert?

The thing is I sometimes feel like there's something flying by so fast like a fly or something. It happens once or twice a day when it's night and usually on the sides.

Should I be worried?",3.8438372093023254,6.288121852713179,4.152887596899227,84.43537790697677,74.65891472868215,7.40077519379845,30.12984496124031,8.344100000000001,2.426431007751938,545,25,99,10,12,170,85,129,0.034,0.759,0.207,0.9641,1,0,2,1,0,0,12.0,0,0,2,1,6,9,0,0,11,0,11,0,0,1,2,17,17,13,0,1,4,0,1,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,8,6,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,4,7,8,9,13,1,18,0,1,2,0,2,5,0,5,20,63,15,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14385417400251474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12977773414228422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14446636245881944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10465917230213563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08205520996958718,0.11593507701419893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08478622026174343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14350640684245325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6342665921684474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725538590908173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12953281985680234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15229169329647996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17028881148094654,0.17282620209437338,0.0,0.12342360812254735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16232701323917853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2498669132083985,0.16050213262800042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10781367876000826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.357463808607247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648063625428474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10450499389032747

healthanxiety,BruhPaul,2018/03/15,"Eye Check Up So yesterday my optician spotted black dots in my eye and said it could be cancer related or blindness incoming.

She recommended me to check it with a specialist, I'm just too afraid to face it you know? Like I'm thinking if I should just overdose or kill myself right now even before facing the results or the truth about my condition.

Anyone knows how to cope with this? Anxiety is killing me.

healthanxiety,JVance95,2018/03/15,"Questions about lymph nodes I see that this topic is posted pretty often, so I’m sorry. But I have a few questions I can’t seem to find answers for.

1. Are they supposed to hurt? Mine doesn’t. The area around it hurts occasionally, but not often. Mostly at night time when I’m going tonight bed. I’ve also been experiencing stomach pains. Don’t know if they’re related though.

2. It’s only one on the left side of my groin. I had a spider bite (I’m assuming, could have been some other kind of bug. Was definitely a bite) on my business. That healed up a few days ago, the node hasn’t even slightly changed.

healthanxiety,Merlebaderle,2018/03/16,Recurring chest pain for around a month So I started having pain on the left side of my chest on the inner part of my pec towards the top. It happens mainly when I exhale. Kind of a sharp pain. It sometimes happens on the tail end of taking a deep breath. Movement doesn't increase it. The pain hasn't increased. It's possible that the frequency at which it happens has. I had an appoint two weeks ago and had an ekg and blood tests which neither of which showed abnormalities. Im a 29 y/o male who has exercised on and off for most of my life. Only problem I have is decently high cholesterol. I called the doctor today and they made a referral to a cardiologist on Apr 21. I want to think that's to much I hope. My first worry goes to endocarditis.☹️. Other than that I don't know what to think of it. It's hard not to worry about it. I want to assume its inflammation but I've never experienced something this consistent for so long.,2.2415672514619907,4.358556010526321,3.9287719298245634,85.69584795321641,78.36842105263158,6.7485380116959055,24.239766081871338,7.793537801064563,1.2880467836257306,742,26,151,12,18,248,116,190,0.106,0.862,0.032,-0.8686,1,0,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,1,2,5,7,0,0,15,0,10,11,4,1,1,18,22,8,0,4,2,0,2,0,0,0,7,0,0,1,19,5,0,0,4,2,0,3,6,5,0,2,3,3,14,2,28,19,7,29,0,0,0,0,4,15,0,3,11,103,33,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1172584661100284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11775747338496015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13507293177117305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1353944477876714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11716104445543428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11251751865794812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35092498205189904,0.0,0.1184971273910489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13976135374992926,0.0,0.1313841420077562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14288537649512592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377495313771065,0.07269776958000912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14372288580360595,0.0,0.09343345720310664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11706386444223232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1251667771636657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10558483876213252,0.0,0.0972412089359431,0.0,0.10202268868131104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1006050958935828,0.5630220777425997,0.0,0.0,0.1432466272419257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1491261138021507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265743406928902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018358041315931,0.13082855613920988,0.0,0.09362864643875167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09945829045508647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16951969432712138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1253862160982615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12921858959000088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1560446451694464,0.0,0.10610724279357568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686740431544197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,boston508,2018/03/16,"Glad to see I’m not alone. I am so tired of feeling like this.... Reassurance never lasts very long, huh?  My anxiety/hypochondria has flares up after like 3 years of being “okay”.  
I had a whole physical a couple weeks ago.  I know I got to work on weight and diet.  However, bp was great, urine no sugar or blood.  Bloodwork will take a couple days to get back.  I addressed all my heart anxiety fears.  Got an EKG too and the doctor said I had “pretty” pqrts (or whatever it’s called).
I do have Hashimotos, but not on medicine as of right now.

I have suffered from anxiety/depression past 18 years (I’m 35 now).  It was SOOOO bad.  Frequent trips to doctors, ER, urgent cares.  Every single possible test done.  I have always been “okay”.  Then I was okay for a long while.  Or at least all my symptoms became manageable.

I was wondering if there was anyone to talk to about this.  Why do I IMMEDIATELY think I’m dying?  Why do I feel like I’ve failed when I’ve been alright for many years.  Why do I physically feel something and think I’m for sure dying?

Last night I had a headache and convinced myself it was a stroke.  I spent an hour staring in the mirror and doing self administered stroke tests.  Today I feel like little pings of pain (but not really even pain, but not a shock feeling either, just feel something), mostly in my right arm/hand.  I am trying to tell myself it’s not a heart attack.  

I just want to know I’ll be okay.  I wish every day I could brush things off or rationalize it better.  I sometimes can and then there are times like this where I’m freaking out on the inside.  The funny thing is, in my day to day life I function.  I’m a mom, I have a job.  I also happen to have a husband who has been battling cancer for the last 2 years.  I do what I have to do.  But inside my head, I feel like a prisoner because it is so consuming.  

Lastly, I have started therapy again and I am hopeful that will help again.

Thank you for reading this and listening to me 🙂(and I am fully aware how crazy some of what I’ve said sounds.  The rational/sane part of me is over feeling and thinking this way)",1.7973841174430731,3.8965423033175375,3.3279378106577298,89.53532019419724,79.75829383886256,6.107594497745925,21.667090509767657,7.217587316427113,0.6650124147497403,1620,48,338,21,41,533,225,422,0.11,0.6990000000000001,0.192,0.9798,2,1,2,0,0,0,64.0,0,1,0,3,18,30,2,1,20,6,43,18,5,1,4,52,79,27,2,5,17,2,11,6,0,2,10,4,1,1,17,10,3,0,14,1,1,1,7,10,1,0,18,19,42,20,38,56,9,51,0,2,2,0,13,15,0,9,40,214,59,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06911268604582757,0.0,0.0,0.0807498833808161,0.0,0.0623498612932689,0.06487445639332838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059644235062078575,0.0,0.0,0.054516059045700505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08869826232977504,0.0,0.05995150227229075,0.0650988537501582,0.04752771527469998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06895512119414933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961261507575003,0.0,0.07949214418986379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0622499853427373,0.17253711835853158,0.0,0.20112802613589015,0.0,0.06715251773325273,0.0,0.161834041473896,0.0,0.0,0.15960423622661116,0.0,0.07978690051106442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051496203518473546,0.0,0.13138044516761274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08773410021964435,0.3153780419303455,0.22279741647930493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04073433018259046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247140236924364,0.08595845097675191,0.0,0.0,0.06894560627412792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0800162242483157,0.0,0.0,0.18478159113486628,0.052259368046765536,0.0,0.0,0.07743842520899133,0.07678139513704252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07736981936362508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08569680794733478,0.2542127379781404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507011483328887,0.22854325304350506,0.0781430150611888,0.0,0.13799597383297818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07904589435059949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131353879509096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06013264787010225,0.0,0.0,0.07316637184266259,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1659239174226496,0.0,0.0,0.08443022925445039,0.07442794113837722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878956260162177,0.0,0.0793200609885644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798769817106678,0.0,0.04994739996174872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13316609960332804,0.14832818021562158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062129285274069475,0.0,0.08133616695549123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1200449944922016,0.07711096031047979,0.0,0.055185160277854056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07348259714535181,0.0810371495524915,0.058621179612115375,0.06266659919667229,0.06814624430693621,0.07178116949432696,0.08916160115836534,0.0,0.10359508833516223,0.14987354603830605,0.0,0.0,0.04546295104379068,0.08961113654758412,0.07390321974314404,0.0,0.0,0.05293420306408088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0643306097469942,0.0459867203132643,0.061886257479465114,0.06254010308730806,0.09494231362571656,0.0,0.0,0.2110581868239376,0.0870469237729255,0.0896577414283173,0.0,0.08455145111058318,0.05676061286958658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20083173486052808

healthanxiety,TheAnkleOfMatip,2018/03/16,"Long time HA resurfacing (lymph nodes) help appreciated Hi. I am a 19 yo male and I have suffered from health anxiety for almost 7 years now. It has been better recently since i went to therapy and started to excercise more. 
About two months ago my parents got divorced, and recenty things haven't been too good within the family. I noticed slight pain in my stomach about three weeks ago and haven't got rid of this creeping feeling of anxiety since. 
So, today at work I go normally to the restroom and strech my groin since ot was feeling a bit stiff. While feeling the groin with my hand I notice a bump and freak out completely. It's about 2cm long and quite narrow. 
My first thought is obviously lymphoma. I mean how could it not be... I haven't been sick since the first week of January so it can't have swollen on it's own right?? Then I connect the weird feelings in my stomach during the last three weeks to the bump and the anxiety is back all guns blazing.
How do I move on from here?

Tl;dr/summary
185cm tall and 65kg, skinny. Noticed a new bump in my left groin, it does not hurt but is quite hard and about 2cm long and narrow. I have previously noticed two other lymph nodes one in each groin and they feel similar but slightly larger. The only reason why I think its a swollen lymph node is because I haven't noticed it earlier (I dont check my groins very often).

Edit. I think its important to note that I started a new job in a warehouse two weeks ago. I lift boxes, stand and walk the whole day so my muscles are very tense all the time. Could this have something to do with the bump",3.5745000000000005,5.113101200000003,4.2995000000000045,87.03550000000004,72.9375,7.495000000000001,27.175,8.109356740369918,1.6318475000000006,1264,46,259,19,25,404,174,320,0.063,0.87,0.068,-0.1572,2,0,1,1,1,0,34.0,0,0,1,6,14,8,0,0,19,1,26,13,4,3,3,42,41,22,0,3,4,1,7,0,0,0,9,0,0,1,14,17,1,1,10,0,1,4,8,5,0,8,8,7,27,3,28,30,7,48,0,2,0,0,6,15,0,2,28,157,41,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22032579789571227,0.0,0.08296276655674939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19014112215546325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06370688860426421,0.0,0.050504870568021616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327449785423626,0.09045124270270173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08686712953862137,0.0,0.0,0.13229869916636913,0.0,0.0,0.05343169174493274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07250299463395471,0.0,0.0971001204327534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07810403885931139,0.0,0.20945840621134207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14094511550973307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0470858249078606,0.06949103385426418,0.13252616054019742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07421773741063191,0.0,0.0,0.08806616322204901,0.0,0.0,0.05553291598204558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08869312947754371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08221629611788157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06753418165654408,0.0,0.0,0.09001726567825659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21996014610824327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902484378517804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06613044560929839,0.0880569257864842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16003497836563915,0.0,0.0,0.0811758586029842,0.0,0.4716289811852735,0.0,0.0,0.056141614929208515,0.06301150714447948,0.08815872933440648,0.0,0.09199562957657807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17624332195596012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0851840701578003,0.08180483270659941,0.0,0.0,0.07075383895104362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27413902200394746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06378233073192661,0.0,0.0,0.11728396204192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09474671988993973,0.0,0.0550421632684211,0.10617445702275533,0.0,0.0657740096366603,0.09662153734241102,0.0,0.07853254729613364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2427985782080825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13672061028203344,0.0,0.0,0.2658305616821099,0.0,0.0,0.0768032051587592,0.07475965231553047,0.09249957825842067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060316120599764066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05335297897478322
healthanxiety,PracticallySuperman,2018/03/16,"Hard lymph nodes on mastoid bone and back of neck. Hello Reddit.

Im a 28/male/6'7/200lbs.

For months now I've had two rock hard lymph nodes behind my ear on the mastoid bone. On top of that I've had one right next to my spine on the back of my neck, right around my hairline. I've been having some neck pain and headaches non stop for three months. I've also noticed I have some brownish skin spots in my hairline. I've also noticed if I dig my fingers down in my skin near the node in my neck, it feels like I can grab this round lump.

I've been to the doctors and they brushed it off. they assured me its not cancer,is or anything like that. They me on some antibiotics a few months ago and it did nothing. They're not red, or painful. They're hard and kind of fixed in place. They aren't growing either. They've been the same size the whole time.

I get this is a long shot, but I'm not sure what to do. Could the ones behind my ear be rock hard because it's right on the mastoid bone?",1.4451674641148315,3.2001854784689066,1.9679425837320568,100.5455980861244,79.38277511961724,4.591387559808613,20.569377990430624,4.4396938790447145,-0.5809196172248803,771,20,184,1,19,235,110,209,0.065,0.892,0.043,-0.318,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,4,1,6,7,0,0,11,0,14,19,13,0,2,23,17,11,0,2,8,0,10,2,0,0,6,2,0,0,10,6,0,1,1,2,0,1,4,2,0,4,6,14,19,5,25,9,7,31,0,0,2,0,5,19,0,6,13,107,29,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.116172785568441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20961005802732105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10784750265757796,0.1166671726013853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20154716641649634,0.0,0.07989021106059263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046371456908092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13414084860393216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06626559415928808,0.09362606914413048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06847108506878596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4695999129976415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14156241979882575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13647412678765386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12805418632469218,0.0,0.0,0.11597998569160378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3138217283504767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13937900174991286,0.0,0.0,0.12575127845261508,0.29841509086484697,0.0,0.0,0.17761318524462774,0.0,0.2789045656051577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136925094629999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33576202038967884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10956825897197643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1235182495369743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07641951087556784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12802217185588527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463187757332868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,PuzzleHawk,2018/03/17,"Chest pain insomnia ugh All day I was experiencing intermittent chest pain near my heart. Knowing I have anxiety, I always try my best to give random aches and pains a chance to subside but it gets really hard at night. Now I keep waking up and feeling it, and worse, now I feel this weakness like my blood sugar or blood pressure is off. I just had a regular wellness exam about a month or so ago and my blood pressure is always low so I know it's ridiculous to think I suddenly have some kind of heart disease but oh my god I can't sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time and its killing me! Unfortunately I just moved recently and I absolutely hated the doctor I saw at my union's preferred primary care provider, and they are closed on weekends anyways. So I'm pretty much just stuck stressing and worrying. Please let this go away tomorrow! 

How's everyone else doing tonight?

healthanxiety,vaiiiishh,2018/03/17,"Health anxiety in PEAKS So.. I’m 21 now and I have crazy health anxiety from the past two years. When I was 13 my mother was diagnosed with Leukemia..she’s fine now but I never came out of that trauma. I’m really happy to have her by my side and I feel like I am the luckiest today.. but it has left a very bad effect on me. Everyday I feel like I have a disease developing inside of me..

I’m really really scared of cancer and any life threatening disease.. every week I have a new symptoms to worry about. I have constant heart palpitations. I’ve tried a lot.. exercised, distracted myself but that fear never left me. 
And now I am at my worst. I feel lightheaded in the middle of nowhere, I have palpitations, disorientation, depression and I keep crying. I have loss of appetite, gastric trouble, chest pains and what not! And recently I just checked my blood pressure it came out to be 140/80 with a racing heart. This has been killing me since the past week. I’m so scared now that I have hypertension and it’s going to affect my health. ( because when I googled hypertension it showed lightheadedness as a symptom)
I also have another fear.. I can’t get any tests done. I’m really scared of getting them done bc I feel like they’ll be something wrong and life can never get better. 
I haven’t been to a psychiatrist yet.. because many people have told me that the drugs don’t help and that they cause other side effects which aren’t good for your body. 
I need help... should I get tests done or go to a psychiatrist??",2.0368686868686865,4.5895042693602734,3.534141414141416,85.7545454545455,82.06397306397307,6.9670033670033655,22.468013468013467,8.101407402915765,1.4070053872053871,1196,40,236,25,33,393,155,297,0.268,0.6459999999999999,0.086,-0.9967,2,0,2,0,0,0,45.0,0,1,3,4,12,23,1,7,13,0,30,17,5,4,3,38,50,20,1,2,6,1,4,3,0,2,12,0,0,0,13,16,0,1,6,2,1,4,8,16,0,1,10,4,39,7,25,36,2,35,0,2,0,0,9,11,0,3,23,151,52,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709956273799342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1207439864297972,0.09309133320447537,0.13582964901593705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741258098709838,0.10823632623626964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07851680803605145,0.0,0.09861219560859233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20307645606216584,0.0,0.0911993233890456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09593733425061376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09751831713320096,0.0,0.0,0.07646424591371337,0.09010766524874332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2725517398590397,0.0,0.0,0.10295413947367572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07479918107802329,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1997995619720844,0.17955502614018864,0.1902687756654765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18553108329218407,0.0,0.10090901428936594,0.07446266197846851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09450568919373747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28310016041047903,0.0,0.21040439735987948,0.11901186446936154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07890984641323229,0.09821955521362777,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1929148223779004,0.0,0.12541286448367595,0.13011714297932495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0754757669618644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09000682190506575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06582766275199776,0.2054128897644616,0.08574221620996125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0944659087479728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1694970370779752,0.061547394120995136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22749349703292265,0.0,0.08765743245109156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2666463939235144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07343796817513917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06834553855466778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18454839046071125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08415103646153707,0.08483105547194557,0.0,0.0602743434939601,0.0,0.08672307517099821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0732510370350194,0.0,0.0,0.14242449824242132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09015823232131827,0.0,0.0,0.0970646599076569,0.0,0.05717003501883916

healthanxiety,Thepettyone,2018/03/17,"So I'm in diagnostic phase to see if I have breast cancer and my doctors won't tell me anything. Okay so backstory. Four (4) weeks ago I found a lump under my armpit. It was hard, fixed in place and didn't hurt. I watched to see if it would go away and it didn't. So I made an appointment with my GP.

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday.

They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged. The only reason I know this is because I saw this on the ultrasound and asked the sonographer (sp?).

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist.

I've called to try and get my results from the mammogram/ultra sound but they won't give them to me over the phone (which I understand).

I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.

I'm wondering if this was the process those of you with breast cancer (or any cancer really) went through test wise or do I have nothing to worry about?",2.9961192982456164,4.80199584,4.027532163742691,87.27926315789476,75.04444444444444,7.5812865497076025,25.175438596491237,8.371475516178862,1.550733333333334,884,30,183,16,19,286,128,225,0.07400000000000001,0.865,0.061,-0.7853,1,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,0,1,4,0,6,4,0,0,14,1,17,16,7,4,0,33,36,22,0,4,7,0,1,0,0,3,9,1,0,0,13,14,0,0,8,1,0,4,5,1,1,2,13,9,28,3,26,19,0,22,0,1,7,5,14,11,0,6,6,122,41,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13326725176538518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10223628845336973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12371692921547603,0.0,0.14054751358797435,0.0,0.14124928642697054,0.0,0.0,0.09164580860230323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15351384852797514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12950451321169273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3077585194406997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4945198267527977,0.0,0.0,0.07854639352807126,0.14421973272154925,0.08544163065571024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13467502205495127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16094197405160626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08262287818356903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14225524994741087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14425519026132622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11434026973157008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1570731989404267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09631159062917956,0.15457445790564953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1283894545111698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35940431097407993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.131403700485552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1425046479202316,0.0,0.0,0.1020709246065654,0.0,0.0,0.1565091395724131,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12059360068921232,0.0,0.13517362662215146,0.1393665949612351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16303721019916873,0.0,0.1526774677330603,0.0,0.10679715262418664,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Cosmobella20,2018/03/17,"Lifelong Hypochondriac/Health Anxiety. I didn't even know this Reddit existed until someone told me today after I posted in r/xxketo about my platelet count. I am 33 years old and started with the HA when I was 16. I went to the doctor yesterday after troubling symptoms for a few weeks. I had a baby 3 months ago and gained 50 pounds, so I have attributed my symptoms to weird hormones and my dieting, but my health anxiety has come back full swing and now I'm obsessing about cancer of the lungs, ovaries, lymphoma/leukemia and stomach etc..I also obsess about my heart rate, lymph nodes, I constantly check my fingers for capillary refill, check pulse, temp, blood pressure and pupils. I have also obsessed about blood clots in the legs/lungs since this all started in 2001. I get blurry vision and dizziness/vertigo often, along with a burning stomach, throat and esophagus, constant post nasal drip, and tingling in my hands/arms and legs/feet. Hot/cold flashes, weirdish night sweat ( hardly any sweating, really) and I have had severe joint pain and swollen, red joints since 2015. It's intermittent and comes and goes. They have done RA bloodwork and gotten nothing, even though my grandmother had RA and my aunt has lupus. 

 Today I got my lab work and literally everything was amazingly perfect except my platelets, which were 384( it said the range is 150-379) and my T3 uptake for my thyroid was low..by 2 points. My doctor hasn't said anything yet, I have an appointment again next week to discuss the results. Every part of me is so stiff and hurts so bad. My joints sear with pain and aching and my muscles are in total knots. I always feel nervous and anxious, I feel nauseated and not even prilosec helps. It hurts to move sometimes. My bloodwork is always pretty much normalish, this is the first time I've gotten something even remotely off. I'm always scared I'm going to die. I feel so vulnerable like I'll break if I push myself or do anything. I have tried CBD oil, kratom, cannabis and then also prescription drugs like Zoloft, Celexa/Lexapro, Ativan ( only thing that ever helped me.) This is the worst condition to suffer from and I wouldn't wish this kind of torment on my worst enemy. I hate this shit. I know ya'll do, too.

healthanxiety,ch1can3,2018/03/17,"First time poster, never used to be like this! Hi all,

About two years ago I passed out in my bedroom after riding home from work by bike on a cold day. Immediately jumped into a hot shower. Felt dizzy, confused, and then boom, hit the ground. Was kind of half aware half unaware, but then had a killer headache after a bit and slept it off. 

Went to the ER the next day for a CT Scan. Everything was peachy. Went about my regular day for a good 4 months until I was playing league and all of a sudden the cursor disappeared whenever it went past my right eye. I could still see out of it, but I couldn't follow the cursor. Then the text became hard to read. Then I tried texting my mom that I was having a stroke but it came out like gibbrish. Then slow creeping numbness up my left arm all the way to my face. Somehow managed to call 911 and they brought me in by ambulance. Diagnosed migraines. MRI was clean. 

All that happened two years ago. I regularly get these stroke-level migraines with aphasia and confusion about once a month. Every sinus infection is a brain infection, every unsymmetrical feature on my skull is a swollen lymph node and lymphoma. I'm itchy all the time in my apartment, so I've got liver failure. Every minor ache or pain is the worst possible disease. I can't help myself making doctor appointments because I don't believe I have migraines.

My life has been ruined, my personality completely changed. I don't even feel real, I walk around with de-realization daily. Who am I?

WTF is going on and how do I begin to deal? I'm only 29 and by most accounts pretty healthy.",3.2936823855755897,5.4942394304207145,4.179947988904298,84.75025485436895,75.40776699029126,6.744382801664356,25.59882108183079,7.7094869923839395,1.4569675450762838,1260,45,239,18,28,405,194,309,0.165,0.764,0.071,-0.9851,1,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,1,2,9,11,0,2,20,0,22,22,7,3,6,38,42,20,0,2,4,1,5,2,0,0,15,1,4,1,9,16,0,0,2,3,1,12,5,6,1,5,15,10,27,5,36,23,8,57,0,1,3,0,8,17,0,5,29,149,36,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20286405407946712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1018636830308362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06975322153856828,0.0,0.0,0.1289192764021365,0.0,0.0,0.12492390337250413,0.0,0.0,0.12773761422262175,0.11684206456268804,0.13087322455910236,0.0,0.0,0.12104787232024948,0.0,0.1199738176334132,0.0,0.0,0.09136010416844073,0.0,0.0,0.2213865270545596,0.11796850967307135,0.0,0.1161403043687667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712018538723107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557750402387628,0.0,0.28922732487702346,0.0,0.10283899659158917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057857384633418316,0.0,0.1098672099630272,0.0,0.0,0.09733096784881656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05978302851355306,0.0,0.06503111361706619,0.0959753668282792,0.09151717974770336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118681532983714,0.0,0.10250350553265232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07669754911976721,0.0,0.11477892695655813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1191574020612089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12432452958561363,0.0,0.08082269256830044,0.1118058384008116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07638045596685948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340147209734528,0.18266799107293796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08825263079323215,0.0,0.12169368759725048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12186029446531378,0.0,0.0870263712765738,0.12175767027339232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923286837750308,0.0,0.09991264746713538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12899848095673225,0.0,0.11641270266431936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11445728363688433,0.2604844025555069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09771945057079776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09118296081995772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09138100556502454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13344581272740902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07768795895101441,0.0,0.22355577227200735,0.0,0.0,0.0988275997691074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0908262853202185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31822303021818604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330372249693996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473735946776988
healthanxiety,jrobert629,2018/03/17,emetophobia I'm so tired of thinking about the stomach bug constantly.  I can't even have a normal life.  Im so worried about every meal becoming the one I have to throw up later.  I worry my kids are gonna wake up and be sick with the stomach bug.  It's a constant thought on my brain from the minute I wake up to the next time I wake up in the middle of the night.  The only relief I get is when I have a wake up in the middle of the night and feel somewhat normal and then the sense of dread comes to my brain like...maybe this is my last hour feeling normal and I'm gonna start vomiting soon.  ,2.718064236111111,3.3873639140625045,4.1535416666666665,90.61506944444444,73.921875,6.938888888888887,23.597222222222214,6.937597516519254,0.5900649305555552,463,12,107,4,9,154,73,128,0.128,0.835,0.037000000000000005,-0.9044,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,1,14,0,8,13,8,0,0,14,19,8,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,2,4,0,0,1,2,6,1,0,4,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,1,2,11,1,19,15,1,25,0,0,0,0,1,10,0,1,13,66,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17404506798678465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3518436894712507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13574928053092625,0.0,0.34059622905186865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040862866377212,0.0,0.13277583336218052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1593638318397061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233393682817199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15519377656279773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17022355228123948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12845636233484892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11131002610034424,0.07699020160735354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1583196945102088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675980731680037,0.2957738796851491,0.4632123429841087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067866294151082,0.11985381024057827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11154256077865464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009768993084356,0.0,0.12510834968093468,0.0918916236619874,0.1811257880647023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32007929120072304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,e_884,2018/03/18,"Awful feeling of dizziness and brain fog when standing? Just recently, I’ve been experiencing a lot of dizziness, slight heartburn + stomach aches, and  heat flashes. Heat flashes aren’t exceptionally uncommon for me. I also get a lot of stomachaches. Im not too worried about those. I have bad anxiety in general to begin with, so when I started noticing (around Tuesday or so) I was getting this dizzying brain fog sort of thing I really began to freak out.

 I’ve never experienced it before and I’m worried it’s something serious. I’m chalking it up to stress right now (just had a family death, general school stress, being broke, lack of sleep, etc) but I’m really worried. It hasn’t stopped. I feel like I’m about to faint frequently. It’s weird to describe, but it’s almost like my brain is going a few steps too far ahead of my body. Sometimes vice verse. I  stumble a lot when it happens and often need to hang on to something to steady myself.

I’ve noticed this is mostly happening when I stand. It’s not as frequent or severe as when I’m laying down, which makes it really hard to get stuff done. I don’t think it’s dehydration or a lack of sleep, either. I’ve been getting 10+ hours of sleep in since it began and I’ve been drinking as much water and Gatorade as possible.

Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be calling a doctor?",2.58481903957189,5.061188999999999,4.091778622729192,83.07590480214056,79.15209125475286,6.633938881847628,26.85100690043656,7.793537801064563,1.847796338543868,1069,45,197,18,27,354,146,263,0.134,0.8140000000000001,0.052000000000000005,-0.9381,1,0,3,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,0,1,17,9,0,2,7,1,16,13,8,1,1,39,37,23,1,4,11,0,3,2,0,1,3,0,0,0,18,9,2,1,3,1,0,3,6,7,0,0,8,6,14,2,34,26,10,32,0,1,0,0,1,9,0,10,20,127,32,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421120782932032,0.0,0.0,0.08322484978060755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07961336882487371,0.0,0.0,0.07276825851092897,0.10663215228597807,0.0,0.09264448476812057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08689421615171339,0.0,0.0,0.08855602020492483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11559845963669248,0.0,0.34853006792169383,0.10626724411070858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1065201935400481,0.0,0.10649988102235727,0.0,0.10194911290105492,0.0,0.0,0.08693724424382393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11606571080938324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09810806176900376,0.0,0.10524197495924792,0.07434772561394365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21748940190349675,0.0,0.05914545631661861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840577542974154,0.0,0.09322639997342354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10248812016067296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11241360489295747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10168682286478199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26543012292272505,0.0,0.0,0.06946762358142597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07650352407484833,0.07716668682460183,0.08026530423796954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23696907813704365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11732344098032332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2000099810581562,0.0,0.10275670371718898,0.0,0.0,0.08887532710961184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10532453319164077,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11756963075797942,0.0,0.08608789153818251,0.0,0.3124358811996611,0.0,0.0,0.16023654946937155,0.1029280251016515,0.0,0.0736613775713239,0.0,0.0,0.08700729325189996,0.23842397725741005,0.0,0.1191354066154482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06913957373657717,0.06668394067714127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3170648229336254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,evillikeeve2,2018/03/18,"Has anyone else have had this type of anxiety attack? I have generalized anxiety but for the past couple of months, due to the death of a loved one, my health anxiety, which was already present, has skyrocketed. 

Anyway, yesterday I started feeling anxious about something else than my health and then I had some coffee and started to feel sick, like I was dizzy, confused and nauseous. Health anxiety showed up again. While I was walking home I was constantly thinking I was going to die right there in the street and I started crying. I kept thinking ""I don't want to die in the street like this. At least let me get home before I die."". I got home and my relatives tried to comfort me, but I couldn't calm down. I kept crying and feeling ill. I even vomited a little. Anyway, they helped me test my temperature and blood pressure and blood sugar and they all looked fine, but I was not feeling fine at all. Eventually I did calm down, but it felt like forever. And I still feel physically bad, so to say. I have aches and pains all over all the time. I feel like I'm 80 and I'm only 25.

I don't get the normal ""raising heart beat thinking I'm having a heart attack"" kind of anxiety attacks so I'm not even sure if this is anxiety attack. Did any of you experience something similar?",2.995502608695652,5.184725472000004,4.17793043478261,84.46879130434786,76.28,7.227826086956522,26.469565217391306,8.18289091462,1.8083113043478256,1008,39,195,18,23,329,128,250,0.293,0.602,0.104,-0.9953,1,0,2,0,0,1,34.0,0,1,2,1,10,20,4,2,9,0,21,13,4,0,5,42,47,21,4,4,7,0,7,4,0,0,7,1,3,0,5,12,1,2,10,1,0,2,5,8,0,1,14,10,31,12,22,31,6,28,0,0,1,1,6,12,0,3,18,125,36,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09468151829084824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05834637818829143,0.0,0.39381678400727255,0.0969286410173114,0.0,0.05999277501500565,0.0879113895586456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3904357717208698,0.0,0.0,0.07163872361892616,0.0,0.0,0.07300877477479333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09271842270699554,0.0,0.0,0.09493515034481508,0.1884927201752664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671379794284188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14334839505774344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11333908598275233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08392805241881049,0.0,0.0,0.2602958317980125,0.0612949446215592,0.08238065888462495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08965305081875083,0.0,0.048761645895783405,0.0,0.06862143463382372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27360151859951337,0.0,0.2033448605405581,0.057509375485630274,0.0,0.2581906912517441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08934663304989679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877354650122115,0.0,0.16766856349053286,0.08599330919408832,0.0,0.0,0.07204969423239282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0774371012915839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06848407940268762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406497030115953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05813973849990847,0.0652541355015275,0.09129636681184908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08190501671813159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07327202289541103,0.0,0.0682309441892641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1321047865952854,0.0,0.0,0.18218728367402576,0.0,0.06851932847407023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08086470290091642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16492993230930006,0.0,0.0,0.05003018635668338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05825200483328924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05060657380092185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

After eating when to floss and pick it out, and digged around for a while.  I think I got the piece out but my gums were bleeding a good amount.  Note I do have healthy teeth and go to the dentist every year.  On Saturday afternoon that tooth and jaw area had a dull pain, made me stay in the night as it was just annoying.  Today woke up and for the first hour seemed alright but that dull pain is now back.  The thing is I am in the army and we are going to the field (woods for training) these next two weeks.   So I won't be able to go see a dentist. Today is my last free day.  Should I go the hospital since the dentist is closed today.

healthanxiety,notewise,2018/03/18,"I feel I'm becoming obsessed with the fear of being diabetic. Don't really know how to stop thinking about it. If this belongs more on r/diabetes I apologize and I'll remove if needed. 

TL;DR: Been scared of being diabetic since 2016 and got myself tested twice since last year. They found nothing, but because of my anxiety, I can't stop obsessing over it, wondering if i really do have it and they just misdiagnosed me and I don't know what I can do to trust the word of the Doctor or stop obsessing over it all. 

Over the past year or so, since 2016, I feel I've been fearful over being a diabetic. It's scary to me. Back in 2016, when I was having some frequent urination problems, I went and looked it up(Big mistake, I know...) and saw that they were possibly linked to things like diabetes, anxiety, prostate cancer I think I saw also..and diabetes was the one I started to worry the most about. So I looked into the other symptoms and started to piece together in my mind that I might have it. 

After some fighting with myself, I went and got myself tested. Blood test showed nothing and I was able to relax and calm myself, and it felt like the frequent urination problem I had stopped after hearing that.
 
The problem came back though in last November. In December 2017, I got myself tested once again for it, this time they gave me a urine test. Saying that they would do a blood test if the sugar in it was high enough. Which did worry me a little because it wasn't what I was used to seeing with diabetic tests, but I did my best to trust it.  They didn't need to do the blood test and said that things were okay.

Then this year, I felt i started to doubt it, thinking I was being misdiagnosed, that the test wasn't accurate enough and that I do have it, they just haven't figured it out yet.

I feel I'm gonna go back to my doctor's for a 3rd time to get tested because I'm waking up at night to urinate. But I don't know how to stop obsessing and panicking over this. It feels like every time something minimal goes wrong with my body. My mind is sent into overdrive, thinking it's something truly awful going on with me. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety, I know that much. So much that it feels like it does effect my day to day life a bit. I'm gonna try and get some therapy for it hopefully soon.

healthanxiety,sufferinginpnw,2018/03/19,"new here and need support Hello,
I am a sufferer of health anxiety and have been learning a lot about this disorder recently. I've always battled anxiety and depression but it hit an entirely new level when I was pregnant with my son (who is now 4) and since his birth. Throughout his pregnancy, I was convinced something was wrong with him. I was never relaxed or trusting, despite having a textbook pregnancy with no issues. 
Since his birth, I have been obsessed-- and I do mean OBSESSED-- with having breast cancer. I have had an absolute terror of cancer my whole life but it has reached a new level of hell in the past few years. I have to say-- and this is me venting here-- I am incredibly resentful of the overabundance of information on the internet about breast cancer because every time I google anything to do with my boobs it comes up as cancer. And it's because of this I have ended up in my lady doctor's office 4 times now, showing her my breasts and the new dimple or vein or whatever that I have recently discovered. 

In my research on health anxiety, I have learned that it falls more on the OCD spectrum than anything else, which makes a lot of sense to me. My fear of breast cancer has become an obsession, taking over my life at times and preventing me from enjoying anything. And the way I ""deal"" with it is compulsive-- by chronically checking myself, over and over and over again, in the mirror with my hands, etc. I feel like I am discovering some new symptom every other day.

Before anyone asks, no, I have not had a mammogram. I stopped breastfeeding my son 4 months ago and was advised to wait until at least 6 months. I have had my breasts looked at and examined and, each time, the doctor has said that things look and feel totally normal. They've also reminded me that by breastfeeding my son past 2 years, I have reduced my lifetime risk for BC by 30-40%. 
I (mostly) know this is irrational, and that my behavior mimics OCD. I am reading books on the subject, and have schedule an appointment with a specialist who uses EMDR for trauma and anxiety. So, hopefully those things will help. I have tried 4 different types of medications and none have worked because, apparently, I am one of the people for whom SSRIs don't work. Lucky me!

Anyway, I am rambling. I guess I am looking for support and stories. Can you relate? Have you found help? I am scared and sad and desperate.",5.279679538750337,6.833301676991155,5.8332341110217225,77.63700053633683,68.73451327433628,9.107106462858676,31.61732367927059,9.496760409515344,3.071040412979352,1906,81,335,41,33,616,227,452,0.217,0.721,0.062,-0.9977,2,0,1,0,0,0,66.0,0,2,0,2,11,24,3,7,21,0,46,23,8,2,2,64,67,33,0,3,6,3,3,1,0,1,15,2,0,0,23,33,0,3,9,4,1,2,6,15,0,1,12,8,55,9,52,53,12,52,1,3,3,6,22,19,2,10,31,251,78,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767299155577716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06922172853908516,0.07202457096828377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2648716107943809,0.0,0.0,0.060524526630977675,0.0,0.21369367356240335,0.0,0.08092159706606268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15829789529219304,0.09559834342271266,0.07365589493146091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07456348226177274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05582381956430927,0.08923920826451724,0.07455370800879632,0.0,0.0,0.09043642103692304,0.0992048691219689,0.17719495897193305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07230948853432934,0.0,0.07666616617081055,0.0,0.09653690150865467,0.0,0.0,0.14586049306445614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0974036821102078,0.08753432947912347,0.061838238140575076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0949081989904682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09535522391318813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1840177409653104,0.0,0.0,0.11603823051160107,0.0,0.0,0.08597327302939392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09034579575611026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757092520618753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12227929495065955,0.042288677401663165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21806494046482386,0.0,0.0,0.14717985444241796,0.0,0.0,0.0577792449549041,0.0,0.0,0.09428884517916007,0.0,0.08719975054687615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13818218899089765,0.0,0.0,0.06418289082785285,0.06676014574630633,0.4179992933271116,0.0,0.0,0.08481008808897815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05865506555207075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16526197910756074,0.06000956911517837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08658308391086174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17093444251406456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08233805827801184,0.06883571559420185,0.08666131975200238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1432060898702117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06663785491141297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236775134206351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19645375195686085,0.0,0.08996862946524953,0.06508209156495555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11501278325206656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2018945345162293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05876832696867911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07475975395907634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06870702879985294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09664076876178047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12603292627356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09463939945075356,0.0,0.11148316567345604

healthanxiety,Interesting_Bullfrog,2018/03/20,"Breast Cancer Worries Hi everyone, I'm sure this is nothing new but I really needed to get it out.


My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago and is currently going through chemo. I've had bad health anxiety all my life and my mom's diagnosis has pretty much put me over the edge.


My left breast (same as the one she found her cancer in) felt sore, so of course I squeezed and kneaded the hell out of it trying to feel something. I didn't feel anything other than the fact that it is slightly bigger than the other, which is something I've known for a while but now I'm second guessing myself. The soreness went away with my last period, and then returned this month. Again, I squeezed and checked it compulsively. I cannot keep my hands off it. Always checking to see if it feels better or worse. My SO gently suggested that this isn't helping but I can't seem to stop. Now that my period has arrived, it feels much better but there's still one spot that hurts to poke. I've also lost 70lbs in the past couple years so my breasts don't look great for a 26 year old and I think that contributes to my worry. I'm always looking for symmetry to assuage my fears.


And now I've developed a rash that I'm pretty sure is from stress. It started on my stomach and is spreading. This prompted me to look up inflammatory breast cancer and I've basically given myself a death sentence.  I'm going to the clinic tomorrow to have it checked out but every fibre of my being wants to cancel and just hope it goes away. I'm also going to request a referral for an ultrasound. 


I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I usually talk to my parents about my fears but obviously I don't want to bring this up. Besides the anxiety it's causing, I also feel so horrible and selfish. Has anyone else imagined (or basically given themselves) symptoms after a family member or friend has been diagnosed with an illness? Any suggestions on how to function normally? I'm exhausted from the constant adrenaline rushes  :(

healthanxiety,WhosThatGirl143,2018/03/20,"Uncontrollable HIV anxiety New to Reddit so I apologise if this post is a little all over the place!

So I've struggled FOREVER with anxiety. I'm a 22 year old girl, whole jadda-jadda about troubled childhood, absent parents etc which I think has contributed to it. Over the past 3 weeks I have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that I have HIV. I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression in the past, as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that I'm on deaths door after panickingly Googling symptoms.

So basically I met a lovely guy, we really hit it off, going on lovely dates every day for about a week. Then, VERY out of character for me, we got drunk and slept together (every kind of sex, for those interested). I barely remember it and the next day I knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home, let alone anything else. Cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day, and I asked if he 'had anything'. He said no, and seemed pretty offended. Well, if he was offended by that, he was even more offended when I said I thought he had HIV and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? Where do you have them done? How many people have you slept with? 

I physically couldn't eat for days, and I spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. I was shaking constantly, waking up in the night in a hot sweat. In the end I spent 5 hours waiting in A&amp;E until 1am to get PEP. I had to exaggerate to get it (the guys parent's are Ghanaian and Nigerian, he was born in Cuba, but I said he was Ghanaian because I know there's a high rate there). I remember the doctor saying to me ""okay so there is some risk"" and I just started crying. I was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point.

The guy in question has been so lovely. He knew how anxious I was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. I'm currently taking PEP. All my friends think it's hilarious how anxious I am, but honestly this anxiety is killing me. I can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. I'll think things like, what if I've actually got it from a previous partner? This guy has tattoos, would they test for HIV before that? What if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before I find out the truth? 

I had a blood test done at the end of January which was clear, and my blood test from A&amp;E was fine, and I tested negative for everything except a water infection. Even then I was thinking what if the water infection is the start? I sneeze and convince myself these are the flu-like symptoms. I see a spot on my body and I'm convinced that is the rash starting. 

Does anyone else suffer with this? I'm scared that even if I get a negative result that my anxiety will continue.

healthanxiety,PaleosaurusRex,2018/03/20,"Hantavirus Hi all. I have OCD, hypochondria, panic disorder, Cyclothymia, blah blah blah, the whole nine yards. Health anxiety fucks me up like daily, but this week it's been super bad. 

So my fiance and I found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and don't want to put it out there and have it freeze. We've been packing because we're about to move and so we've been kicking stuff up, but haven't found any droppings. Of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box. 
Anyway, now about a week and a half later, I have heavy chest pressure, a dry cough, and back pain in the area of pleurisy. I went to medemerge last night and my blood pressure was 98/65, pretty low, but the doctor kept saying how great it was. I was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection, but she also gave me an antibiotic because my tonsils were pretty big. 

Well this morning I wake up and as I'm brushing my teeth I hack up something black. What the hell?!? I'm freaking out! 

I live in NJ but don't know the Hantavirus facts about NJ.",3.822263824884793,5.076415912442396,4.109513248847929,89.75569844470046,71.90322580645163,6.53099078341014,26.004896313364053,6.6274283507984215,0.8591476958525344,851,27,178,6,16,265,126,217,0.19,0.705,0.105,-0.9458,0,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,3,0,0,1,14,14,2,3,16,0,16,11,4,1,2,29,28,19,0,1,6,0,1,4,0,0,6,1,2,0,9,14,0,2,3,1,0,4,3,10,1,2,17,4,18,4,23,11,3,30,1,1,1,1,7,16,2,0,9,111,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484696725252685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10616513351638482,0.0,0.11942932521649775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12004458527538865,0.2607028883061988,0.2855030142526623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1704396833023574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15845579717619415,0.0,0.0,0.17892397817786926,0.159792695927773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34234917449855073,0.0,0.14432794999622942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17211990037467872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16594541457606093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579799821144123,0.1272564554083394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07627103850400163,0.0,0.13785445691121284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16592800823044151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14650553248966475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661198393645251,0.18317004184886815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31765488651622115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15694103007847882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12415076179065823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12018674288386615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17871698474127007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09208204229992463,0.0,0.2504558002265748,0.0,0.14036822282315214,0.14472232301871846,0.0,0.1742994164910012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,WorrierHabit,2018/03/20,"Back pain and worst anxiety day in years!! Crying and scared 33 female. I have been doing really well with health anxiety, not googling, going to therapy etc. NOT TODAY! i am terrified I have some sort of kidney disease or something. Last night when I went to bed at 1 am i was irritated with back pain, sort of mid back no matter how i moved, so I changed my pillow (my old one was giving me neck pain and headaches) and still no relief. I didn't sleep well. I have been unable to function all morning so far bc I can't stop googling kidney failure, infections, back pain etc.  I have sort of all over back pain, mid back, lower back, not sharp but achey and like i pulled something. I can really feel it when i take a deep breath or move. Sitting on my couch right now even hurts. I finally broke down and took ibuprofen. I also keep excessively checking my urine to see if its cloudy and keep moving and touching my back and checking for other kidney symptoms.  On sunday i spend several hours sitting on the floor going through several closets of clothing reaching and moving differently than normal. Yesterday I carried a heavy gaming system by myself from the floor to my car to the post office, I also used my lap top while sitting on my couch to work most of the day and evening....Is it possible this is from weird posture and will go away or should I be going to the ER???? I know my anxiety is probably making it worse and my husband and parents are giving me the silent treatment now because I've had a slip in my anxiety. I am just really really really scared.",4.037708333333335,5.7502527927631615,4.915131578947372,82.38425438596494,72.0592105263158,7.82982456140351,27.469298245614038,8.472884824447931,2.0146758771929827,1235,45,231,21,24,401,172,304,0.16699999999999998,0.762,0.071,-0.9804,3,0,2,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,0,2,22,15,0,2,9,0,22,16,7,3,2,43,38,27,0,3,9,2,3,1,0,2,9,0,5,0,6,16,0,3,2,1,3,12,7,11,3,1,8,4,36,4,31,27,7,61,0,2,1,0,5,18,0,9,27,159,42,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12209817831424816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23359963589246324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07172396497361339,0.4696061266419818,0.0,0.04653616972124374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08075762246444618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08385593108794928,0.09846599932125198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07975907633998089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17027861139950246,0.05042186549646892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03859980960792336,0.0,0.0,0.08362676419812924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14646461330723104,0.1735431782901647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08114587508704436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07517954555314661,0.0,0.08172357398513179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13570904087588753,0.0,0.0,0.04195448041375659,0.06222730806371316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03729587936500714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050957558430393235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.324549454137236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163994057526824,0.07479701444098033,0.0,0.0,0.0801060128169843,0.0,0.05172997557238765,0.0,0.40615583651379256,0.0,0.08476656178778537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08606190611950247,0.07311264011563431,0.0,0.08230745698120041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2445268690405668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06519396289553328,0.0,0.0,0.15285936215900084,0.0,0.060833114898597815,0.0,0.0,0.17248499430722905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07639515528324492,0.0,0.0,0.11754055934703515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0609652413246688,0.06382367786854183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07934651441804155,0.05739819698720275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08730146989271037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236141600823104,0.0,0.08481657494592107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593326952584402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13727769826598227,0.07076796653878696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0555764462632812,0.0,0.07779700578716102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04916047218377653
healthanxiety,cette_femme,2018/03/20,"Those of you that Beat Cardiophobia, I Could use your Help... Hello,

Little bit of background. My younger brother has a weird heart issue. He needed a pacemaker/ICD at 21. Nobody else in my family has it, I've looked into it. I spent a whole summer getting second and third opinions from specialists in the field. I had 24 hr holter over the summer, excercise test and several EKGs. This kicked off my intense fear.

During the late fall, I started developing weird dizziness. I went to the ER twice, back to the cardiologist, everyone deemed it panic. I want to believe them. I'm trying.

The worst thing I've been doing is regularly checking my pulse, and it's always changing. The doctors don't seem to worried though. When I'm relaxed, or even just sitting and anxious, it can be 60. Sometimes it's 107. The more I focus on it, the more it fluctuates. I tried deleting the Samsung health app with the pulse ox but the curiosity always gets the better of me. I felt tired and panicky at work, I had a little coffee, and was surprised that my pulse was 66. Usually it's high when I'm stressed and have caffeine. I made a doctor's appointment and by the time I got there my pulse was 100. I showed him on the app that in the 5 minutes waiting for him to come in after the nurse took my vitals, my pulse was all over the place. 65, 84, 100, 76... He said that was normal.

I just want to be free of this. I want to stop checking and freaking out. If it's high I get scared, if it's low I get scared. The holter monitor averaged my hr at 66. When I'm take it, it seems more like the 70s. I'm seeing a therapist, but the hardest part for me it's believing I'm ok and stopping the hypervigilance and checking my pulse all the time.

healthanxiety,spoticry,2018/03/20,"Tired of wasting my money and time I know nothing is wrong with me but I'm in so much pain all the time that I go to the doctor and my blood results are always normal. I'm so tired of it. I've wasted so much money going to the ER because the triage nurse suggested it based on my symptoms or because I was hunched over in pain for hours. I don't know if I'm a hypochondriac or what but I'm always at the doctors office and my job is very much at risk. At this point I'm saying fuck it, if my appendix bursts then let it. If my iud punctures my uterus or becomes embedded in the uterine lining and causes digestive infection then let it. It would be better than living in pain just to be told nothing is wrong with me. Better than to be known as the unreliable employee.

healthanxiety,blackisthesoulx,2018/03/20,"Ridiculously anxious about my teeth it’s making me miserable. Hi everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve had health anxiety for around 3 years now but have only just joined reddit and thought I’d search to see if such a subreddit exists and it does. 

So yeah, I’ve had HA for 3 years. It was severely bad 3 years ago, I had a lot of stress going on but I managed to get it under control. I used to be so bad, any pain or symptom I panicked and I can’t even count the amount of times I called 999 or 111 (I’m in the UK) and had ambulances come out for me. I was at the doctors almost 3 times a week. 

Everything has been fine until recently, under a lot of stress again. A lot of uncertainty in my life and may have to uproot and leave my home (for like the 15th time in the past 3 years). Ever since the stress, the HA has crept back in. Right now, I’m petrified and convinced that I’m going to lose my two front teeth. 

I haven’t been to see a dentist in the last 5 years since they gave me 2 fillings and I had such excruciating pain afterwards for a few months whenever I drank or ate something too hot or cold I had awful pain up the side of my face. Something as simple as changing my tooth paste fixed it and I haven’t had it since. But I haven’t been in 5 years and I think that itself is what scares me. I’m not even registered at a dentist, I’m going to call round tomorrow morning to register. 

My problem is, I am convinced that my 2 front teeth wobble. Well not wobble, but they definitely move if I hold onto the tooth with my thumb and index finger and try to move each tooth. I can ever see it in the mirror (I think). It’s only slight and it’s not wobbling or twisting or anything like that. But that’s enough to have convinced me that I’m doomed and my teeth will fall out.  I smoke so I think that’s contributing to the fear. Plus I suffer from depression so I haven’t brushed as often as I should because I neglect myself. 

Has anyone else had any similar issues in relation to anxiety about their teeth? Are teeth supposed to move if you try to move them with your fingers? I did a google search (awful I know, I promised myself I would stop doing this) and all the results were about gum disease or forums where people put as the header ‘I lost my front teeth!’ So that’s terrified me even more. 

My gums seem fine, they don’t hurt, they aren’t red. They bleed when I brush sometimes but that’s when im really rough at brushing. If I’m gentle and brush properly, no blood. I’m so terrified I’m already acting like they’ve fallen out. Ive even been thinking that I wish they would just fall out at least then I could be like okay, so now I need to get this sorted. But the whole worrying that it might happen is a nightmare. I’ve been spending the past week either crying uncontrollably or sleeping so I don’t have to think about it. That is of course unless I have a dream where my teeth fall out which I dream about quite frequently. 

Sorry that this is so long. I’ve never really spoken about my HA before. Nobody ever seemed to get it and my doctor is in no way supportive or understanding, just acts like I’m annoying them. My family don’t get it either. My mum actually told me I was deranged when I was in the middle of an intense panic attack a few years back. 

Thank you all for reading. I hope that everyone is well. Any responses will be greatly appreciated.

healthanxiety,I-Already-Reddit-420,2018/03/20,"Slightly red, raised spot on the head of my penis For about a month now I’ve had a small red slightly raised spot on the head of my penis. It hasn’t changed in size or color. It doesn’t hurt, burn, itch or anything. It’s more of a aesthetic displeasure than anything else. I have had unprotected sex but only with my girlfriend of four years. I haven’t been tested for anything yet. I also had shown my dermatologist and they didn’t say much, just prescribed me a steroid cream. Any thoughts or any one else?

healthanxiety,starlord327,2018/03/21,"Have I been having heart attacks?! As of late I’ve been experiencing pains on the inside of my left arm and frequent sharp pain in my chest to the left of my breast plate. Sometimes the pain radiates across my chest and shoulder and other times it can be one or the other. I’ve also been experiencing rapid heart rates from little physical activity and high blood pressure. I do have pretty severe health anxiety and also suffer from digestive problems as well so I can be sure if it is just my anxiety manifesting physical symptoms. I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since I’ve taken it off and sent it in. While I was eating lunch (normal meal that shouldn’t have triggered anything) I experienced hot flashes across my body and then the pains started again. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? I’m a 24 male who is 6’,underweight and pretty malnourished right now from my stomach issues.

healthanxiety,featherintheweather,2018/03/21,"New Moles - Anxiety First time poster, but a long time hypochondriac. 

It’s genetics - my family has tons of moles, but today I noticed 2 more on my stomach, or maybe 1 new mole and a weird red dot? It’s making me extremely anxious.  

2 weeks ago I was in and out of the hospital for some strep throat complications which has completely peaked my anxiety.  I’m only 19 and I’m indoors most of the time and have no family history of Melanoma, but I can’t help but freak out. 

They’re very tiny, one is small and brown but the other may not even be a mole? It’s the same size, but red and not raised. No pain or itching. It’s just making me paranoid. 

I have a doctor’s appointment coming up soon so I’m trying to hang on until then but it’s driving me insane.

healthanxiety,StandardCaterpillar,2018/03/21,"Telling the difference between anxiety and something else? (Upper stomach / throat) So I've had these symptoms for more than a month now...getting close to 2 and I KNOW I'm freaking out about them. Earlier I felt like I couldn't breathe and something might be wrong with my heart and that got all checked out, got normal blood tests, everything was fine and I finally saw my primary care who said my anxiety seemed really bad. So I felt silly for getting over anxious and I have a therapy appointment and a meds appointment and everything to deal with my anxiety. So that's all set to be dealt with.

That said, everything started in my throat/upper stomach and that hasn't really been checked besides me going ""ahhh"" and doctor's looking down my throat (apparently it looked bad at first, but now looks fine). I'm having discomfort (and some mild pain) in a very specific area right under my breast in the center...front and back...the pain mostly in the back, and discomfort in the front. I burp every time I eat, I never burped before at all and the discomfort is worse when I eat and sometimes relieved when I burp. I have mild nausea. I have mucus in my throat, a white coating on my tongue. And this has been going on for the full 1 month +. 

I'm just not sure...is this just anxiety should I try to ignore it until my therapy appt? Is it indigestion or gas or acid reflux or something mild like that (the primary care guy suggested acid reflux, but I'm been trying various remedies for all this type of stuff and nothing seems to help)? Or should I ask to be checked? My doctor does have an electronic place where I can ask a question but I just feel silly since I KNOW my anxiety is bad and it might just be anxiety.

I see discomfort in this area can be related to like an ulcer or a hernia so I guess that would be my anxiety but mainly I just hate feeling so uncomfortable and having trouble eating so if there's any possibility it's physical I'd like to get it fixed!

Does anyone have any advice or similar experience?

EDIT: So here's what ended up helping my acute anxiety. 1) I stopped Googling. 2) I remembered that while I felt sure I had an ulcer I felt sure a few days ago that I had - anemia - thyroid problems -heart problems and I DID get tested for those...and they were all fine, so it's likely this would turn out fine too even though I FEEL so sure. 3) I distracted myself and tried to do something else.

healthanxiety,Dornasealpha18,2018/03/21,Has anyone tried EMDR for health anxiety? I’ve got the worse health anxiety/anxiety to where I have many panic attacks and pain everyday. I’ve tried CBT it did not work. Having a therapist tell me to go to my happy place sounded like a croc of shit lol. I’ve convinced myself I have MS and that I have heart disease. Those two are the big ones. Any small ache or pain I think I’m dying. I don’t take meds because I’ve heard really bad things. I’ve taken one Xanax which actually didn’t even help. So I’m gonna try and new technique and wonder if anyone has ever tried it? I also get numbness mainly on left side of my body.

healthanxiety,ijustneedareddit,2018/03/21,"Persistent pain in Fibrocystic breast - Anyone have similar experiences? A couple months ago I got a checkup because my breasts have always felt lumpy. Doctor felt with her hands and said they felt like normal lumpy breasts. I got an ultrasound and was told I have fibrocystic breasts. Cool! I could finally relax.


A month later, I literally woke up one day and felt a ""pain"" in my right breast I hadn't felt before. I don't know if ""pain"" is what I should use since it doesn't hurt too bad, but I can definately and specifically feel it, and it's a sensation I don't feel anywhere else in my breast.


Ever since it randomly started that day, months later, it is persistent and I still feel it in the same spot. I'll feel it ""twinge"" throughout the day. It hasn't been getting more painful, but it is a specific sensation in the same spot (although sometimes when I sleep it'll feel slightly painful/more pronounced in the morning, but then goes back to its ""normal"" sensation after I move around. It also hurts when I feel/knead it with my hands, but so do many other parts of my boobs).


During my cycle, my nipples will get sore a few days before my period, and then feel normal again once it starts - that is the way my breasts have acted during my cycle for years. This new specific sensation in my breast is persistant throughout the month, and I believe it's unrelated to my cycle.


Has anyone had similar experiences like this? Any advice, similar experiences, or concerns if something's going on with me that I should get checked out would be appreciated. I'm so mad this pain decided to start RIGHT after I finally got an ultrasound, so I feel obtuse about going to get it checked out again, especially considering I don't know what else could be done to examine it besides getting another ultrasound.

healthanxiety,ercarp,2018/03/21,"Worried I have worms in my brains, among other bizarre health anxieties. For the past several months I've been on a huge parasite scare that came out of seemingly nowhere. I even had stool samples taken (again, several months ago) and everything came back negative. But now I'm thinking maybe the samples weren't great. Apparently they do their testing kind of hastily sometimes, so I'm thinking of doing a second batch of samples.

Anyway... I always thought that tapeworms were just an intestinal parasite. But then I read that they can spread to other organs too, including your EYES and BRAINS. Christ. So, naturally, I look in the mirror every day to make sure there aren't any worms in my eyes. I also check my stool with every bowel movement. And now I'm worried that the larvae of this hypothetical worm has spread to my lungs (I've been coughing a lot lately) and brains as well (would explain my headaches, and why I feel so spaced out.)

I've also had to take my cat to the vet a couple times because she was diagnosed with diabetes, so naturally I'm worried about fleas as well now. I just saw some kind of small, brown bug on my floor (one of my cats spotted it) that bounced around a couple times before I killed it. Now, it could've just been a moth that was struggling to fly, but it could've also been a flea. Right? And infected fleas carry feline tapeworms that are even worse than regular tapeworms if they spread to humans.

So yeah, it's 3 AM and I'm going over all of this shit in my head, unable to sleep.

I guess I should mention I'm also worried about going blind, as my astigmatism has been getting worse (and I found out about something called keratoconus, which I may have) and I also have all kinds of pains in my body (around pancreas and liver, especially) so I could also have cancer. Or maybe those are just the cysts formed by the larvae of the tapeworm.

And I do also worry about early-onset dementia and stuff like that, but that's kind of taken a backseat while 90% of my mental energy goes into worrying about worms.",5.609303375196234,6.5811574617346915,5.7323469387755095,80.81814756671899,67.49489795918367,8.479748822605966,29.10753532182104,8.617729084823388,2.131091130298272,1623,55,302,24,26,513,201,392,0.151,0.81,0.039,-0.9928,2,0,1,0,0,0,54.0,0,1,4,0,37,14,2,2,17,1,29,22,13,1,3,50,54,36,1,4,10,0,1,1,0,3,9,0,0,1,21,22,0,0,7,1,1,5,3,5,2,2,18,10,34,9,48,32,5,41,1,0,6,0,10,20,1,7,17,207,55,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06602895035041746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4169751303069269,0.06197982606789465,0.0,0.0,0.05065426595712162,0.0,0.05698297173678395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13261988872053232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057276529005762876,0.0,0.04540707837720338,0.0,0.06338364110127585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827391662420819,0.0,0.24945909591501034,0.07606038353968665,0.1703884246191183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17841736850385198,0.1648386927711857,0.0,0.04803847604402979,0.0,0.0,0.07560356047941022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09839699366051656,0.0,0.12551838725000275,0.0,0.06694484176455268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03766327548466016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167204034351949,0.0,0.0,0.038916807015723774,0.0,0.08466627943009705,0.0,0.0,0.0821230748864144,0.08205672194017065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07644598409352191,0.07917706016922492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08240972687901088,0.3102703717634375,0.0,0.0,0.08402549556932377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.036390982060144086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06255100122922971,0.0,0.0,0.06332687342945853,0.0,0.0,0.049721192427736975,0.0,0.14966603651907345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07506619403646925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11891092059553107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05047486867390265,0.0,0.07926028296876123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07110704432542297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07450796872612057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06361218382712336,0.0,0.0,0.07457529358152731,0.0,0.0,0.06781090581050034,0.0,0.16830004923728192,0.07646066784647408,0.0,0.0,0.07454160547298723,0.0,0.0,0.057344356258168076,0.07367034999099221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07787083337351257,0.08527072284745911,0.0,0.0,0.07020388059165998,0.0,0.056005563949933466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09545756354718472,0.0,0.0591350017763595,0.0868688835292386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13394697591022406,0.0,0.06721366383014057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4538759283933327,0.15181888670466856,0.0529140039640255,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Disastrousitem,2018/03/22,"Drove downwind of a confirmed asbestos fire today. freaking the hell out so yeah, there was a major fire in the city today. we had no idea till we were driving up on it. The route I wanted to take was blocked due to the fire. At that time, we had no idea the smoke was highly toxic. So cause our route was blocked, I took a street pretty much parellel to the one we were supposed to take. We drive, and we come across smoke, and drive right through it. I also played the funny guy, and breathed in really hard and said ""mmmm smell that"" to be funny.

Read on the news when we got home the building contained asbestos, and theres an asbestos warning for the whole city center. So yeah, now here we are. I'm in a really, really bad place now.

That said, there are a few things which I guess are kinda making me feel a bit better. We were about 800 feet maybe from the burning building in question, and we drove through about 8 hours after the fire started, and apparently it had been contained by that point.

Still we walked around the city center all day, and drove through it, and waited at a stop light in the smoke. My lungs feel full, and I think my nose burns a little, though that could be becuase later on, at the bar, I stood with my frie ds a few times while they all smoked cigarettes.

And this is kinda gross, but I could have sworn my farts had a kind of asphalt like smell, which I got when I quit smoking, which indicates smoke inhalation of some kind. I guess I could be misidentiying it though.

I dunno... I'm just really scared now.",4.063850968703426,5.237427940983609,4.015506706408349,90.9660320417288,71.22950819672131,6.856929955290611,24.02757078986587,6.980632752743323,0.6724754098360655,1202,31,254,10,22,367,160,305,0.103,0.843,0.054000000000000006,-0.8684,1,0,6,0,0,0,44.0,12,0,1,2,20,10,1,1,26,2,23,5,4,2,2,55,46,22,0,4,2,0,7,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,15,26,1,6,6,3,0,9,2,5,0,1,21,14,30,5,34,19,10,52,1,0,0,0,17,24,1,7,20,169,45,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09333192033654544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10389550350397043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09744690535287706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10321937763130133,0.12741569374277045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11989200320383366,0.0,0.10053422723389227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2795472460940357,0.0,0.0,0.07526746861740037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11802286995831852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866852480932321,0.0,0.25713562344557844,0.1155599806270644,0.0,0.0,0.10454808820345786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1233091692684023,0.11706836090137356,0.0,0.11493457893278275,0.0,0.0,0.2634998756021332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2430683422201943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057017984868166616,0.11697279681575973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790397612206353,0.0,0.11724959485043936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08579433706689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0790848483702581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12193577106319305,0.0,0.11032746294974452,0.0,0.0,0.11873472466046743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13074047521016385,0.12413408850754434,0.11674030193421367,0.0,0.2990663752928519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09966860825276644,0.2220334353982545,0.0,0.1168457876169163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08260703193205343,0.0,0.0932037336702552,0.09757371486871663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17550086406312285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775360869391265,0.07478223457792389,0.2293314475083116,0.0,0.13610758507144952,0.0,0.2212524382448295,0.0,0.12966768096568035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06883782622432127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13030111674030453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,giraffe_shit,2018/03/22,"Health Anxiety gets worse during the winter months? Nice to meet you, I'm new here.

I've been struggling with HA for quite some years now. This last year, I've graduated university and started a new career. Everything's been very stressful, and somehow it's impacted my HA too.

The thing I noticed is that it always gets worse and more intense during the winter months and beginning of spring. I get back pains, my joints start to ache, I feel tired,... which triggers unhealthy and irrational thoughts and anxiety about my health (for the last month I was absolutely sure I had heart problems, lung cancer, an aneurysm, and some other illnesses). It's absolutely crazy.

I don't know, but it's often this way. It always gets worse during the period of january - april. During summer and fall I sometimes get little health scares, but they're nowhere as intense as during the cold and darker months.

healthanxiety,misterchief10,2018/03/22,"Does anyone else only worry about sudden health issues? I don’t know how to explain it, really, but the only health anxiety I have is usually kind of “sudden” things that could kill me, like aneurysms, embolisms, all that. I’ve never worried about cancers, really, or long-term sort of degenerative things. I almost think it’s because it’s the fear of not knowing something is coming. I’m afraid the X-Ray missed something and that my aorta is going burst or something. 

Like, if I knew something was coming, I would be able to tie up loose ends, spend time with friends and family, take a vacation, and live until I die. I wouldn’t be happy about it, obviously, but I never get very anxious about things like that. The things that scare me are things that could just randomly kill me while I’m studying or playing video games or something. The kinds of things that just make you drop dead and end up in an article like “Healthy 20 year-old dies in sleep.” It’s more of a fear of sudden death for me, like it’s waiting around the corner and I just don’t see it yet.

healthanxiety,iamanemotionaltampon,2018/03/22,"Having a difficult time managing my anxiety Hi everyone. This will probably be quite lengthy, so I’ll apologize in advance. I’ve been struggling for years with health related anxiety which I “managed” for a long time on my own. By manage, what I really mean is just deal and push through it. I’m at a point where it’s more than I can handle now and it’s crippling. 

My mother has had Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis for 21 years and I grew up watching her deteriorate from an independent, strong woman into someone who is now dependent on someone else for even the most basic tasks. I think this is the root of my health anxiety. 

I am terrified of getting MS. Over the last 4-5 years I’ve had varying degrees of symptoms ranging from tingling in hands and feet to constant headaches. I’ve had a number of tests done which all come back either normal, or with some other explanation. The most recent being a constant left sided headache and pain in my left eye. My primary care physician ordered an MRI based on my family history of MS which came back abnormal with some extremely small white spots which they were unable to make a diagnosis of. Their recommendation was to see a neurologist and get a lumbar puncture. This was in November...

I live in Massachusetts which makes me extremely fortunate to have access to some of the best hospitals in the country. I was able to schedule an appointment with a neuro at Mass General, currently #3 in the country for neurology. The doctor was extremely nice and listened to everything I had to say. He flat out said “I do not think you have MS”. He explained to me that MS has certain patterns that show in an MRI which mine did not show. He said he believes my headaches are being caused by a combination of tension from clenching my jaw at night, which I absolutely do, and migraines with aura, which has happened twice. I asked about the lumbar puncture and he told me if I really wanted one and if it would put my mind at ease, he would gladly order one, but he felt it would come back negative. 

I certainly do not want to put myself through that unnecessarily and I’m afraid it still wouldn’t placate me. He also completed a full neurological exam, which I passed. I left there feeling pretty relieved. That lasted for about an hour. I started thinking about what if he’s wrong?? He’s basically just assuming this is due to headaches, but he really doesn’t know for sure. 

I really don’t know what to do at this point. My anxiety is out of control and I can’t stop thinking about this. It consumes every thought of my day and it is exhausting. I hate feeling like this. I do have a NP Psych who I see every six months who is very nice and tries to prescribe medication for me, but I can never bring myself to take it. I read the side effects and they scare the crap out of me so much that I’m too scared to take them. The only thing I will take is Xanax, which usually isn’t often, but lately it’s been almost every day. 

I also see a therapist who also is very nice, but if I’m being honest, isn’t very helpful. Whether that is my own fault, I don’t know. I originally went to her because I have issues with control and wanted to try to work on that. I just don’t find it to be doing anything for me though... 

I just wish I knew how to RELAX my thoughts and stop being such a worry wart. I’m wound so tight I’m ready to snap at any given minute. I get up every day, shower, go to work and then come home and lay in bed until I fall asleep because I’m so exhausted. I don’t know if I’m exhausted because of my mental health, work hours, or if something is really physically wrong with me. 

I’m honestly not even sure what I’m looking for in writing this, maybe I just needed to vent. But if anyone can relate or offer any advice I would be open to hearing anything you have to say. 

Life is so hard...

healthanxiety,powerofsoulphoto,2018/03/22,"Severe HA and a nodule found in my lung yesterday Hey all! I've been on Reddit for a while, but haven't posted here. Basic backstory... I'm 34 female, son died in 2009, was diagnosed with PTSD and general anxiety. Health (in real life) began to fail after his death. I have since been diagnosed with POTS, fibromyalgia, PAC's, diabetes, had two colonoscopies with polyp removal, gall bladder removed, three ruptured discs in my neck and recently had pneumonia at the beginning of February. The pneumonia brought back severe symptoms of HA. They hadn't gone away completely, but I had made real progress. Yesterday I finally went to the doctor after three days of chest pain thinking maybe the pneumonia was recurring. After the x-ray, I was told I was negative for pneumonia but I have a 1cm nodule in my right lung. She said they are usually benign, but of course, I'm flipping my shit. I have smoked for 22 of my 34 years on this planet, so lung cancer is a real, legitimate fear. I have to wait for two months for reexamination to check for growth. How the hell do I get through the next two months? I have found myself already writing an end of life journal for my other two kids. I feel completely defeated and hopeless. I'm not functioning. My house is a wreck and I just can't find any motivation to do anything at all. Please give me some advice to help get through the waiting game. Sorry so long, but I'm feeling desperate.

healthanxiety,overthinking_all,2018/03/22,"Brain amoeba First of all, thanks to everyone who participates here. Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as I've realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. 

My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, I've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, I've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. 

Allow me to think out loud:
- can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose?
- is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution?
- would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constant/progressively worse?

I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldn't resist venting on here. I'm struggling! I know the questions I posed are mostly unanswerable. Just needed to ask them ""out loud"" rather than let them cycle internally.

healthanxiety,HulkSmash1978,2018/03/23,"Years of Random, Sudden, &amp; Violent Vomiting. Anyone Else Have Similar Experiences? I am wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and had any luck correcting it? 

I am 39, and have been suffering from random vomiting spells in the mornings for approximately 15 years. I have seen many doctors and specialists without any luck finding a cause. They have performed many tests and everything showed up negative or inconclusive.

It can come in waves but is fairly consistent. For the last two weeks I have thrown up 6 out of the 14 days (43% of the time). Sometimes it’ll be for a few days in a row, sometimes I can go a month without a spell and have experienced it multiple times daily for over a month at a time. The worst was about three times daily for a month and caused me to lose 45 lbs that month due to no appetite.

The majority of the time it happens in the mornings right after I wake up and before I get into the shower. It can happen throughout the day as well at random. It’s fast, uncontrollable, violent, and usually produced a white foamy substance. However, I had my gallbladder removed in November due to gallstones. That didn’t fix the problem and the docs thought it would. 

Ever sense the gallbladder removal all I throw up is yellow stomach bile. Today it went from yellow to a green color. After getting sick I usually have a pain of about a 4 out of 10 right in the middle of my torso. I find myself applying pressure with my hand to relieve the pain. Usually have to lay in the fetal position after a bad spell without an appetite until the end of the day or night. 

Some of the exams that have been done without luck is Celiac Disease, the breath test for H. Pylori, Barium Swallow test, upper Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, ultrasounds of my gallbladder &amp; liver, gallbladder removal, MRI brain scan for tumors.

Again it happens usually in the mornings, with gagging and dry heaving until something comes up. Usually there is no food or liquids other than the white foam and stomach bile. 

If anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and found relief please let me know.

Thanks!",6.50476086090076,7.812564525906737,6.768911917098446,72.97548027102431,65.65803108808291,9.772658429653248,34.5352730171383,9.943994293440598,3.686085213232364,1681,76,275,37,26,542,204,386,0.133,0.7979999999999999,0.07,-0.9821,3,0,1,0,0,0,49.0,0,0,1,3,6,18,2,2,36,0,32,18,7,3,3,50,47,21,0,4,10,0,1,0,0,2,9,0,1,0,14,19,2,0,6,1,0,8,8,11,1,2,12,11,19,7,59,31,5,67,0,2,8,0,1,23,0,13,36,190,33,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699284947128369,0.0,0.1066518210057827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644919248087421,0.2410409199690428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0654745038657916,0.0,0.0,0.06672666771195841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0875387503338586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611106971292884,0.0,0.13509774632315727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20228862669830608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08026261277903507,0.0,0.0802473073642794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19652077617175026,0.0,0.0694537456857969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709322156566756,0.0,0.0,0.07047569583949044,0.07670638608491356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14334252472649744,0.0,0.09482154570885327,0.08597964715614909,0.0,0.0,0.08193877174078412,0.0,0.04456590530128275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20803036172570535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0430956588327036,0.06391991539268374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08018618636571362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08772800778165157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900405051972832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2503652156310521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07358857522198255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16688137420069638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0860777713665302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07503400221201813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13393452881264134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06036885446642356,0.15511185153336565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16300954182728425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07219537962349963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062253943527358885,0.2286264651671945,0.0,0.07432967507135517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07660152827226704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4318234927892614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06290098804308064,0.0,0.07050585290849842,0.07269288314770171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3023628392314349,0.08503935159664333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05570483327354489,0.0,0.0,0.10099531284348708
healthanxiety,lanadelgay69,2018/03/23,"Same illness for two years in a row! Need advice Could be TMI but here it goes:

So, this started in March 2016. I started noticing that just before I peed, I felt a sting every time before I passed urine. This when on for 2-3 weeks, then I got really scared and when to the doctor. They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI. The results came back negative for a UTI. A couple of days later, I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital. And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit. He prescribed another urine test, checked my penis for any issues (I also felt some tightness in my foreskin). He couldn't find any issues. And this urine test came back negative too. I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better. So, I had to fly back home to see another doctor( i was in college btw). Another doctor, another urine test and the result: nothing, nada, zilch!
It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms. I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it. All in all, this went for couple more months, then the sting before peeing, gradually went away.

So now a little over a year later, in June 2017. The same symptoms returned. And the same progression of symptoms occurred: the stinging sensation, and few weeks later the gassiness etc. But it was worse this time around, I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest, my left arm going completely numb and gassiness. So, I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG. I had a fever too. They concluded that nothing was wrong with me. Oh yeah, I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative. Amidst all this chaos, I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time. So obviously I wasn't looking forward to it. And my nightmare came true. I finished that journey with constant gassiness, nausea and uneasiness. So, I guess I'm not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life. So, these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly: 4 months.

So, my concern now is that it gonna be April soon, that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again. What do I do? I feel about 70% just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety.

Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime. The doctors always brushed it off with, ""Your results are fine, don't worry about it.""

healthanxiety,NumeroFrog,2018/03/23,"Health anxiety taking over my life Since I got the flu this year, I’ve been constantly worrying about my health. I wake up in a panic every day. I am constantly worrying that I’m losing my vision or that I have MS, brain tumor, etc. I’ve gotten blood work that all came back perfect. I’m only a teenager but these worries are controlling me all the time. I’ve been on medication for a month and a half and started seeing a therapist a couple of weeks ago but it still isn’t doing the trick. Are there any tips that you guys can give? I’m beginning to feel hopeless.

healthanxiety,potatoechili,2018/03/23,"Waking up with a dead limb and worrying I had a ministroke I woke up to pee in the middle of the night and when I stood up my lower body was involuntarily leaning to the left. It seemed like my left leg or knee had just given out, but I was still able to stand. After a couple minutes it went away and I was walking normally. I ended up going to the ER after speaking with a nurse. All blood tests came back normal and so did the physical tests. The doctor checked my eyes, walking, reflexes, etc. It's the next day and I can't help but feel like they missed something and that I could have possibly had a TIA (ministroke), which can be a warning sign for a stroke. I even told them I was feeling lightheaded the day before but I don't know what is just anxiety now. Still feeling out of it and being hyperaware of my body right now. Has anybody had a similar issue- either with this temporary paralysis situation or not feeling assured even after the doctor?

Has anyone else had that happen or heard of that happen?",8.60923076923077,8.010488512820514,7.899615384615385,73.15788461538463,61.30769230769231,9.851282051282054,40.01282051282049,8.841846274778883,3.6066820512820517,336,16,58,4,4,105,53,78,0.093,0.907,0.0,-0.7003,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,1,6,2,0,1,4,0,4,0,0,0,2,10,13,5,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,6,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,6,3,6,0,11,7,2,22,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,1,14,42,12,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14940374677575669,0.2189312126508497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17849472132737124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1932776724183017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4103153786815152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11163429011950524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.341784471241965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3778971584298044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17417040133173955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21466126107231948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22724155608583926,0.4010315596040551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20445431128167094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18247388542495813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17863854206018315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15555504892412572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,u-s-e-r-n-a-m-e----0,2018/03/23,"Trying to be a supportive girlfriend of hypochondriac boyfriend Hi all! My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years now and I always sorta joked about how he was a hypochondriac, but he’s shared some recent concerns with me and I’ve realized how severe his anxiety is behind it. A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that he’s terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because it’s not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesn’t want it to be confirmed true. 

He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasn’t talked about these types of things with the therapist, which drives me crazy. We’re in our mid-twenties, live in a metropolitan area, and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, going to the gym frequently and eating semi-healthy. 

Im thinking about blocking sites like Mayo Clinic and webMD so he can’t search at home but I don’t know if that’s a mean thing to do.

Anyways, can you please share advice on how I can be the most supportive I can be? Or any advice I can share with him?? Thank you!!

healthanxiety,JitteryChest,2018/03/23,"It happened - my first ER visit for a panic attack I just came back from the ER.  It started with some shoulder pain this afternoon and spiraled into a waves of panic attacks.  I was fairly sure I wasn't having a heart attack, but I couldn't be positive so off to the ER I went.   EKG, blood work, monitoring all normal.  Only thing wrong with me was borderline low electrolytes.

I'm on meds but this has been a stressful year in my life.  Consoling appointments are set up, along with a checkup with my doc.

Even though I know whats happening once my mind goes there its so hard to stop.  I just wanted to share my story.

healthanxiety,helpmehealththrow,2018/03/23,"Struggling tonight I've always had issues with health anxiety and I can get really scared when I think even the slightest thing is wrong with me. I finally got to the doctor for my annual physical and that was a nice victory in itself. Unfortunately my blood work came back with low platelets and elevated liver enzymes. My doctor had me get retested and those numbers came back today -- and they're worse, so now I'm going in for an ultrasound and more testing to rule out hepatitis. I can't stop shaking and crying. I'm so scared! It's probably going to be nothing but I can't stop thinking about all the serious things it could be. I'm taking care of it with my doctor, but I really could just use 100000 hugs right now. And some chocolate. I just wish everything came back fine instead of having these things to worry about until I get it all confirmed that it's okay. Every time I even look at my dog, I think he's looking at me like he knows I'm sick. My anxiety is just spiraling out of control.",4.624155844155844,5.8047474040404055,5.59945165945166,80.10727272727273,69.9090909090909,8.889466089466088,28.78932178932179,9.23628265651192,2.442665512265512,798,29,152,16,14,263,116,198,0.138,0.7340000000000001,0.128,0.3682,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,0,0,2,16,13,0,4,5,1,13,8,2,2,2,36,36,14,0,3,5,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,0,0,13,17,0,3,4,0,0,6,2,7,0,0,7,2,19,6,22,25,4,28,0,1,2,1,2,8,0,1,15,100,32,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09437849752464728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.173539281995271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.261649947762159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3891831713159787,0.1156441155848128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272155277848252,0.1811209037948269,0.0,0.12459178728126732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3482851845950617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14983198585373575,0.0,0.0955652633438771,0.0,0.10193887242991992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12425129481975712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17777928759806008,0.0,0.12892382490491774,0.0,0.0907161526331946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12056522987018885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11838599448075987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06233528900566989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05541361485139543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19049648536316374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10883412891438002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12229108947712206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14532562816625766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09686413652224536,0.0,0.0,0.2271159700569033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18965637834646246,0.0,0.11857620004828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08528131351683894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22606313790271385,0.21803404421653105,0.0,0.0,0.06613889735792547,0.0,0.10751342252956546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09796258636621286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13043289143195208,0.0,0.0,0.08257458573110517,0.11518836289688597,0.1155895339828434,0.0,0.12401218371339205,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,coreygirl10,2018/03/23,"Hypochondriac seeking advice on visiting fiance in the hospital Hello there! I'm looking for advice on how to cope with a special situation. My fiance is admitted into the hospital ICU with the flu and pneumonia. I am flying out there to be with him, but I am so scared of the hospital and getting sick. His entire family has the flu as well. I want to be with him and by his side, but my anxiety is through the roof about it. I'm going to go because he needs my support but does anyone have any advice or coping skills to help me get through this? He might be there for multiple days and that thought is ruining me. I've always had bad experiences in hospitals like passing out, so my anxiety correlates the hospital with passing out, which is a big fear for me. I'm scared that something is going to happen to me while I'm there. I'm also scared of catching the flu myself. By the way, I have panic disorder, if you couldn't tell. I know I have to do this for him but I could really use some advice to help me survive.

healthanxiety,BinaryTsar,2018/03/24,"Post TC anxiety Hi all,

Just venting some steam off here.

So, last August I “found a lump,” I had a CT, an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then I’ve had Chemo, Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first “Scans are normal” meeting with the Onco. Hooray!

That said, the health anxiety I’m experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache, twitch, twinge, anything makes me worry unnecessarily.

As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since, but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen, which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. It’s internal and normally I can’t feel it unless I’ve sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally there’s a spot or two of blood on my crap, and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright, bright red, but otherwise my bms are consistent size, shape, colour and bloodless - they just scratch a little as they pass. I’m improving my diet to include more fibre so hopefully it’ll sort itself out.

Right now I want to concentrate on the future. I’ve been given a new lease of life,  but I feel that all the residual after effects are holding me back and the worry over everything my body does is becoming quite a burden.",6.284775858298707,7.0509719144981435,7.074856767986006,72.52281653181721,65.91449814126395,10.492980537940083,30.693417887601136,10.46071229359064,3.209281478241853,1131,40,206,28,17,376,172,269,0.107,0.8190000000000001,0.07400000000000001,-0.6997,1,0,1,0,0,0,31.0,0,0,2,4,9,6,2,0,24,0,14,16,6,6,2,39,28,20,0,4,7,0,3,0,0,1,8,1,0,0,12,11,2,2,4,0,0,4,1,3,0,3,10,11,19,3,27,17,9,34,0,0,5,0,5,13,2,6,15,129,31,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1229101291079925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2121428366180569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141020283774483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10661786288582857,0.0,0.0,0.15313459746673366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15137638022529254,0.15401549700748265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2848756998426699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407328653603151,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12133875174336385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11682361373648052,0.0,0.12461502266396815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14021722374449958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179406758756552,0.0,0.15202908678483462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14738478555458664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771663908483495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11302310123307613,0.0,0.0,0.15065008980518885,0.0,0.09793679440650452,0.0,0.2779393659708111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1178803259466177,0.0,0.0,0.0925539198830813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339147755772064,0.0,0.0,0.2717067730597997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09395685668928884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13279406714405947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14747766486892713,0.0,0.0,0.08882654877335212,0.0,0.13690601798321958,0.0,0.0,0.11841141931743054,0.13189355546510598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22939526085814554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1067441204789892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11592257851516975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20850402919690614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15081785196380107,0.135446710643108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08178286873713092,0.0,0.11122143537861033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2816236850743849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,jinglesmeowmeow,2018/03/24,"Let’s talk coping strategies I love this sub. Everyone has been super open and supportive. In my short time following, i have felt a sense of belonging here because all of you seem to really understand how it feels to deal with HA. For me it’s an stressful, frustrating, terrifying condition that leaves me paralyzed with fear and exhausted from sleepless nights of searching the internet for reassurance. I definitely get the temptation to post here looking for reassurance from each other that our symptoms are benign but let’s take some time to talk coping. I would love to know what you do to cope when the anxiety takes over. Perhaps we can help each other cope a bit instead of reassuring each other that we are healthy. 

I’ve shared my two tips before, the first is to allow myself a few moments a day to think about my worry. I give it space to exist without doing anything to correct it. I recognize that it’s there and then put it back on an imaginary shelf to visit again tomorrow. The rest of the day I do what I can to keep it there. Sometimes I even say “no, I’ll talk to you later!” (It’s worth noting that this strategy doesn’t always work but sometimes days go by and my anxiety has been kept at a manageable level.)

The other one is for full on panic attacks: I pick out 3 things I can hear, smell, see, and if possible, taste. Sometimes doing this mindful activity can give my brain/body the space to rest for a moment.... long enough to calm down a bit. 

Anything work for you?

healthanxiety,JinxMiss,2018/03/24,What's going on? Hey guys so earlier I had shortness of breath. And now my heart is beating hard. My body and hands are trembling. And I have a strong urge to pee as my groin feels really strange. I have pain in my left arm as well and I  feel like my hearts about stop any moment. I have no history do any heart problems. I have had anxiety attacks in the past but they always scare me into thinking I'm having a heart attack or cardiac arrest. Is this just another anxiety attack? I don't know if it's because I'm anemic or because I slept late at 1 am last night. I feel like I'm about to die any moment now and I'm scared :(. I'm 20 years old btw. ,0.025620503597124863,2.155514525179857,2.2297796762589925,94.54956160071943,87.20143884892086,5.201618705035972,19.47886690647482,6.6274283507984215,0.13057158273381295,505,15,114,6,16,170,90,139,0.292,0.6509999999999999,0.057,-0.9858,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,1,2,7,12,3,3,3,0,13,11,10,0,0,18,25,12,1,2,5,0,5,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,3,6,0,1,5,0,0,1,2,8,1,0,3,5,16,4,12,22,0,19,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,3,13,62,19,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10037174807034696,0.0,0.0,0.246092521255244,0.12648845750796384,0.18455942348721274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4116936065035273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14706681578920958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1339899653881506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12519230636431533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18297867410805374,0.17235262845211832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06855539139221051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11944019574375875,0.0,0.0,0.10805855151495433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5717767005546421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06629372249050063,0.09832751714293762,0.13607308067517945,0.0,0.13106213797263752,0.0,0.0,0.1178650123790956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1132007426357146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12657827557717433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12835617101297145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11515260354619425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11542423192334053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772770690413841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2415383538326693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10084999616758136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729323497351834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845861447012066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07768015878906327

I've been to a cardiologist for other unrelated things because of an abnormal EKG but it was an abnormality that was no cause for concern.

I don't know if its hormonal or what is going on but its pretty scary. The pain is sometimes a dull achey on the left side and sometimes pokey feelings on the opposite side. The pains come and go..

healthanxiety,dc_bs,2018/03/25,"Reassurance Hello,

I stumbled upon this subreddit about two weeks ago and since then have been reading it often to help cope with my health anxiety. I often end up laughing at myself over my anxiety. This is my first post and rather lengthy. I apologize. 

My most recent concern is that I have some sort of colon cancer. I have been having unusual bowel movements for several months. Changes in appearance, size, etc. Sorry, too much information. I mentioned it to my doctor earlier this month and he shrugged it off and said to try Miralax. I did, but didn’t notice much difference aside from change in color and more loose. 

I’ve recently thought I’ve noticed some red streaking in the stool which has elevated my anxiety about the situation. My employment offers a telemedicine service so I called and spoke to a doctor about my concerns and he said it’s likely IBS and promised I was fine. I follow up with my doctor again this past week and he said the risk is slim for anything major but referred me to a gastro doctor. The appointment isn’t until next month. 

This weekend, I decided it would be a good idea to get an EZ Detect test which tests for blood in the stool. These are little pieces of paper you put in the toilet after a bowel movement that changes to blue or green if blood is detected. You are first supposed to put a paper in to test the water color. I decided to skip that step and test my first bowel movement yesterday late afternoon/early evening. There was no color change on the paper. I was satisfied. 

This morning I decide to do the water test to eliminate any what ifs from my mind. Once again, there was no color change. I follow the water test with another bowel movement. There was no color change. 

There is a control test you are supposed to do at the end to verify that the paper worked properly. It comes with a powder that changes the color of the paper. I flush everything and pour the powder in and then place the paper in for the control test and it instantly turns blue. 

About an hour or two later I feel another bowel movement coming on and I decide to use my final test. The paper instantly turns a very faint blue and I immediately freak out. About 5-10 minutes later I realized that I had put the powder in the toilet and that it’s possible there was some left over in the water even after flushing. I have noticed some little white specks in that toilet throughout the day today. 

I just am looking for some reassurance that there was likely a little bit of left over powder and that my health anxiety is getting the best of me, as usual.",4.753051774037947,6.530473018329937,5.43088058741559,79.1396835137743,70.34419551934826,8.101211276664165,27.78866973952192,8.6894789155246,2.234911201629328,2056,73,360,36,38,665,221,491,0.059,0.873,0.068,0.8027,6,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,0,3,0,7,21,11,0,1,35,0,33,20,8,3,0,57,50,28,0,4,8,0,1,2,0,1,8,4,0,0,28,24,4,2,10,2,0,14,5,2,0,5,17,18,42,9,63,31,14,76,0,0,13,0,19,29,0,14,34,262,70,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060999983755230615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046796282299193234,0.14431619949131766,0.2105718980429989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056628545816169065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07221666875989191,0.0,0.07512771161891163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07026739234403355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5095769967777123,0.11855535546046565,0.0,0.0,0.15436283265780995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04437971893783595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189660217962733,0.0,0.28173860326116024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12189860648221658,0.0,0.07674646037339199,0.09090277799360913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061846118080966565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034794725352142744,0.0,0.0,0.07538302188322257,0.0,0.17560097035228128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07190556818383789,0.0,0.0,0.0577184148664797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14629338671833364,0.0,0.0,0.04612497045473707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06776851145617276,0.0,0.0,0.0776832982043053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07762585710589819,0.0,0.14953451106973045,0.0,0.0,0.06723866736408428,0.2069108982172904,0.0,0.0,0.057786925865198124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06948312106456937,0.0,0.1647814523663949,0.0,0.10117328602722037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07318509925507535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23503760720724726,0.0,0.07328529459319465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.065691314578134,0.0,0.0,0.07189660217962733,0.0,0.0,0.0775781128748185,0.0659053570065112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20753301497271345,0.0,0.0,0.06883321418572043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13589221545169858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1963753060674613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07774090164234908,0.0,0.05692414159608849,0.07735048460371025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0770323017877953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054631099367470966,0.0,0.0,0.06522818691783698,0.0,0.0,0.046720590845853116,0.14970103093305426,0.1344437144260023,0.0,0.0,0.05943371296447099,0.07578955101345806,0.05677924523044396,0.0,0.0,0.11039782970803964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05009784253915196,0.0,0.0,0.048883911755373766,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,leafingbikinibottom,2018/03/25,"I fainted in a bar. Should I be worried?? I had a cold this past week and was getting better but feeling dehydrated 
Decided to go out drinking and ended up smoking some weed and having 5 beers
Was standing at the bar for about an hour and we ordered some bar snacks, about 5 minutes into eating I felt very lightheaded and nauseous, started seeing black circles, tried to make my way outside to get some air, and dropped to the floor at that moment 
I came to a few minutes later, sat at a table sipping water, and felt pretty much fine other than being kinda tired and still lightheaded

Could this have been just a routine fainting spell? I’m attributing it to dehydration, since I️ was sick, drank a lot of coffee during the day, and then drank alcohol, without really drinking any water. I also read that prolonged standing can reduce blood flow to the brain. I plan on getting checked out by a doctor this week. Should I be worried? 

TLDR: Was dehydrated, fainted in a bar while standing for awhile, felt fine after",5.907587044534413,7.179643200000001,6.133157894736844,77.12248987854255,67.0,7.740890688259107,33.036437246963565,7.882392219407189,2.5682712550607287,808,35,134,9,13,258,123,190,0.065,0.863,0.071,-0.4254,0,0,4,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,0,2,5,3,0,0,13,0,15,22,2,2,0,32,31,13,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,2,7,0,0,0,7,14,14,0,5,8,1,3,1,0,0,0,13,7,10,3,26,12,6,34,0,0,2,0,1,12,0,5,13,92,17,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612969569182438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12069768445489915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263674054135667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13348423375465088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16848642471549913,0.0,0.1726223073066194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12050434327158528,0.0,0.0,0.09733657192677313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15448199356158285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29570547479091136,0.0,0.1544378131851496,0.0,0.0,0.13367809397632316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0763141220352286,0.0,0.4347458697923437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23656216207448494,0.0,0.08577629929357551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486344381532435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12831424470698233,0.0,0.0,0.10074612730411174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11095001352138717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14407859083910216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15354882101677833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15096961548864782,0.0,0.09668883610774946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12027069048552325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12484983986939295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10682816166150053,0.0,0.12053191229738396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1734704209170845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10247072897642084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453204345575992,0.0,0.11980023407297476,0.24213191406164936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14548995032097053,0.0,0.0,0.3065509884853996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,BundleOfIssues,2018/03/25,"Sharp, stabbing pain in head (on top of head) in the same spot every time, can't stop thinking it's a tumor For the past 4 months or so, I've been getting this off-and-on stabbing pain in the top of my head. It stabs for a second and then goes away, and it keeps happening, and it only seems to happen when I open my mouth or talk, or smile. I had a big episode where I thought I was dying of an aneurysm, and went to the doctor and all that and figured out that it was not the case, so I've been through all that, but I still can't help this nagging feeling of ""WTF IS IT THEN??""

Initially I theorized that it must be my headphones causing it (headband is too tight), because the pain seems to be coming from muscles on the outside of skull, as shown by how when I massage it the pain temporarily suppresses. So I switched to in-ear buds exclusively, and the pain went away for awhile. I thought I had won... but now it's back! AGH. Why? And now that I've ruled out headphones as the cause, I am freaking out again. Constantly thinking it must be something fatal. Even though I have already shown myself that it is muscle-tension related (massaging it, the fact that it only happens when I open my mouth etc.) and multiple doctors have assured me that what I am experiencing is not life-threatening. I just can't stop, I want the pain to leave me alone. :( ",4.324857026143789,4.960785562500004,4.836421568627454,87.30236928104576,70.21323529411765,7.809150326797385,30.18464052287581,7.793537801064563,1.7553277777777776,1051,41,225,12,18,335,140,272,0.2,0.753,0.046,-0.9936,0,1,1,0,0,0,47.0,0,0,0,3,17,11,1,0,16,0,22,14,6,3,6,47,39,26,2,3,8,0,3,0,1,2,8,0,0,0,25,15,0,5,8,0,0,3,5,9,0,1,11,4,23,2,28,23,4,35,0,0,0,0,3,16,0,5,16,154,48,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197292101647873,0.10865098598640507,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18500929339776626,0.07570821839086307,0.0,0.060019157339762465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2022872257440972,0.0,0.08481295405872594,0.0,0.1063982520355621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10218398614378504,0.0,0.0,0.201552119869664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10980683230271948,0.06503066102613543,0.0,0.08295521428189208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04978338483850856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051440305056283074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26119857646860045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3031393151429174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06599440379464308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08751410274576052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10425293500882593,0.0,0.0,0.06954388334878392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0785883336663021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14976367700721047,0.6285983019798729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939894182550108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17926515295181608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07579787257429707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07862878344393512,0.16463079737504227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07913690896762024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12617597807581554,0.09673460500418726,0.15632950204012006,0.057411722740219925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05807315134061813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18254333107984813,0.0888431409590191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,sugar_root,2018/03/25,"fear of rabies hi, i'm new to this subreddit but i've been lurking it for a while so i figured i'd give this a shot instead of other forums. i've been a hypochondriac since i was little but it's been kind of getting worse with age. now something new and exciting has hit me super hard and super fast; rabies!

it comes and goes and my ocd (a whole other animal) makes it worse, but right now it's at one of its peaks. long story short, my (HEALTHY, VACCINATED) dog scratched me and since then the spot on my wrist where it's at has had an internal tickling sensation and, to make matters worse, when i get nervous my throat gets tight and i feel like i can't swallow. i feel like i'm fully going crazy.

i love all my dogs but due to all of this i can't even bear to be around them anymore. i just sit around and cry all day on the lookout for symptoms and trying to come down from all this anxiety and it's almost like i can't trust myself to ""know"" that i didn't contract anything. like 'i KNOW it's all in my head but HOW DO I /REALLY/ KNOW?' or 'WHAT IF ITS REAL THIS TIME' or something.

i'm starting to feel hopeless and like i'll never calm down again. i feel really dumb and embarrassed because i definitely know better but i just... like won't listen to my better judgement. my family and friends are sick of me being such a mess and that makes me feel bad too.

sorry if this is long or rant-y or hard to follow; this has really gotten under my skin (pun kind of intended). can anyone relate or offer some advice? if you've had the same problem, what did you do? i'm kind of super at the end of the rope with this lmao",1.231632798573976,3.1867001882352968,3.039358288770053,91.6227183600713,80.94117647058823,5.885918003565062,20.303030303030305,6.980632752743323,0.3438725490196082,1264,34,276,15,33,421,177,340,0.16899999999999998,0.657,0.174,0.8462,0,0,2,0,1,1,39.0,0,1,1,5,15,27,1,3,11,0,22,8,4,5,6,64,51,33,0,4,16,0,10,6,1,1,2,1,0,0,24,20,1,1,10,0,0,4,6,8,0,1,9,11,32,19,34,38,8,38,0,1,0,1,8,15,1,10,24,176,56,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09775730573265702,0.0,0.0,0.10017496936064886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07652983732605663,0.0,0.09921216470895504,0.06994984722467762,0.0,0.08232387017640128,0.17811248168775987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08352868776717508,0.060983065918544924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17695337033979092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17235010277904295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10988854054447303,0.06451711177899262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08860518056832124,0.0,0.0,0.06607505443026371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09430820625204817,0.1125720936947052,0.2529145337770142,0.1429362789386127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07729016213087386,0.0,0.1567993114111481,0.09596687073250544,0.05685467425003654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17923123540103025,0.0,0.10266924571662804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125267999513136,0.21991606614606785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29324507153429,0.10026572098000784,0.0,0.1770633728154405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09028942907730683,0.0,0.2003311508074233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07715652241485202,0.19323727642862426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06778926003563067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572415784220636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11386669419284084,0.19226332888435765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08543306766681659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16550718635340358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15403037511896267,0.0,0.11198587426832914,0.07080837459782742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10397920044015344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05833375587971746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06792015934586419,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1116903739169772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30584596630552235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,dreamsooz,2018/03/26,"Worried about a brain tumour Hello !

Since a week and a half, i've had burning at the back of my head. I know rationally that it's probably not a tumour but I can't help but freak out about it. It comes and goes. I went to the doctor last friday, he did a neurological exam and nothing came out of it that is unusual. He gave me some anti inflammatory medicine. Before I took the medicine, my right ear hurted a lot too. It stopped today. 

Could this be a sign of a tumour or something else?

healthanxiety,Sexstarvedpeepingtom,2018/03/26,"Nervous wreck (ulcer/appendicitis) Google brought me heregarding ironically, as it is causing me to be a nervous wreck.

Last month, I got hit with bronchitis hard. Couldn't breathe, chest was heavy, fever, hacking, the whole works. Around that time my stomach would be hurting after exercise or drinking a lot of wine or taking ibuprofen but I didn't think much of it, it always went away after awhile, and was t that bad. 
After the antibiotics, my chest was better, but my throat was still swollen. I ended up getting a raw piece  potato stuck in my throat (didn't chew it well enough) and had to get an endoscopy to push it down. Since then, I've had some of the worst acid reflux from my esaughagus being swollen, but nexium and tums seemed to help...until this morning. 

I drank a couple cups of coffee, to my multivitamin, and about and hour afterwards my stomach began hurting again. It felt like a knife stabbing me 1000 time in my upper abdomen. I planned on walking to the e.r., but I had to stop and rest at the police station, where they seen me sweating pofusely, breathing hard, and pale and called an ambulance. I'm there for three hours. My white cell count came back fine, as did my hemoglobin and everything else. She said before I left ""you may have an ulcer brewing down there but only your GI can go and look for sure"". I was released with a antacid and zophran.

Well like a dumbass, I sat down and Google my symptoms of an ulcer. Started reading about puforated abdomen and began freaking out . I tried to smoke some green to calm down, as it worked before, and had some vague pain in my lower right side. Since I am my own biggest asshole, I absent/stoner mindly put ""lower right abdomen pain"" thinking it was gonna say ulcer and reinforce what I believe without solid proof....aaaand guess what it says first? Appendicitis. I still have my appendix (not my galbladder), and boy, THAT was a dumb idea to google. I shut down my home screen and put in some gtaV and tried to veg out on that. It worked temporarly.

 I have to call my GI in the morning, and I keep telling myself I'm probably just tripping out and blood tests dont lie, but there's that though in the back of your head that keeps your heart racing. Mostly because I have never had appendicitis or an ulcer, no does anyone I know have had besides my dad, which I was 7 and remember my brother going when I was being a whiny as ""sexstarvedpeepingtom, dad has an ulcer. If it start's bleeding because your stressing him out he can die"". He did die, cancer 6 years later. 

Google is an amazing tool, but I think I should stay off it.

healthanxiety,HokutoSilver,2018/03/26,"Anxiety -&gt; ... -&gt; tender neck muscle To start, I've been going through a lot of health anxiety the last few months. I've never actually felt sick or anything, but this basically stems from getting fixated on swallowing/hyperawareness for months on end. 

It started out as if it might be tmj pain, but recently it was tongue pain, mostly when swallowing, for a few weeks. After I finally went to a dentist, assuming I must be scraping it on sharp teeth or something, they weren't able to find anything wrong. That has since eased off, I assume because my anxiety about it relaxed, but now it's more focused on a tender spot that seems to be on my scm muscle...which I saw can be a cause of swallowing pain.

The upper front end, just below the corner of my jaw, spanning about a half-inch. It feels as if it's bruised or something, and it seems to be super tender to the touch. I don't feel any strange lumps/lymph nodes, and my salivary gland above it feels fine, it seems to be part of the muscle or a tendon in there. Pretty close to the surface. I've read that trigger points in the digastric might be involved, causing ""pseudo-scm pain"" but it's been driving me crazy. I've also been feeling a lot of tension around the upper shoulders. 

So I wanted to just see if this all sounds like a reasonable idea of what's happening, and if anyone's got some advice. It's super irritating and it's really hard to take my mind off the tenderness. I'm going to try and get a massage next week I think.

healthanxiety,Grillskillz,2018/03/27,"Anxiety over oral cancer A little over a week ago I noticed that I was having some pain in my mouth when eating so I looked to see that I have what looks like a bit of red bump/lump in the upper back corner. I've been brushing and rinsing it out with mouth wash for almost a week and while it feels like it's gotten somewhat better it still hasn't gone away and still have this kinda heavy like feeling on the side of my mouth.

I'm starting to now have anxiety it could be something more serious like oral cancer. I do brush and rinse regularly and smoked smoked socially, but quit earlier this year. I'm only in my early twenties so the chance of it being something serious isn't likely, but it's still freaking me out. I would go to a dentist, but I am at college in a really small town and there isn't one here as far as I know and I don't know if a regular doctor would be able to do much.

healthanxiety,thetimeisnowoldman,2018/03/27,"Blotchy skin below knee Hey y’all-new to the group and I’m glad I found you!  I have a question.  I am freaking out over this rash under my knee.  I don’t even know if it’s a rash, but it’s not bumpy, just flat, and blotchy looking.  It doesn’t itch. I’ve noticed some pink dots too, these don’t hurt either.  I recently shaved, I do sit by a small heater a lot (which is by my legs constantly) and I do wear tight pants at times.  I googled my symptoms and of course the worse is coming up, I was just seeing if anyone has experienced what I have.  I’m also wondering too if it is a heat rash, but I thought heat rashes hurt and this has been on my skin for 2 days now.

healthanxiety,vompire,2018/03/27,"worried i have something seriously wrong to start off i’m pretty sure i’m suffering from depersonalization/derealization. after i smoked weed (even though i had smoked many times before) about a month ago i just had that unreal feeling. apparently this is very common. smoking weed, having a panic attack, and then BAM depersonalized. 
i have anxiety and depression, so even though what this is is most likely just depersonalization i cant help but think it’s something worse. like a brain tumor or something.
i am nearsighted so i do have blurred vision (bit with things close up like looking at my hands or something close to me) but recently i’ve noticed sort of vertical doubled vision? if i look at something i can see a little bit of a ghost image above it it’s sort of hard to explain. it’s only for far away objects and it’s worse when looking at letters like on a tv or poster. i read somewhere that this could be just from being nearsighted and it isn’t double vision. i also read on a forum where somebody thought they had a brain tumor to do the “pinhole test” where you make a small circle with your fingers and put it close to your eye and if the double vision goes away it’s an ocular problem and not neurological, which made me feel better.
i’ve had no headaches but bad memory and trouble focusing as well as the not feeling real feeling.
i kinda just need reassurance because health anxiety is a hard ass thing to deal with i’ve been terrified for a month of a serious medical issue!",5.5481118881118885,6.883094615384621,6.407979020979023,74.5904300699301,67.88111888111888,8.936783216783217,30.73356643356643,9.255337874911486,2.7795963636363643,1204,47,212,23,20,398,162,286,0.214,0.6659999999999999,0.12,-0.9825,1,0,7,0,0,0,22.0,0,3,1,1,16,18,1,1,16,0,22,9,6,2,1,47,39,25,1,5,14,0,8,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,17,14,0,0,7,3,0,1,5,10,1,0,7,13,20,8,30,29,6,28,0,2,5,1,9,17,1,10,14,144,37,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003665562633308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08122637551504333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15540323375131312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555179456843348,0.19085879225422286,0.0,0.08480762957014125,0.061916802510859965,0.0,0.08642952880353616,0.0,0.0,0.08983138777898067,0.22177867870157889,0.0,0.0,0.2267738882470783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0810962619703693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10471534869381396,0.08748304341088646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13417351307057987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2054296090775655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18197551794010933,0.0,0.0,0.10796533432879092,0.0,0.0,0.06808097027160019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060138440222228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1984900442769218,0.10180093032417124,0.0,0.0,0.2558824391514601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09610903489704713,0.06779950091874344,0.10297715767552776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10232220188982118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16214617302033754,0.0,0.0,0.07531368693112826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11563937560088106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07724940188732388,0.0,0.11917180633013127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10333432867522394,0.0,0.0971898294610324,0.0,0.10210701407818316,0.0,0.0,0.20319718202423004,0.1156101535845975,0.0,0.0,0.10028921199405152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08093901977449353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3909719925222009,0.0,0.0,0.07189255049827582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09572956387945268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1349586570376925,0.06508266245650182,0.1995861887931669,0.08063611131396717,0.059226927805589774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380679854030677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09132462108070848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.103150386926135,0.20701926575022556,0.0,0.11105205779374044,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Polka-Pirate,2018/03/27,"Hello everybody, new member here! I'm so glad I found out this sub exists. So, I haven't always had health anxiety, more generalised anxiety, but for the last 6 months I've had obsessive worrying thoughts about getting just one particular neurological disease, I'm almost afraid to say what it's called as that can be a bit of a trigger for me, let's just say it follows me everywhere, everyday and nothing I do can reassure me I'm not in danger f developing this disease. I'm also on the autistic spectrum with OCD traits so this is definitely a big factor in my anxiety. 

I'm just posting this to introduce myself and say it's good not to feel alone for once :)",7.021791208791214,6.53250537692308,8.263626373626376,68.89423076923079,64.46153846153845,12.043956043956046,37.802197802197796,11.491704259439757,4.517142857142859,529,25,97,15,7,183,88,130,0.095,0.753,0.151,0.8895,0,1,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,0,9,6,1,2,5,0,9,2,0,1,0,15,19,8,0,0,6,0,1,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,9,4,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,3,0,1,4,4,8,3,14,13,2,11,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,1,4,60,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18744776509018224,0.1938765439381485,0.0,0.14969898551498995,0.15576041560442333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4296087254443339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2043673806689338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1911460180316679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09465091812436298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052485744834544,0.0,0.0,0.09780114626533636,0.0,0.0,0.15700945774123648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989784834953446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1525881060156581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19141856228995102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14941647618997306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18079314538272373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17961770526408444,0.0,0.0,0.19935551575874472,0.12684750863310745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1792801203874441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4465925805001535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14861113749115987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1901046080218276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Portucaelis,2018/03/27,"Sick, afraid of pneumonia For the past few days I've been sick, a cold probably, and until this morning it didn't really affect my chest. However this morning I woke up and it seemed to have moved mostly out of my head and into my chest. I just have a pretty minor cough going on. However I've also been experiencing some mild chest pains and also this feeling of an obstruction when I breath in, but I can still get a deep breath. Occasionally it might feel like I can't. Also it feels like there might be some chest tightness or pressure. Throughout the course of this cold I've been afraid of it turning into pneumonia, so obviously this is making me pretty anxious. Could this be pneumonia? Is pneumonia more obvious than that? At what point should I go to the doctor?

healthanxiety,electricbowels,2018/03/27,"Hemorrhoids or Colon Cancer? Help? Help, freaking out a bit here.

Never considered the possibility of cancer.

Here's the symptoms:
- I'm young, 23, so I know I have the odds in my favor here as far as likelihood goes
- Itchy butt (it seems to start near my colon, but itches all the way up my crack and on my cheeks; this is why I initially thought it was a yeast infection); comes and goes depending on carb intake &amp; stress
- Just recently, I had some bad diarrhea and have been obnoxiously gassy since (for about the last week); farting is basically incessant
- Stools have normalized for the most part since, I'll have some hearty ones (the type you're proud of), sometimes some thinner ones, no additional diarrhea
- During the aforementioned diarrhea episode, there was some blood when I wiped (bright red, I seemed to come directly in contact with the ""source"" while wiping so not sure if that's a hemorrhoid or a polyp?); no blood in stool though
- Also, the itchy butt started after having sex w a girl I dated a few months ago (did an STD screening, negative)

What worries me is just the combo of the incessant gas + itchy burning butt + blood

Is a colonoscopy in order? Or does this sound like something less serious.

healthanxiety,Weaslenut,2018/03/27,"It’s either side effects from my meds or leukemia... I am a cancer survivor, it will be four years since my initial diagnosis in a few weeks. I know the chemo I received is known to cause leukemia, and around New Years I started to have non-specific symptoms, abdominal pain that feels like when the cancer first spread to my lymph nodes, difficultly breathing, my joints ache significantly more than normal, my pulse races (120 at the moment, I’m laying in bed), and now I feel like I have a fever, get chilled easily (normally I can’t stop sweating), and it has felt like I do the night before I wake up sick for three months, and the strangest one, I randomly start bleeding, it’s happened 3 times, and when it stops there is no wound or scab, it’s as if it just comes through my skin. I saw my general practitioner a month ago, he basically said it’s all caused by my weight, I am heavy but not so much so that it could cause all of these problems. There is a possibility it is caused by my med though, I started a new antidepressant in October and it was upped in late November, all of these except the bleeding are on the list of side effects, albeit in the 0.1-1% incidence range. I see my psychiatrist Friday, and my oncologist next week, I hope I just have to change antidepressants again, it’s tearing me up waiting.

TL:DR I might have leukemia or my problems could be caused by a med, the wait is killing me",9.019681107099876,6.521748173285201,8.535243682310469,74.98303399518653,61.85198555956679,11.977015643802648,38.24578820697954,10.317481424215053,3.5513925391095063,1112,42,231,19,12,355,165,277,0.116,0.8370000000000001,0.047,-0.9552,0,0,0,0,0,0,41.0,0,0,0,3,12,9,1,0,16,0,22,16,4,7,3,48,39,18,1,8,10,0,5,3,0,2,11,2,1,0,16,9,1,4,7,0,0,2,3,5,0,4,4,9,31,4,27,29,7,39,0,0,2,0,3,13,0,7,27,148,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09150265726726092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09189205765059108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08783679821141438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5302021020491277,0.10919827097127928,0.08891912251507017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648333873156529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10438723529438934,0.1474877971507215,0.09911210444625143,0.0,0.0,0.08780305838778442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05393075666654746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09128144978769648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10252563004881986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142030723505366,0.0,0.05672971269922635,0.0,0.11644219818713165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512914354111349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.343978824336117,0.0,0.0,0.10950532034798603,0.0,0.0,0.16478628169679166,0.0,0.07588218837154595,0.0,0.0,0.19939052869917565,0.10978086618971293,0.09686958833822244,0.20227699631362275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06994787262809969,0.0,0.10983858548269082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11637057974161692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19754460209948999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09819053066716918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225689120118161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08538871484950653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21918937445702966,0.0,0.0,0.1726012989879931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10729020886991064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014179530624341,0.0,0.06019127696700749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1656015977866222,0.1257001352558372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329469194059905
healthanxiety,Miracow,2018/03/27,Just the mention of a terminal illness has become a huge trigger for me Basically anytime something that has anything remotely to do with like cancer or ALS or something like that sends me into a spiral of panicking. Today like 3/10 top posts on my Reddit feed had to do with cancer and it just made me feel so anxious. I couldn't help but feel that these illnesses were just waiting to happen for me and anytime I start to feel better cancer or some shit gets brought up. Does anyone else have something similar where just a word can trigger them and have any advice?,7.543888888888887,7.4903819074074125,7.272592592592595,74.98166666666667,63.25925925925928,9.422222222222222,35.592592592592595,8.841846274778883,3.129692592592592,458,19,78,6,6,145,73,108,0.222,0.6809999999999999,0.096,-0.9579,0,0,3,0,0,0,5.0,0,0,1,2,6,5,1,0,5,0,10,7,1,3,0,24,19,8,0,1,8,0,3,3,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,6,1,1,3,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,4,3,8,4,13,14,1,11,0,0,0,0,4,6,1,4,5,55,13,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1997669286388032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13901961801765844,0.0,0.0,0.230948056547946,0.0,0.14294242291253412,0.2094630065366592,0.16822872291278174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22577721125493305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18080199244513248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1788983380566408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17077528839974304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3100983148548712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10680639712304853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18077704409513276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1370253246336168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.299622963418588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19343689807084108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1957877230029564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20984477094959164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4721413104215506,0.0,0.0,0.14469682249629007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19377602629468824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Recently, about a week ago, I cleaned up the room. I swept it up. Idk if I swept up any mouse droppings but I'm so goddamn freaked out. Right now, I'm having bad hip pain. Its sharp and generally pinching. Having the same pain in my thighs, back and shoulders, but less frequently. I'm so fucking scared. It's said those are the early signs.

healthanxiety,Krankenschwester1,2018/03/28,"Physical with Family Friend :/ Hey guys! So, this is pretty awkward, but I don't know where else to turn.

I'm a 23 year old man with severe insecurity about my body. Long story short, I was recently accepted into a Nursing Program at a local college. Part of the admissions process involves a physical exam. 

I enlisted in the Army at 18 and had a physical at MEPS, but the doctor was an old man, so it didn't matter much. This time, however, the physical will be at a local clinic due to my lack of insurance. 

The doctor and the practitioners that work in his practice are all old family friends. (Like, since I was about 6) I'm extremely nervous because I'm afraid the physical will make things weird around these people. 

I know logically that they're all skilled medical care providers and can surely separate personal and professional lives well, but I'm still a little embarrassed. Does anyone have some advice? 😅",4.7566165413533845,6.843578801169594,6.0109983291562274,73.72171052631579,70.9298245614035,10.031913116123643,30.927736006683375,10.290406445055957,3.6934858813700933,729,32,125,22,14,244,115,171,0.126,0.753,0.121,0.4053,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,0,0,2,8,13,0,5,15,0,13,5,1,1,3,22,22,9,0,1,3,0,0,1,2,2,4,0,0,4,7,8,0,0,4,0,0,0,2,6,1,0,5,0,8,7,16,14,6,22,0,0,0,0,9,13,0,1,10,77,15,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14564952684433366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10421893355950214,0.0,0.0,0.1326857286443504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09085924197669128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1655604851756599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.151965982847015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3051171266281788,0.1304342939481231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12451180043469788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28102136234632297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303106751912657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14758252007550152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16382750496028514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07281809715447515,0.14938683825208562,0.13161351193626972,0.13190419006922138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09949175361235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1501517734134362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1095685928972303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4692073915359479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16140617291698864,0.0,0.10333221331380284,0.1301443462038361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516370095492956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14716848110205585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16838360278665726,0.0,0.12329535476169155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11903118900558753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14047746744223005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09902191957091327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08691201009742462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621231449395293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13401347467428334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10850987112793883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09598304425546897

I'm so scared of my bloodwork coming back all messed up. I mean, even something like high cholesterol is going to freak me out. My new doctor has a patient care portal so I can log in to look at my results when they come in and even though it's probably a bad idea I don't think I'll be able to stop myself from checking.

It was really bad when I was about 10 and went away for a few years. However, it came back with vengeance about two years ago in the form of relationship OCD. That faded and morphed into Contamination OCD. It’s been ruling my life for two years and I’m honestly sick and tired of it. I do everything in my power to keep myself and the things around me germ free. I know it’s an irrational fear because 99% of people don’t live like me and are doing just fine. I don’t even know what I’m truly Afraid of. Getting sick doesn’t really scare me (this part confuses me too, you’re not alone). I just can’t shake the anxiety I get when I know I have come in contact with germs... I am currently on Zoloft even though it doesn’t seem to help. Any advise on how to kick this thing in the Ass would be greatly appreciated.. thank you ",2.7113058419244,3.9761152164948506,4.112762886597938,88.6117903780069,74.67010309278348,7.853745704467355,22.21168384879725,8.447377352677275,1.0063193127147767,728,18,165,13,15,241,117,194,0.16699999999999998,0.726,0.108,-0.9055,3,1,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,1,0,1,13,13,0,6,7,0,18,6,1,1,0,27,32,13,0,1,3,0,0,1,0,1,5,0,0,0,12,15,0,1,5,0,1,4,6,7,0,2,6,0,18,7,28,24,3,24,0,0,0,1,7,9,1,2,12,106,30,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287619030312172,0.0,0.0,0.1504428383346049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09877999948013932,0.0,0.11112149810444437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12930986454289467,0.0,0.0,0.13647409007996245,0.1116939590083626,0.12128384488577272,0.08854755061087195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16613574569953815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12512637089286924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1918822590551543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305479668839384,0.0,0.0,0.1634549364428145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15178197153368914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16014677424117232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19472591982457196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1291114335074393,0.0,0.0,0.2394889716994091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259958325711792,0.0709654186288214,0.0,0.12826492776861526,0.12854821030684746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15729958729944776,0.0,0.10070317767437058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861111942971396,0.0,0.0,0.15595206505097148,0.1645482952932988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14542797772353902,0.0,0.0,0.13223686325607995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15185455232269804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13373347954914114,0.0,0.0,0.19300509764412266,0.0,0.14271463832692455,0.0,0.0,0.16695199007322895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28379070705233045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13465504652096785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10318667510615996,0.0,0.0,0.3741639610498631
healthanxiety,JayWright91,2018/03/28,"Colon Cancer Fears Creeping In again Hi.

So.. it’s been a long time since I posted In here but today I had a bowel movement that was very dodgy. So my colon cancer fears have come back. Last year it sent me to the Dr. Multiple times. I don’t have any other symptoms. No blood, no weight loss (if anything I’ve put a little on) no fatigue etc. - Just dodgy bowel movements. 1-2 times per day. 

I’m unsure as sometimes I’ll have these weird flat bowel movements then I’ll have normal ones. 

Just don’t wanna be consumed by this fear again?

healthanxiety,rollsteelertide,2018/03/28,"Fluttering Having an episode now and just need to vent. Open to advice or anything you have. A few months ago I started feeling a funny feeling in my chest. Specifically, it seems to occur when I lay down after light exertion. Like walking up the stairs and plopping on the couch. My heart flutters like crazy. It will beat hard one time, not beat for like two seconds, and then beat really fast. I get this funny feeling in the back of my throat, too. So, I went to my PCP and she listened and said she heard a murmur AND a flutter. Great. So, I’m dying. Well, she sends me to a cardiologist. I get an EKG and a halter monitor for 24 hours. Nothing shows. Cardio says it’s fine. Not a single thing to worry about. But, I still get these things. It fucks with my head cuz I just keep thinking “a healthy heart doesn’t do this” and “I will probably die young because of this.” I know these things are common, but that serves  little comfort when they are happening. I just worry that my heart is wearing out or something. Can anyone provide me with literature that goes into detail about how chronic palpitations are not associated with lower life expectancy? Or, if they are hit me with that shit too. I’m not afraid of the truth haha. I just get into this habit of checking my carotid pulse when it happens and being like “ooohhh fuck you’re surely gonna die this time... this is a bad one...” ",1.8520609318996435,4.430428055555558,2.8845519713261645,89.89467741935486,83.25925925925927,5.261648745519714,21.6726403823178,6.6834051587181325,0.5307765830346476,1085,35,214,12,31,345,161,270,0.114,0.7490000000000001,0.13699999999999998,-0.3347,1,0,1,0,1,0,39.0,0,1,2,3,18,16,3,1,15,1,14,13,8,2,2,44,39,23,3,3,14,0,4,4,0,3,3,4,1,0,20,17,0,1,6,1,1,3,5,5,1,4,3,9,27,11,27,31,2,31,0,0,0,2,11,11,3,5,21,146,47,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11312577120807132,0.10262009643661907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08094669092884937,0.0,0.09526603902123944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08901736130792565,0.09666026647155472,0.07057023831584007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3604423274426106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17560519780383002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21404869269485646,0.24193305922717084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276330733684343,0.0,0.0,0.20474402514295897,0.0,0.10370412511554923,0.0,0.1188099192586948,0.0,0.0,0.4115518970583406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11400677103298815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10289866370172662,0.0,0.0,0.06362228990806845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176936563021872,0.22623083169527625,0.1160285354285039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240378708218706,0.0,0.0,0.08583945907481379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11108116465222392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1568928739122028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12481596334909595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07416304146295696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11012053668339693,0.092062238322706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10538955498758798,0.0,0.0,0.11883274028092833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0891227762682713,0.0,0.0,0.08194018773671369,0.0,0.092451347737383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10910864035105002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307305336446888,0.07417855595787806,0.0,0.0,0.1350088583538347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11308713617903712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040880667673205,0.1073167880744122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2351331817069104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tictoktic,2018/03/28,"Worried about tetanus. Today I was tearing apart an old wooden desk. There was one screw I was loosening and I reached out to pull the screw out when something pricked my pointing finger. 

I immediately pulled my pointing finger away and went straight to the bathroom to disinfect it with hydrogen peroxide. There was a small metal piece which had loosened from the screw and pricked me. The wound is no larger than a pinprick and it had no notable bleeding.

healthanxiety,kronos4all,2018/03/29,"Lymphoma fear Hey guys. I've been having a swollen lymph node ever since June and it's freaking me out. I had a full CBC in April and everything seemed perfect aside from a little high cholesterol.

After the tests everything started going haywire. In June I noticed the painless (sometimes it hurts) lymph node, started feeling tired (I've been building more muscle mass but my strength is getting lower), I started getting shortness of breath randomly (mostly when lying down), random itchiness non-localized and some pressure in my neck. My veins suddenly became very visible in my hands and feet (I think I'm pale but other people don't agree) and my tongue sometimes burns after eating and gets a bit swollen.

I'm really freaking out right now.",5.8559090909090905,8.229718932835823,5.3638941655359575,78.30329036635005,68.6268656716418,7.260786974219811,33.8236092265943,8.00094639256281,2.8788895522388063,603,29,92,8,11,184,94,134,0.125,0.8059999999999999,0.07,-0.8201,1,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,2,3,7,0,2,6,0,6,11,5,0,2,19,18,9,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,3,8,1,0,3,0,0,1,1,5,0,0,3,2,10,2,11,15,5,26,0,1,0,0,2,13,0,5,12,51,13,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989909137616636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18650704012284733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648730546602689,0.0,0.0,0.32762386300197993,0.0,0.0,0.20510368327584647,0.09216085573097764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856846244039929,0.0,0.10358786727157937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1804753046016707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.192577566759144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19512310004548772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18268176423083787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20751485356814625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12636261166588572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11676640754916795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15565702188625888,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16593116310167427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15077508295158254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3605380790598397,0.0,0.3870335345146036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1167908344308214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094917953501619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15039129567017825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,unorthodoxworld,2018/03/29,"Terrified of brain amoeba / fowleri Hi everyone. I'm down in South Australia, and I've found myself going a little insane over something very silly for the last day....

I will start by saying that our water has a decent amount of chlorine as far as I can tell, it's the only thing you can taste in the water, and if you fill a bathtub it's even ever so slightly green. There's never been an order to boil water or anything of the sort either here.

So moving onto story time. I often get itchy eyes before bed, so I keep a glass of water in the bathroom, that way I can rinse my eyes out quickly to calm things down, the glass of water had probably been out for a few hours, anywhere from 6- 12. Last night I did it, and as the water ran down my face a little bit got in my nose, maybe a drop or 2 tops. I started freaking a minute later as I remembered all I'd read about fowleri.... I blew my nose a bunch, and I rolled up some toilet paper, and stuck it up my nostril as well in an attempt to deal with any water that had made its way up there. I spent a terrified hour in bed reading things on my phone, and eventually calmed down enough to sleep.

Now all day today I haven't had a fever or anything of the sort, but I have been getting sinus headaches. (Quite possibly from blowing my nose so much) And I got rather paranoid in the shower too, anytime water got near my nose, or even the tiniest bit might have entered I freaked out a bit. My right nostril which is the one the water entered is also worse than the left, but the discomfort might just be from me freaking out and blowing it a ton... I have bad sinuses at the best of times, so it could just be dust or allergies too.

I know I'm probably being silly, but some confirmation would be lovely, especially since the glass of water, while cold was sitting out a long time... A day of sinus headaches just doesn't exactly fill me with confidence, even if it probably was cause I wouldn't leave things alone. One last thing to note is that 2 family members of mine recently had colds, so that might be why I'm feeling crappy sinus wise too, the right side being worse than the left still has me all freaked out though.",5.965068493150685,5.385890358447488,6.344851598173517,82.07837328767123,66.64840182648402,8.943835616438355,29.89383561643836,8.07648339933343,1.8911945205479448,1699,51,347,18,24,550,218,438,0.105,0.8170000000000001,0.078,-0.9191,1,1,1,0,0,0,54.0,1,2,0,4,28,14,0,1,35,0,36,29,11,2,6,55,56,32,0,6,15,0,1,0,0,6,5,1,3,0,19,16,12,1,4,2,1,7,4,6,1,2,18,14,35,8,56,25,16,72,0,0,3,1,9,36,0,15,24,242,54,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08883503395110043,0.0,0.06859269404406125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058328629695159125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14116785850501729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07161693170255297,0.0,0.0,0.0729865661000148,0.0,0.09001354643905805,0.0,0.2809259361361541,0.0,0.0,0.095751114309127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08811257139504136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06848281792926204,0.0,0.0,0.1659496052709876,0.08842827011703501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08862651112952742,0.0,0.16995691373356905,0.07758665349504101,0.0,0.08195984524909687,0.0,0.0,0.08085921791288349,0.0,0.04336944198759328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404574536086996,0.0,0.0,0.0896257790907335,0.0,0.04874681300016634,0.0,0.2058016816565704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16893839491122978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07623904671087538,0.0,0.0,0.047138636768056456,0.20974950300475032,0.0,0.09082129773956656,0.18638538563956286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17193430145934413,0.0,0.07590646888463587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07741354555593867,0.0811605538688875,0.0,0.0,0.08617057869768469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27297502178908994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0911632004554023,0.06305307650289445,0.0,0.06615348024612976,0.0,0.0,0.08049221688741069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11624410572977345,0.06523428572487015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.096696250129309,0.0,0.0,0.2774336337627763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09123021922974794,0.17159256520835536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08469056006264794,0.0,0.09716416920069196,0.14649946828539567,0.0,0.068210188891644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07095237084528598,0.0,0.08583501547918955,0.0,0.0,0.06603230069746395,0.0,0.0,0.12142124252391802,0.0,0.06849848545229897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07496944482380354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2849190860753531,0.0,0.08427160695342419,0.0,0.15004490274416338,0.0,0.0813028423089654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07077176661690264,0.0,0.1361653430102889,0.0,0.0,0.07712029193422174,0.0,0.07739685560386626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17482017468822733,0.06093072882584925,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Bob_Majerle,2018/03/29,"A great, simple technique for coping with health anxiety (I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks, but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, a book on depression by David D. Burns, M.D.)

***************

If you struggle with health anxiety (or any kind of anxiety really), give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet, but a notebook works fine too.


**The Three-Column Technique**
 


**Column 1: Fear**
 
In this column, write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment: ""I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere"" or ""What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?""

**Column 2: What triggered it**
 
Write down what you were thinking, feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example, ""I felt a skipped heartbeat"" or ""I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen."" Over time, some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others, helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.

**Column 3: Real talk**
 
Normally, you only think of the worst-case scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite: write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine - which, by the way, are *exponentially more realistic scenarios*. Go nuts; the more you write, the better you'll feel. 

For example, my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats, so when I feel one, I list points like these:


 * Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal; most people have them and don't even notice


 * Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy


 * You already met with a cardiologist, and she gave you a clean bill of health


 * Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety - it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect


 * This aside, I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue


  ...and on and on.

 
The more you use this technique, the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that, you'll see how often you worry about the same thing - and how your worst fears are never, ever realized.

 
Hope this helps, stay strong!",1.9979874353288984,4.8057714609756115,2.6332150776053247,87.24823355506285,94.14634146341464,5.216555801921656,23.28529194382853,6.850034144686104,1.2510081300813014,1769,70,307,28,66,549,219,410,0.16,0.7140000000000001,0.126,-0.9186,1,0,1,0,0,0,110.0,0,24,2,10,14,28,2,5,31,0,23,10,3,9,4,66,50,25,0,5,8,0,6,2,0,5,7,1,1,0,24,16,0,0,14,1,1,3,2,13,0,3,8,13,37,14,48,36,15,49,0,1,6,0,40,24,0,15,19,208,61,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08729001689024107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053791451906117546,0.08294438706239607,0.3630726919910197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17997781258310927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1399169674010644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125860613032845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05101365748647885,0.0,0.06812965064718157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05224552219033866,0.07155146215240983,0.06664607771443487,0.0,0.0,0.0773760417603182,0.0,0.2670321441209049,0.1599835459919535,0.0,0.15189889717185007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08265410675175908,0.07588097077822513,0.04495497083986141,0.06634623916355656,0.0,0.08720922808109469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2522422708345562,0.0,0.2812055081848752,0.10603958297472944,0.0,0.0,0.07856522784616267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08256098411066527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08237161009664024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0772895914812645,0.07928007014992326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05814840070758057,0.0,0.0610076350101075,0.07639632309578713,0.08412490380441383,0.0,0.15500454175068099,0.0,0.18011422450732514,0.0,0.0,0.05360094395678648,0.060159941379361925,0.0,0.09280808275189788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10967746845864784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07477609529928207,0.0,0.15151395228814454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09003435486339607,0.05067418207082259,0.08132909208786794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07524324805932335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12606665076938453,0.07201065911612453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06702209463917498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11197631354861802,0.08431123440600778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0826936312105749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1644326340937992,0.0,0.06357845773520532,0.0,0.0,0.09045898714017632,0.0,0.05255124763210163,0.152054348481827,0.0,0.06279742769767642,0.092248960323631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08788421857886172,0.053704445995134735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06831794226921853,0.0,0.06526668121949795,0.0,0.1255735226097012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05758653369760317,0.3213239755453987,0.0,0.0,0.0864846215466327,0.0,0.0

Don't know how much longer I can do this.",4.23992105263158,6.341116610526317,4.194934210526316,86.13766447368424,72.3684210526316,7.276315789473685,27.66447368421053,8.07648339933343,1.7989210526315786,398,15,75,6,8,122,73,95,0.173,0.735,0.092,-0.8452,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,2,7,4,1,0,2,0,8,8,4,2,0,11,17,4,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,2,0,1,4,0,0,1,3,2,0,2,4,1,7,2,5,13,1,15,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,12,42,14,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1446138391440432,0.0,0.0,0.11818858383142924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14302092614228054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13363991604776496,0.1451140508617058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5820480607698673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14971156766170826,0.0,0.18781386977371398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1496919425222776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11479192437464945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878774789817903,0.12416130916420297,0.0,0.19038718811783287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18160453898682005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19102964538949585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08490891246088006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16445184765817206,0.0,0.17620386953701228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17508317688611594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13872388674207478,0.0,0.12776151020585932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11777000682816548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16590983425511194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13879528856610296,0.14530289054280862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13797617994767067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16977536924252892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1434015322392244,0.0,0.0,0.13941025344529806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17650028152742836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11192019869906107
healthanxiety,throwawayme84,2018/03/29,"As someone who has recovered from health anxiety, I want to reiterate how true the pinned post about reassurance is u/nathan98900 has posted some excellent advice about how reassurance feeds health anxiety. If you are not hypochondriac and you get stressed due to a chest pain, then yes, reassurance will work for you and you will get on with your life. But if you are hypochondriac, since your mind is in ""worry-mode,"" when you are reassured about one of your symptoms, yes you will feel temporary relief, but it is very likely you will probably find something new to worry about. I was sick and tired of worrying about every single symptom and spending a fortune on dozens of doctors. So one day I decided that I will stop caring about my symptoms and stopped googling and got on with my life no matter what. Then for a few weeks my symptoms and anxiety become worse, almost unbearable. Of course they would be. My anxious mind had got used to the instant gratification from reassuarance seeking and was begging for that. But I had said to myself that I would keep myself busy and distracted no matter how anxious I was and ignore my symptoms no matter how much panic I had. Then, something very logical happened. My mind decided that since I am not reacting to all these symptoms, then they must not be that serious. So it could take some time off and relax and not worry anymore. Then anxiety slowly dissipated and along with that all these symptoms that I thought could give me a diagnosis of 20 extra rare fatal diseases went away as well. 

Also remember that almost all people recover. You do not see that in this sub, because people that recover do not come back to post. You may feel hopeless now, but it is certain that you will be fine eventually once you find what works for you. This is what worked for me btw:

healthanxiety,Apollomajor,2018/03/29,"Worried ive had cancer and its progressed too far now undiagnosed I apologize in advance for my sloppy writing. Im a 19 year old male, and 18 last year when i started experiencing my symptoms. It was June or july 2017 and i had been starting to feel tired more often as my senior year ended. Nothing shocking since ive always been tired and i was losing sleep over stress of not knowing where i was gonna go for college or how i was gonna spend the summer. One day in the summer when i was hanging out with my cousin i became unbareably tired and felt like i was gonna pass out. Id describe it just as the feeling of having really low blood sugar. I layed in my bed and freaked out because i thought i had something terribly wrong with me, my parents didnt take it seriously but instead talked very gently through it with me about how it was probably my anxiety and that did bring me back to feeling somewhat less fatigued after a rational conversation. I thought this feeling would go away during that week for sure, but i felt fatigued the whole week through. Being alone bored fatigued and scared to death that whole week took such a toll on my anxiety and stress levels. After that week i started to attempt to move past it, getting out and doing more physical things to try to shake it off and to also test that my physicallity wasnt degrading. Im not very fit and was never good at running but i wasnt physically diminished at all, i could run for just as long and do just as many pushups despite feeling a vague fatigue. After that it was on and off but it always came back, a sensation if vague fatigue and low blood pressure that would just strike me randomly. I went to the doctor a month later and all of my vitals were normal and he brushed it off as anxiety and stress related. I also wanted a blood test, which returned as completely normal. So i was just living like this, being constantly fatigued on and off. I eventually went back to him in august to try and get more answers but with good vitals yet again he wouldnt listen to my concerns and kept telling me it was psychological. I had another blood test which came back completely normal. Probably around september i started focusing on my bowel habits and noticed sometimes my food was indigested. So i thought hey, either colorectal cancer or ibs is behind this. I got a stool test done which came back completely normal. Now comes the beginning of this year and im still feeling frustrated by my off and on fatigue without any answers, so i try talking to a new gastro doctor because im still focused on having colorectal cancer. This doctor actually listens to everything i say and he suggests adding fiber to my diet. He asks me if i wanted a colonoscopy but i say no because im afraid to have one and we have poor insurance (which is possibly the most annoying aspect of this whole thing because whenever i visit the doctor which yields nothing my moms stuck with a bill that almost always goes into collections) anyway, i voice the concern that i might have celiacs disease because i have many food allergies as it is. I get a blood test done in late january checking for sprue and some cancer markers because i voiced my concern. Still completely normal and its not celiacs.  Here we are in march and my worries at an all time high. Its literally all i can think about. Made so much more troubling by the fact that over the past week ive been off balance on and off. (This started last week after smoking marijuana right after waking up and having an anxiety attack) im scheduled to go to a different doctor for a physical and guidance but the next available spot is fucking april 29th. Im so afraid i have some kind of abdominal cancer and its already too far.

healthanxiety,humblecactus,2018/03/29,"I feel drained mentally because of myself Every single day for the past few years I have woken up and felt something wrong with me, and I convinced myself it was everything you could possibly imagine; cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and whatever else. I used to smoke cigarettes regularly (I switched to Juul which is still unhealthy but at least it's better), but I just recently quit due to my fear of developing cancer. Every tiny problem with my allergies/ constant dry cough/ dry throat/mouth has a reasonable cause, but I ignore it and continue to worry myself to death. My health anxiety is bringing me down, and I'm constantly depressing myself to the point of not caring about anything.

healthanxiety,Megsi99,2018/03/30,"UTI won’t go away I was diagnosed with kidney infection last Tuesday, but had to stop Bactrim early because of allergic reaction. I had my UTI right culture done and there’s still bacteria in it. 😔 My Doctor said it could be because I had to stop early or it wasn’t right med for that bacteria.

So, my doc is calling in another round of antibiotics. I’m sad and anxious, I’ve heard stories about ppl who battle these and forever and some that escalate into something worse. Has anyone gone through similar with a positive outcome? Thanks!!

healthanxiety,shanomac29,2018/03/30,"Some advice for those of you suffering from hypochondria.... Get professional help before it turns into a more generalized anxiety. Over the course of six years I basically burned myself out on the health anxiety. One disease after another until the point that I stopped caring about any symptoms, imaginary or real, altogether. Unfortunately it's turned into a living hell of generalized daily anxiety with no breaks in between. I thought I had beaten my health anxiety into submission, but in reality it just morphed into a new beast. Now instead of having some relief between imaginary diseases I face an unrelentless onslaught of unreasonable fears.

healthanxiety,MARKYfan74126,2018/03/30,"Worried About Arsenic Poisoning I'm a college student volunteering at the local Natural History museum in the ornithology collection. Early on my supervisor warned me that some of the older specimens had been treated with Arsenic. I continued sorting specimens, never running into the aforementioned older ones until last Tuesday. When I encountered them I made sure to handle them carefully and thoroughly washed my hands when I had finished with each bird. When I mentioned the specimens to my supervisor she jokingly said ""technically we should be using gloves"". I immediately began to panic. For the last few days I've been concerned that my health has unecessarily been put in jeopardy. I read online that there can potentially be cross contamination between specimens, so now I'm worried other birds could have had trace amounts. I haven't always been super diligent about washing my hands post-volunteering. Now, I think I may have permanent brain damage. I forgot my headphones to an editing job today, which only bolstered my concern. Does anyone know anything about Arsenic? I'm freaking out.",8.307461180124221,10.867909233695652,8.390062111801246,58.31891304347829,62.64130434782609,10.909316770186336,40.316770186335404,10.914260884657429,5.555203105590064,905,50,114,26,14,294,125,184,0.14,0.826,0.034,-0.9629,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,1,0,2,1,10,9,1,1,8,0,17,7,3,2,2,19,28,6,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,4,1,0,0,5,7,0,1,2,3,0,3,2,4,0,1,11,3,23,5,19,12,4,28,0,1,0,0,6,7,0,3,18,85,28,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16367607459748126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13754218598804932,0.0,0.16187319218424207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2195901913163296,0.0,0.0,0.20055600995636114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15705462228270467,0.0,0.0,0.12685981370646046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17213971880829082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20909046102309475,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19520145570046973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1081050841128625,0.3206850999465102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1861290250249284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15171265095244935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13329382953281962,0.14960462221318405,0.0,0.23079341236178025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18839103789311795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1977449778674532,0.0,0.0,0.19676034317947805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18711350845613728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1853941246005746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12604197432667574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18645534128771293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16989178694703302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39953124011851904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,dadouks,2018/03/31,"Phobia of appendicitis, anxiety whenever I get any tingling sensation in my stomach, i'm in a vicious circle Hello, i've been feeling pretty weird for about 15 days now, and I want to share a bit of backstory to help you understand better
6 or 7 years ago, I felt a huge discomfort around my abdominal belt, so much that almost had to sleep standing up because it was the most confortable position for me, I went to a doctor and he shoved his hand in my lower stomach so hard I screamed in pain, he said it was appendicitis even though the pain was coming from him and him only, and he rushed me to the hospital. After a day of stress they announce me that i'm fine and that I just have to take some medication because there was a problem with my nose for some reason.

Because of that experience, any small tingling sensation in my stomach puts me in a state of anxiety, my heart rushed, i feel heat around my head, I want to throw up and I have diarrhea, which are common symptoms for appendicitis, so i end up in a vicious circle.

I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while now, and i'm pretty inactive at the moment, I'm a lot on my computer but ever since too weeks i've been feeling stomach discomfort for sitting too long, which triggered my anxiety through the roof and messed up my digestive system, going from constipation to diarrhea every few days, I also suffer from lower back pain. 
After a night of drinking yesterday, I'm now left with anxiety and hangover, and an annoying discomfort in my right flank area, parallel to my arm under my ribs, which doesn't help my anxiety.
I have an appointement Tuesday but i'm terrified because i have to wait two days and I can't really take it anymore, I'm afraid i might have something serious and I don't know what to do. Thanks for your help !",8.258026403743315,6.9077213835227305,8.743816844919788,69.2531885026738,62.4375,12.60053475935829,38.88770053475936,11.67016984619884,4.581625802139038,1445,64,264,38,17,485,177,352,0.189,0.726,0.085,-0.9875,2,0,2,0,0,1,32.0,0,2,1,1,18,23,3,5,18,0,19,21,11,3,1,42,43,22,0,3,4,0,6,0,0,1,9,2,0,0,11,18,2,1,7,1,0,7,3,19,0,1,11,9,40,4,51,31,7,55,0,3,0,0,15,22,0,7,22,178,51,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08710603149172587,0.0,0.09839824603408663,0.0,0.0,0.0785825192456704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13364719754698925,0.0,0.4510349327912688,0.0,0.09745251787859244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17495344302784047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07555975239399194,0.0,0.239605832174004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08690744495548311,0.1072799763428966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08464663341296849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2534912934340973,0.0,0.0846355373967487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10057843517866978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09626233207684247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08703366133377846,0.0,0.0,0.06490313402679977,0.0888863570158766,0.08279253671734506,0.0,0.0,0.09612206746709206,0.0,0.0,0.14905727456082207,0.0,0.09434985112935433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051339429136444265,0.0,0.05584628835674554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880261771505554,0.0,0.10084828340488974,0.0,0.0,0.11644454887639685,0.19759496060393975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054003897684219586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10676525654994848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08696147068033437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08354142541937404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0989916926402444,0.0,0.10424368174230107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0722361129977577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0922150860355261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07473499306149503,0.31368280130215803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1999417509489961,0.0,0.09402637500045206,0.0,0.09878350902695064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0629511026544825,0.10103283004477168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08391780966222538,0.09347255819579263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08128585886849801,0.0,0.09833600866461116,0.0,0.0,0.07564923076298995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11256227455411656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021350045089902,0.14776616593917818,0.0,0.0,0.09046924910919786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09654490565754917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.095990668371709,0.1022973750846008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11591853643634276,0.0,0.07882229009890608,0.0,0.0,0.09109267917492317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06327946583388222
healthanxiety,Daisyinthedaisies3,2018/03/31,"Stressful, anxiety-ridden past few months So, I just wanted to start off by saying that this community has really helped me to calm down by knowing so many others are going through similar things as myself. Everyone is also so kind and helpful to one another, which is even more reassuring.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety since I was a child (e.g. thinking I have appendicitis when I have a pain in my right lower stomach), but for the past several months, I have been in constant panic mode. It all started when I went to the ENT in December, she removed the wax from my ears (which I've had done before), and then a few days later I had intense ringing in my ears, a clogged feeling in my right ear, headaches, and dizziness. I was googling like crazy, which made things even worse. That ringing and googling led to, what I now know were panic attacks in which I was feeling disconnected from the world and having episodes of shaking, like the chills, amongst other symptoms. Long story short and countless ENT visits later where they didn't find anything wrong with me, I then went to the dentist who said I most likely had a TMJ disorder as a result of grinding my teeth, which I thought would make me feel better. But obviously, it didn't, and I just started to get different symptoms instead. 

I have been having a random ""tic"" in my neck in which it will randomly slightly jerk my head. Sometimes I get a little spazz in my leg or my arm as well, and a twitch that will last for a second or two in random body areas. I also have like a ""shaky"" feeling on the inside, which will sometimes lead to my fingers or toes being a little trembly. I recently have been getting floaters in my eyes, which I'm not sure if I've always had them and just never noticed, or if it's something new (my vision has been bad for years). Also, I randomly have ""visual snow,"" which I think I've also had for a while, but was never really concerned about until now. I feel like I am so hyper focused on my body and I just don't know how to get out of this phase.

I am only 23 and I feel like I am going crazy. I'm in my last year of grad school right now, and currently doing an internship in a hospital for speech pathology. So, not only am I at a super stressful time in my life, but I am around these disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's, MS, etc, and the fact that I see these disorders frequently, makes me even more nervous because they can really happen to anyone! I am caught between that ""1st year medical school"" syndrome thing and going to the doctor to see if there is something to actually be worried about. I stopped googling my symptoms, which has helped a great amount, but this anxiety has not fully gone away. 

For anyone taking the time to read this, thank you. It is a little bit of relief being able to express my feelings instead of keeping them inside.",7.953127202606553,6.569406852782768,7.878176740474768,75.32357404082721,63.05745062836626,10.406250415586145,36.06948600305872,9.150863307647796,3.1415631225480425,2255,86,422,30,27,728,269,557,0.108,0.778,0.114,0.5292,3,0,2,0,0,0,74.0,0,1,4,3,31,29,2,8,29,0,52,25,14,7,6,73,92,46,0,5,19,0,8,6,0,4,11,8,0,1,33,17,0,2,14,1,0,12,8,13,1,3,25,19,59,16,64,60,10,80,0,0,3,0,16,33,0,13,41,309,92,6,0.06745523089218469,0.0,0.06582657481673382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21577569509430566,0.11225631165635708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07073269112038487,0.1032061339988702,0.0,0.0,0.09433253170410953,0.0,0.055509907466107115,0.0600494568334837,0.0,0.07674006329317391,0.06337640991362388,0.0,0.05632230018809752,0.04112008265505866,0.0,0.05739943317673461,0.0,0.0,0.05965867003294335,0.14728728276527334,0.1498551096559052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07289514068464914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04350304349344094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07047635916829584,0.23192861594873895,0.06904328714102265,0.0,0.06903012115864056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07523041342979075,0.13366063145656154,0.0,0.0,0.06445636384789571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2387517407939865,0.09638006085513837,0.0,0.0,0.06165285898091145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409702961167341,0.0,0.11500908666730347,0.0,0.0,0.07436963019651817,0.0,0.0,0.05965043790363784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06922852772996503,0.07170175608958887,0.0,0.0,0.1356414581153688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059957308597615375,0.0,0.07024424268361237,0.11121489237496293,0.10997003261373252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047645624467327286,0.19773131111159306,0.2704314499158816,0.0,0.05969575664725864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382777046943483,0.09005378083797094,0.0683890166075357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06795404847366057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10768424347540034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10405126509425926,0.06514868233582115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07679822746101231,0.0,0.0,0.04570941020764128,0.10260548548525117,0.07177712161668334,0.1582883588211177,0.0,0.0,0.12878730121012455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06747348523565813,0.0,0.12964064459831195,0.0,0.06660390264634197,0.0,0.0,0.17281919583841776,0.06416537167091184,0.05364310706018503,0.0,0.13653658985158734,0.107506171125773,0.0,0.0,0.07620521054005885,0.0,0.055799664057137474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10386066461042504,0.1334298963563168,0.0,0.14323547884696905,0.0,0.0,0.0563955934711624,0.15453947815912486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06357575681601745,0.2103354391307737,0.05071793872385843,0.0,0.0,0.06210371370943483,0.0,0.0,0.13444277419119632,0.08644517646573376,0.0,0.05355191850598664,0.07866737518766029,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06589395895326197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03978684288497875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06065035361963314,0.12506334968418936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06850406132584128,0.06874264314073505,0.0479182606406847,0.0737517056810551,0.0,0.13031687126384606

I haven't been able to focus at work or at home. I just keep thinking it's cancer even though there's no history in my family of bladder or kidney cancers and I'm only 29.

I also get flashes of light in my vision, chills, and a tingly feeling going through my whole body, also pain in my arms and slight numbness in my fingers. 2 weeks ago i vomited aswell which really didn't help matters as i have a fear of vomiting.

Im convinced i have a brain tumor but i went to the doctor and he shone a light into my eyes and said everything looked ok but i still dont believe him. I've have headaches from anxiety on and off in the past but they never lasted this long before.

The last 2 months have been really stressful for me as my mum was in hospital with liver failure and i had to look after my dad during that time who is a schizophrenic. My anxiety was improving but this has brought me back down and i feel worse than ever.

Does anybody know what it could be? Is it a stress reaction or could i really have a brain tumor?

healthanxiety,Annoyingbrain,2018/04/01,"Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site: https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php

And I'm not sure how trustworthy that is.

healthanxiety,henz333,2018/04/01,Overreacting to symptoms Does anyone feels the same? If there is the slightest abnormality or pain on my body or state I get extremely anxious and am convined this is a sign of a serious illness. At night it's the worst and keeps me awake (like if there's a red spot on my skin it's probably skin cancer). I'm also too afraid to go to the doctor because he might find something terrible.,3.8878354978355,5.489459363636364,5.199415584415586,80.64293290043291,72.24675324675326,8.25021645021645,29.71645021645022,8.841846274778883,2.420213852813853,309,13,60,6,6,103,58,77,0.21,0.79,0.0,-0.9412,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,1,7,0,4,8,3,0,0,12,9,7,0,2,4,0,3,1,0,1,5,0,0,0,3,2,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,4,4,1,7,8,2,6,0,0,1,0,1,3,0,5,2,37,7,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20991742542112107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2965450134363309,0.0,0.1835428423032388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16001472047685508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29157314304021953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686750993511159,0.22971143752287895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.132725529021184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2399159816673145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13714297900300826,0.0,0.14918214869803187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23331791563438614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12824196205399746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2784660697801212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2463340909833625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2793135448796056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830143692723227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202081734071284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2728331618495811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,throwahoyway,2018/04/01,"Obsessing over stools. Worried about parasites. I've been looking at almost every stool I pass for the past couple of months because I'm crazy and I have a fear of parasites.

It seems to be only getting worse as now I'm afraid to eat some foods because of some stupid stories I read online. Yesterday I cut open a quinoa patty and almost had a panic attack because I didn't know quinoa looked like worms.

Anyway, back on the parasite topic. I've been passing weird white stuff for several months now and I think it's gotten more frequent somehow. Although I think it happens with every bowel movement.

I posted on /r/AskDocs with a pic if you're brave enough to go look at it (warning: it's pretty gross as you might have guessed).

I've also started washing my hands every time I touch something and I also check my bedsheets obsessively for anything suspect before I go to bed. I look at most foods with my phone's zoom, too.

I can't even pet my cats anymore because dandruff and flea eggs are like indistinguishable.

healthanxiety,Mostuu,2018/04/01,"Brain tumor anxiety Hey reddit. I'll start by saying that I'm a huge 22 year old hypochondriac. It started in last December, when I pooped a lot of blood and I was convinced that I've got colon cancer, I couldn't function properly for a whole month before I got my colonoscopy which revealed a small benign polyp which was removed.  
 
Anyways, since yesterday all I've been reading about is brain tumors. The reason of that is, when I was in work yesterday (slept only 6 hours and didn't have breakfast, then worked from 8 am to 2 pm) I kind of tripped twice when I was standing and wanted to turn around. Like, I'm clumsy overall and I sometimes trip or bump onto things, but never so often. Also, when handing the change to the customer (I'm a student but I work part time as a cashier) I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes, I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness, loss of concentration, balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear. However, I've read that tumors can grow fast. Should I go to doctor or observe myself for couple days? I've never head headaches as well.

healthanxiety,ska1234567890,2018/04/01,"My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone! 

As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years, I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support. This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body, it also reminds me (and hopefully others) that many of these symptoms quickly pass, as they are only manifested *only* as a result of mental illness. 

Here's all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety. I hope that people may relate, and be reassured. I've bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years. 

1. tingling extremities 

2. **cold hands and feet**

3. muscle spasms (mostly in leg, thought it was a blood clot, it was not) 

4. **tightness of muscles** particularly around neck and shoulders 

5. dry mouth

6. **bruxism**

7. chest pain, stabbing 

8. **chest pain, dull/achey** 

9. constipation/diarrhea (thought this was hypothyroidism, it wasn't) 

10. hair loss (thought this was PCOS, it wasn't) 

11. Paralysis like symptoms (this came in two ways. One: overthinking things that should be unconscious-- me, thinking about swallowing, resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid. Two: mid panic attack, thought I could not move legs. 

12. **pelvic, vaginal/vulva pain** (thought this was vulvar cancer, literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test. As soon as results came back negative, the pain stopped)

13. **headaches**

14. **HEADACHES**

15. **pressure in head, tightness** 

16. insomnia 

17. **lethargy**

18. difficulty concentrating 

19. hearing phantom ringing (always hearing my alarm clock, even when it's not going off)

healthanxiety,tattedsparrowxo,2018/04/01,"Not sure what is real and what’s not anymore Hey guys,

I am a 29 year old female with two kids ages 6 and 11, I have had this illness since I was around 6. It would be to the point I would make myself hyperventilate and my heart would go nuts and go to the emergency room, I would vomit all the time and be in serious pain. I had all sorts of tests and they were all negative. It died down a lot from ages 13-24 but since then it’s been getting worse. It didn’t help that for 3 weeks in 2016 I thought my symptoms of a bad headache, neck pain and double vision was just my anxiety but it turned out to actually be meningitis!!! I was in the hospital for 7 days. 

Now, every headache I freak out. Every rash I freak out. Stomach ache, palpitation, everything. I’ll be at the store sitting in front of the bp machine for 10 minutes. I carry around a thermometer if I feel hot I check my temperature. I google non stop. I look in the mirror and smile to make sure I’m not having a stroke. It’s embarrassing and terrible!

Lately I have been losing my memory and getting panic attacks when the light changes from high to low. I have a red rash on my face I can’t get rid of. And I KNOW these aren’t made up. A least not my memory or rash. I go to an mri Wednesday to see if something actually is wrong. Please wish me luck as I’m already nervous enough!",1.973526097271648,3.5803678042704665,3.6737588967971533,89.57737618623962,77.36298932384341,7.103262158956111,23.452105575326208,7.9370924344782425,1.030106642941874,1047,33,236,17,24,350,164,281,0.278,0.659,0.063,-0.9964,1,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,1,1,5,17,1,3,16,0,26,14,7,3,5,48,44,19,1,7,10,0,3,0,0,4,7,0,1,2,11,17,0,1,3,0,2,4,8,14,0,1,11,7,30,3,32,25,7,36,0,2,3,0,5,18,0,6,13,148,41,1,0.0,0.0,0.23149635906940244,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1308912660547979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907378377231537,0.0,0.11763120916054642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21117961339700267,0.0,0.13493824717892802,0.0,0.0,0.09903604634039072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12547574424234026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07649491261855333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12310050567382325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255787918512773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1998714125716728,0.0,0.10660079675193536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059973779444771474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859095873065815,0.0,0.20222975977028929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11744450534404485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14055576379821647,0.07950310792663426,0.12532006591320674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06518604056891851,0.0,0.1337994763908601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09960418746105512,0.13269646245541292,0.0,0.10083966121141452,0.0,0.11223352052213637,0.15834883132279146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12446331714288265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2524230125143909,0.13916559859060434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1302003321996486,0.11212665701123822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500639725290714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0945183888968728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1962341060959984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09131329472473802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0991649238356956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22358076914930747,0.12328325978173185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09416466062400823,0.0691635976206851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12901577065158545,0.11586666650070795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09514337335735963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1363979198304705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12087573783226804,0.3370341811689471,0.12968357679140716,0.0,0.07638222431919542
healthanxiety,Le_Pistache,2018/04/01,"Stomach ulcer concerns Been anxious for a while about this. I fear I have a stomach ulcer.

To keep things, I will have random spasms across the abdomen with a sense of feeling hungry at night. Sometimes dull pain will be there and I belch often enough. I can get gassy but it is not prominent.

It isnt a burning pain and it doesnt interrupt my sleep. I will feel nauseous after eating at times but not always.

Stools are fairly normal. Light brown that sinks.

No vomitting as of yet. Fatigue nothing out of the ordinary. I will feel some sort of ache on the breastbones, arms and knees but the latter two not every day.

I will have lower back pain - but only at my job that requires a lot of standing and easily relieved with exercise. I do not have back pain at home or when moving. Only by standing at work 

Am I being a nervous Nick or os there genuine concern to be had?

healthanxiety,ThoughtsBecome,2018/04/01,"My neck hurts. Is it serious? I have two swollen lymph nodes, pea sized, on ONE side of my neck only. I’ve been fighting a cold, so my sister says it’s nothing to worry about. 
However, our other sister died of lymphoma at age 33. 
I’m supposed to leave for vacation Monday, so it’s unlikely I’ll go to the doctor before then, also, no health insurance yay USA.
What do you all think? Hypochondria or maybe death?

healthanxiety,slm_CO-USA,2018/04/01,"Feeling stupid lately... Alright so I’m 16m, have health related anxiety, and have had this sort of thing before.  Maybe someone has something wise to say.

So I constantly worry about losing intelligence; I’m a pretty bright guy but I often worry that this attribute is slipping away from me.  I’m rather insecure about this.

I work at a swimming pool that’s under construction.  There were diesel fumes in the pool the whole 3 hour shift.  They were bad enough at one point to give a coworker a headache, and at least one patron turned right around when she came in and smelled how and it was.  Mgmt didn’t close till the last 30 mins!  I was one of the last on the deck.  Didn’t really get a headache, though.  Anyway I own a juul, I was using that before and after.  So nicotine exposure.  Haven’t used it for a few days.  Also I drank a bit with friends the night of that work shift.  Continued using the juul and drank more the night of the next day.  Also I was at higher altitude for two days after this, but only 2000 ft higher than the 5000 of my hometown.  Back home and still feel what I’m about to describe.  

I feel like my memory has been shitty since this, and my mental/cognitive/linguistic abilities down.  I feel dull.  I’ve had scares like this before, but this feels different.  Is this just anxiety? Anxiety seems to cause very real physical symptoms for me, but I feel less stressed than I normally would during this type of episode.  Anyone have any words of advice?  

EDIT: Forgot a MAJOR component: I got a meningitis vaccine the day before the second drinking incident.  Not an antivaxer at all, I just was worried about the interactions between all these in relation to my memory/mental issues recently.  Kinda reinforces my point that I forgot this big part which was a primary part of my thoughts about this :(",3.1731810631229216,5.768006866279073,4.022212624584719,83.73109302325581,77.72093023255813,7.4198006644518255,24.072757475083066,8.418075326091056,1.8222906312292357,1438,49,261,30,35,460,195,344,0.136,0.7959999999999999,0.069,-0.9766,1,0,2,0,0,0,46.0,0,0,1,3,22,14,2,3,25,1,22,5,0,6,2,45,46,21,0,3,8,0,6,2,1,1,2,1,1,1,22,12,3,2,8,4,0,2,4,8,0,5,20,9,25,6,42,25,13,41,0,2,1,0,7,18,0,4,23,181,47,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938984751823577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14630756327204822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06220720587395584,0.0,0.20993798175698716,0.0,0.0,0.06396254612865207,0.0,0.0,0.08143354330317155,0.0,0.0,0.08594525068581264,0.07033983741118963,0.0763791167007561,0.0,0.0,0.311359301059906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09986872447765767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10462482881296492,0.0,0.093971637898942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885367676172173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23597928527256976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09557354801885797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08961221513538785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09451975217896312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2775198204169064,0.0653508813657815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07067457266501273,0.0,0.0477927333510945,0.08775266336657192,0.0,0.0,0.07316217122949199,0.0,0.0,0.09057618827698434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09723531847467408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09175846033152917,0.0,0.09008599693823006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09547777488312156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14913123090745614,0.10318955773570357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08938166490802914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10233888534710156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0919005119328161,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09218686912872807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09728637217715157,0.17168913219237938,0.0896276183148181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18596067800387686,0.06957205515260449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19812042645317968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17294985689739176,0.0,0.0,0.093064560218035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1041203657876934,0.058602234460518064,0.0,0.09032207910474878,0.0,0.0,0.07812049272958503,0.0,0.07274584171203435,0.09158400686062136,0.0,0.0,0.0832768355941432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07567036571037902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0775078026635074,0.07042313432161781,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07305330862142596,0.0,0.10478610424085782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09507918413619276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06077296976643976,0.0,0.08987526760834946,0.07262218019253619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950024225489043,0.0893593188480897,0.0,0.0,0.2370191628426549,0.0,0.07547775216064427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10213032590113677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13319206789757207,0.27869669795133345,0.0,0.06498233220854065,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,iSquall429,2018/04/02,"Paranoid I'm having a stroke, heart attack, blood clot or Diabetes... Help please v.v So for the past week I've been having issues with my neck, on the left side. Feelings of fullness, I would constantly feel it seeing if there were any bulging veins or something, and it would go down to my should or back. I think I pulled a muscle. So I went to an urgent care the other day and the doctor told me there's nothing wrong, says I just pulled a muscle. 

On top of that, suddenly today I've been getting tingling and numbness on my left arm and hand/fingers.

I was streaming a game and I noticed my left hand started shaking and twitching, and my right is perfectly fine. So after ending my stream, I went into the bathroom to check it more and it's been really scaring because my brain thinks I'm having a stroke... 

ON top of that with that shaking and tingling in my left hand, my left side of my jaw and cheek are also tingly, and it's still happening as I write this post... 

So recap.. my symptoms are... 

- Tingling and Slight Numbness in Left Hand/Fingers
- Shaking in Left Hand

healthanxiety,wsnyder503,2018/04/02,"Hantavirus - freaking out - vacuumed large amount of what looked like mouse droppings from engine bay of car. I’m seriously worried right now. Here’s my info. 

Male 
21 yrs old
165 lbs
5’11”
No previous health issues and no medications

I purchased an older vehicle from Alabama (I live in northern Illinois) on March 3rd, 2018. It was shipped that day and arrived March 6th, 2018. On March 25th, 2018 I opened up the engine cover (It is a van) and discovered a large amount of broken nuts or acorns and what looked like mouse droppings (small, round pellets about the size of rice) on top of the engine, along with a few chewed wires. I’m assuming that at some point this van sat for a period of time (not sure if recently before purchase, but I assume not, as there are was no sign of a current infestation to the previous owner prior to purchase). Anyway, fast forward to me cleaning it out a few days ago with a regular household vacuum. I don’t believe I used a respirator (mask) for all of the time, but if I did it was a 3$ one that is made for basic things like sanding, not for chemicals or pathogens. I vacuumed it up for quite awhile, probably about an hr. My question is, am I at risk for hantavirus? It seems that the virus wouldn’t survive after excretion for very long, and assuming that the mice were active until the very day that the van was picked up in Alabama (unlikely), there still would’ve been about 2.5 weeks between then and when I first opened up the engine compartment, and another week or so until I vacuumed it up. Any knowledge or experience with this? Lifespan of hantavirus after excretion? I’m killing my self over this and my anxiety is giving me a bunch of “symptoms”. Thank you in advance!

healthanxiety,beyond_the,2018/04/03,"Throat nastiness for months! Honestly just need a little reassurance that nothing is wrong. I'm a 22 year old male, and I've had hard swollen lymph nodes in my neck (especially my right side), drainage and nasty looking tonsils for 2 months. I've also had a feeling of tightness in my throat. I've been on allergy medication but it hasn't really helped. 

2 blood tests have shown that I have low white blood cell count, and I have had a round of antibiotics but it didn't help. I've seen 2 nurse practitioners and the only thing they could offer is that I do an STI test, which came back all clear. I'm going to see my PCP soon, but as a college student 5 hours away from home, it makes me a bit anxious that something could be seriously wrong and I'm so far away from decent help, or at least help that my insurance covers. Plus, I've already missed at least 3 days of school for visits and whatnot. 

Just a sinus infection that is lasting for months? Some other virus? Some STI the test didn't check for? Something worse? I have no idea. If anybody is interested in seeing a picture of my throat, it's in another post in my post history.

healthanxiety,okfinebyme,2018/04/03,"I'm so tired. I am 27 y.o, male, and I am so fucking tired. Every goddamn day that I wake up I have a brief moment of calm before everything gets going. 
When I wake up, I am fine. 2 hours later I know that I am going to die in a couple of weeks. It never ever fucking goes away. 
Being a hypochondriac, is going to either kill me from some fucking disease or it's going to make me kill myself. I have
tried getting help from the psychiatric ward, and I was actually seeing a therapist for a couple of weeks before they said 
that before we can go on I have to start taking my ADHD medication again. I said ""Ok fine"" thinking that it would only be a couple
of weeks before I could continue with the therapy sessions. It has now been over 3 months since I was in a session. It always keeps on getting
postponed because a doctor quit or that ""there are many people waiting for a psychiatrist"". I am so fucking tired of waiting, so fucking tired of 
worrying about disease X and disease Y. 
The first time I started experiencing problems was this autumn. I went abroad and as soon as I landed I got a lot of problems with my stomach. 
Constipation, dihareea. When I got back home I went to see a doctor who did a shit load of tests on me. Couldn't find a single problem with me
other than possible lactose intolerance. So I went to another doctor who said it was most likely IBS. After a couple of weeks the problems went
away, until I was more or less completely normal. Then I noticed I started loosing weight. My thoughts automatically went to a number of horrible 
diseases. I started eating more, and stopped taking my daily walks. (Which I started because I was told it was good for anxiety). 
When my dad came to visit the latest batch of problems started showing up. A lump in the throat. It feels like I have something
stuck in my throat that I am trying to swallow all of the time. It's not present the first couple of hours after I wake up, but after a while
it sets in. So I went to the doctor today and described my issue, and after an examination including blood tests and some stick in the throat
tests, he said that he could not see anything. He mentioned ""Globus"", and I have read that that is connected with anxiety. I just can't seem
to get it into my head that it is that and not something else. This is where I am at the moment.
I am so tired of this constant worry all of the time, and I am so tired of going to the doctor every other week trying to figure out 
if I am going to die next month or not. It is so fucking exhausting...
The only medicine I have at the moment is Promethazine for my anxiety, and I don't really know if it is helping or not. I guess it helps a little,

healthanxiety,sydni1210,2018/04/03,"Change in stool? First post here! 

I know it's gross, but I've noticed what I would call a significant change in my stool within maybe the last year. I don't go nearly as often, and sometimes when I do, it feels like it's very little or there's more in my body that I can't get out. I think that's kind of normal, since I'm a 24-year-old female and I know my metabolism has to slow down at some point, but I feel uncertain about it. 

On top of that, I have noticed a little bit of blood in my stool. I've have had trouble with hemorrhoids in the past, so I'm pretty positive that's got to be what the blood is coming from. 

On top of THAT, I've also noticed an increasing amount of mucus in my stool, which I feel like my body may be producing to make up for my possible constipation. 

Anyway, it worries me because I know colon cancer is becoming more prevalent in adults my age. In addition, I'm not overweight, but I have a history of eating poorly, which I know can lead to colon cancer.

I'm definitely going to pass this information along to my physician the next time I see her, I guess I just wanted to see what someone might say here first.

healthanxiety,JhingerMan,2018/04/03,"Smaller stomach after hernia repair surgery [Help] Hello,i am a 19 yo rather healthy female and i have underwent a hernia repair surgery a month ago.Im roughly around 66kg and 176cm tall. Now im not the most fit person and i had some stomach fat before the surgery and after. The past week has been different and i had started eating once or max twice per day since my loss of apetite and i noticed that my stomach is way way smaller than it used to be. Is this the cause of the said surgery,eating less food (i was pretty inactive though) or could there be another more worrying reason? 
I need advice.",3.4391596638655457,5.33109497478992,4.123268907563027,86.69599579831936,74.04201680672269,6.440672268907564,27.866386554621855,7.1686216300943375,1.4979573109243698,478,19,91,5,10,152,84,119,0.065,0.883,0.052000000000000005,-0.1078,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,0,1,5,1,0,0,8,0,12,6,4,4,0,19,16,9,0,3,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,7,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,5,2,8,0,7,8,4,13,0,1,0,0,3,3,0,4,8,56,11,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17676142856387447,0.16034608782587592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18967659148226576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16102845957255113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1539221633664016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18582156050904453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14442415984682516,0.0,0.0,0.11665764271426945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889892124190616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18509334030871846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.218730201128224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.121245254641023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3907796492412305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.144382886719221,0.0,0.0,0.1341259843020787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20594191718073146,0.0,0.19263956414050606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17267783773531756,0.0,0.15794421755374544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18402788537538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1859827472589496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720656855684621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14963222686098396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12803328973106864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1777213088071493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1562289491265937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2871605733985552,0.14509725255978878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18370030390704264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,lologoop,2018/04/03,"Has therapy helped you? Hi guys, I just found this sub. I've had health anxiety my whole life, but as of the past year it's gotten so much worse and it's really ruining my life.  I feel like I have symptoms of OCD mixed in as well. There is always something I'm worried about, and I suffer from intrusive thoughts regarding exposure to disease/carcinogens/etc extremely often. 

It has given me some kind of solace scrolling through this sub and seeing I'm not alone. I really would like to see a therapist regarding this issue, and I'm wondering if any of you have done the same with positive results. Are any of you prescribed medication as well? I'm not keen on medication but I would take it if deemed necessary. 

TLDR; I'm looking to get professional help. Has professional help helped to effectively treat your issues with health anxiety?",4.768758519961049,6.88441615822785,5.729746835443041,75.63049172346643,70.96202531645571,10.177994157740995,30.508276533592987,10.389873798559362,3.625983836416747,675,29,120,21,13,222,100,158,0.118,0.693,0.189,0.9291,0,1,1,0,0,0,18.0,0,4,0,1,7,9,0,0,3,0,11,7,0,2,0,24,27,12,0,4,7,0,1,2,0,2,7,0,0,1,7,6,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,6,4,13,7,19,19,4,4,0,2,3,0,10,2,0,5,4,73,20,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1364059326579925,0.0,0.0,0.10958852644132187,0.0,0.0,0.17912687777235434,0.0,0.20150685476403327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13477922347919818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14688510658679424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06659365027575452,0.09408957671594237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14440696466134048,0.0,0.0,0.0688100597439985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13040796141408004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799910197358829,0.0,0.0,0.3531144586261966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27493013825630785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13714975903090346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18605328109246855,0.12868813459899525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11059843963794856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26535644822351145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09681781302709266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125726654971324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1687462913969414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20990254718305396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10139240299214188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13689119416460893,0.09902524119808184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15061534276068267,0.15291884093795036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10455850099800583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23683596167554266,0.0,0.0,0.14704314514311664,0.0,0.0,0.14282769291361908,0.0,0.1337521075683722,0.1342179313451224,0.18711790885555785,0.0,0.0,0.08481324973492531
healthanxiety,SevenLight,2018/04/03,"Be careful of Google results. Don't click on calmclinic. Also my head hurts. I'd never seen the website before in my life, but it was suddenly not only the promoted result *and* the top non-promoted result when I googled a generic symptoms (I know, googling bad). I clicked out of curiosity, seemed like an innocuous anxiety website, it directed me to a test, which then offered to send me in-depth results via email (no), or I could get basic results, which I clicked. Then a long-ass video with a woman promising she could cure me in just a few weeks, no meds, no therapy! It was really deceptive because the video suggested she would tell you the solution at any moment, but eventually she asked for $78. It was an obvious scam (to me) and I knew that from the start, but it was really well crafted. I doubt anyone here would fall for that sort of thing, but if you see calm clinic in Google results, click on the feedback button to report it as a scam. :) I think at one point the woman insinuated that if you thought the whole deal was too good to be true, that also was your anxiety lol. Who tf can sleep at night after weedling mentally ill people for money?

Anyway, comes and goes, but I've been getting this weird pressure headache, generally around the crown and eyes. Often accompanied by a rushing in my ears that times with my heartbeat. My anxiety was better, but I had my period and it left me feeling really tired, and I dunno if it's tiredness causing anxiety, or if I have blood pressure problems. I googled blood pressure stuff, saw the word ""stroke"" and exited out before I made myself worse. :(",6.115791199309751,6.723698767213116,6.571509922346853,76.53961173425368,66.24590163934425,9.830888697152721,33.429680759275236,9.811843763644266,3.2356885245901634,1264,53,231,26,19,411,182,305,0.18,0.705,0.115,-0.9719,0,0,0,0,0,0,54.0,0,4,0,4,10,16,0,4,20,1,18,12,6,8,3,55,34,25,0,9,14,0,2,1,0,2,6,1,0,2,19,13,0,0,6,2,1,4,6,8,1,1,14,11,32,8,29,14,2,32,0,1,8,0,17,16,0,11,13,156,51,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20485176280389736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0870990911022806,0.0,0.3919247433795289,0.0,0.0,0.08955682149880527,0.0,0.0,0.11401874601659255,0.11973792158722008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10694181727612508,0.0780766472780838,0.0,0.2179740413313844,0.0,0.0,0.11327674062125642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13058654444924295,0.1315738930144941,0.0,0.11032995783612044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20452361829637586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320453093994067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06476131872931623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13383348689887953,0.0,0.0,0.10742779613545096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13144748240160886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13711275978583026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.070389660099267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13915977255763728,0.0,0.0904670023911518,0.06257363327386888,0.0,0.0,0.11334715873128125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12119280895646453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14226849490516896,0.0,0.12907495843723074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09878353105162653,0.0,0.0,0.12019481630789901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08679062072926566,0.09741094596320034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08879485009830031,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12107741482999995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12255568320917727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2461548281922193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10206352785834788,0.1165996219926776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12817293792190812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09065599448859116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1466214605485558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13312461803522166,0.0,0.0,0.11194794972421217,0.0,0.14647114518666124,0.0,0.08509095298330069,0.08206877413677194,0.0,0.101681562445552,0.07468473441971576,0.14720962411038374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273840308250698,0.0,0.11515969718676125,0.0,0.0,0.14299723697593314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305249103336147,0.1819693391964408,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,NJamb,2018/04/03,"Got a minor sunburn today So I've spent the past 5 hours freaking out over skin cancer, remeasuring every mole, and generally feeling sick to my stomach.

I haven’t changed anything in my diet recently either :( I’m not sure what has made this happen... it’s making me sooo self conscious and I just can’t stand looking at my face in the mirror :( does anyone have any tips on what I could do to make it go away?

healthanxiety,greysanatomyfan2,2018/04/04,"Can’t get over this fear... Health anxiety is the worst. I don’t know how to get over it. Every time I’m over one health fear, a new one shows up. Currently I’m terrified I have a pulmonary embolism that my drs are missing. I’ve been short of breath for a month now. I went to the ER and they did a CT with contrast and an X-Ray and said there was no PE, especially since my blood ox was 100 and my BP was perfect. I accepted this for a little bit but now I fear they just missed it. My GP said it’s my asthma and allergies but since my inhalers aren’t working I’m back to thinking a PE. I got dizzy recently so I called 911. They said blood ox was good and EKG was good and agreed it was my asthma/anxiety. The EMT said they can miss PE’s on CT’s though so I’ve been spiraling since last Thursday. I’m so scared this thing is missed and I’m just going to drop dead. I can’t talk to my husband about it because the subject just enrages him at this point. I’m sitting here debating on going to the ER again for another CT but I also know that’s crazy.

healthanxiety,Gladaren,2018/04/04,"Question about recovering from HA First off all I want to thank this sub for helping me get by from a bout of HA recently. I've recently been through straight non stop HA for a month and I've been feeling some physical symptoms that come along with it but today I finally got an all clear from my doctor that I'm perfectly fine. It honestly made me feel instantly better. I got my energy back, appetite etc. but I unfortunately am still experiencing a few of them, more specifically, different body aches, suddenly feeling cold and this burning back pain albeit they weren't as bad as before. I just wanted to ask if psychosomatic symptoms last for a while or are they supposed to disappear right away?

I feel like I fucked up so bad. Like yeah, hamburgers are arguably gross, but I always thought they were just bad for you nutritionally and that was a lot easier to dismiss than ""hey your burger might be harboring a death sentence"". I didn't learn about BSE/vCJD until a few months ago. I feel disgusting. The only beef I really ever ate was ground beef, whether it's from the store or from taco bell or some other burger joint. I ate ground beef frequently and carelessly. 

I have tiny muscle twitches frequently at night and it perpetuates my fear. What do you think the odds are that the beef I ate contained BSE? I'm reading that fast food ground beef uses the mechanically repurposed beef which is basically all the risk tissue smashed into a patty. I'm horrified and terrified. I have panic attacks nightly. I need help.

healthanxiety,areyoureadyable,2018/04/04,"Relapse Advice Hello, Fellow Hypochondriacs! 

I've had severe health anxiety for a couple of months beginning around August last year. Panic attacks, pulse checking, spending way too much at the doctor's office, the whole shebang. 

Around February, I got on top of my shit and turned a leaf. My therapy, healthy eating, and exercise finally kicked in and I was literally like a new person. The health anxiety dissipated and I was able to function. 

But, after a dizzy spell over easter and a whole bunch of stomach problems from eating too many things I'm intolerant to, I've had a major relapse. I'm back to not sleeping, I can feel my heartbeat constantly, I'm Googling non-existent symptoms and struggling to function again. I'm hoping this is just a temporary relapse, a speed hump in what has otherwise been a pretty linear recovery. 

What do you do in periods of anxiety to make yourself well again? What has helped you in the past? What should I do to help me get out of bed in the morning and function through a full day? Help!

healthanxiety,IronSage1,2018/04/04,"24 yer old male w/high cholesterol? Hey, I'm a healthy 24 year old male who has recently lost about 20kg. I'm 180cm tall and weight 75kg. Recently I had a fasting lipid study done, and the results were (mmol/L): 

Total cholesterol: 4.4
HDL: 1.1 
LDL: 3.0
Non-HDL: 3.3
Triglyceride: 0.7
LDL/HDL Ratio: 2.7
Cholesterol/HDL Ratio: 4.0

The doctor seemed quite surprised at these results for someone of my age but for the last year I've followed a very healthy plant based high fibre diet. Are these figures worrying? Does anyone have any thoughts?

I should also mention I’m very thin do that might be part of it. Advice?

healthanxiety,Zoomspoon,2018/04/04,"MS Awareness commercial terrible for my MS anxiety I've been dealing with HA for about 4 months now. Mostly centered around physical symptoms. Recently, past week or so, I've been having this pins and needles feeling in a small spot on my lip thats been coming and going, and some spots in my left leg with the same, but the leg stuff is pretty much gone. I also been having some blurry vision but I've chalked that up to having just started Lexapro a week and a half ago (I hear it can cause that?). Unfortunately I'm still only on 10 mg, likely getting moved up to 20 after a month.  And while the side effects have sure been there, no real benefits so far. Anyone been where I am?

Anyway so I've been doing pretty well with the HA the past couple of days until tonight a MS awareness commercial comes on and all the anxiety flairs back up since that what my HA has been centered around recently. Am I not supposed to watch tv ever? How do you deal with triggers?",4.767271255060726,5.7561003263157895,5.387894736842107,82.46564777327937,69.42105263157895,7.951417004048582,28.299595141700404,8.139509932561175,1.849218623481781,762,26,146,10,13,246,120,190,0.063,0.777,0.16,0.9713,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,1,0,1,17,8,0,0,11,3,19,4,3,4,3,32,28,16,0,0,5,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,8,14,0,0,2,1,0,5,2,1,1,1,9,3,9,7,23,19,6,41,0,0,1,0,4,17,0,4,20,103,17,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12721681304379515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11476837468294597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2195761714716543,0.0,0.0,0.10034857112777598,0.0,0.0,0.2555163984844749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11035367734385887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14742877137393146,0.0,0.24724981159788376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15879589974826047,0.0,0.09255488378005894,0.2959139884733921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12981694687476292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07256516801374037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07498032508628975,0.0,0.08156251299021504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16175110393666173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15592876233120315,0.0,0.0,0.07011386273227625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22910357159981126,0.15253304295704329,0.10549956099330643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10914913097650024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2740013741256451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29201137871312194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16335075078282515,0.0,0.0,0.2834062159195818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11871655422346165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10158019633623352,0.0,0.11461074613214466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16428959644253824,0.0,0.0,0.13526057744035694,0.14916636140267284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23023711151733106,0.0,0.12903663697301962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,niceshrubs,2018/04/05,"I need new ways to cope I’m 26 year old female and I’ve been struggling with health anxiety since I was 17.

Whenever I’m sick or hungover my heart starts racing and I have a hard time calming down or sleeping. I’ve been to the doctor about my heart, and everything always checks out as normal, but I can’t keep the anxiety and worried thoughts away. The best form of coping that I’ve used is showering. On a bad day, I’ll shower around  5-6 times a day. It seems to be the only place I can meditate and really relax and get my HR down. Im lucky to have at least that, but it’s not very practical, especially when I’m trying to function with my day to day responsibilities (school, work, socializing). I need something else to get my heart to calm down. 

Breathing exercises or meditating outside of the shower never works for me because I can’t calm down enough to focus.

healthanxiety,Rising_Phoenyx,2018/04/05,"Anyone else have a fear of cancer? Not looking for reassurance because I know that's not going to help.  I guess I need to vent

A few years ago my friend died of ovarian cancer.  Ever since, I've had multiple phases where I've had an extreme fear of having some form of cancer.

Lung.  Colon. Throat.  Liver.  Stomach.  Ovarian.  Cervix.  Uterine.  Bladder.  Breast

Its like I jump from one to another.  Right now I'm having a bad fear of uterine or cervical based on symptoms I had.

This fear has caused me to have so many procedures done.  Colonoscopy, X-rays, pap smear and breast exam (granted those should be done on the regular), breast ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, etc.

Hi, have been struggling with health anxiety since early 2017 and just wanted to share my experience and offer encouragement. Some days are easy and some days are hard but I’ve dealt with it all...Headache=brain cancer. Chest pain=bad heart. Feeling weak=ALS, to name a few. 

Anxiety can and does create real pains that you physically feel. But most of the time that’s the only thing wrong, the anxiety. The worst thing I did was Google, Googling my symptoms only sent me down a more anxious and depressing path and feeling of impending doom.

I have a pain/pressure in my upper rib cage and my gag reflex is triggered often (i.e. I have a feeling if a lump it my throat). I also have a dull pain on the front left side of my neck that comes and goes. 

I went to my GP and he said the pain in my chest is likely costochondritis without a sinister cause and that the rest could be triggered by a bug/virus, etc. and that I shouldn’t worry - just take ibuprofen for the pain and to decrease any inflammation.

But he didn’t do any tests other than feel around my chest. And now I’m freaking out and worried that he wasn’t thorough enough and that I have some sort of cancer or other serious condition I’m not dealing with.

healthanxiety,BALLZ2U,2018/04/05,"Daily bloody noses, bloody sputum, dry blood in nose, just want someone to clear things up for me. I have bad winter allergies, and recently for the past week my nose has been very dry, i decided to turn on my phone flashlight and shine it in my nose just to see what it looked like. It appears my nasal passages are red and I have dry blood in my nose as well. To be fair i was picking off super-dry boogers which felt as if they were attached to the inside of my nose off, which caused temporary bleeding, but I just want some confirmation. I am a 17 year old kid who just wants to know if i should be concerned or not, I've had 2 nosebleeds today which occurred after blowing my nose (I have been doing that frequently but after looking it up, I've been blowing my nose too hard). If anyone can give me a simple answer on whether or not i should be concerned I would greatly appreciate it, thank you and have a nice day :).",8.539689189189192,5.898839421621624,7.9714527027027025,79.09934121621625,62.8918918918919,10.763513513513512,36.097972972972975,8.472884824447931,2.7372297297297297,723,24,151,7,8,228,110,185,0.033,0.855,0.112,0.9106,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,0,6,6,0,0,5,0,21,12,11,2,1,33,33,14,0,9,14,0,2,1,0,3,1,0,0,1,12,4,0,0,4,0,0,1,2,1,1,0,7,16,22,5,22,20,1,21,0,0,5,0,6,9,0,7,12,103,34,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14340922729675204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.171248187738375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21069205018498605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13227118449487296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19692615705618502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19674860380510745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2261211696147713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18372744184662135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11271644745287845,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10020047883315712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3444611780085277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21521575515411664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19578916221723144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20250944273223387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1634364799954569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17377879340646846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1888265995714978,0.0,0.0,0.13625793784387713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1944088370221658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22308763051603328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16922725517652648,0.3629161833126235,0.0,0.16451717192711138,0.0,0.18440765217981409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14569567057608376,0.0,0.0,0.1320763295126978
healthanxiety,fourth_letter,2018/04/05,"Fear of vocal cord spasm So one of my biggest health anxiety fears is not being able to breathe. I am currently sick with bronchitis and am being treated and have been managing well enough. Tonight my wife was watching a medical sitcom and someone had a vocal cord spasm and couldn't breathe and almost died. This has been a fear in the back of my mind for years since someone that used to work for me actually suffered from that, so seeing it on TV again triggered me. Couple that with my current sickness with bronchitis and now I'm a mess. I am trying hard not to Google and I guess I am just here looking for reassurance and to vent. LOGICALLY I know I am fine and will be fine, but my brain wants to convince me otherwise.

healthanxiety,Millboysean123,2018/04/06,STD Anxiety I got tested everything came back negative and I felt calm. I still worry that I have some disease that is dormant or that they missed it. I have no reason to believe the girl I had sex with has anything and I guess the thing I’m scared about is HIV and that he chance of it actually being HIV or anything else are super super low. I’m definitely a Hypochondriac and have had Health Anxiety for a long time and I managed it until for some stupid reason I went on google like 30 minutes after the fact and now I’m worried I’m spiraling. Does anyone have any input and or tips for helping me control this anxiety. Also I have had no symptoms for any STDs at all prior to or after the testing.

healthanxiety,RadiantKat,2018/04/06,"Should I wait for my appointment on Monday or go now? I keep freaking myself out... Im not seeking any medical advice I just want to know if this type of thing can wait a couple days or if it’s an emergency.

So I have pretty bad depression and it makes me lose motivation to take care of my health.  Despite that i have health anxiety and always thing I’m gonna die lol. 

Well I went to the dentist recently and we scheduled a day to do some fillings and I have one tooth that needs to be extracted but was waiting for a later date. My fillings appointment is on Monday. Just my luck, either the tooth that needs to be extracted or the tooth that needed a filling next to it got infected just yesterday. I had bad jaw pain and tooth pain and my face is swelling. I’m taking some over the counter meds and trying to tell myself I can wait this out until my appointment on Monday. I’m not in any pain anymore but my face is swollen still.

Anyway I know a tooth infection left untreated can get worse and start breaking down your jaw and infect your heart and whatnot and the thought of that is really freaking me out. I’m afraid if I wait half a week to go to my dentist it will land me in the hospital. I just need someone to tell me I’ll be okay and waiting till Monday isn’t long of a wait.

healthanxiety,HollywoodCol,2018/04/06,"Working out worsening my anxiety Hey all,

I'll try to make my story as quick as possible. I've been working out for about 9 year now. I've battled forms of anxiety and depression my whole life. My health anxiety has been at an all time worst this past month. About a month and a half ago I took performance enhancing drugs (PEDS). I stopped cold turkey after taking them for 12 days cause I saw some symptoms I didn't like. Ever since I've stopped, my panics and anxiety have been killing me. My biggest fear is that I screwed up my heart just from those 12 days. 

I don't really fear anything else except for heart issues. I haven't been able to sleep since I've been in fear. I went to my doctor and she gave me all the physical tests (took my blood pressure, listened to my heart/breathing and checked my limbs for swelling) and she said everything seemed fine.

Yesterday I returned to the gym and working out makes me so nervous. I keep thinking any type of physical exertion is gonna cause my heart to stop. One symptom I've noticed is that I feel a weird bubbly feeling stemming from my upper left abdomen, sort of where my chest meets my stomach and it feels like a weird pressure/bubble rising through my stomach/chest and throat on the left side. It's almost like I have to burp but can't. I noticed its been happening and its mostly when I workout. I'm super scared that I have AFib. Hoping this is just anxiety related or stomach related. 

I've been doing so much googling lately that I've come up with about 50 different possibilities of what it could be lol.",4.1019264069264105,5.756725318181823,4.548116883116883,85.31241341991344,71.79220779220779,7.860606060606061,29.71645021645022,8.472884824447931,2.1892722943722944,1250,52,244,21,24,395,173,308,0.159,0.79,0.051,-0.95,1,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,0,1,5,12,20,3,7,8,1,22,18,10,4,4,43,43,17,1,2,5,0,3,3,0,1,7,2,0,0,13,15,0,4,5,2,1,5,4,14,0,2,14,7,37,6,34,26,9,38,0,1,1,1,8,14,1,7,22,146,50,6,0.08668497261751608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07684099795347017,0.0,0.0868024784580907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058948753934282526,0.0,0.33156883392597963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0713343464258729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17809869070571602,0.0,0.07467142829795767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06921089701466758,0.0,0.0,0.11180927213887724,0.0,0.07466163989473193,0.0,0.0,0.09056734642937474,0.0,0.08872574263082489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10052704757893932,0.0,0.07241417144919693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07841152054088447,0.0,0.0,0.07790686390932237,0.0,0.0,0.2926340821549174,0.13149158024224705,0.061927761758429976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07665523500415106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09214207232035353,0.0,0.41088843969450745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08609773709356927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090476589949756,0.0,0.07704958659635118,0.09590407875408664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09778442484419872,0.0,0.1883669527714759,0.0,0.06122815973895415,0.1270496969814676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11572578468407164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13838223624084445,0.0,0.06372342897465827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19738283173834406,0.0,0.0,0.0587399808703533,0.0,0.0,0.10170613804592188,0.0,0.0,0.0827506149725216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19544856393955515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05553261315436308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08245725961824796,0.0,0.08678677990587425,0.0,0.0,0.07891474341110243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14341341025399906,0.0,0.08674757546803831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2174175558131256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18019775526562645,0.06517631133042194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.055544230267520034,0.0,0.0,0.05054670463535742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19262038826369132,0.05885340625624803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803578380760152,0.0,0.09678067622861626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18932307743577828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05582228028721423

also, “does anyone know how painful it is and how easy it is to tell if you have pulmonary edema?

healthanxiety,arunnano,2018/04/07,"17, Need professional help but not sure if parents understand that I'm 17 and male. Since last year I've constantly thought im going to have a heart attack, cardiophobia. It's really starting to get in the way. 
  
It started with bad heart palpitations and arm pain and I took multiple trips to the urgent care center and a few ekgs, and they all said I was fine. It takes me so long to fall asleep at night because of this, I get anxiety attacks often, and I've formed a habit where I need to knock on wood almost all the time to calm me down a bit (weird habit)  
  
I'm not overweight and I go for bike rides a lot but my dad is always telling me to workout because he loves working out. I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat. He's trying to have me do guided meditation but for some reason that makes me way more anxious than when I started. He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't ""committed to his solutions yet"".   
I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help. I went to them in tears a couple weeks ago saying please just let me get some professional help, and my mom said she'd find someone. Fast forward to today and I found out she got my a family psychologist, one that already sees my 10 year old brother (he gets very angry).   
I wanted an actual therapist, I'm not sure if it's the same thing and my mom is saying that ""he's just going to say the same things we've been saying and it's going to cost a lot""  
I'm not trying to make my parents look bad because I get they're trying to help, and my mom used to have a lot of problems with depression and anxiety when she was a teen so I'm sure she gets it, but I just dont know what the fuck I'm supposed to do anymore. Looking for any advice. I usually take my mind off it by hanging out with my friends by the campfire at night and that sort of stuff but I moved from New England to TX 3 months ago and I haven't made any close friends yet.  
I just need some advice, this stresses me out so bad every day thinking I'm going to die, please and thank you so much.",2.8244690090801434,4.0211701789709196,4.320350704040006,87.50415811290961,74.27964205816555,7.4064745361231745,24.78016844321621,7.928766900206844,1.1934790630346097,1678,52,366,24,34,560,209,447,0.153,0.718,0.129,-0.9341,2,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,1,2,2,14,22,3,2,19,0,19,9,5,5,6,81,73,33,1,10,17,7,1,0,2,0,2,6,0,1,19,26,1,0,8,2,1,15,9,12,0,2,12,10,47,10,47,58,15,59,0,1,3,2,37,15,1,11,28,211,66,4,0.0,0.0,0.06332860352711678,0.0,0.0,0.12683017656853576,0.17257771785614054,0.0,0.06498342480154105,0.0,0.07161374914463832,0.0,0.053998217848141024,0.0,0.0,0.08826227053603082,0.0,0.09928969203968732,0.07331339323711908,0.06435885417195923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1476558990489608,0.0,0.0,0.1625549845914462,0.15823866994231006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07084902990013378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06616524218955201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07012893312957276,0.0,0.0,0.07180558745284993,0.0,0.04185220028976338,0.0,0.05589436094271827,0.0,0.06735123739434684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07605699081944453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054677220384971664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06117766013069136,0.07302542972611621,0.03281309231599642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059313270872523714,0.0,0.0,0.0711545176286961,0.10027613626011346,0.059994803126734275,0.2373363801668294,0.0,0.2581710811220159,0.0,0.0519028242736455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307042825591849,0.21749028024885525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07009822832296493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035664845315808845,0.05289845791496948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06636000030303715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05743043619526831,0.10899167697874164,0.0,0.0,0.16551538737812935,0.0585706824994954,0.06140564933436424,0.08663644126529832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655259106896461,0.2280143203257303,0.10359786727711602,0.06897359927343633,0.04770562694094452,0.14435747444738029,0.0,0.0626764355497117,0.0,0.1217999781598012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0680968642158935,0.0,0.08794968064363548,0.0,0.06905334038472644,0.0,0.14411744749545444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14247144534136671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06209618682721973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08314738138939078,0.06672333683089153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12346087865061693,0.2064298844917901,0.0,0.0,0.05171327618744432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053682191605121436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05498570906078823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1378000127785853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07433752529942388,0.0,0.07428977072865088,0.0,0.0,0.1834895971063559,0.0,0.09758661276537617,0.0,0.0567214887059463,0.0597470166724605,0.07421360934183642,0.07534862593917607,0.08622731439942792,0.041582387679074816,0.0,0.05151974297043285,0.037841062121553914,0.0,0.061513304021761674,0.0,0.07210123914849187,0.22029877301337375,0.0,0.0,0.0675584580938806,0.0,0.05604883758812372,0.0714731761444805,0.0535455473932753,0.11483106354872888,0.1030219842744136,0.0520552201667612,0.0,0.0,0.06015873763729403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0472446646850228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08358109164005369
healthanxiety,iphone1234567891011,2018/04/07,"Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", results in mental issues and gastrointestinal tract issues Hello,

I am 27 years old male. I am a lonely guy that drinks a lot of beer. I drink only beer intentionally, so that the harm of alcohol is less. 


Recently, however this is still becoming an issue. I let my alcohol addiction to beer to overrule my healthy life. I smoke a lot of cigarrettes and I drink beer every day. I also drink so much coffee. My life is good, but recently I feel this anxiety. My overall performance is getting lower too.


A few months ago I noticed that I have swelling exactly bellow my ""Xiphoid process"". It is something internal. I have Gastrointestinal tract issues. I feel stomache discomfort, as well as drifting issues regularly. I researched about symptoms and could not get any information about it...

Recently I feel a lot of anxiety and it is messing my decisions and mental health already. I think this could turn into dementia or something serious. It could be a cancer, as well, I don't know.


I could have possibly gone to a doctor, but the problem is that I come from a poor family and owe around 500 euro for health care, which I cannot spend at this point. 

I hope you guys could help me identify the possible reasons for all this, so I can make some adequate response to it.. And I will see a doctor soon probably. I am just a bit scared and unaware of what I did to myself. 


Hope you guys support me and give me advice, Thanks!

**EDIT;** Also, I have been very anxcious around people ever since child. Every time I talk to someone, I feel something like pain in my stomache and have to make effort for all my conversation. I ended up a quiet and lonely guy because of it. This is the whole reason I abuse alcohol, cigarrettes and coffee. I wanted to overcome something psychological to be more connected. This abuse was obviously affecting my digestive system or something.. i don't know. I know that this will become a nightmare and could possibly be the reason for my death some day.

**Edit:** sorry, I am actually 30 years old male. I am so embarrased right now. 

**TLDR:** Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", anxiety, mental disorder due to beer abuse and smoking

healthanxiety,throwaway-0035801386,2018/04/07,"Please help, i'm mentally breaking down slowly. Am I going insane? I dont know why but I keep worrying about having a hormone issues, I have some symptoms of low testosterone, low ring finger (I dont see any men I ever met ever having a short ring finger), puffy nipples that developed over time. I'm docile and weak and I'm isolated 24/7. I keep telling my mom of the symptoms I have and we went to a doctor before and I just told them to test my testosterone around 2 pm and they said it was normal! 

I later realized I had gyno but not enough to be noticeable at all (I juts have puffy nipples) but she wont take me to the doctor again to ask him about it.

healthanxiety,dfrizado,2018/04/07,"Sick of taking anxiety medication ast year I was paralyzed on my left side due to a lesion on my brainstem. I recovered thankfully and learned to walk, talk and eat again. I have documented the last 15 months since being discharged. I have tried different medications (a lot) for my residual symptoms. Equilibrium and gait issues, depression and anxiety, cognitive issues and most importantly my severe neuropathy. If I didn’t take my medicine I was so itchy and uncomfortable I would be clawing at my feet and legs and actually leaving pretty big cuts. I was losing my train of thought and having trouble finding certain words. I have been in the medical neurology field since I was 19, I’m 34 now. I know about medical issues and treatments and all of them have such a negative impact on daily life. I had to make a change. I started taking CBD oil and weaned myself off all my meds. I feel great. My thinking has improved. My speaking skills are on point now. I am no longer losing bits and pieces of a conversation. I wish I did this sooner. Like I said I recovered, but I was left with a lot of symptoms, things that my grandparents are complaining of and even though I’m only 34 this is my life now. I can’t go on the rest of my life taking pills everyday. So now I take CBD oil in the morning and at night. I started out slowly and gradually increased it. I decided to start selling it to get a discount on my monthly oils. Im not a sales person but if I can benefit from this, I am sure other people in the same boat as me could too. I was desperate and willing to try anything and now knowing I can take something that is all natural and not made by a pharmaceutical company and it’s legal makes me feel so good. I don’t mind talking to you personally or just go to the website. http://www.hempworx.com/DfrizadoI I wish you luck on finding your cure to be pain free, now that I’ve tried this I am not going back to pharmaceuticals.

healthanxiety,Growing-Old,2018/04/07,"Diarrhea...every single night! So in the past couple of years, I’ve shit the bed while sleeping, three times...after the second time, I figured out I’d had a stomach ache prior to going to bed. So then I started taking Imodium anytime I had the slightest stomach ache before bed. It’s gotten to be less and less effective at stopping it, and even had a breakthrough accident recently, even after taking ten or 12 pills before bed! I take a LOT of sleep meds due to severe insomnia, so when I wake up from it, I can barely shower and change sheets without a dangerous fall. 

The anxiety: what’s going to happen when Imodium ceases to work at all??

Oh. Not to mention I can never even LOOK for another SO again...😢

Also WHY is it happening just at night??

I don’t get diarrhea during the day!  I’m actually somewhat constipated during the day!

Last time I was on a plane it was a three hour flight and thought the whole time I was going to have a heart attack in the air and not have any help in a dire health related situation.

healthanxiety,secret_cuttle,2018/04/07,"Struggling to discern between anxiety and ""real"" symptoms How does anyone manage to deal with health anxiety, when you clearly have symptoms of something and it isn't just a general worry about dropping dead from cancer or a stroke? 

A couple of weeks ago I noticed I had ""air hunger"", that sensation that you aren't getting enough oxygen and I have begun to get vertigo / dizzy or lightheadedness quite frequently. Here in the UK it is quite hard to get a Dr's appointment that isn't an emergency one and I have got one booked in for close to the end of the month. The last week has been horrible for me, because while realistically as a 29 year old I am not at a huge risk of lung cancer or heart failure and I cannot stop obsessing about how serious this illness could potentially be. Especially because it is clearly not a common cold, but if it is real maybe a viral infection like labyrinthitis. The problem is that the more I worry, the more things happen like palpitations, stomach ache and such like. All classic anxiety symptoms that I am sure are due to my HA, but my mind just cannot reconcile that the simplest explanation must be true. Its the opposite of how i operate as I am a scientist and normally think very logically. 

In the past I have spoken to the GP about my HA, but they don't really seem to do much about it. I asked if I could be refereed to someone, but instead was told to look up self-help related stuff online. Weirdly, I worry that being labelled as a hypochondriac on my medical records will bias a doctor towards me if I am require treatment. 

Just have no idea how I am going to get through the next few weeks until I can see a GP for a 10 minute ""lets do nothing and see what happens"" waste of time.

healthanxiety,mistakelord,2018/04/08,"Stinging pain in far left side of chest that’s worse when I move my left arm. Hey guys.

I’m trying to get some help identifying what this may be. 

For about a week I’ve had a constant pain in the far left side of my chest.

I went to the doctor about it, who said my blood pressure and heart sounded fine, so I should just carry on as normal. 

However, having HA I’m freaking out that it’s not “fine”. 

I have noticed that if I raise and lower my left arm, the pain comes on sharper as a burning, stinging like sensation in the same far left spot on my chest.

Any idea what this may be, and if I need a second opinion?

After that, I went straight home to rest . I did not think of any disease or symptoms , I thought that happened because I was away from sport for a long time ,A week later I started paying attention to every detail, and these are the symptoms that I have:
Diarrhea. Blood in stool. heart palpitations . I think I lost weight too. Exhaustion. Vomiting. After Googling these symptoms it turns out to be Colon cancer . I'm so scared right now .

My HA started 6 years ago, when I fell ill, had a number of tests on my head and heart over the course of a few weeks. During this time, I convinced myself I was dying - too many different ailments to list.
I started having panic attacks, usually when in a crowded area, that were debilitating.
Cue lots of therapy, medication and 6 years later, I felt I had it under control (I still have bad days and symptoms, but not as bad as previous). I haven't had a proper panic attack for a couple of years.
Then today. I've had a cold for a few days, and had taken my daughters to their dancing competition, when suddenly I started to feel dizzy. This quickly became a cold rush through my body and tunnel vision. Heart rate doubled, blood pressure rose, and I was expecting to pass out.
I have friends at this competition, and I asked them to call an ambulance. Trip to a&amp;e, 2 ecg's later and given the all clear, I'm now resting at home, heart rate slowly coming down, and the cold rushes are getting further apart, and I'm mentally drained.
Does anyone else get lasting effects from an attack? Particularly the 'cold rush' feeling.",4.589535864978902,6.215749746835443,5.726434599156121,77.45817510548524,70.51898734177216,7.6295358649789025,29.200421940928273,8.167268648758528,2.203513080168777,978,38,170,14,18,325,144,237,0.182,0.743,0.075,-0.9791,1,0,0,0,0,0,39.0,0,0,2,2,9,17,5,5,16,2,15,10,6,2,2,24,30,18,1,1,3,1,3,0,1,0,4,0,2,0,5,12,0,1,4,1,0,8,2,13,0,0,13,7,21,4,27,17,8,45,0,0,0,0,7,11,0,1,26,113,26,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08218697330928489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10045754371641503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06482905159763909,0.09499830618423756,0.0,0.0,0.0866767686353798,0.5273881059870389,0.0,0.0,0.15482766078811072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10298636600282528,0.0,0.0,0.09467321044322304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07986646253874267,0.0,0.0,0.10398866709948254,0.0,0.1025882826489396,0.0,0.11958805728385885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622437506139854,0.0968682901306285,0.0,0.0,0.08113623200372433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07745216400902243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09375980083192216,0.0,0.08902171943443234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163200646712213,0.0,0.0968803702772676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0741533047182341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09515317176712593,0.0,0.0,0.3296060513820521,0.0,0.0,0.1860030383214509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557576150793735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06548792004613473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07882366793181142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939992811868651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09340142653195624,0.09343573164442848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4351281152299576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19687418711307988,0.0,0.07404296734015081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09636722906290854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060286114441659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05406333565909678,0.0,0.17576749786493606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10211336827989972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07437103196637834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17911782963074488
healthanxiety,powellax18,2018/04/08,"Pressure on head likely due to stress and anxiety, but knowing this doesn't make it go away. Hey everybody, 

20 yo Male here.

To give a little rundown for the past year or so whenever I have any sort of problem with my body I tend to assume the worst and can't stop thinking about the issue until I get 100% confirmed of the problem and that it is solvable. A good representation of this was in December I thought I was having heart palpitations, and it really stressed me out. Long story short and a few doctors visits later, I had an ultrasound of my heart, and I passed with flying colors, where there were no signs of any problem with my heart. After that day, my heart did not flutter once and hasn't really since because if I ever start to get to that point, I remember the ultrasound and how good it was, and the problem will cease. 

More recently however, my lower right abdominal was hurting and after some googling (which I know is bad for me but I still do anyway) I believed it could be appendicitis. So I did my classic worrying and got some bloodwork done and a CT scan, and there was classically no issue to worry about. A few days later with some medication, the gut problems went away, but then I had my first nosebleed in a few years. I live in upstate New York, so this should not be an uncommon thing, but it spiraled into something very aggravating.

This is where we address my current issue, which is a pressure on my head that is likely some sort of tension headache. The pain level in my head is extremely low, probably around a 1, but I can tell all the muscles in my neck/shoulders are now tense. I have been doing my classic Googling, and I'm certain that all these symptoms I have been getting are solely due to anxiety and stress, but knowing that isn't taking away any of the tension in my head. This problem has caused me to have trouble falling asleep, making me wake up in the middle of the night, and waking up much earlier than I would want to. Last night it felt as though I just laid there and didn't sleep at all, but I'm sure I likely did. I am now on a more or less sleep schedule of trying to go to bed around 1 am, not being able to until 2:30 am, then rising for morning at about 7:30 am. This whole process is likely what is causing my stress, but is also something that is tough to conquer due to my stress. I have started to work out recently, and usually after hitting the gym I am feeling ""normal"" for a little while, but right when I wake up my symptoms manifest and it's back to this anxious version of myself.

I am not sure what I am hoping to come of writing this, maybe I just want someone to tell me that what is happening is solely due to my stress/anxiety so I can affirm that even further. Or, maybe I want somebody to reciprocate with me and tell me they went through the same thing, and let me know how they got through it. Right now it just seems like a constant cycle that is very tough to break, but I'm hopeful for the future.

Hope everyone has a great day, and thanks for any help.",7.31032668881506,6.078108526578077,7.368225913621262,77.97696788482835,64.23255813953489,10.086467331118492,35.182945736434114,8.936278230431713,2.8733028128460694,2391,91,472,31,30,772,270,602,0.166,0.753,0.08,-0.9953,3,0,2,0,0,0,64.0,1,0,2,3,31,38,0,9,29,0,61,21,16,6,7,105,99,51,0,17,21,0,2,5,0,3,5,0,2,1,36,34,0,1,11,1,0,9,11,23,0,1,21,4,59,15,78,69,18,89,0,2,2,0,12,36,0,15,48,352,95,2,0.0577554899487728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046187044445549816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15710285474122326,0.0,0.13254837518125046,0.0652472641954949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10282926185869314,0.0,0.0,0.16278955200402515,0.044410406736970616,0.04822342165879846,0.03520721060569525,0.0,0.0,0.0650706593230851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0641533292898908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11866159531859954,0.0,0.04975124057029185,0.0,0.062413166620921175,0.0,0.04611305911710542,0.0,0.0,0.11174253907346217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05911519127222454,0.0,0.05910391849540535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03814695640616585,0.052243147222866534,0.0,0.05518784570319947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02920291107640338,0.0,0.05545432762112156,0.0,0.0,0.049126790246020416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052457918488344,0.055404328696130406,0.0656475518273515,0.09688512955673988,0.09238468275289913,0.0636756315633129,0.0,0.0,0.051072989021265086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23709518058677806,0.0,0.0,0.2737621346845512,0.03871228747918453,0.0,0.0,0.17209269977833255,0.0,0.0,0.061828446517616716,0.0,0.0,0.1808451784774448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696362735718225,0.04707843283080742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05905890152678371,0.0,0.14108207523243882,0.11577234768058844,0.0509991557543938,0.051111791145385985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07710447603907042,0.0,0.11604630503803035,0.0,0.0,0.05818257993767593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042456930544193715,0.0,0.0,0.05578061208976237,0.0,0.10839922970547183,0.056588117498176486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06150771186016255,0.0,0.0,0.06145591337030758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05513415032601055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05459760622571597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062270186603550076,0.3315852229900928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07399929155005157,0.0,0.11405315730037847,0.0,0.06542571135206532,0.14796861853684876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05257842890486123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04777593811438996,0.0,0.1155944005457831,0.0,0.048936039209946235,0.08892599568101471,0.0,0.0,0.0817592661032335,0.0,0.046123608878897736,0.04828617571682151,0.3969523116053271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10886773153714123,0.12006013647782278,0.04342494068206739,0.0,0.15144253167447946,0.05317349545003623,0.0,0.0,0.0767403623685903,0.03700738589470179,0.05674447563402999,0.045851407668494895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03921218650528744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06360951254441373,0.09530865570392236,0.10219705309479682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10707983562001147,0.0,0.06448194196035092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042046684547272,0.11730700712235308,0.0,0.04102784297364825,0.0,0.0,0.07438528387778046
healthanxiety,ana-carime,2018/04/09,"Hydroxyzine for Anxiety After having anxiety for most of my life, I had my first panic attack last night. I went to the ER today to make sure everything was working okay (I was experiencing chest pains) and I told my doctor about my anxiety. I've never gotten treated for it because it hasn't been totally  unmanageable until lately. I am a 22 year old college student so most of my current anxiety/worriment comes from the stress of school. The doctor prescribed me Hydroxyzine 25 mg. 

Since this is my first time taking anything for anxiety, I was wondering if anybody has taken this for anxiety? If you have, has it helped? Any experiences with hydroxyzine will be helpful. 

Thank you so much in advance.",4.693567708333333,7.379418304687501,5.901250000000001,71.75208333333336,72.984375,9.266666666666666,31.760416666666664,9.725611199111238,3.8149510416666663,565,27,88,16,12,188,88,128,0.134,0.795,0.071,-0.7622,1,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,2,0,4,3,8,1,2,4,1,14,5,1,1,3,12,23,6,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,5,3,0,0,1,0,0,3,2,4,1,2,9,1,15,4,16,12,4,17,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,5,13,66,20,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09733020468699333,0.0,0.5474528352171872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11778003902479953,0.0,0.0,0.16282584608800232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0872479375465159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12328989020892055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2929898976623307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1286319133949709,0.14000414035198466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434848460589049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1918679260390082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11666633330916835,0.16145172628917615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1010937284042332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09553734013971316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1052136639287566,0.0,0.11038715990352076,0.0,0.0,0.1343135264158578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15018606914195895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15229555535221312,0.16792686143915622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1448505826716772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1183948399523652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16394970374943724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13489402992418328,0.0,0.10761251594232496,0.0,0.0,0.13177067226689754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08345759291022427,0.0,0.13566617842597262,0.13676248792230666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13267871339336765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1552134303811224,0.10419702226637102,0.14535082807048816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09216808844689622

so last wednesday i went to my towns urgent care because i suddenly felt as if i had to pee and nothing was coming out (typical uti symptom) i also had a lot of uncomfortable back pain. i went to urgent care and they tested my urine and it came back positive for a uti but negative for a kidney infection! 

the doctor gave me two prescriptions to help with the pain and discomfort and the overall uti itself. i finished the last dose of my antibiotics this morning and now it feels as though my uti came back! i have the sudden urge to urinate and can't tell if my back hurts or not, i'm stressing out bc idk if this is normal or not and keep assuming the worst. 

if anyone has ever dealt with anything similar i would appreciate some advice/comments on what to do :( ",4.1327472527472535,5.292854205128208,5.212399267399267,82.50057692307695,71.05128205128204,8.648351648351648,27.77472527472528,9.04235418022936,2.138934065934066,770,27,155,15,14,254,111,195,0.188,0.691,0.121,-0.9536,1,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,0,1,0,13,9,0,2,9,0,17,11,4,0,1,43,33,26,0,8,12,0,2,0,0,2,7,0,0,0,9,19,0,1,5,0,0,6,7,7,0,1,10,2,20,2,21,20,3,27,0,1,0,0,5,7,0,10,14,117,29,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10183641500544503,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09741729890776638,0.0,0.0,0.08904141722667552,0.0,0.1047927102477728,0.0,0.11904882347845328,0.0,0.0,0.4895958017359685,0.0,0.07762731201933715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4369405346622824,0.2596700238775216,0.0,0.0,0.10969500305924293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13034129426968702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1151893325421695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06438861389474045,0.0,0.1222695669156759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536000496380768,0.0,0.0,0.08535554982713725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13632366855889272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11318860279027652,0.0,0.0,0.1399691277213611,0.2076036205008139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10826274533852573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12476942586605445,0.12218935961838835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2710045630174689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1458713542844508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13235847877622714,0.0,0.0,0.11130368331794188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12511417518273835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12439592971550086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23609708544502894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09046104798431727,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,JohnnyLong123,2018/04/09,"Consistent head pressure around sinuses and vision has felt off for about a month. Is this anxiety? So for the past month I've had this strange consistent head pressure on the right side of my head around my sinuses and something about my vision has been off. It's the best way I can describe it. I've had my eyes and vision checked and they said everything looks fine. It's almost like the link between my eyes and my brain isn't quite working right. This also came on pretty suddenly out of nowhere. Other than that I don't have any other symptoms of anxiety to speak off. No panic attacks. I sleep just fine. I've always been a bad hypochondriac but I've never experienced physical symptoms like this so I'm not sure if I can attribute it to anxiety or something else. I've also been to the doctor and had blood work done and everything was fine there as well. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

healthanxiety,Kelekona,2018/04/09,"My mouth is falling apart again. Not your usual post, but I think I'm in the right sub.

My teeth had always been bad, but I got a lot of stuff repaired when I had insurance.  I have a few teeth missing, some that are root canals with very little tooth above the gumline.  

Depression and rum-coke means that I got a few spots that will need care, and I'm having trouble trying to brush because the toothpaste hurts the cavities.

Today was a new low.  I've broken teeth on potato chips, a stray bit of gravel that got into my spinach... I had a temporary crown that would fall off at the slightest provocation.

Today I was eating CHEESE and I found something hard in it.  Luckily I didn't crunch down, but one of my metal fillings fell out.

I have been FML over damage in the past, but now I am unusually cross.",3.2694711538461547,4.9471428125000045,3.88625,89.12144230769233,74.0,6.6730769230769225,23.55769230769231,7.321109707123232,0.8520961538461536,630,18,129,7,13,199,109,160,0.212,0.736,0.052000000000000005,-0.9783,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,0,1,3,8,0,0,12,0,16,6,5,2,0,20,27,8,0,2,5,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,7,6,1,0,3,0,0,5,2,7,0,1,12,2,16,1,15,13,5,28,0,5,0,0,1,14,0,2,8,82,23,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14976143447446782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15027945145556373,0.10971681633335634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19649634324614615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18350608552535813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15502029525041694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18416896872837088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19734359862358292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4318498865105588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1612306649354224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19267701683963434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18039164688749645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1530162959023115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19605576984540693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334561479488733,0.0,0.17383004976329045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12196208374695125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17181547021041266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17237529765050547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.153705689486249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13856078012917689,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2060390708150956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532673254523106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3412083219290996,0.0,0.0,0.12219758938056825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19822738253966676,0.14850597495438597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1278557498493044,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,katysbrown,2018/04/09,"Side effects from taking my adderall in the morning and drinking alcohol in the afternoon around 3pm? ive been on vacation in the bahamas since march 31st til yesterday april 8th. Everyday we were super active always going out on the boat in the sun all day. On April 7th i took 20mg of adderall 3 times that day spread out between 2hrs each dose. So all together that day i had 60mg.and about an hour and a half later of my last dose i drank two rum punches throughout 3 hours time. After that about 2 and a half hours later i had 2 other rum punches again in a spand of 1 and a half hours. I never got drunk just felt pretty tipsy and good. I went to bed around 10:30pm feeling fine, not drunk at all. I woke up around 1230am with heavy vertigo and my stomach started hurting i went back to sleep hoping i would feel better in the morning. Well i woke up around 7am to get ready to leave for our flight and the vertigo was back and the stomach pain. I only puked twice i felt better after i got home in florida around 4pm i was 80% back to normal. I went to bed around 10pm last night and woke up today around 8am i feel like im in a daze like sleepy but i feel very out of it i feel depressed and have loads of anxiety (which i already have normally) i dont know whats wrong with me im freaking out, im scared this has permanently damaged my brain and in going to feel like this forever. Is it because im off vacation? Or because a counteractment with my adderall and alcohol? Someone please ease my mind i hate feeling this way. And any pointers on how to get myself back to normal :(

healthanxiety,Ameelio,2018/04/09,"Just listens to an old interview with Aubrey Plaza. She talked about how she had a stroke at age 20 Like most of you, my constant fear has been health related more so the fear of having a stroke. She described what happened during the stroke and it is absolutely terrifying. She said hat she was feeling fine and then all of a sudden the right side of her body was paralyzed. She couldn’t even speak or make out any words. 

After listening to that, I started freaking out immediately. I’ve always been struggling with anxiety and panic attacks and now this story reignited those fears. Purely because it could happen to someone so young with no health problems.

healthanxiety,Kornell2018,2018/04/09,"Fear of Cancer Hello,
My friend 5 years ago was diagnosed with a big tumor in his head, which turned out not be a cancer. He figured out by accident, had no headaches and no symptoms like that. 
They removed it, but he went through a lot of stress and is still taking injections everyday. 
 After this, me as a person suffering from anxiety, got to live with this fear, that there might be something in me, that i might not be aware of. And even when i have a headache or something like that, fear kicks in. 
No one in my relatives had cancer and i know that this already decreases the chances, but still, i do a overal blood test, once in three months.

healthanxiety,StarShot77,2018/04/09,"Heart Disease, depression, anxiety, and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions, something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress, anxiety, depression, anger/frustration, I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. 

Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease, something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet (although my cholesterol was only 150, with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol, CRP, or interlukins though). 

I have also been pretty sedentary (though that is very slowly starting to change) since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more (I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession). I used to get very angry at video games, I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy, and I'm depressed and socially isolated. 

I have no know history of heart disease, but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January, so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases, my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health, a bit of hypochondriac. I vape, don't drink anymore, and and am an on and off smoker. 

All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however, and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease, I will risk low mood, higher inflammation, and more clotting and an early death than take those. 

I have often been pointed to exercise as the key, which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga, even if its ""relaxing"" because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. 

I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular, good sleep is also out of the question because, for some reason, I rarely sleep more than 4-5 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy, I'm just a bit lazy. 

I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions.

healthanxiety,meowcheese,2018/04/09,"Terrified of a brain bleed... This sounds so ridiculous but I dropped my phone on my head yesterday from about an arms length. The corner of it just happened to hit me on the perfect spot right above my temple. It hurt pretty bad for a few seconds, but then I didn't have much pain. I've stupidly been googling like crazy and keep reading about hits where people seem fine and then just die from a subdural hematoma and that they can take days to weeks to cause problems. 

Ughhhh I also take a daily baby aspirin for a blood clotting disorder and people on blood thinners have a higher chance of a bleed. 

I feel ridiculous, I haven't have a trigger like this in a really long time!! Today I am having a mild headache and pressure in the base of my head. I'm terrified but I feel like going to the er would be overreacting to a bump from my stupid phone. 

I've been trying to keep myself from reaching out for reassurance but I can't help it today! I know you guys understand.

healthanxiety,Isabella2424,2018/04/09,"Started with Ectopic beats; now I feel like I’m having heart attacks! In January, I had started having “funny” heart beats. The. One day I was sitting in class and a felt warm all over and then my heart started to race and then I broke out in a cold sweat. I went to the ER and got a ekg(normal), heart attack blood marker test(normal), and a chest xray(normal). While I was there I found out the “funny” heartbeats were ectopic beats.

My primary care sent me for hotter monitor(confirmed benign ectopic beats), stress test(normal), and echocardiogram(normal). This still wasn’t good enough for me so I asked to have a CT angiogram to make sure I had no blockages. This came back clear.

I had a couple good weeks and was getting good at ignoring my “funny” heart beats and then just days ago I started to focus on odd feelings in my left chest almost under my armpit. No sweat, shortness of breath or any other symptoms. So I went to the Emergency room and of course everything normal.

No matter how many times I tell my self to calm down everything is alright. It just does not work and I just focus more and more. It’s really getting to me 😩",4.151388888888889,6.1785254351851915,4.167777777777779,86.555,72.42592592592592,6.466666666666668,25.88888888888889,7.1686216300943375,1.1957055555555556,898,30,168,9,18,276,124,216,0.112,0.7240000000000001,0.16399999999999998,0.8777,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,0,0,6,10,15,2,1,10,1,12,13,12,2,3,33,31,19,0,1,5,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,5,15,0,1,4,0,0,4,5,5,1,1,15,5,23,10,24,16,4,35,0,1,0,0,4,14,0,2,17,109,28,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09371069143546984,0.0,0.10585911806540778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07189037932310607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09883001640232032,0.24053400229695496,0.0,0.0812889362570315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12091072930070484,0.1077843189422664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697253850718782,0.0,0.13635590999710095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09251262207850076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923269647313506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1900211157833342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10690618489802388,0.07552339933101354,0.10150376081598088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11591193455172667,0.0,0.0,0.11046430011532543,0.0,0.0,0.2660082298087491,0.08455059454763694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6263687486517533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1148605422752082,0.0,0.0,0.05164740727777328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07056612738308994,0.10717924361698246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1035790530687776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07163577216423292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06772425807203898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11028465076665983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993047917822685,0.0,0.08442478638637943,0.0,0.12109710886114045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963590450527317,0.10987920960687388,0.0,0.0,0.092400281888899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06164374184770589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08479885008189489,0.0,0.0,0.19599923918017867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07696237236074124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,Drayelya,2018/04/10,"Anxiety, panic and my heart I don’t really get it, I mean I do but, I don’t at the same time. Like today, I just had a really bad panic attack all because I went for a walk. I’m 26 and quit smoking about a month ago now. I know nothing is wrong with me, except that I used to smoke and am struggling with things like shortness of breath etc. but, every time I get my heart rate up even a little or feel short of breath my anxiety kicks in then quickly turns into a panic attack. I get ALL the usual symptoms, tight chest/chest pain, light headed, fast heart rate, and those agitating urges to hit the toilet among other things. 

I’m afraid of having a heart attack and constantly monitor my heart. It’s debilitating because I don’t want to go for once enjoyed walks, a run or even work...nothing that would increase my heart rate even a little. I really do hate it and I just want to get over it but, the slightest internal change just sets off my panic. 

I’ve been to several doctors, though not since I stopped smoking, and everything has always come out fine. No heart problems on ekgs, ultra sounds or X-rays etc. No major problems in the slightest. 

My mom thinks I’m insane. She used to have panic from excessive worrying but, never health related anxiety. She’ll confront me about it sometimes and I think it’s just so she can tell me how crazy I am anymore. As soon as I try to explain my fear she rolls her eyes, waves her hand and walks off with some ridiculous verbal response. I wonder how she’d feel if people did that to her years ago with her excessive worrying. I’ve told her to stop talking to me about it if she’s going to be that way but, it hasn’t deterred her. 

She tells me she’s been right where I am but, got over it and treats me like an inferior because the magic trick she used doesn’t just work for me like it did her. I call it magic because it was like she was all better over night.

healthanxiety,jrsmusicman,2018/04/10,"Anxiety/Antsy 2 weeks Post-Op Septoplasty/Turbinate Reduction - Need Support Hi all! 

First time poser here. I am a healthy 28 y/o Male who recently just had a Septoplasty/Turbinate reduction 15 days ago. I am a very active guy and usually very ""chill"" and outgoing. 

For those of you who don't know what that is, it's for a deviated septum and you have splints up your nose for a week with a ton of congestion and basically can't do anything while recovering but sit at home (I live by myself with family close by). 

Due to the surgery, I was instructed to not be super active for 2-3 weeks (I am a runner and take boxing classes). So far my nose and breathing feels fine and is healing normally, but the past few days I have been experiencing super anxiety/restlessness/antsy behavior that I have never experienced before in my life. Let me explain a bit.

8 days ago I got the ""splints"" removed from my nose and had a minor complication the day after where my nose bled for 5-6 hours and I went to the ER and they packed it with the most painful ""rhino rocket"" thing up my nose that was the most pain I have experienced in my life. I immediately saw my ENT 6 hours later and she took it out and was pissed they didn't contact her (it was 3am). She said everything looks fine and is healing correctly and gave me the number to call if anything like that happens so she can be contacted.

I got relief that day and was able to take a nap/sleep but the next day I got a migraine I tried to wait out that kept me up all night but ended up taking my imitrex to relieve it. A few days later I got oral thrush (didn't know until the end of the day on Sunday when my Uncle told me what it was an not super serious) with a swollen uvula where I felt as if there was ""something stuck in my throat"" and driving me crazy.

On Sunday I think everything just hit me at once: not being able to workout, being cooped up in my house, the whole trauma of the bloody nose incident, the swollen uvula driving me nuts and not healing as fast as I wanted to, living alone with my dog, etc. I started pacing and my mind was racing to the point where I was like do I need to go to the ER for anxiety or do I need to call my doctor? I have no history of anxiety/depression and have never felt this way before. I am not even close to suicidal thoughts or any self-harm. 

I was able to sit with my Dad and talk for a few hours while watching the Red Sox then have Sunday dinner at my grandma's with my whole family and that helped a lot and by the end of Sunday/Monday I was feeling better (though the oral thrush is still annoying).

Today I had some restlessness/anxiety at work that started resurfacing again like on Sunday but talked to a co-worker who used to struggle big time with it for a bit. 

Is this normal after surgery? Any thoughts/recommendations/words of encouragement?",5.435867930359535,5.4934497110332785,6.272840733491298,80.00158004532814,67.65148861646234,9.589801174410221,30.104100133923968,9.402419484367199,2.4315403935304416,2239,76,457,41,34,741,262,571,0.106,0.818,0.076,-0.9761,0,1,1,0,1,0,66.0,0,3,2,6,14,20,2,1,37,0,44,22,9,1,5,78,81,42,1,8,16,1,4,3,0,0,12,1,1,2,24,34,1,2,9,2,0,7,12,7,2,1,32,18,61,13,68,43,15,85,0,0,4,0,28,26,1,8,52,304,85,4,0.22077484832407446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13046905483146326,0.0,0.0,0.07621872021773342,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10008964503500456,0.0,0.11259476978705572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12111925928967585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12524209005857478,0.0,0.0,0.06508580408829874,0.16068596945699445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1502905361644714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3796840344573996,0.0,0.06338435111899034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07532413743034043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19554098616842108,0.0,0.08207410502562804,0.04860656838028893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322787986861862,0.0,0.13875125236107286,0.0,0.07442026456974513,0.0,0.14131898434042905,0.0,0.0,0.06259699106719137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041823811353649216,0.0,0.235431752494638,0.0,0.0,0.0728672700043472,0.06507682308428188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04932690903251834,0.0,0.07381839124996273,0.0,0.21741875389263268,0.08491484438914745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08088805525188525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07525241345499238,0.1039598696394916,0.10785943912280556,0.0,0.12996549056858828,0.0,0.06179842300861065,0.0,0.0,0.06256496035394662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07430655365754228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1637017526043557,0.11351678224346895,0.0,0.07826551860956647,0.06906074648458753,0.14420831761258715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07837266938451913,0.0,0.0,0.1566133362673275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07025152464004181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06956786413453964,0.0,0.07048042562988684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07266284274795565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07000247922925078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767721053357735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07364476309306488,0.0,0.0,0.0566544214410232,0.0,0.0,0.1041770493104587,0.0,0.0587703596860345,0.0,0.0,0.07693393560902123,0.0,0.08049728361955485,0.08351089385928012,0.0,0.0,0.16599521017082233,0.11830030685351388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04889099973378383,0.047154536102802035,0.07230338918109089,0.05842352292648361,0.08582372632137844,0.0,0.06975624722859433,0.07031994289064218,0.08176299328273612,0.04996387665679737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06355952803785872,0.08105076819777803,0.12144158085328473,0.043406241873539975,0.05841359945877723,0.17709226639200987,0.0,0.0,0.06822016541499121,0.0,0.16432482255297404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10715114599711946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,ubercool-RA,2018/04/10,"Brain / Neuro issues? Hi all,

Like a lot of people with h.a., my biggest fear is having a brain tumor.

So, I've had some weird vision things for the past year and I've been to an opthalmologist twice (because the first time wasn't enough apparently). I sometimes see glittery floaters or what appears to be a quick line through my vision. Also, I sometimes have funky peripheral sparkles. My opthalmologist performed intensive tests and said my eyes look extremely healthy. 

I think I'm ""seeing"" these things because of my anxiety and stress of my life as a college student. It's just very concerning it doesn't seem to go away... But the doc probably knows best.

Also commonly, headaches are pretty common...

Finally, maybe once a year I'll have an ocular migraine where I get some weird vision tricks and my lips and fingers seem numb. Although these are probably nothing major I've been wanting to get an MRI just to be sure.

Mother thinks most of this is caused by me over committing to activities and my academic stress in college but some of these symptoms seem so real it's hard to not think it's a neuroloical issue. Ive been told to try deep breathing and  exercise. Have of you experienced these things?

Thank you everybody... :/ ",5.292471855115026,7.3410565462555075,5.286923641703378,79.61974424865396,69.44052863436123,8.39246206558982,31.113313754282927,8.998388855275968,2.775207733724914,984,42,172,19,18,307,142,227,0.094,0.8140000000000001,0.091,0.2526,1,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,0,2,0,3,8,11,1,3,12,0,17,12,6,1,3,33,36,16,0,1,6,1,2,1,0,0,6,1,0,0,13,8,0,0,7,1,0,2,3,7,0,2,7,8,16,4,22,27,9,17,0,0,4,0,6,6,0,10,10,109,29,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.188047120137108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08994347704680006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11046426117341088,0.0,0.0,0.14334354237077718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12338623243402275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2625020280466633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078046743629407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1214849512617293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1323029798456474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12879612448737168,0.0,0.10000803838222233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12285469963631113,0.0,0.06681978254604704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10532284577242572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24543256961344326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06461537205207409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08304570599852949,0.05744051880544857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09873220668980703,0.0,0.0,0.09995686453592427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11811847741567587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11281503373035473,0.0,0.0,0.1252120396571624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11223729851598713,0.0815107256849727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11961461283643285,0.2535284385863353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13382448928898702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11183941129206973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18738186308085472,0.3211037507027193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2325665802075808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2693603077270943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11081172024091136,0.122203981543671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10824596818260318,0.0,0.0,0.23433201314771396,0.2260092334823069,0.0,0.0,0.06855810774387487,0.0,0.0,0.11234660688553386,0.0,0.07982475210436357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09701052775952528,0.06934795154382782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15142707854242904
healthanxiety,allypatra,2018/04/10,"Afraid of Rat Biter Fever I have really terrible anxiety, panic disorder, and crippling health anxiety.




I got 2 pet rats from a breeder and they are babies so they are scared. They pooped on me and I used a tissue to remove one of the poos from the towel they were on in my lap. But later I was scratching my nose with the same tissue because I didn't realize that was the one I had used and now I'm worried that some germs passed through the mucus membranes or something.

healthanxiety,BeerAddict,2018/04/11,"I think I'm losing my mind Hello guys, long time lurker here. I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.

It all started last summer, when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP, said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test (I was 20 at the time). I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. 

Fast forward to last week: that pain came back, exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day, compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days, but today I saw in a stool some dark-brownish spots which I believed to be blood.

This has gone too far. I have no idea what I should do, but I want to get out from this dumb situation.

healthanxiety,Bopas,2018/04/11,"Terrified of colon cancer Hi everyone,

I'm in full blown panic attack right now and I can't function properly because of it. I've practically convinced myself I have colon cancer. My symptoms are:

- blood while defacating (especially while constipated, but when I'm not I sometimes feel my anus hurt and see the blood on the paper then)
- diarrhea, constipation
- pain on the right side of abdomen for over a year now, it comes and goes, now it's mostly in my upper back
- extreme fatigue 
- I've had black stool once, but it was after drinking red wine so I thought then that's the cause

I'm also scared the cancer is already in my bones/spine, as my back often hurts and I can feel some kind of ""dent"" in my spine. 

I'm also diagnosed with severe anxiety (duh), so sometimes it's hard to tell which symptoms are real :( For example my fiancee tells this ""dent"" in my spine it's just my muscles contracting because of my anxiety. The same can be said about diarrhea, fatigue... But then again, how do I know when it's anxiety and when it's real?

I know I should just wait for the colonoscopy in 4 weeks, but I can't function properly right now. I've made mistake and visited a forum for colon cancer survivors and not only they all have symptoms similar to mine, but lot of them were very young, like me. 

My doctor told me it's probably IBS and hemorrhoids, but my mom had colon cancer at 50 and I've read it's getting more and more common in young people and here I am, crying myself to sleep every night, because I'm convinced I'm dying. What should I do?",4.372703427719819,5.62299194098361,5.369605067064086,81.25783532041731,70.57377049180329,8.299552906110284,28.94560357675112,8.710501217029153,2.2226393442622947,1222,46,234,21,22,402,158,305,0.222,0.7509999999999999,0.028,-0.9965,0,0,2,0,0,0,45.0,0,0,2,0,20,13,1,2,9,1,19,26,11,3,1,43,37,31,1,3,10,1,3,1,1,2,13,1,0,0,14,13,2,1,5,3,0,2,4,9,0,0,8,7,30,4,28,26,8,41,0,4,3,0,10,17,0,4,23,151,44,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12240532212944855,0.1774087650365051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545653638459508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12618992933115109,0.0,0.1705845331424747,0.0,0.20285129181517772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1139475762924826,0.0,0.09554958814278464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12184274475422965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11258362100635876,0.11511965240670854,0.0,0.0,0.11353349412589045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10866145306373268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09345667353412668,0.10599084298165316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11217111750121483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05795223166809814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09936443581264463,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2374888558575619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1155083230294096,0.12191979701443638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05419094691213972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09430202324454637,0.0,0.10495719574965946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12991065106426286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1040928993390544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11812844199412745,0.0,0.08436127367335652,0.11802896056782874,0.13014321305203733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0768994344101458,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11959281045740268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11095214114022672,0.2525073221976471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2841806635811849,0.1055123408711033,0.0,0.11105239668318473,0.0,0.08839057172259755,0.0,0.0,0.12531042743576806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100223066957043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21940963389020476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3458716745951643,0.0,0.0,0.1939016509997383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08805977636480683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10599084298165316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09152236903606144,0.0,0.0,0.08897503718402691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0714302111558818
healthanxiety,Sufficks,2018/04/11,"How to escape an HA hole when the symptoms persist? I’ve been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection, but lately I’ve been noticing some other things (which I won’t mention so you don’t fall down the same hole Im in) and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea: Googling my symptoms. I came across something rare, sporadic, and deadly (of course) and I’m now constantly worried that it’s something that could be far more serious. Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom, I didn’t mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding. He felt the area and chalked it up to side effects of the sinus infection, but of course since he didn’t SPECIFICALLY say “it’s not ____” and the symptoms have come back, i’m now back to spiraling between “you’re just making it worse” and “maybe I should make sure just to be safe.”  Any advice to get my mind off of the possibility when I still feel like I’m feeling the symptoms? 

I have this huge urge to go back to a doctor and get specific reassurance, but I know that’s problematic in the long run and could end up getting expensive for no real reason. Not to mention I’d feel a bit ridiculous.  Really starting to think I should see a psych, as I haven’t since my anxiety began as a more generalized disorder a little over a year ago :/",8.116294800605754,7.002885215547702,8.096398283695105,73.01926678445233,62.56890459363957,11.477940434124179,37.882130237253925,10.608840637214634,3.9068427057041903,1168,50,219,24,14,379,153,283,0.135,0.78,0.084,-0.9584,0,0,2,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,0,2,14,10,2,0,22,1,18,15,0,6,1,52,41,21,1,5,9,0,5,1,0,3,15,1,0,0,16,13,0,1,11,0,1,7,9,5,0,0,10,7,18,5,32,23,6,37,0,0,1,0,10,13,0,1,18,143,34,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0933279068170902,0.08466080447913242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06494773706792288,0.0,0.0730622583464602,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22031595221487216,0.0,0.0582199135994103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10426842947786746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10923406343453533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08227044624197853,0.0,0.10320866395328207,0.0,0.2287626544178501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0969371498063371,0.0,0.0,0.10945879409692977,0.09775501293830947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08459046588503986,0.0,0.0,0.06308118330988095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14487296185666335,0.06822990681661187,0.18340255346970472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14969470992156195,0.0,0.05427858000745668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10781528314759413,0.10316347572745976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05248790864027687,0.0,0.10773556165748972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046659681861472985,0.09572266537460963,0.0,0.08452030175642805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12750274321352575,0.0,0.09594917825941073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09643440153445916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10873485359635927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21533859655796708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870737634956623,0.061183949059637525,0.09819665210217188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07595065127778093,0.0,0.0,0.07610636446004236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15800802967904587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14705123456877087,0.0,0.0,0.06760003599534595,0.0,0.07627166360597831,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09001380420110383,0.5956073189741597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19035094756828166,0.12239349680153548,0.09383471203261574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09052905327545728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08853553960658929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09699154948338938,0.09732934580461826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06150309447876901
healthanxiety,DrJackBlack,2018/04/11,"Excessive neem oil Today my skin was in flaming. I was getting frustrated and angry so I used heaps of moisturizer then neem oil.

While applying my skin was feeling iffy and I noticed my heart racing. I wasn't sure if this was because I was getting anxious or not so I stopped and went online and looks up the dangers of neem oil.

I only used it externally but I used quite a lot. 

Was I getting poisoned? 

Should I be taking precautions, I'm unsure. I took a quick shower to try to rinse off the excess.

Sorry if I'm just wasting time.

healthanxiety,dyt1991,2018/04/12,"Worried about getting sick from tattoo ink A couple of years ago I got a big tattoo on my back that's mostly black ink with some red parts. I've since developed severe health anxiety and I'm currently worrying about the toxicity of the ink, specifically the red ink which my tattoo artist said contains cadmium, a known carcinogen. I've read some sensationalist articles that made me really worried, but I've also read more legitimate sources say that there are no reputable studies that link tattoos with long term health issues. I guess I'm just freaking out about the cadmium. 

I mostly just need advice on learning to cope with this anxiety. Thank you.",5.655630252100838,8.098083680672271,6.106462184873951,72.47750840336138,69.33613445378151,9.465882352941176,31.227731092436976,9.888512548439397,3.5347640336134463,534,23,86,14,10,172,80,119,0.159,0.8140000000000001,0.027000000000000003,-0.8921,1,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,1,0,0,8,2,0,0,7,0,1,3,0,1,0,19,10,3,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,6,5,0,1,3,3,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,5,7,1,13,7,7,10,0,0,3,0,3,4,0,5,6,48,13,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16257732832491406,0.1474792254050084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13304806648006334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2545490875871011,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1279302198025021,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.184088059840822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08692278952574402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.133063325010306,0.0,0.18327811856445805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35369247706144125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17364971510594476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1472344694894555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1574257275821552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12336313619971433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801652565341924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3328351414315457,0.0,0.10658251442388493,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1582583920224803,0.13230612782818468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1879536231108828,0.0,0.13762509090367234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15317348928776106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5068781950507303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10713846613606916
healthanxiety,Splendorific,2018/04/12,"Balamuthia I have severe health anxiety. I go to therapy for it and had it well under control. However, in January, my ex husband passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. We have a daughter together. Since then, this shit has been out of control. I can't leave her parentless. I can't. 

In my depression and mourning since her dad died, we have been pretty inactive. I'm not a gardener. I don't plant things. I take care of my house plants and that's it. On a whim, I bought some flowers at Wal-Mart. I thought it would be nice for us to plant them together. I wanted get back into being a normal mom, a good mom. 

So, we're outside planting these beautiful flowers. I'm a hypo already and I couldn't stop thinking about damn N. Fowleri, of all things. I know I can't get it from dirt, but we were breathing in so much of it! I didn't know to wet the ground before digging. We just went after it. I thought breathing through my mouth would keep me safe. Wrong and stupid. By the time we get back inside, my nose is all stuffy and my throat hurts. I assume this is from dirt and allergens. I ignored my compulsion to Google for a little while. Then I got a weird metallic taste in my mouth and that was it. 

I found Balamuthia Mandrillaris. FML. Fast forward two days. My eyes hurt, like they're tired. I had some brief photo sensitivity, but I attributed that to playing Skyrim all day yesterday in an attempt to maintain control over my thoughts. My sinuses are still full, but I'm not congested. I can feel popping and pressure in there, but no snot and I can breathe fine. My irrational brain tells me that this is a direct result of amoeba eating away my soft tissue. It is not possible for this to be run of the mill allergies or a sinus infection. My head doesn't throb or anything. It's a like a sinus headache, but very vague. I can move my neck and all just fine. I don't know if I have a fever. The kid hid the thermometer some where. It's messed up, I felt fine when I woke up this morning. No nasal problems. It wasn't until later on it started up again. Now my face is twitching in weird places. Which I read is also a symptom of the amoeba infection. 

I already know this is rare. I've researched it thoroughly. I'm scheduled to see my doctor tomorrow, but I want to go to the ER. I can't just up and take my kid with me though. I can't let this shit disrupt her life. She's spent many hours with me in the ER already. What am I supposed to do though? I know something isn't right. I don't want to die. I don't want to leave my baby alone. The inside of my nose is twitching as I type this. And I don't want to be the one person on this forum that guessed right about some horrible disease. Help me y'all.

I was just listening to [a podcast](http://www.borntoprosper.com/how-to-destroy-fear/?ap_id=amandahayward) by Shane Krider and wanted to share here because I think it's relevant to the sub and listening to the podcasts has helped me start taking control of my thoughts and given me more confidence overall. I'm doing all the basics for my anxiety - eating well, exercising, meditation, medication - but this seems to be the icing on the cake for me! Really enjoying it.

But now 2 weeks later I still have difficulty breathing and I sneeze pretty much every day(no runny or itchy nose) and I still don't cough,so I'm leaning more towards spring allergy or asthma(even though I never had asthma).so not sure what to do and I'm having anxiety attacks because of it.",5.262922077922077,5.988252305194807,5.8172987012987045,80.78451948051949,68.15584415584415,8.237922077922079,31.63376623376623,8.238735603445708,2.3474774025974017,621,25,116,8,10,201,101,154,0.108,0.835,0.057,-0.7574,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,0,0,0,9,3,1,0,5,0,13,9,6,1,3,24,21,18,0,4,8,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,7,7,0,0,2,0,1,1,5,1,1,0,7,3,9,2,9,14,3,22,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,6,15,72,16,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2966765349050389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1338230494183894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1280158969190243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1903752742488328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10200991081652903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079215142693191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17128125988504728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11052757528838472,0.15137009428737078,0.14099254947479334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08461296147116651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1479796600060681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09196658923580056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301536031531465,0.0,0.12906418940899944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279185553160784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17024660875529904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15918022092919884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13842673425075472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11844527442152095,0.0,0.2672785004735204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15771751572822867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11117435017674596,0.0,0.1644123121137502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5369254803450553,0.0,0.15046023169821127,0.15512737723219375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,muffahoy,2018/04/12,"How to manage health anxiety when awaiting results. I have had health anxiety most of my adult life, it comes and goes, changes depending on my life stresses and what is happening.

I went for my annual skin check, and the dermatologist pointed out a mark on my face she wanted biopsied. Apparently the doctor the year before told me to get it biopsied, but I didn't book a follow up appointment. (I call BS, if the previous doctor had told me I needed it checked, I would have been pushing for the next available appointment).
So I had it biopsied yesterday, and the Dr wrote path report BCC? (Basel cell carsinoma).  So I have now googled the life out if it and convinced myself it is the worst possible outcome, overanalysed every comment the Drs said during the procedure (it's not coming out easily! Has it infused with my brain?? I left it too long!?? )

My skin and moles have never been a trigger for me in the past despite it being a likely genuine health problem for me (fair skin, family history etc).  How am I going to get through the next week until I get the results??    Usually I can have small comfort that my fears are somewhat irrational....

healthanxiety,ibraalenn,2018/04/14,"16 year old with chest and back pain. I’m 16 years old, for the past 2 days I’ve had mild back pain on the top of my back in the middle and also some chest pain, some shoulder pain here and there also. Should I be worried? Currently having some chest pain. I do vape if that makes a difference. Goes away if I lay on my side or stand on compared to laying on my back. I also do have higher cholesterol than normal. So I don’t really know if this could be health and cholesterol related or just posture related.",3.0305,4.288360847619053,4.0258928571428605,89.57598214285713,73.85714285714286,7.154761904761906,22.648809523809533,7.6454224807358475,0.7978809523809529,399,10,86,5,8,129,66,105,0.172,0.8109999999999999,0.017,-0.9509,1,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,1,11,5,0,0,4,0,10,10,4,1,0,19,13,13,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,1,0,8,0,11,8,3,21,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,8,11,58,10,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155523317713632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12357631486284115,0.4045523319073223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10501562003076202,0.0,0.0,0.08482566001394276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1374203550317515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13980973044736827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07228518506226819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0877969767504148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12887100442313154,0.0,0.0,0.2760362137235517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6997834204351917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12555981086944382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08426117929230108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13357461338253773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16940139858757886
healthanxiety,BadAtThinkingOfUNs,2018/04/14,"HA strikes again... So... I’m not looking for reassurance or diagnosis or anything really I guess. But I just had to share with some people who might understand.

I have a long history of health anxiety. Can’t get a cold without convincing myself I might be dieing. Frequent rabies scares. I’ve convinced myself something was seriously wrong a couple times a month for years. I’ve mostly talked myself out of seeing a doctor because I know it’s just anxiety and I don’t want doctors to think I’m crazy or wasting their time.

A few days ago though... I found a lump under the skin above my right rib cage. So I did the logical thing and poked around for a lump on my left side... I thought maybe I felt a smaller similar lump and talked myself off the ledge.

But now I can actually see a lump on my right side in the mirror. And when I prod around, it feels like there might be a cluster of small lumps (only one is visible though).

So... of course I’m worried it might be cancer although Dr. Google tells me there’s all sorts of benign explanations.

I’m currently talking myself into seeing a doctor for peace of mind. But I hate the doubt telling me this is anxiety and I’ll be wasting the doctor’s time. I’m terrified the doctor will label me with hypochondria.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. I’m just frustrated that I can be terrified of illness and doctors at the same time.

Anxiety is torture that worms into everything and just makes me feel so confused.",3.0933422674886124,5.243092090592334,4.256463414634148,84.20657129455911,75.82926829268294,7.342213883677299,26.36947199142321,8.263242389622931,1.8455088180112569,1158,44,222,21,26,378,159,287,0.212,0.728,0.06,-0.9911,1,0,1,0,0,0,37.0,0,0,1,0,17,15,3,3,20,1,22,17,2,1,1,51,47,21,1,1,12,0,4,1,0,5,15,0,0,0,9,14,0,0,10,0,0,0,5,8,0,1,6,9,28,7,27,31,5,32,0,0,4,0,9,17,0,13,15,142,37,6,0.0,0.0,0.0863943349258712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784781616668245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2709065550479192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728541861806221,0.15762426953649747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053968206654701256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09795883102481684,0.0,0.05709573254161855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09188210440527897,0.0,0.0,0.5436967264590153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07956673681585087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08952874782049662,0.0632471861165252,0.08500447952187598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09707062662245716,0.0,0.0,0.04625424842176476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0975278367457747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08740689350498301,0.0,0.09410523861561036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09730960165493042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09619013655469702,0.0,0.0,0.0432522001057744,0.0,0.0,0.07834791963268767,0.07434447406535506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05909571115250301,0.0,0.08894216360886349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3756732969424465,0.08939195180610586,0.0,0.0706652945482422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059991486808138,0.0673324770651058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0613768519402528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08478905965976218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05671578335758089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15121146769322175,0.0,0.0,0.08863584707893207,0.0,0.21164531606033749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06815615933958341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21347569241942874,0.15476151438132466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0588166410206151,0.05672764798334987,0.1739642269208686,0.07028441622870284,0.2064945830350015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0921647996412702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05221839111966154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07988624305380948,0.0,0.0,0.08534156408619772,0.0,0.0,0.08990841213361504,0.0,0.0,0.09679570264293304,0.0,0.0570116220984471
healthanxiety,UninspiringNucleon,2018/04/14,"‘Palpable lymph node’ - I’m terrified... So two and a half weeks ago, I went to the dentist with a tooth that was shaky after a previous filling had fallen out. I’d been feeling a bit weird in my throat, on the same side too. 

She looked it and firstly said, it appears I have gingivitis. 

She had to extract my tooth (surgically, by altering the gums) and said it was infected, so put some medicine in it and temporarily closed it. The next day, I went back and she opened it all up and then sutured my gums back together. 

When she checked my lymph nodes (mainly under my neck), I directed her to the mandibular node, which had been noticeably hard for maybe a week before. She called it a palpable node and said it could be due to the infection and the antibiotics (amoxicillin) she prescribed should take care of the infection. 

Well, almost three weeks later and I’m freaking the f*ck out. My infection appears gone and I’ve had no pain on that side since the extraction. 

My lymph node is still as palpable as before, but what’s worrying me is that it’s painless, whereas when it’s an infection it’s usually quite tender? It’s hard but a bit rubbery and moves around. It could’ve been around a lot longer than just the three weeks it’s been since I need to push it out a little from against my jaw to feel it - but I can REALLY feel it. 

I had a couple of random lumps in my armpit, groin and side as well, and whilst it felt hard, they had sort of pus coming out of the end so I assumed they were harmless as they went down after a couple of days. This was before the dentist. 

I’m scared it’s lymphoma. The reason for this is:

-Night sweats - I’ve had this on/off for the past few years however. But I’ve noticed it again despite keeping cool. 
-Temperature regulation - out of nowhere I’ll get quite warm and then get a bit chilly again. 
-The node is pretty much painless but despite the infection going, it’s still the same size and hardness. 
-General fatigue (but I have that anyways), recently it’s been muscle aches
-I’m a smoker... and at times in the past year I’ve been very heavy. 

I’m just freaking the fck out. Can anyone let me know if they had anything similar? Or just put my mind at ease?

I know I should go to the doctors but I’ve just built up such a resistance to it with how much anxiety I’ve had over it. I fear having to face the issue and find out I have something serious. 

I’m booking a GP appointment for a couple of days time. But until then, anyone have a clue what this could be? :/ it’s slowly consuming every second of my life.

healthanxiety,lolygagging,2018/04/14,"I convinced myself that I have esophageal cancer. So I am 22 years old without any known digestive issues like GERD or anything. However for a couple of weeks now my stomach hurts like hell everytime I swallow something, like a cramp when the food is passing into it.

The last few month have probably been the most stressfull of my life so I had a lot of acid reflux issues which in turn can lead to only one logical conclusion that it hurts because my esophageal cancer is blocking most of the pipes and that I am going to die (/s).

The symptoms have gotten better over the last week now while I had vacation and only swallowing large portions causes the pain or when there is a lot of sauce on it. But that is a state I reached a few weeks back and it eventually retuned.

Anyone have some input here, because I know how much of a hassle it would be to get my doc to order a gastroscopy. So far he only gave me these acid absorbing pills or something like that but I am not sure that they helped all that much.

healthanxiety,VikkBlack,2018/04/14,"Scared of HIV, extreme anxiety, dont know what to do Hello folks

Soo, for a long time I had enlarged lymph node behind my ear. Then I went to the doc. She looked very worried. Sent me to bloodwork for a few tests. Then I became very anxious, like my life will soon end, then I somewhat learned to deal with it, I became less anxious, then more anxious again, as I got sick frequently. Recently not only the lymp node got bigger, I got a few test results from blood work.

I have not good levels of some stuff but I cant understand it and I dont wanna research, HIV results not here yet. Bad thing is, I am always anxious, feel like my life will really change. I  have thoughts of how the area behind my ear will hurt very much and I would need operation. Recently it feels like the area is stiff, like a muscle I can't relax.

What to do? Tell friends? Try to get engaged and not pay attention to it? Try relaxation? I feel very lonely in this situation.",1.388441102756893,3.7676020947368407,2.7196240601503767,91.67903508771929,83.3157894736842,5.724310776942359,22.205513784461154,7.07126945348624,0.7123408521303265,738,25,154,10,21,238,113,190,0.13699999999999998,0.71,0.153,0.8479,0,2,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,1,5,13,0,1,8,0,16,10,3,3,0,26,30,10,0,3,5,0,3,4,1,4,7,2,0,0,9,4,0,1,8,2,1,2,8,4,0,0,7,6,21,9,19,19,7,20,0,2,1,2,6,5,0,2,17,97,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09317189932800933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566031954098349,0.5059980396607684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0934941760622182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11845435835968712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11544097266742775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2624669692525631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099176325805213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16985327974182093,0.1599894597412391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08651135579051969,0.0,0.058502145867021314,0.0,0.0,0.09391904440833032,0.2686691289514441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11987120501883375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06153835274080189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15818204823545215,0.2188206796992912,0.0,0.0,0.09909406333737764,0.0940305250778182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08231426976389132,0.08302780235132047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08516178576576246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07173384379079667,0.0,0.2211229647813245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210618336236364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12586422574679434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1281842126511782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09787080103843067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07439099822833034,0.0,0.0,0.08889538389851401,0.06529333320536146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15204690761469394,0.0,0.0,0.11656958520336205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3695633337544418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10380164513216524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0815188966828105,0.11371571738344408,0.0,0.07954359608846732,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,drkphntm,2018/04/15,"Would you go to the doctor again? Alright. This is a pretty long story... I haven't had a UTI for about 5 years (I'm a 27 yo F) but about a month ago, I was in China and got one. Went to the doctor to get antibiotics, took them for 5 days. 2 days later, I developed super intense middle super low abdominal pain that almost made me faint - Broke out into a sweat, couldn't stand, ears began ringing.

Went to hospital where they ran some tests and said the infection was still there, so they gave me another batch of antibiotics. These made me feel super ill every night (btw, at this point, the UTI stinging symptom is long gone) and by the 5th night I felt sick af and was vomiting.

Went to hospital the day after and I still had the infection. So, 3rd batch of antibiotics. Went to hospital the 3rd night because I was nervous I had a UTI that lasted so long. They told me I still had an infection and that it was severe, So I should stay at hospital. Didn't feel comfortable doing that in a foreign country, so I got on a plane to Melbourne (where I'm from) the next day. 

Dad picked me up and took me to hospital. I did indeed still have an infection so they gave me a new batch and sent me on my way - I was asymptomatic at that point. 3 days later, I have muscle aches in my leg, I start feeling super weak, and my heart rate was really high (180 when I arrived at emergency) shortly after being admitted, I developed diarrhea. Doctor on duty thought I might have an undertreated UTI, so they administered new antibiotic via IV. I was discharged the  next morning.

Considering how long this UTI lasted, I followed up and had a new urine test 8 days later (last Monday) Called my GP's office last Wednesday and the results were normal (yay!) But was feeling worried because since Tuesday, I felt ultra uncomfortable in that region down there. Had an ultrasound on Thursday and went back to the doctor on Friday explaining my concerns. He told me my test results from earlier in the week were completely normal so it was highly unlikely anything was wrong. Gave me some tablets they apparently usually give to ""old ladies"" with bladder issues.

Started feeling okay Friday night and Saturday. This morning (Sunday) I woke up and started feeling the same horrible, sharp pain that almost caused me to faint in China. It's right below my belly button, but at the pubic bone and it's SUPER fucking sharp and intense ☹ I've taken 6 paracetamol tablets today (spread out) But the pain hasn't completely disappeared. All this shit is making my hypochondriac tendencies go mental. It's almost 2:30am and I'm struggling to sleep because I feel so uncomfortable. I saw the doctor on Friday, I know, but this pain is fucking intense. Am I being paranoid or should I go back to the doctor tomorrow? I feel kinda stupid because he kinda laughed me off on Friday too... but... I'd also rather be safe than sorry.

healthanxiety,FeatheredDrake,2018/04/15,"I might be dying, and my anxiety is going nuts I might have messed up yesterday. I'm an avid codeine user. I don't do hard drugs because I'm too scared of damaging my brain or other organs, but over the years, it has become increasingly difficult to lead a normal life without the help of a substance, considering that I have severe anxiety, depression, depersonalization, derealization and Pure O. So I started to consume codeine once in a few weeks in order to be able to function correctly, since I've tried around 20 antidepressants and SSRIs and nothing worked for me.

Yesterday, I took another dose. I buy OTC pain relief pills which contain codeine phosphate but they also contain paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin and, in order to stay safe, you need to do a cold water extraction in order to remove the acetaminophen and aspirin from the pills. Opioids are highly soluble in water, so the codeine dissolves and the other ingredients  get filtered through a fabric and removed from the water, leaving a crystal-clear substance containing just codeine. However, I was in a hurry yesterday (stupid excuse to overlook my safety, I know) and I didn't wait long enough for the water to reach the right temperature (it needs to be around freezing temperature, but not frozen) and I did the extraction anyway. The water came out very milky and that is a sign that the extraction was not successful. I didn't know the water needs to be COMPLETELY clear and I didn't look it up...I took the substance anyway.

A few hours later I did some reserch and found out that I might have potentially intested 4 grams of paracetamol and 5 grams or aspirin. 4 grams of paracetamol is a risky amount, because it can cause liver damage. The liver, then, continues to self-destruct over a period of 2 weeks (!!!) without showing any serious physical symptoms so there's no way to know whether I overdosed or not...it ultimately leads to necrosis and then painful, slow death. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My health anxiety is sky rocketing right now. I wish I would've been more careful but the deed is done now. Does anyone here have experience with paracetamol poisoning/overdose? I'm going nuts right now...",7.109127439724452,8.262245990049756,7.1713432835820905,71.18631458094144,64.22388059701493,10.363719862227327,36.357060849598156,10.389873798559362,4.083005051664754,1776,84,290,42,26,570,210,402,0.154,0.7759999999999999,0.071,-0.9874,1,0,2,0,0,0,63.0,0,1,1,5,15,15,1,1,29,0,34,21,3,3,3,62,56,31,2,5,13,0,2,0,0,3,12,0,0,0,12,23,6,5,5,1,1,10,10,11,0,0,13,4,26,4,42,36,7,52,0,4,1,0,4,19,0,7,18,191,38,4,0.10224456174667622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08176493908887425,0.0,0.110781939935197,0.0,0.0695298081031577,0.10721233785895563,0.2346504296416055,0.0,0.0,0.07149177487774767,0.0,0.0,0.18203867412087787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12465467168212398,0.11292108550195833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1141387452160504,0.0,0.11694054037615595,0.10424514494356872,0.1050333294745901,0.0,0.0,0.10720147770719803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08806309121198827,0.0,0.10611371275855573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08947490499845916,0.1046316852204696,0.0,0.0,0.11857123112615504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564596397847198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001480058144696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210588457219343,0.0,0.0,0.05341856352397638,0.0,0.11621588133497235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.091591044446417,0.0,0.0,0.10868118796546086,0.0,0.0,0.06853237451593408,0.10802699310133776,0.0,0.0,0.10069029772191047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2247637488387239,0.0,0.0,0.10826222794045677,0.0,0.0,0.07221835769259817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09048321969708577,0.08585968091631704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3253959673173313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2274391409970681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10017796193577982,0.09810641454701524,0.0,0.0,0.10888712135869927,0.0,0.0,0.21759084495212772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.261948891230602,0.0,0.0,0.10236464301643364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10666337661213382,0.11550725201630335,0.0,0.0845777580429983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07236922705416866,0.10897909875013773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10627124839828284,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2271949403317476,0.06941734591669298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0843624713577506,0.0,0.08115697402189936,0.16402884027258316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11757620008569,0.1971202178362028,0.0,0.0744352586784335,0.0,0.0,0.0726316031250506,0.0,0.0,0.06584214554522506

healthanxiety,KindCardiologist,2018/04/16,"Self-diagnoses, panic attacks, and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection (health anxiety, right?). Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. 

Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack, and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning, I felt like I got a ""hot flash"", and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. 

So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer (thanks, WebMD). I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point, I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. (Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, which had recently been clearing up. That's another story). So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the x-ray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. 

Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then, my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream, and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed, which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. 

I started a gluten-free diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a follow-up blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot, though still nothing like it used to be.  

So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While gluten-free has definitely helped, and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety, in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress, and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before.

healthanxiety,wildpantz,2018/04/16,"Stomach related cancer Hey guys....I've been having problems with my stomach lately, it started on September. Basically, I had tons of things to do on my uni, got really stressed out and started feeling like my stomach, or better yet the area above it felt heavy. I started running by that time and I ran almost every day until the real winter kicked in (around two month period). I also started eating more healthy and I stopped eating after 7PM for quite some time. While I ran I almost felt as if a weight was in my chest and as if it was jumping while I was running, so I visited my doc.

In the meantime, I lost quite some weight. I was usually around 100kg (+-5), and last time I tracked my weight I was at 83.

The doc basically said it's all stress related and she took my blood, urine and stool sample.

Stool -&gt; negative for H. Pylori
Urine -&gt; everything good, except high amount of proteins in urine (I had wisdom teeth extracted and took antibiotics a week before, so I'm not sure if it's related to that, if anyone has something smart to say regarding this...please do)
Blood -&gt; All good

She gave me a prescription for Controloc pills (proton pump inhibitor) and told me to take them for two weeks at least.

Well, newsflah. I'm stupid. First of all, I started taking them and the situation improved. So I stopped taking them after around 5 days, forgot one day and figured oh well, if it doesn't hurt it's fixed. Then, another period of high intensity workload on uni arrived and so did the pain. I started taking them again, but for a week and it improved a little. Later I figured I won't be my own doctor and I stopped taking them, so for a while I felt just a minor annoyance above stomach, but nothing alarming or hurting so I ignored it.

Now, back to another high intensity period, my stomach is going crazy again, I google, telling myself not to do it, but hey, I said I'm stupid didn't I?

The moment I read about bla bla cancers of this and that caused by gastritis I totally lost it.

If I had these symptoms on and off, considering I didn't take my meds as I was supposed to, how bad did I fk up my stomach? Could this half a year have made any permanent damage? I'm terribly afraid of well...pain, doctors, disease and death, nice combo, in fact so nice that it keeps me scared, but not scared enough to face my fear of doctors and operations.

Yesterday it was hell, I took 2x20mg Acipan (same thing as Controloc basically) and I feel a lot better, but my mind is still in a terrible place. I guess this turned out into a rant, rather than a question, but still... any comments are welcome.

sidenote: I read that the usual period of taking controloc or similar pills for such symptoms is at least 4 weeks, considering I didn't take even 1/4 of the given time, is it possible it's simply the gastritis coming back every time?",4.0020589595861935,5.619981788426767,4.981096766054083,82.25649228310697,71.98372513562387,7.892829807813617,28.412002186803484,8.499448955792047,2.114763438327937,2231,86,424,38,43,729,260,553,0.153,0.767,0.08,-0.9936,0,0,1,0,0,0,99.0,0,0,5,7,27,35,4,7,22,0,31,29,14,3,6,82,74,52,1,9,21,0,8,1,0,1,10,3,0,0,26,27,5,6,8,2,0,11,9,22,2,5,34,12,60,13,58,37,15,89,1,5,0,0,19,27,1,16,52,281,86,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12306834353835025,0.0,0.0,0.04914224015377774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08357740042923575,0.1288731946289595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04296787852117583,0.0,0.0,0.16411291332095027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09450385489671397,0.051308911333076114,0.0,0.0,0.05229016601946747,0.0,0.0,0.1086966051012389,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06312697298753939,0.0,0.05293448501421096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049063521005975226,0.0,0.0,0.11889218624964568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18869271423034756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575916660944406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06349517765144222,0.0,0.0405877214130361,0.0,0.10355002006450427,0.0,0.05522808139756705,0.0,0.0,0.06914931538323754,0.062142814572076585,0.043900515250421386,0.17700742177188594,0.0,0.0,0.052270080349053664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034923946705558415,0.10308415186904052,0.04914787599935908,0.0,0.06769506356393958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19477866053221765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13156885891175382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05462035854947285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050090662435923534,0.06931926025151508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030021792066124982,0.06158991748858595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13416177182081582,0.05224333388845871,0.0,0.05814630092640019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06825806570811997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062047863066963076,0.0,0.04904949977181789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05896376904353999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04164070124264382,0.0,0.13077612087839074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06420308211077452,0.06745460412876242,0.0,0.06927662504073465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05880018540276005,0.0,0.0,0.06883904035649788,0.13072113306382738,0.12293500299981068,0.06994454566813976,0.039367002156298736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11690770280054845,0.04886819988867208,0.12304608616907292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06907335484245485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04730788349990736,0.0,0.0,0.2609714610151145,0.0,0.09814949155094074,0.15412704179291892,0.1407835325589572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05791671963879773,0.12774197029740822,0.3696272648365699,0.0,0.05371077070336643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08165045766137027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17916248825196612,0.0,0.0,0.058718941635538424,0.20482253965914984,0.0,0.06684090269697014,0.12005714560758525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13535890763512592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19716873150383726,0.22449182148159516,0.16575514170036154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03957234683568313
healthanxiety,Lightdragonman,2018/04/16,Hantavirus Spooked Me I'm 18 and my dad's place is hopefully on the tail end of a mouse problem. The problem is that his clean up procedure involves just vinyl gloves and bleachwipes. Now the mice live where I sleep and hang out so I can't avoid their leftovers.

healthanxiety,macncheese323,2018/04/16,Foot feels weird??? I got a leg cramp in my calf yesterday morning and it was super weird but my calf is sore now. Yesterday it fine and my foot felt fine but now my left foot feels like it could be getting the smallest of pins and needles. Like idk if they're really there but I feel like they come and go. I'm a healthy 20 year old and I exercise everyday. I google stuff but there is nothing about a foot feeling weird after a leg cramp. (My calf is still a little sore). I'm afraid I have a blood clot? How could I even though I'm normal weight and height and eat all the right things and exercise a lot?,0.9965838885523935,3.0695494094488183,2.064094488188978,97.66411265899455,82.46456692913384,5.797456087219867,19.218049666868566,7.010146845296331,0.04006892792247152,473,12,111,6,13,149,72,127,0.113,0.726,0.161,0.8848,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,1,1,9,10,0,1,9,0,8,15,7,1,1,25,20,15,0,4,5,0,6,3,0,0,6,0,0,0,5,9,2,0,5,2,0,2,0,4,0,0,3,6,12,6,4,14,2,16,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,2,12,61,17,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16428067391858173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3045344936676436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1951450045890904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1259628430268693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3857169274191484,0.2724880096132434,0.18311250551487968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09963864689080676,0.0,0.10838547875067653,0.0,0.15252904016491353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2072081025543614,0.0,0.0,0.27951534230714525,0.19114256328173254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621357059891179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18685632703469665,0.18299238601550316,0.0,0.2001191550257261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12217437541245188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16286618580355172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15230208258780614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2183185131423818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12669994056586625,0.0,0.1873726281286236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23223466839752044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12281165680483355
healthanxiety,herewegoagainqq,2018/04/16,"Helpful starter links for dealing with Health Anxiety **EDIT: I have found all the modules, a long with the parent link. I have now included all of them for you :)**

I, like many of you, have been dealing with debilitating health anxiety - specifically, concerning me focusing on my stomach, kidneys and waste (literally examining every urine and bowel movement).  I have been to the doctor 3 times already, have done 2x blood tests and a stool test, and everything came back okay, yet I am still unconvinced, a feeling I'm sure many of you can relate to.

&amp;nbsp;

So tonight (since it's a Sunday and I can't call my doctor yet again :p), I decided to look for some self help. Through a google search I came across these .pdfs that have already brought some comfort to me, in the short few minutes I've been working with them.  Apparently, there are 9 modules, but I have only been able to locate modules 1-3, 6, and 8-9 (missing 4, 5, and 7).  I am going to keep searching for the rest of them, in an attempt to maximize the effectiveness, but for now, I'd figure I'd share these with you, friends.  Hopefully they help to bring some comfort to you.

healthanxiety,bryterlu,2018/04/17,"Have been getting sick fairly often This year I've been getting sick a lot. Back in October, I believe I had a flu. 102 fever for 5 days straight, respiratory symptoms, etc. but I never got swabbed. Then, in December I had a cold. I caught another cold again in January, and then Influenza A in February. Now just a week ago I caught another respiratory virus. It wasn't another flu because I got tested and the swab was negative, but it also seemed much worse than a cold (I had fevers up to 102). A week fever free but I'm still very congested. In between all of this I've had random sore throats as well. I'm worried something more is happening, whether it's some sort of auto immune problem or something else possibly worse. I'm getting a metabolic panel tomorrow, so hopefully that'll answer some of my concerns. I'm hoping it's just a vitamin deficiency, but of course my mind goes straight to something serious like cancer or something like that. This is also fairly recent of a problem. I've always had a lower immune system but I've never been this constantly sick.

healthanxiety,sophi,2018/04/17,"TNF-Alpha levels increased - PANIC! Hey people,

Uh I'm sweating from panic.

I've been experiencing worrisome symptoms in the past 2 months, but I was trying to attribute them to weed withdrawal.

I just got an email with my TNF-Alpha levels being elevated - and I'm extremely concerned.

[**8,6** | ↑ 0,0-8,1 ng/l]
Am I correct by assuming that this can't be due to weed withdrawal, and is associated with cancer only?

Will go to the doctors tomorrow obviosuly, but I really want to know.

Anyway thanks in advance.",1.6178245614035092,4.3466807473684215,4.6421052631578945,73.06140350877193,94.15789473684212,7.164912280701755,25.280701754385962,8.021203637495839,2.67898596491228,401,18,64,11,15,143,73,95,0.138,0.759,0.103,-0.7445,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,0,1,1,2,3,0,2,3,0,8,4,1,1,1,12,15,4,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,2,1,0,3,1,6,1,11,9,1,11,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,1,4,36,8,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2778191701279646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1542594041996832,0.0,0.21708663494594055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14917032673707012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21665210621481348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2064340503506564,0.0,0.6369270976160109,0.0,0.0,0.2591097746558353,0.188174751562276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17388442231220586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2821187478538266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24989543399605185,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1842825317714985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16009590693066744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

healthanxiety,blackvelvetblazer,2018/04/17,"Can anyone find out what precisely is low blood pressure? Websites only say below 90, but not in what situation. Websites I've found usually say below 90. But they never say in what situation. Is this resting blood pressure ( laying supine for 20 minutes), or standing or moving upright? Because if it's resting my blood pressure doesn't seem to be below 90, but if it's moving about it does go below 90 (systolic). To be clear I'm a very unfit person, though I'm relatively slim. I do have ""symptoms of low blood pressure "", which is why I ask. I know low blood pressure isn't considered a problem if you have no symptoms.
If it matters, I'm female, 38, and 125 pounds.

healthanxiety,BeardBurn,2018/04/17,"Is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? My life has been a big mess since August. A dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. I suspected MS - did an MRI, an SSEP - they found nothing. Then, I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety, and still I kept thinking the opposite.

In January I woke up with my right side tingling/pins and needles, followed by a toothache. Of course, I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia - a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.

I had a cavity, did a root canal, the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations - eyelid, eyelashes, inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is, but it's really uncomfortable.

I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this, they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know, I can't find peace, I'm always startled, nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. 

I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this, or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. One thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned down/disappears when I'm distracted. But it hits me again when I'm alone at home working, for instance.

Oh well, long post already. Anyone with similar experiences? Thank you",5.574146419437341,8.026957316176471,5.854526854219952,74.15210997442458,69.58823529411765,10.171611253196932,35.723145780051155,10.374825546531014,4.465593797953965,1218,65,197,37,23,388,160,272,0.129,0.809,0.062,-0.9229,1,1,1,0,0,0,43.0,0,1,2,1,10,9,0,3,17,1,27,10,3,6,2,37,47,17,0,3,9,0,0,1,0,0,7,3,1,0,16,10,0,1,8,0,1,3,6,5,1,2,14,6,24,4,18,28,3,22,0,0,3,0,8,9,0,3,10,129,40,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13138323777665228,0.13998734354400574,0.0,0.10555329336835484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3881740698106956,0.0,0.12580580037601835,0.08869977327978275,0.0,0.10439062999961707,0.11292760006508056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14292183487821544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1303147463767426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13078165136245248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1298411863917537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12408826261996025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11594292053584372,0.0,0.0,0.2781793167643995,0.0,0.0,0.06627635810708038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13484064074221705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12724563233518188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20914811806253905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08960124384834021,0.061974810983644414,0.0,0.0,0.11226243979087976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08467651401925946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13482649703838345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3651615899518476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08596004472534986,0.0,0.13498237138477753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12149176072070304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16253277034599387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10833324207704008,0.2413357859396848,0.10087996894191786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1433097315535498,0.0,0.1049355394484874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0976589649107332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20261269459240125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13185063114192105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11679078736353744,0.0,0.0,0.08427664259924758,0.08128338564783119,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12391863366913168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11405763246711947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09235175067466499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

But yesterday night i licked my wifes vagina for maybe 5 minutes without a barrier. We have never gotten tested for stds although my wife has had gyno examinations and pap smears and nothing has come up. Also i havent noticed any warts or anythimg on her. 
I knowbit sounds silly, but what is the chance that i could get chlamydia / gonorrhea? Is it possible that  she carried those diseases for 3 years since we met and i havent noticed?? Is it even reasonable to think that tou could catch those from the activity described?? Note that i do suffer heavily from health anxiety.

healthanxiety,EIVOH,2018/04/18,"Very scared about having an appointment scheduled at a cancer center. So April 18th I went to a free clinic because I can’t afford healthcare, I had acid reflux. But the doctor ordered my feces to be examined for ulcers, that checked out fine, they also drew blood to see if I was ok. They scheduled a return appointment to see how my acid reflux was doing. The next day in a voicemail they left a message saying it was very important of me to keep my appointment bc my thyroid levels were low. I kept it. Returned for the appointment which was about 2-3 weekend later. We talked about my acid reflux for like a minute and then everything shifted to my thyroid. She said I have Hyperthyroidism and she wanted my neck to be scanned to see what kinda of treatment I needed which could be a pill taken for 1-3 years, surgery or radiation. The radiation part alarmed me so I asked immediately if it was cancer, smiling she said no. I went home looked up the symptoms of hyperthyroidism but only 1 or 2 seem to match. A week later I called back bc I never got a call to schedule my appointment they said I would be called Monday, again no call, Wednesday I get a call and I was scheduled for the appointment which is a 2 day process for some reason. Monday at 9:00, later at 2:00 then Tuesday at 9:00 again. It’s also in a cancer center which worries me so much and I can’t stop thinking about it. Should i relax? Does anyone see anything positive in this?

healthanxiety,Sir_Dibs,2018/04/18,"Please give me some advice This all started about two months ago, I went about 4 days without eating to help me lose weight. That Thursday I decided to start eating again, so me and the family went to eat Mexican. I ate a small plate of fajitas (not spicy). On the way home I felt my heart rate go WAY up and started pounding really hard. Then I started to feel like my chest was tight and I couldn’t breathe properly and my hands and face began to get pins and needles. The pins and needles spread all over my body and I got this enormous pressure in my lower diaphragm. All of my joints locked up and I couldn’t move. I could speak but it was slurred. They took me to the ER and after taking several tests including a EKG a CT scan of my brain and a battery of blood tests, they concluded it was a low potassium level in my body, which triggered a panic attack. Ok. So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level, and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again, I pulled over, got something to drink, and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didn’t go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldn’t breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins, they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasn’t gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing, a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing. I was desperate to feel better, it had been two weeks of constant suffering. I went back to my primary doctor and he ordered more tests and a copy of the results from the ER. He found what appeared to be a “hiatus hernia” in my stomach and gave me a acid reducer. It has gotten better but still hasn’t gone away. It has been almost two months since that Tuesday and I haven’t gotten even one minute of relief. My heart pounds constantly, my stomach bloats, I’m always cold, I have pain in my chest, I can’t take a deep breath, and I’m always tired. I feel like if someone can’t help me I’m going to die. I don’t know if this was the right sub to post this on but nobody else will really listen to me. I have had worry’s like I’m having a heart attack. A few days ago I was helping my dad move a water tank. I got a scratch on my arm somehow. Afterwards something flew by my arm. Probably a large insect like a dragonfly, but my mind immediately thought it was a rabid bat and it had just flew by and scratched me. A few days later I lay down to go to bed and I start feeling cold, my heart starts pounding, and I get scared and start googling. I had read a story about rabies on Reddit a while back that scared the shit out of me. I began reading the symptoms and convinced myself that I have only days to live. I don’t believe rationally that I have rabies. My state has not had a human case in the last 30 years. But I’m so damn scared and there is nothing I can do about it. Any advice to make me feel better? I feel like I have fever but I have no temperature, and I feel a pressure in my face. I haven’t slept in 2 days",2.7424882445141066,4.138659630747128,3.9765945663531888,89.09149843260192,74.81896551724137,6.900898641588296,24.148798328108672,7.486611883883027,0.9620756321839088,2637,80,566,32,55,863,276,696,0.114,0.7929999999999999,0.094,-0.9437,1,0,3,0,0,0,64.0,0,0,4,7,23,30,4,7,45,1,47,46,27,7,4,90,118,49,1,6,13,1,18,6,0,2,12,3,2,1,28,38,7,1,19,3,1,24,16,15,4,5,50,25,83,15,72,60,13,114,0,3,1,0,16,34,2,7,56,361,111,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09826850834460124,0.08914258612617693,0.0,0.050349407334620164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08367605351927017,0.0,0.0,0.03419297324716929,0.0,0.038465017532568216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1144043581771852,0.1417226645756613,0.15465270590576355,0.0,0.030650982436466426,0.0,0.0,0.0566497487795451,0.0,0.13340903490166514,0.0,0.1117022641371767,0.0,0.05613050241484326,0.0,0.0575083532901312,0.05126508398979529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10867233393335904,0.0,0.04014548556316181,0.0,0.0,0.2594179653257589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05218399763347426,0.0,0.0,0.20585995405386665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04925648133035243,0.0,0.15435081005315054,0.042003531233903366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0996308714062879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04740068623816337,0.0,0.22881339054919705,0.10776280208180664,0.09655576756575524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11026158755796052,0.0,0.0,0.10507950838970227,0.048234355308301516,0.11430396918361235,0.0,0.16085803105342122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09008424495549268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29791760826929725,0.10110738310588968,0.0,0.05043619200120656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0276332592475073,0.04098592853590104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03551513286033886,0.14738926949300102,0.0,0.08879852737039469,0.0,0.0,0.05625185570798322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04757733314956699,0.033563123862817366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05065306808172774,0.0,0.05334045885620185,0.05076972748605725,0.0,0.08026802579986111,0.10688201970760862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1069493565715737,0.0,0.0,0.14473864229589806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06814375064410501,0.07648231059931115,0.05350279357335929,0.058994211500281474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0551937117576668,0.0,0.0,0.04815553711213569,0.0,0.10842338049877497,0.0,0.0,0.05054654258997771,0.0,0.0,0.10058971078604624,0.0,0.06442291072172257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04293991154932612,0.0478289816830538,0.0,0.1510209043691287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056803498899174035,0.051612979099297684,0.04159316841172842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0426031387471423,0.0774179233421905,0.0,0.0,0.2491252857532897,0.0,0.12046401018416812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052261469613645334,0.07561048269670836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033404627328630726,0.0,0.0,0.03991769489704923,0.0,0.05779089856427218,0.0,0.0,0.11172863450349237,0.0,0.0,0.14735242111415384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1197327441534816,0.08066516937431217,0.061229014914765324,0.0,0.3262785482145568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04846932933389874,0.0,0.0,0.051063048635838985,0.051240887943199184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032379475545566215
healthanxiety,HeathenArmy,2018/04/18,"Pain in left thigh/leg and muscle spasms, freaked out about DVT again I've been afraid of DVT since early March because I have had various weird spasms and pain in my left leg. It happened twice that I woke up with immense pain and cramping in that leg. This happened to me when I was a kid sometimes, but I don't remember if it was just in one leg then. 



I've had two doctors tell me that my pain and symptoms don't match those of DVT and that I need to stop Googling, so I'm laying off the Google now...


The pain was mostly gone the last two weeks but right now I have a lot of cramp and a burning sensation in that same leg again and it seriously makes me anxious.



I also have another issue. I got meds for my anxiety: gabapentin and lexapro, but I am afraid to take them because of the possible side effects. I have been taking gabapentin but it only helps for a few hours. Lexapro seems more dangerous and I don't know if I'll just worry myself by thinking about the symptoms. 


Anyway, thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

healthanxiety,ButtDumplin,2018/04/18,"Your honest opinions, please! Ok, so I have struggled with hypochondria for going on three years now. 

Last night, my girlfriend was puppy sitting for a coworker, and I stopped by to bring dinner and hang out with the cute puppy, for a while.

As puppies do, he was a little bit of a biter, and at one point he got in a little deep just above my elbow on my bicep. I pulled my arm away but it dragged a little bit and drew a little blood, so i assumed it punctured the skin. 

He's only a few months old, and apparently he went to the veterinarian four days ago. I haven't confirmed that he got a rabies vaccination there. I think he would have, but I don't remember what all my dog got when i took him home two years ago. This puppy who bit me came from a shelter. 

So, please tell me honestly: should I be worried about rabies? Should I go to the doctor just in case? I could use a level head's perspective on this.",4.303630630630629,4.782369772972974,5.1565540540540535,85.55140765765765,70.18918918918922,7.68018018018018,26.22747747747748,7.492282038375204,1.1856396396396396,708,20,150,7,12,231,114,185,0.043,0.8690000000000001,0.08800000000000001,0.8231,1,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,0,1,0,0,9,5,0,1,15,1,12,8,6,1,1,24,23,13,0,4,4,0,1,0,1,3,1,0,1,0,7,9,1,1,3,0,0,8,2,1,0,4,8,1,20,4,21,10,5,37,0,0,0,0,11,15,0,2,13,97,27,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22055174390110235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11688083919183168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074480055438359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1422840435554132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09932577946728226,0.0,0.0,0.08022972960825744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12733187873222487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14140233548183212,0.0,0.2984896513360605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1276735054592276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1247864862912072,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1014051578131684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4987384872874802,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09929739442717066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674391365801905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13054016193618495,0.0,0.08429878295905673,0.0946141889825116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27311456643848786,0.11760117197267801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409244995163362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10400659015893343,0.0,0.13005316613708498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10873382212521254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07971250488290088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13821645890189144,0.0,0.0,0.12152378512172154,0.0,0.0,0.10744436501352043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11532295126176954,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12633742092247835,0.0,0.08837241686503564,0.0,0.0,0.160223078744193
healthanxiety,gloriagoodwin,2018/04/19,"Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering cold-like viral symptoms for the last 10 days, and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat, but has now progressed to a hacking, productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today, although admittedly it feels muscular.

Roughly 4 days into my symptoms (6 days ago now) I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However, I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.

Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning. 

I mean, as a health anxiety sufferer whose condition arises from a fear of death, this is the worst illness I ever could've learned about.

healthanxiety,DarlingLuna,2018/04/19,"My mind is tricking me into feeling like I need to urinate A couple of years ago, I went on a vacation with my family. I had bladder issues at the time, so I spent 1/2 the trip worrying that I would constantly feel like I need to go to the toilet and that it would ruin the trip for me. Ever since then, every time I go to see a movie I'm anticipating (I love and am very passionate about movies) I will fear that my mind will trick me into feeling like I need to go to the toilet, and this fear will cause my mind to trick me into feeling like I need to go, and it will ruin the experience for me.

I'm currently scared this will happen to me with the new Avengers, and I'm already constantly thinking about and feeling like I need to go to the toilet. I've seen several doctors, and we've all concluded that it is a mental thing, but I don't know how to solve it. I'm constantly thinkin about the toilet and feeling like I need to go. Does anyone have any advice on how I can fix this?

Has anyone else taken psylocibin regularly for a long time?",5.681527093596059,7.9062250344827625,6.0755336617405575,73.64068965517242,68.77011494252875,8.189819376026273,28.52052545155993,8.841846274778883,2.5919077175697867,386,14,60,7,7,124,67,87,0.06,0.8240000000000001,0.116,0.6208,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,5,0,7,1,0,4,0,10,12,2,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,5,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,6,11,3,11,0,0,0,0,7,2,0,2,10,31,7,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15178475107585918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1642360841027364,0.0,0.30923732021547473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2119755107798977,0.15531088285550534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09240132080265104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13264804742548544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12662503632413805,0.0,0.0,0.15662191360101255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14827361941325015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30480118414634705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08330400690563007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07405397853897319,0.15192225760111244,0.0,0.4024286726360764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15270017537479708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1485155088577589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11528287114554345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.132353178637754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15584874301034696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34248287704155617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284326301362226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11396875258702603,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10070253677786033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17677419163755662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102912379660726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2618316559149056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12158775348238525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15393611437876886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I know that a famous person dying so young can affects someone with HA but remember in this case the death is related to alcoholism, not to a weird disease, not to cancer, no to a heart problem, not to anxiety.

healthanxiety,allaboutthebenjis093,2018/04/20,Nodule in neck So I've had this bump under my skin near my jaw for about 6 months now. I went to the doc a few months ago and was told to come back if it doesn't go away. It didn't disappear so I returned and was scheduled for an ultrasound on my neck. The doc then sent me to get a CT scan of it. I'm worried that I've got cancer or something. I realize the odds are slim but it's still getting to me. I hope I'm over reacting. ,-0.6217346938775492,1.0395825408163295,1.9585306122448998,98.47575510204081,85.83673469387755,5.5526530612244915,18.983673469387764,6.742157984588678,-0.12511346938775514,331,9,86,4,10,114,69,98,0.048,0.894,0.058,0.2223,0,0,1,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,0,6,0,6,5,4,1,0,9,17,8,0,2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,1,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,8,2,9,1,14,9,1,20,0,0,1,0,2,6,0,3,9,53,15,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2494746380693039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2644169076957635,0.2164057018587505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2424308382880612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29407574385284024,0.0,0.15994567008412602,0.0,0.22508882017844467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27952788709239124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4492765479478851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21666197095215914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22475389632914733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2689226548679877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26089253268398344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28581032098642195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
healthanxiety,tscared,2018/04/20,"It's officially affecting my every day life The anxiety meds aren't responding. I got finished with an eye doctor appointment who told me my eyes were fine (the initial cause of this), got one night of rest (after 3 weeks of anxious manic hell) and it started up the next day. It moved from my eyes to other health concerns. It just never stops. I've talked to my therapist but I don't know when I'll see my psychiatrist next. I'm losing sleep. I'm barely hanging in there. I'm being a good girl and staying away from google but still continuously performing body checks every few hours and obsessing over random sensations and tingles on my body. 

Sleeping is the worst. I can't at all. I toss and turn. Wake up from panic attacks. Have vivid nightmares. It's just all gone to hell after years of building up and I don't know what to do. I've attempted grounding, meditation, nature sounds, reassuring myself, etc etc. It builds back up.

I'm not sure where to go next or what to do. Maybe more doctor appointments, if it even helps anymore. Sometimes I think they're lying to me. Sometimes my brain tells me they either missed something or just aren't trained enough. I'm just crying right now because I feel so defeated. My brain has collapsed into itself and I can't escape it anymore.",2.9967338709677414,5.5184108185483876,3.885251612903225,84.87587741935484,77.91129032258064,6.548645161290323,24.839354838709678,7.699297019823105,1.4618094838709679,1025,37,190,16,25,328,155,248,0.2,0.75,0.05,-0.9919,0,0,1,0,0,0,32.0,0,0,1,4,12,13,3,2,6,0,13,15,10,2,4,32,31,14,0,1,11,0,1,0,0,0,5,1,0,1,14,9,0,1,4,0,1,4,8,9,0,1,5,7,21,4,27,25,10,38,2,3,5,0,9,13,2,4,20,118,35,2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08419144627887161,0.12433034047033867,0.21828912557901414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12520296354197674,0.1033998930848242,0.08462517253581685,0.0,0.0670882455469949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2444916387304589,0.0,0.24571459896848385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11305636127908095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1208897794790376,0.1419521885893155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22529103552367336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11371579222494715,0.24547987858476955,0.07269000679745348,0.0,0.18545144689861048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05564689832780687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06254654942530427,0.09230855341467377,0.17604138966649974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11698286355699475,0.0,0.0,0.07376725970075187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1083815845264669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12096622909254184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07773479884070045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12312291509852068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1105646098238959,0.0,0.12224581936522945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11697059299103893,0.0,0.0,0.08488087050647447,0.0,0.3511328573059281,0.1032787604367811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07457582616121758,0.0,0.0,0.12912532755470488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0939860030835455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0876992449991565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2202681040121564,0.0,0.0,0.08472538623656055,0.2176935714150716,0.0,0.07789719244597777,0.117303530429785,0.08788972329095822,0.09201055003464093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10372513158322416,0.0,0.0,0.08845769610851555,0.09619254670133306,0.0,0.0,0.1277818404434022,0.0,0.07051852587136022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516185974548604,0.0,0.0,0.11970777127267272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08827913919710674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07087153602944325
healthanxiety,MinimumCut,2018/04/20,"Constant abdominal pain. Hey all, 

Spent all day in the ER for abdominal pain that I've been having for weeks now. They ended up telling me that it's nothing requiring immediate surgery so I'm good to go.

Get home and have a yellowish bm mixed with blood and I get abdomen/back pain when eating. Feels like I have to vomit.

So, I guess I'm dying.

The best part is that I changed my diet and started exercising. I was trying to get away from feeling physically and mentally miserable 24/7. I lost 15 lbs and was feeling good.
